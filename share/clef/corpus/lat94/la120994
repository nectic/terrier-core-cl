POP MUSIC REVIEW; SEAL DELIVERS MISSIONARY ZEAL BUT WHERE'S THE MESSAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was it that Seal was trying to tell us near the end of his long-awaited 
Los Angeles concert debut on Wednesday at the Wiltern Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
 Was the English singer-songwriter, best known for the 1991 hit "Crazy," urging 
us in the first encore song to "understand" or "step into the sand"? 
</P>
<P>
 Was he recounting in the next number his search for "paradise" or a "pair of 
dice"? 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, Seal would have you believe in the liner notes to his latest album. 
The important thing about his music isn't the lyrics, he says, but the vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 He's wrong. What he's saying does matter. 
</P>
<P>
 From the revival-tent fervor of the audience Wednesday, however, Seal's fans 
seem perfectly content to settle for that vibe -- which, in his case, is 
accessible and seductive enough to guarantee a wide and loyal audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age in which the most absorbing rock is obsessed with dark and angry 
themes, Seal steps forward with a spiritually tinged message that is 
relentlessly positive -- all the way down to his husky, comforting vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure we didn't miss the point, he even explained that "Prayer for the 
Dying," one of the most popular songs from his latest album, is really a song 
about life and the living. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Seal is mindlessly cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence in his music and manner -- which moves from somber to 
celebratory -- of life's suffering and disillusionment. Like a man of the 
cloth, however, he constantly points to a better day. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the uplifting approach all the more appealing to his audience is 
that it is supported by rich musical strains in the "adult-alternative," 
pop-rock-funk style loosely associated with Peter Gabriel and Sting. His 
music's special trademark is its strong dance factor, and that was delivered 
with considerable punch at times by his four-piece band. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, Seal adds a commanding presence. A charismatic performer with a regal 
stance, he comes across as someone utterly confident of the salvation ahead, 
and he reaches out to the audience with an almost missionary zeal. He also 
knows how to use his sexuality -- punctuating the the beat with subtle hip 
twists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, Seal's set seemed one-dimensional. For a man who cites 
the brilliant wordsmiths Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan as his own inspirations, 
he should know better than to downplay the importance of lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 To maximize his potential as an artist, Seal needs to reach inside for the 
insights and revelations that give the music depth rather than simply coloring. 
Until then, he is in the awkward position of being known as a substantial 
artist without a lot of measurable substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act on the tour is Des'ree, another English singer-songwriter, 
whose even more superficial brand of pop-soul positivism showcases many of the 
weaknesses of Seal without much evidence of the strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seal and Des'ree play tonight at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., 8 
p.m. Sold out. (213) 380-5005.

 Stern Times: Radio personality Howard Stern continued Thursday to bask in -- 
and encourage -- the adulation he was getting for having helped prevent a man 
from jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge the day before. His 
syndicated morning show was filled with discussions of and reactions to how he 
and sidekick Robin Quivers kept the man on the phone until police could arrive. 
But while Stern played his heroism largely for laughs, the congratulatory calls 
were genuine -- including one from New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.

 Script Detour: Juan Vasquez, a Los Angeles man who darted in front a car 
driven by actor James Garner during the filming Wednesday of a "Rockford Files" 
movie for CBS, on Thursday was listed in "good condition" at the California 
Medical Center. Vasquez suffered a laceration to the head and a fractured foot, 
and was scheduled to remain hospitalized until this morning, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. Garner stopped the familiar "Rockford Files" Pontiac Firebird 
and offered assistance to Vasquez after hitting him during a routine driving 
sequence in the Rampart area near downtown Los Angeles at an intersection 
controlled by off-duty police officers, according to executive producer Chas. 
Floyd Johnson. There was no indication of why Vasquez ran past police 
motorcycle officers escorting Garner's car. THE ARTS

 Cartoon Museum: "Garfield" creator Jim Davis and a range of characters 
including Fred Flintstone, Snoopy and Spider-Man were in Boca Raton, Fla., on 
Thursday to celebrate the start of construction on the International Museum of 
Cartoon Art -- a 52,000-square-foot facility that will host the world's largest 
collection of animation art. Phase I of the museum, which will house 130,000 
drawings, 10,000 books and 1,000 hours of film and videotape, will open in 
January, 1996. The City of Boca Raton donated the 1.5-acre site valued at $2 
million for the attraction, projected to draw 1 million visitors annually when 
it is completed in 1997. Founded by "Beetle Bailey" creator Mort Walker, the 
museum will have more than 30 galleries.

 Jerry Lewis' Broadway Turn: Jerry Lewis is scheduled to join the Broadway 
musical revival of "Damn Yankees" on Feb. 28. He'll play the devilish Mr. 
Applegate, who promises a baseball pennant for the hapless Washington Senators 
in exchange for the soul of the team's biggest fan. The timing of Lewis' start 
is unusual; the show will close at the Marquis Theater on Dec. 31, then go on a 
two-month hiatus to allow Lewis to rehearse and to avoid the usual seasonal 
slump in ticket sales. MOVIES

 'Disclosure' Backlash: "Michael Douglas in particular should now do all of us 
a favor and stop subjecting our culture to his acting out of his serious fear 
and distrust of women. It's perhaps time that he simply get some therapy." So 
says Tammy Bruce, president of L.A.'s National Organization for Women, in a 
statement about the Warner Bros. movie "Disclosure." Bruce's statement, which 
also attacks Douglas' co-star, Demi Moore, calls the film "the clearest example 
of how far some in the entertainment industry are willing to go to cast a 
shadow on the crime of sexual harassment." Following release of the statement, 
"Disclosure" director Barry Levinson told the Hollywood Reporter that he found 
Bruce's charges "so unfair and irresponsible it doesn't merit a response."

 Chinese Viewership: More than 900,000 people in Beijing and four other Chinese 
cities saw "The Fugitive," one of the first hit foreign movies shown in the 
communist country. Published reports put ticket sales for the movie, which 
showed Nov. 12-20, at 8 million yuan -- or about $940,000. China has kept 
foreign films out to protect its domestic filmmakers, but earlier this year the 
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television announced it would allow 10 "excellent" 
foreign films to be shown in China each year. LEGAL FILE

 Picasso Suit: Pablo Picasso's heirs have sued two Hearst Corp. companies for 
selling publications, films, video and computer games that claim to use 
authorized reproductions of the late master's work. The Manhattan suit alleges 
that King Features and North American Syndicate had no right to reproduce the 
work, and that the products offered are of such inferior quality that they do 
not accurately depict the art of Picasso, who died in 1973.

 Schell Settles, Shakur Sought: TV and film executive Diane Botsford has 
settled her sexual harassment lawsuit against Austrian actor-director 
Maximilian Schell. In a statement jointly released Thursday, Shell apologized 
for commenting about Botsford's "beautiful breasts" in front of their 
colleagues, saying that the comments were intended as "compliments" and that he 
"was unaware that in America, such remarks may be construed as offensive." No 
details of the settlement were released. . . . A Los Angeles judge issued an 
arrest warrant for Tupac Shakur on Wednesday after the rapper failed to appear 
in court on felony weapons charges. Shakur, who was arrested in April during a 
routine traffic stop, was free on $20,000 bail. The rapper was convicted in New 
York last week of sexually abusing a woman he'd met at a nightclub. QUICK TAKES

SCREENING ROOM: 'DRAGON GATE': SEARCH FOR SELF

<TEXT>
<P>
 No Oscar season would be complete without films opening in self-deluded 
Oscar-qualifying runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a film is "The Dragon Gate," which opens today at the Sunset 5.Dan 
Coplan, who wrote, produced and starred in this supernatural quest for 
self-knowledge, is an attorney and martial artist, playing the same in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Coplan unfortunately is not an actor, and as a result his film, directed by 
Michael Oliver, comes across as a foolish vanity production. 
</P>
<P>
 Also opening today at the Sunset 5 is Russ Meyer's deliriously erotic and 
sadistic 1965 "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!," in which three dangerous 
dominatrix types zero in on a rich but crippled Dirty Old Man and his two dim 
sons at a desert ranch.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; BUYERS; HOLIDAY BUYERS' GUIDE: TAILOR CD PLAYER TO SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things to remember when you're buying a CD player this holiday season: 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, spending more money doesn't mean you get perceptibly 
better sound or a more reliable machine. More money does mean higher-quality 
parts, such as a more substantial motor and internal features that enhance 
sound -- though the fine-tuning is well beyond the perception of most people. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sound test, most folks couldn't tell the difference between a $150 
machine and one that costs $300 -- even though the more expensive machine 
delivers more detailed sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending at the higher end of the $150-$300 range, however, does buy fancier 
remotes and features that make taping easier. And moving up into the $300-$500 
range gets you a machine that plays scratched and dirty CDs better and that is 
more resistant to bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Decide whether you want a single-disc machine or a multiple-disc player, which 
allow you to play hours of uninterrupted music. Multiple-disc players dominate 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, $100 buys an adequate single-CD player. Even the inexpensive units 
feature the basics -- such as instant access to tracks, easy programmability 
and remote control. For $200, you get a very good single-CD player. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple-disc players in the $150-$300 range are just fine. There are two 
kinds, magazine (box-like) and carousel (circular disc), which stack CDs 
differently. Carousel changers are the biggest sellers, probably because 
they're easier to load. Also, according to audio experts, they are less likely 
to break down with frequent use than the magazine style. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to know something about the stereo system of the person for 
whom you're buying so you can fit the CD player to the system. For a low-end 
stereo system -- in the $400-$500 range -- a $200-$300 CD machine is too 
elaborate. Nor should you add a $100 CD player to a $1,000 stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
 As for specific brands, you get varying opinions according to the price range. 
A sampling of audio experts and servicemen turned up recommendations for the 
Pioneer PD-203 single-play model, which sells for about $135, the Pioneer 
PD-M703 magazine changer (about $220), the Yamaha CDC-645 carousel changer 
(about $265) and any Sony carousel changer. 
</P>
<P>
 VCR Buying Hints: Salesmen say it's surprising how many VCR buyers don't 
realize a basic fact about stereo VCRs: The stereo sound is not inherent in the 
machines. In other words, you don't get stereo sound by hooking up a stereo VCR 
to just any source. It has to be connected to a stereo TV or a stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully check out the remote control when buying a low-end ($150-$200) 
machine. It may not have enough controls to suit your needs. You may have to 
buy a more expensive machine to get a remote with more features. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that whoever is getting the VCR as a present may want a VCR Plus -- a 
system that simplifies taping -- now a feature on some machines in the 
$225-$300 range. For those still intimidated by on-screen programming, this is 
a good alternative. Remember, though, because of the parameters of the VCR Plus 
systems in some machines, what can be recorded may be limited on TVs with a 
cable box. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Newt's Pick: Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently said that people 
should rent the 1938 drama "Boys Town" -- starring Spencer Tracy and Mickey 
Rooney -- to get a sense of orphanage care. That's what many are doing. 
Suddenly this vintage tear-jerker (MGM/UA, $20) is the hottest classic around. 
</P>
<P>
 A spot check of stores around the country indicated that the movie is renting 
briskly. A clerk in a Los Angeles Blockbuster outlet, which had no copies 
available, said this was the first time it had been rented in six months. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Special Interest: If you want to know how Joan Collins, who's in her 50s, 
stays trim and pretty, she explains it on "Joan Collins: Secrets of Fitness and 
Beauty," which comes out Jan. 3, when the post-holiday fitness craze gets under 
way. Though it's being promoted as a video for women of all ages and fitness 
levels, its strongest appeal will be to middle-aged women trying to look as 
glamorous as Collins. From Forum Home Video, at $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death Valley Memories" is an absorbing documentary that uses interviews, 
stills and grainy old films to chronicle the rugged life in Death Valley in the 
first half of the century. The most intriguing part is the anecdotes about the 
bizarre effects of the extreme heat. From Flashpoint Films, $35, (310) 
578-1112. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: "Maverick" (Warner): A film version of the '50s 
comedy/Western TV series that starred James Garner. In this one, Mel Gibson 
plays the lead role as the charming, rascally gambler, who's traveling with an 
equally conniving card shark (Jodie Foster) and a marshal played by -- in a 
clever casting move -- Garner. Directed by Richard Donner, this movie is about 
their adventures on the way to the climatic high-stakes poker game. Basically 
lighthearted fun, though it does drag in spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call Northside 777" (FoxVideo, 1948): A gripping nail-biter of a 
mystery/drama about a reporter (James Stewart) searching for cop killers 11 
years after the murder. He's convinced that the two prisoners convicted of the 
crime are innocent. Richard Conte co-stars as one of the convicts.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; LASER VERSION OF 'MY FAIR LADY' A BLOOMIN' TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are an Audrey Hepburn fan and own a laser player, you'll find a bonanza 
awaiting you at the video store: a sumptuous "My Fair Lady" in a "30th 
Anniversary Restoration Widescreen Collector's Edition," from Fox Video/CBS 
Video/Image Entertainment ($130), and a collector's "Breakfast at Tiffany's" 
edition from Paramount Home Video ($80; the disc is also available singly for 
$40). 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter how many times you have seen "My Fair Lady" on television or 
on videotape, nothing quite prepares you for seeing the restored "My Fair 
Lady." If you didn't see this glorious Lerner and Loewe musical when it was 
first released in theaters in 1964 or catch it on the big screen when 
re-released in its restored form this year, this is your chance to see what all 
the fuss was about. 
</P>
<P>
 This edition, like its VHS counterpart, comes with more special, even gimmicky 
"collector's" items than one would think possible: limited-edition 
reproductions of Cecil Beaton's Oscar-winning costumes; a clip of six frames 
from the original Super Panavision 70 print; a special printing of Beaton's 
"Fair Lady" diary; a 24-karat gold CD of the classic score. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more value is a promotional documentary, "More Loverly Than Ever: The 
Making of My Fair Lady. Then and Now." A full-color brochure features 
well-annotated notes and complete chapter stops. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Hepburn fans, the real bonus is watching her sing two numbers that she 
recorded herself. Her vocals weren't used in the film because singer Marni 
Nixon was called in to record the complete soundtrack. Nixon did a superb job 
of capturing in music what Hepburn was doing on screen. Hepburn, however, 
insisted on doing "Wouldn't It Be Loverly?" and "Show Me" herself because she 
felt her voice could handle the songs and it would give more credibility and 
realism to her character. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was finally decided to use Nixon's versions of even these two songs, 
Hepburn, furious, walked off the set, only to return later with an apology. Not 
singing the role in the film, however, was one of the great disappointments of 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser technology now enables you to zip back and forth between Hepburn's voice 
and Nixon's voice as the restored scenes unfold. The footage of Hepburn singing 
the staged numbers of both tunes can be seen on both the "Making of . . ." 
documentary and in CAV on a supplemental sixth side. Although Hepburn does a 
respectable job on both numbers, one can see how the purity of Nixon's voice 
tipped the studio's decision. What is amazing is how much Nixon succeeded in 
sounding like Hepburn's natural voice while enhancing its upper registers. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the bonuses are finally tucked away, it is the wonderful, restored 
film itself that overwhelms in an incredibly sharp transfer with THX sound and 
razor-sharp THX picture that is only suggested on the new VHS videotape 
collector's edition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepburn, who was maligned at the time for replacing Julie Andrews, gives one 
of her finest performances -- she is the perfect Eliza (with a big assist from 
Nixon). 
</P>
<P>
 No one could play Prof. Henry Higgins but Rex Harrison, for whom the role was 
first envisaged by Lerner and Loewe. As the documentary reveals, when Cary 
Grant was asked about taking over the role, he told studio head Jack Warner, 
"Unless you cast Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway (as Alfred Doolittle), I'll 
never make a film for Warner Bros. again." Harrison won an Oscar for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is an Academy Award for saving films, restorers Robert A. Harris and 
James C. Katz certainly are deserving of one for preserving for all time this 
masterpiece of a musical. A special collector's section in the laser edition 
shows just what was almost lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepburn's 1961 "Breakfast at Tiffany's" has been digitally remastered in its 
original widescreen format. The collector's edition includes a copy of 
Hepburn's hand-notated script; a CD of Henry Mancini's score featuring the 
Oscar-winning "Moon River"; three 8-by-10 glossies; a brochure reproducing 
notes from Hepburn to Mancini and a remembrance by Mancini; and the theatrical 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not included, however, is what could readily set it apart from its VHS 
counterpart: an analog soundtrack from director Blake Edwards and others 
offering real information and details about the making of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such a grand-looking package that it's a shame the producers missed 
another golden opportunity to use laser technology to enhance the motion 
picture experience.

 The small ton of holiday music in the record stores this time of year seems to 
grow with each passing year. Consider these selections for holiday gifts to 
yourself or others: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Santa's Bag" on Telarc, which leads off with a smoking version of "Let It 
Snow," played by bassist Ray Brown's trio, with pianist Benny Green.Also 
included are Mel Torme singing "Good King Wenceslas," Jimmy McGriff and Hank 
Crawford doing a bluesy "Silver Bells" and a perky "Santa Claus Is Coming to 
Town," with the duo of Dave Brubeck and Gerry Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Concord Jazz Christmas" is enlivened by Ken Peplowski's singing clarinet 
tone on "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," Peplowski and guitarist Alden 
making the most out of "Winter Wonderland" and pianist Harris with a typically 
bluesy "I'll Be Home for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 * Other new releases worth noting: the "MoJazz Christmas Album," with fine 
tracks by pianist Eric Reed ("Oh Christmas Tree"); "The Joys of Christmas Past" 
(GRP), which gathers such time-tested numbers as Louis Armstrong's "What a 
Wonderful World," Torme's own take on his classic "The Christmas Song" and 
Ahmad Jamal's "Snowfall"; pianist Butch Thompson's "Yulestride" (Daring), which 
includes solo piano versions of traditional holiday songs played with jazz 
flavor; and "The Gift," New Age pianist Liz Story's laid-back interpretations 
of festive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Favorites from past years include "Christmas Songs" (Milestone), featuring 
Chet Baker, Red Garland, Anita O'Day and Coleman Hawkins; "The Christmas Album" 
(Columbia) by the Manhattan Transfer, with arrangements by Johnny Mandel; and 
the perennial wonder, Nat "King" Cole's "The Christmas Song" (Capitol). ZAN

THEATER BEAT: DARING 'MAIDS' FROM NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean Genet's "The Maids" has always been an unsettling play, but the daring 
version by Fabulous Monsters, the new company at Glaxa Studios in Silverlake, 
puts a particularly ominous spin on the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The title characters -- chambermaids locked in a love-hate relationship with 
their rich employer -- are here played by men (director Robert A. Prior and 
Kevin Hincker).Sporting shaved heads and heavily powdered faces, the pair 
resemble the vampire from the German horror film "Nosferatu." 
</P>
<P>
 Madame, whom the treacherous maids want to emulate and to poison, is also 
played by a man in drag, Mark Brey, who with his deliciously regal bearing and 
strapping physique takes the disturbing androgyny one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior's sure visual sense highlights the themes of power struggle and class 
consciousness that course through Genet's text. The use of props becomes highly 
animated with the addition of four mute "men in black." 
</P>
<P>
 When the maids cry, "The objects are against us!," Prior has the pair silently 
encircled by the men, who are carrying a phone and other symbols of the 
materialism that these characters find both oppressive and seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Genet's play, which sparks more of an intellectual than an emotional response, 
can be similarly oppressive and seductive. But probably few interpretations are 
as engaging as the one by this talented ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Maids," Glaxa Studios, 3707 Sunset Blvd., Silverlake. Fridays, 8:30 
p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 
35 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

THEATER BEAT: COMIC SNAPSHOTS AT THE 'JOE SHOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Joe Show," at UpFront Comedy Showcase in Santa Monica, solo performer Joe 
Liss offers vignettes of six eccentrics from one Chicago neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 With his putty features and gift for mimicry, Liss comes well-equipped for the 
mission.These are seamless, highly individualized portrayals: The imperious 
acting coach with the faux British accent remains amazingly distinct in speech 
and movement from the salty old lady who runs the local Laundromat and the 
loser salesman who lives in his mother's basement, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Liss and director-co-writer Ron West have a hard time making the material 
add up to much. There are some scattered funny moments. A cab-driving barfly, 
for instance, relates his life story as though inspired by Harrison Ford 
movies. What's missing, though, is a thematic thread or set of insights that 
might give these disparate comic snapshots unity and a larger significance. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Joe Show," UpFront Comedy Showcase, 123 Broadway, Santa Monica. Fridays, 9 
p.m. Open run. $10. (310) 319-3477. Running time: 1 hour. SCOTT COLLINS

RESTAURANT REVIEW; WHEN IT COMES TO BAD TASTE, BIRDS DOESN'T CHICKEN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A postcard came recently from Birds, a cafe with an all-chicken menu on the 
Franklin Avenue "Strip." The postcard, made expressly for this cafe, shows two 
little girls, one around 4, one maybe 7. While the 4-year-old is furiously and 
aggressively giving the viewer "the bird," the older girl looks on in mock 
astonishment. This public relations statement made me wonder: Did the owners 
think such an image would draw people into their restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the postcard did make me curious: With such poor taste in 
P.R., what could the food be like? 
</P>
<P>
 Birds is half restaurant, half bar. Dark, it rocks and rolls at a moderate 
volume. There's sports on the bar TV and plump chickens on the kitchen 
rotisserie. Roomy booths in black vinyl are a bit sprung. The crowd is largely 
young men with big appetites, some with girlfriends or dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu offers chicken. Marinated rotisserie chicken is served with one to 
three side dishes and a choice of four dipping sauces. There's chicken pot pie. 
Chicken chili. Chicken "roll ups" -- lavash bread sandwiches in a variety of 
ethnic flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Much, then, depends on the quality of those twirling birds. And frankly, 
they're not much to chirp about: They may look plump and promising up there on 
the spit, they may be reasonably priced (half a chicken with one side dish is 
$6.75), but on the plate, the birds are small and flavorless, unless you count 
a faint, watery taste. Overcooked and dry, the white meat in particular is 
mealy -- no wonder the waitress urges us to select a dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything made of this meat, then, is not as good as it could be, no matter 
how enormous some of the portions are. Side dishes are also large and 
unremarkable: baked beans that taste as if they came from a can, dry rosemary 
potatoes, mashed potatoes made inedible with too much mashed garlic. You could 
feed a family of four with the Chinese chicken salad -- if you could find four 
people who'd like a deluge of thick, too-sweet dressing and knuckly meat. Corn 
chowder is thick and tasteless; the accompanying corn bread is sweet as pound 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The best chicken item is the pot pie, which has a terrific flaky crust, 
although the filling is dry and mostly potatoes. The best item of all, however, 
is the Italian "roll up" made with roasted vegetables, feta cheese, tomato, 
pepperoncini, lettuce -- and no chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe, 5925 Franklin Ave., Hollywood, (213) 
465-0175. Open 7 days for lunch and dinner. Full bar. Dinner for two, food 
only, $22-$36.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flavorful Fare: More low-priced chicken can be found at the newest branch of 
Rosti, now inhabiting the former Mario's Cooking for Friends space on Beverly. 
There, the irresistible half chicken, pollo al mattone , grilled with fresh 
rosemary and garlic and served with roasted potatoes, sells for $6.95. For the 
same price, chicken breast that's been pounded, breaded and fried to a thin 
crisp golden disc (fabulous with a squeeze of lemon) is served atop more 
roasted potatoes with a chopped tomato-and-basil relish. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can make yourself order something other than the chicken here -- and a 
lot of my friends could do so with only the greatest reluctance -- there's much 
on the familiar Rosti menu worth choosing. Antipasti are varied and 
interesting: fresh artichokes fried and stuffed, tuna and beans, caponata, 
roasted eggplant stuffed with ricotta and pine nuts. Rigatoni with pancetta and 
onions is simple and lively, and pasta fagioli , with soft pureed beans and 
sturdy bits of pasta, makes a satisfying $4 meal. 
</P>
<P>
 This third Rosti's food can be terrific, but the service can be unbelievably 
dim. At times, nobody greets you at the door, there are long lapses between 
courses, and neither wait staff nor management seems to know what's in the 
food. Vegetarian lasagne turns out to be lasagne with meat sauce -- the manager 
apparently thought those small brown flecks were a kind of pureed vegetable. A 
friend with a serious nut allergy asks if the pear tart has almond paste. It 
does not, we're assured, and yet it's full of the stuff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Still, I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rosti, 7475 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 938-8335. Open 7 days for 
breakfast, lunch and dinner. No alcohol served. Dinner for two, food only, 
$17-$42.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A MELROSE PASTICHE -- AND PROUD OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophie Healy, who ran the front of the house first at Champagne and then at 
Champagne Bis, is back in business again. She's traded in sleepy Little Santa 
Monica Boulevard for a livelier Melrose Avenue address.And this time around, 
she's not setting her sights quite so high. Her new restaurant is much more 
casual and not entirely French. She's called it Pastiche because its menu is a 
pastiche of cuisines, namely, French, Italian, Moroccan, Spanish, Thai and 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 She's inherited a pizza oven from the previous tenant, so naturally pizza -- 
and pasta, of course -- are the Italian contribution to the menu. Daube cooked 
in a cast-iron casserole, cassoulet and coq au vin are classically French. 
Vietnamese cooking is represented by an exotic fondue, Spanish by paella, Thai 
cuisine by coconut soup. Instead of a fragrant couscous or tajine, Morocco gets 
only kebabs. Looks like she's trying to cover every possibility, vegetarian 
included, with her "pastiche of seven different potato preparations." Take a 
couch potato out to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pastiche Restaurant, 7966 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 658-8884. Open 
Tuesday through Sunday for dinner only. Major credit cards accepted. Valet 
parking. Appetizers $3.50-$7.75, entrees $8.50-$22. S. IRENE VIRBILA

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BRYAN FERRY PUTS SOME HEART INTO HIS MANNERED WARBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the musical times passing him by and his recent albums showing little 
sales punch, Bryan Ferry and his aging image have the look of an endangered 
species. And when the singer tossed glitter into the air during his first song 
at the Pantages Theatre on Wednesday, it looked like a desperate, flailing 
attempt to recapture the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ferry proceeded to turn in a charming, involving concert, bringing a 
touch of playfulness to his wounded-romantic persona and summoning more 
conviction than you'd think possible. He didn't break character, he didn't 
break ground, but he put some heart into his mannered warble, and the 
performance of his nine musicians evinced respect for his music and for his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ferry seemed to know that the band was the real spark of the show, 
and he allowed them full rein. The evening came palpably alive during Melvin 
Davis' awesomely physical bass solo, where it seemed very likely that he'd snap 
his instrument's neck with the fingers of his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry and company turned his music's split personality to their advantage. In 
the richly atmospheric mood pieces such as "Slave to Love" and "Swept Away," 
supremely sensuous swells of sound filled the party-tent stage set over the 
lapping funk beats. The rockers, ranging as far back as Roxy Music's "Virginia 
Plain" and "Do the Strand," didn't have any real grit, but grit isn't the 
currency in Ferry's dream-pop realm. Engaging artifice is his game, and he 
still plays like a master. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bryan Ferry and Combustible Edison play tonight at the Pantages Theatre, 
6233 Hollywood Blvd., 8 p.m. Sold out. (213) 480-3232. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; THE BILLBOARD AWARDS OPT FOR HIP, REMAIN UNEVENTFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who woulda thunk it? An awards show dedicated strictly to honoring the 
certified top-sellers in music -- opened by a punk-rock band on an independent 
label, replete with expletives deleted and stage-diving from a singer proudly 
sporting a "Corporate Rock Kills Bands Dead" T-shirt. Inconceivable even a 
couple of years ago; the fetes they are a-changin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Having as au courant a kids' band as the Offspring open the fifth annual 
Billboard Music Awards -- telecast on Fox from the Universal Amphitheatre 
Wednesday -- was further evidence that a) "the year that punk broke" has given 
way to the year that third-generation punk ballooned, and b) everybody's trying 
desperately just to keep pace with the MTV Video Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 To the latter end, the Billboards this year hired executive producer Joel 
Gallen, veteran of many an MTV rite. Out went fogy Phil Collins as host; in, 
quite wisely, came Dennis Miller and Heather Locklear, as a Gen-X George Burns 
and Gracie Allen. Gone were country or adult-contemporary acts as performers, 
if not honorees; in were rappers and ex-college radio faves gone gold or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 The hepped-up result was the easiest-to-take Billboard Awards show ever . . . 
yet, mysteriously, one devoid of anything that might qualify as a real 
highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Billboards can't pull in favors with the same weight as MTV, so booking is 
still a problem. Stone Temple Pilots were slated for the final performing slot 
(and were still being advertised up to air time), but had an apparent change of 
heart, with singer Scott Weiland offering a half-baked apology as he picked up 
a statuette. In their stead, Collective Soul, whom no one would've likely 
pegged as "climactic," closed the show with uneventful dutifulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, balladeer R. Kelly provided a more risible performance, with several 
minutes of fairly explicit simulated mass sex (seen mostly in modest long shots 
by luckier home viewers) on his immeasurably silly "Bump 'n' Grind." The 
panties-exposing, non-missionary-position aerobics of Kelly's dancers at least 
provided co-host Miller grist for one of the post-play remarks he excels at -- 
something about chiropractors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Effective but not overwhelming numbers were turned in by Urge Overkill (some 
of its members wearing Tarantino-style suits for their reverential "Girl, 
You'll Be a Woman Soon"), Melissa Etheridge, Warren G & Nate Dogg, Tom Jones 
(terrific vocal dynamics on "A Girl Like You," but too stationary to inspire 
the cotton to fly) and, by satellite, the ubiquitous Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorees had to walk out onto a platform amid the "party in the pit" to accept 
their awards and, like the hosts, clearly had a hard time hearing themselves 
think, thanks to the hall being packed with several times as many screaming 
teens as tuxed industryites. Snoop Doggy Dogg finally couldn't take the roar 
any more: "Can we get a moment of a silence for a small chronic break?" he 
twice requested during his speech. Ah, a man after Newt Gingrich's own heart. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the show's increased grooviness, the selling point the Billboards have 
long offered above all other awards telecasts remains blissfully intact: still, 
just two hours!

JAZZ REVIEW; '50 FINGERS' GETS BIG HAND AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I needed that," said a listener Wednesday night at Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena after pianists Roger Kellaway and Dick Hyman had just performed an 
exhilarating, blues-tinged and very swinging version of "Just a Closer Walk 
With Thee." The number had concluded a concert called "50 Fingers" that also 
spotlighted three other fine pianists: Kenny Barron, Alan Broadbent and Gerald 
Wiggins. 
</P>
<P>
 On the program, the pianists first played unaccompanied, and then in duos, and 
the fan's observation could have spoken for others in the audience. The 
pulsating, bandlike feeling that Hyman and Kellaway generated was often missing 
during the solo performances, which, though much wonderful music was performed, 
were sometimes short on rhythmic energy and focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the post-intermission half of "50 Fingers" made for a more 
consistently rewarding listening experience than the first. Here the pianists 
were, in effect, each other's bands, there was more forward drive to the 
pieces, and there was a clearer distinction between the soloist and the 
accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Barron played fat, thick chords for Broadbent when they offered 
"Strollin'," and the latter delivered fluid, attractive lines that sparkled. 
When Wiggins and Barron played a duet on "St. Louis Blues," one of the 
evening's high points, Barron worked like a bass player, allowing Wiggin's 
locked-hands phrases to sing. After Wiggins and Hyman performed "Satin Doll," 
Kellaway joined Hyman for an uproarious "Chopsticks" that could have been 
written by Erik Satie, John Cage and Art Tatum, separately or collectively, 
before their climactic finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The solo portion was full of its own charm. Barron brought a Monklike elegance 
to "Getting Sentimental Over You," mixing phrases that might have been played 
by the great pianist with be-bop bent darting ideas that were stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadbent was alternately bluesy and boppish on "Django" while Hyman took 
"Sophisticated Lady" at a fast waltz tempo that all but obscured the number's 
lovely melody. Wiggins was the epitome of ease and grace on two tunes, and 
Kellaway, with typical elan, gave "My One and Only Love" an expressionistic 
ride, liberally mixing in dissonant passages with robust, swinging lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The superb acoustics of Ambassador provided an ideal venue for these 
outstanding artists.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DISCLOSURE': THE PLOT THICKENS . . .; DOUGLAS, MOORE STAR IN 
ADAPTATION OF CRICHTON'S NOVEL ON HARASSMENT REVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the hotel chain that promises "no surprises," the film version of the 
best-selling "Disclosure" has little use for the unexpected, with one 
exception. Albeit unintentionally, it increases appreciation for the 
storytelling skills of novelist Michael Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of Crichton's talent, his ability to spin out glib tales that are 
pantingly close to today's headlines, has been much commented upon. 
"Disclosure," with its au courant topic of sexual harassment in the workplace, 
is high-concept pulp fiction, the latest in a successful string that has 
included "Jurassic Park" and "Rising Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 But not until you see "Disclosure," starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore 
and directed by Barry Levinson from a script by Paul Attanasio, will you 
appreciate a humbler aspect of Crichton's craft. Although literary critics 
understandably fulminate about his characterization and his writing style, 
Crichton knows how to write a coherent plot, something his movie versions tend 
to have trouble with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is hardly a great mess. It is rather standard Hollywood fare, 
adequately entertaining if lacking in the over-the-top enthusiasm someone like 
Paul Verhoeven ("Basic Instinct") would have brought. But its preoccupation 
with snazzy computer-generated special effects has left key plot points so 
unclear at least one baffled viewer had to retreat to the book to find out why 
some things happened and others did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course "Disclosure's" money scene, the lurid sexual encounter between Tom 
Sanders (Douglas) and his glamorous boss (and former girlfriend) Meredith 
Johnson (Moore), has not been allowed to languish in uncertainty. Crisply shot 
by "Howards End's" Tony Pierce-Roberts, it is presented as a high-gloss clash 
of the titans, with the unscrupulous Johnson trying to force her dastardly will 
on a plainly confused Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' confusion is understandable. When this particular day began, he and 
his svelte wife, Susan (Caroline Goodall), were looking forward to some 
positive results from the merger of DigiCom, the high-tech Seattle firm Sanders 
works for, with a bigger outfit. He might even be promoted to the plum job of 
vice president of Advanced Operations and Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Sanders gets to the office, he eventually finds out (in a typically 
murky bit of exposition) that DigiCom's mercurial boss, Bob Garvin (Donald 
Sutherland), has given the promotion he thought he earned to Johnson, an 
ambitious old flame who he feels "doesn't know the difference between software 
and a cashmere sweater." 
</P>
<P>
 As played by Moore, Johnson is a classic villainess with a heart as brittle as 
a silicon chip. Rapacious and conniving, she insists on getting her own way or 
knowing the reason why. Although Moore does not bring the brio to the part that 
Linda Fiorentino imparts to "The Last Seduction," she is perfectly adequate to 
the film's single-dimension sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Douglas, whose character spends much of the movie rushing 
around with jaws clenched and a harried look on his face after Johnson has the 
cheek to accuse him of harassing her . As DigiCom lines up behind Garvin's 
favorite and problems develop with a new gizmo he is supposed to be 
supervising, Sanders decides to duke it out and ends up with harassment expert 
Catharine Alvarez (Roma Maffia, who makes the same strong impression she did in 
"The Paper") as his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is certainly clear enough, but other things that should be are not. 
What, for instance, is the nature of the hold Johnson has over Garvin, and is 
there anything besides pure lust motivating what happens behind her locked 
office doors? The book tidily clears up these problems, but the film leaves 
them uncomfortably hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
 More effective, and a surprising highlight of the film, are "Disclosure's" 
visuals. Production designer Neil Spisak, art directors Richard Yanez-Toyon and 
Charles William Breen and set decorator Garrett Lewis have created an exciting 
office environment from scratch for the folks at DigiCom. And the ever-reliable 
gremlins at Industrial Light & Magic have come up with a vivid representation 
of the possible future of virtual reality technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Levinson has done a plausible job of directing, "Disclosure" suffers 
from what feels like a lack of creative passion. After "Toys" and "Jimmy 
Hollywood," back-to-back personal projects that misfired, it's hard not to feel 
that he took this film on largely to strengthen his commercial credentials, and 
it shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, screenwriter Attanasio, who dealt thoughtfully with ethical 
dilemmas in "Quiz Show," works in a more limited moral palette in "Disclosure," 
where questions of who is right and who is wrong are plainly obvious. The idea 
that sexual harassment is about power, not sex, and that a woman in power can 
potentially misbehave just like a man may be news to certain segments of the 
population, but they are not news enough to light a much-needed fire under this 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for a very strong sex scene, sexual dialogue and other 
strong language. Times guidelines: The sexual situations are more clinical than 
steamy.

MOVIE REVIEW; SNIPES OUT TO LAND SKY-DIVERS IN 'ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing about "Drop Zone" are the stunt sky-divers who dive-bomb 
through the air at speeds of 200 m.p.h. or float together in formation. These 
jumpers are juiced by pure adrenaline and they juice the audience too. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Badham is a techno-whiz at this sort of stuff, and he's smart 
enough to keep the stunt divers at the center of the action. And a good thing 
too: The script, by Peter Barsocchini and John Bishop, is so preposterously 
contrived and tone-deaf that any attempt to play it straight would be laughed 
off the screen. It's no use picking away at "Drop Zone" -- the filmmakers have 
done that for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Snipes plays Pete Nessip, a U.S. marshal tracking down a team of stunt 
sky-divers who have cooked up a plan to swoop down on the Drug Enforcement 
Agency headquarters in Washington during the Fourth of July celebrations and 
abscond with their entire computerized roster of undercover drug agents. The 
team's asking price for the DEA list -- $2 million a month. (No doubt a bargain 
compared to this film's budget.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pete first gets wind of these jumpers when he and his brother Terry 
(Malcolm-Jamal Warner) are transporting a convicted computer whiz (Michael 
Jeter, in his best flibbertigibberty mode) to a federal prison on a commercial 
747. Posing as terrorists, the jumpers, led by the truly bad Ty Moncrief (Gary 
Busey), yank the master hacker off the plane, killing Terry in the process. 
Later Pete goes to another sky-diver -- the good-bad girl parolee Jessie (Yancy 
Butler) -- for help in cracking the case. Whereupon Ty offs her highflying 
boyfriend. So their motives for revenge are personal . 
</P>
<P>
 The ground-level action is mostly filler for the highflying jamborees. 
Parachute-equipped but untutored, Pete learns how to sky-dive after Jessie 
throws him horrified out of a plane. It's not exactly Meet Cute time. When he 
joins Jessie's team of avengers, his participation is played mostly for comic 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Snipes is very funny at acting scared in the sky. His performance starts out 
tough-edged but he seems to have decided early on that "Drop Zone" didn't 
really need an actor. He's more like a stunt double comic, yet his charisma is 
so strong that he holds the movie together whenever it isn't airborne -- quite 
an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few good scenes involving the wiggy camaraderie of jumpers (Grace 
Zabriskie and Corin Nemec stand out) and Busey once again demonstrates that 
he's the best heavy in the business. But you could skip everything in "Drop 
Zone" except, perhaps, for the aerial wingdings and still live a full and 
complete life. (It would be different, of course, if the film had included the 
Flying Elvises.) 
</P>
<P>
 A side issue: Pete, who is black, and Jessie, who is white, clearly have a 
budding attraction -- plus they save each other's lives. So why doesn't the 
film allow them a single kiss? This is the same question a lot of us asked in 
the Denzel Washington-Julia Roberts starrer "Pelican Brief," which was also 
kissless. Now that a new generation of black superstars like Snipes and 
Washington are figuring in interracial romantic scenarios, is it too much to 
ask that these performers be allowed to be romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong language and violence. Times guidelines: It 
includes scenes of people being sucked out of planes and a man's finger being 
torn off.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CENTURY' A DRAMA OF ENDINGS, BEGINNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Century" takes us back to New Year's Eve, 1898, to a town outside London. A 
new resident, a Romanian Jew who made his fortune in construction in Scotland, 
is throwing a gaudy celebration shunned by his openly anti-Semitic neighbors. 
The next year, at the film's end and as the century turns, Mr. Reisner (Robert 
Stephens) will be considerably more successful as a host, but in the course of 
that year the destiny of his brilliant, handsome son Paul (Clive Owen) will 
have entirely changed. Writer-director Stephen Poliakoff suggests in absorbing, 
provocative fashion that while some bright hopes of the 20th Century were 
already dimming on the eve of 1900, unexpected challenges and possibilities 
were also opening up. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical student of blazing promise -- and equal self-confidence -- Paul is 
heading for London to study at a research institute celebrated for its 
progressiveness. After a bit of adjustment and humbling, Paul soon becomes the 
assistant to the institute's formidable, charismatic chief, Professor Mandry 
(Charles Dance). Paul's life is going swimmingly, his career seemingly assured, 
when he tells his mentor that he should reconsider the merits of a fellow 
student's revolutionary theory regarding research in neurology. Mandry regards 
this an act of impertinence to such an extent that Paul's attempts to press his 
case trigger truly shocking consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 A distinguished playwright and screenwriter, Poliakoff chooses to present 
Mandry as an enigma. Is the possibility that Paul has intervened on behalf of a 
colleague stunning enough to threaten Mandry's own ego and stature? Why 
couldn't he proclaim it as a credit to the institute? Is there some latent, 
unacknowledged anti-Semitism on Mandry's part involved here? We'll never know 
for sure -- such uncertainty is something which members of all minorities are 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, Poliakoff, in his third directorial effort, may be right to 
let us ponder such questions, but in other aspects of "Century" some crucial 
clarity is needed. As part of his growing experience -- and his developing 
relationship with Clara (Miranda Richardson), a smart, poor and beautiful lab 
assistant -- Paul is becoming aware of the plight of London's homeless. In 
doing so, he learns that Mandry, in the name of eugenics -- a movement which, 
significantly, the Nazis would appropriate only a couple of decades later -- 
has embarked upon a secret program of thoroughly horrifying cosequence.  
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty surrounding some key aspects of Mandry's clandestine 
activities diminishes the impact of what is a distinctive, complex drama of 
wide-ranging implications. Fortunately, the film nevertheless possesses the 
larger perspective of Paul discovering his true path in life, one that he 
cannot remotely have anticipated only a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 British films almost invariably shine in their performances and in period 
re-creations, and on these scores "Century" triumphs. Owen, Richardson and 
Dance are impeccable, and Stephens is a special delight as a man who is a 
shrewd businessman, a loving father, and yet often obtuse in social situations. 
Joan Hickson is amusing as the very grand patron of the institute. "Century" 
has so much going for it, is so challenging and unusual, that its flaws are all 
the more unfortunate.

NEWSWIRE: SAMPRAS WINS QUIETLY, IVANISEVIC ERUPTS

 Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic won quarterfinal tennis matches Thursday in 
the $6-million Grand Slam Cup at Munich, Germany, and Ivanisevic had another 
temper tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Sampras defeated Michael Chang, 6-4, 6-3, and Ivanisevic rolled 
over Boris Becker, 6-4, 6-1, in only 58 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will meet in the semifinals, as will the winners of today's 
concluding quarterfinals in which Todd Martin plays Sergi Bruguera and Andre 
Agassi faces Magnus Larsson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic is serving a two-month suspension from the ATP Tour for 
accumulating too many conduct violations. He became the first to be banned 
after an outburst at last month's ATP Tour World Championship in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 He was allowed to play the Grand Slam Cup because the ATP considers it an 
exhibition. The tournament is the most lucrative in the world, and Ivanisevic 
earned $425,000 for reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost his temper and was warned by umpire Bruno Rebeuh in the fourth game. 
After a linesman failed to call a shot by Becker that seemed clearly out, 
Ivanisevic smashed his racket to the ground and raced toward the umpire, 
swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic still managed to save three break points in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said something bad and I deserved the warning," he said. "But that ball 
wasn't even close. I lost my temper a bit, but I played better and better after 
that." Baseball

 The Boston Red Sox reportedly are on the verge of acquiring Jose Canseco from 
the Texas Rangers. The Boston Globe reported that the Red Sox have agreed to 
send outfielder Otis Nixon and pitcher Ken Ryan to the Rangers for Canseco. A 
high-ranking Ranger official told the Globe that only a technicality needed to 
be resolved before the trade was made. There is believed to be a question as to 
which team is responsible for the $400,000 buyout in Nixon's contract.

 Toby Harrah was hired as manager of the New York Mets' triple-A International 
League farm club in Norfolk, Va., succeeding Bobby Valentine, who will manage

 Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said that Colorado's decision to promote a 
white assistant football coach over a more qualified black typifies hiring 
practices at schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, speaking during a conference call, called the practice "white male 
affirmative action." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is protesting the appointment of Rick Neuheisel, who is white, over 
assistant head coach Bob Simmons, who is black, to replace the retiring Bill 
McCartney as head coach.

 Colorado President Judith Albino has defended the decision and the 
university's efforts toward diversity. She will meet with Chet Whey, Colorado

 University of Idaho President Elisabeth Zinser's remark that Idaho's 
acceptance of an invitation to join the Big West Conference was null and void

university's position has not changed since it accepted the Big West's

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: MONDAY NIGHT GAME STILL A SPECIAL EVENT AFTER ALL 
THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Raiders began piling up penalties Monday night, the obvious question 
was: Are they on a record pace? 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hirdt, the executive vice president of the Elias Sports Bureau who also 
works for ABC, was busy in one of the production trucks at San Diego's Jack 
Murphy Stadium trying to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirdt, whose lap-top computer is on line to Elias' extensive data base in New 
York, found that the record for penalties in a game is 22, set in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 He also searched to see if the Raiders had set a first-quarter record with 
nine. He couldn't find penalty records broken down into quarters, but he did 
learn that the Pittsburgh Steelers, in a game against Cleveland on Sept. 11, 
had committed nine penalties in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC put up a graphic with that information. 
</P>
<P>
 Such things are taken for granted on "Monday Night Football," now in its 25th 
season and as successful as ever. It ranks seventh among prime-time network 
shows. This isn't a half-hour of top ratings for ABC. It's three hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Knocking "Monday Night Football" has been fashionable ever since the Howard 
Cosell days. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticisms include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The booth is overcrowded with three announcers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dan Dierdorf is too opinionated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Gifford is too bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten is that the ABC cameras rarely miss anything, the information is 
plentiful and often shows up in newspaper game stories the next day, 
play-by-play man Al Michaels is tremendous, and commentators Gifford and 
Dierdorf, now in their eighth year together, aren't all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last time ABC did a Monday night Raider home game was 1983, when the 
Raiders faced a rookie quarterback named Dan Marino. The NFL doesn't schedule 
Monday night games at the Coliseum for a couple of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One, games there hardly ever sell out, meaning ABC would lose the L.A. market. 
Two, the Coliseum is often not kind to television. Remember the power outage a 
couple of weeks ago that took ABC off the air during the USC-Notre Dame game? 
</P>
<P>
 ABC hasn't done a Ram home game since 1991. Why? Check the team's record. 
</P>
<P>
 So it took a jaunt down Interstate 5 to San Diego to get an up-close look at 
the "Monday Night Football" crew, the same one that will be working the Super 
Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew, which had arrived in San Diego on Saturday, was at the stadium all 
day Monday getting ready for that night's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds of graphics were being prepared. Only a few would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 One showed that Jerry Ball leads the Raiders in tackling ballcarriers behind 
the line of scrimmage with 13 such tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass rushers get a lot of credit because their sacks are recorded, but there 
isn't a stat for the inside guys who stop the run," Hirdt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another graphic showed that the Raiders' Jeff Jaeger is third in field-goal 
percentage from 50 yards or more among kickers who have tried 10 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball didn't have any tackles behind the line of scrimmage, and Jaeger's one 
field-goal try was from 43 yards, so neither of those graphics was used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's game, the crew was in good spirits. It had been a good telecast 
and, more important, a good game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third exciting Monday night game of the season. The two others 
were Detroit's 20-17 overtime victory over Dallas on Sept. 19 and Kansas City's 
31-28 victory over Denver on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and Chargers drew a 17.7 rating, which is higher than the season 
average of 17.4. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few flaws Monday night, but they were minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford, in talking about how Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard had 
drafted Stan Humphries when he was with the Washington Redskins and later 
brought him to the Chargers, called Humphries "Bobby." He did it again a moment 
later without correcting himself. Such slips don't count as long as they are 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michaels said Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Houston were the only teams to 
have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, he immediately corrected 
that to Washington, Cincinnati and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Quipped Dierdorf: "That shows you how fast we got a call from (Tampa Bay 
Coach) Sam Wyche." 
</P>
<P>
 Dierdorf was hot Monday night. When Humphries overthrew Shawn Jefferson in the 
fourth quarter, Michaels marveled that the ball "was 57 yards in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dierdorf: "Unfortunately, though, it needed to be 52." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two key members of the ABC production crew are producer Ken Wolfe and 
director Craig Janoff. Wolfe has been the producer since 1986, when Michaels 
and Gifford made up the series' only two-man crew. Janoff came aboard the next 
year, along with Dierdorf, who came over from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels, who has been at ABC since 1976, calls Wolfe and Janoff "the best in 
the business, certainly the best I've ever worked with." 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford, who has been on the series since its second season, was asked his 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Different people think they put their own personal stamp on the telecasts, 
but what really matters is what takes place down on the field," he said. "The 
games are what makes the series so popular." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that might help, though, would be for ABC to put up the score more 
often, particularly now that the score-all-the-time graphic on Fox and ESPN is 
becoming more accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said he's getting somewhat used to that kind of graphic but that ABC 
isn't going to use one, even one that is taken down during live action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to clutter the picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe figures, with the kind of success "Monday Night Football" is enjoying, 
if it ain't broke, don't fix it. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Here we go again: Los Angeles gets the Rams at Tampa Bay on Channel 11 Sunday 
but not San Francisco at San Diego because the Raiders are at home. The only 
afternoon NBC game available here is a dog: Seattle at Houston. . . . NFL 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who was at Monday's game in San Diego, was asked 
if most homes would be able some day to get the league's new Sunday Ticket pay 
package, which has gone over big. "I really can't speculate," he said. "Sales 
have gone better than expected, but our main concern is putting exciting games 
on the field, not how we televise them into homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural Diners Club Matches, being held this weekend at PGA West in La 
Quinta, figure to become another popular television golf event. The match-play 
team event, created by Jack Nicklaus and Terry Jastrow, ABC's senior golf 
producer who also heads Jack Nicklaus Productions, brings together players from 
the PGA, the Senior PGA and LPGA tours. ESPN carries today's round and ABC 
Saturday's and Sunday's. . . . The Heisman Trophy winner will be announced on 
ESPN Saturday at 4:30 p.m. . . . Oscar De La Hoya's fight against Johnny Avila 
at the Grand Olympic on Saturday will be on CBS at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK for UCLA radio announcer Chris Roberts and Marques Johnson to get 
excited, but they shouldn't forget to tell listeners what is going on. A case 
in point was the Bruins' thrilling 82-81 victory over Kentucky last Saturday. 
The listeners didn't know where J.R. Henderson was when he was fouled by 
Kentucky's Walter McCarty before making the winning free throws, or that 
McCarty had gotten mostly ball in committing the foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9 will carry the Raycom telecast of the Michigan-Duke basketball game 
Saturday about 8:30 p.m., after the Laker-Utah game. . . . Channel 13 will 
televise Saturday night's high school showdown between Bishop Amat and Mater 
Dei at Anaheim Stadium, with Randy Rosenbloom and Ron Glazer calling the 
action. Halftime guests will include former Ram Lawrence McCutcheon, now a Ram 
scout, whose son Daylon is Bishop Amat's star running back, and former Ram Rod 
Perry, now the Rams' cornerback coach, whose son Rod plays for Mater Dei. Also 
on hand will be Pat Haden, a Bishop Amat alumnus. . . . Both KORG (1190) and 
KGRB (900) will provide radio coverage of the Bishop Amat-Mater Dei game. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC's Joe McDonnell, the only holdover from the station's all-sports format, 
will leave the station Dec. 24. McDonnell said there aren't enough 
opportunities to do sports talk under the new format. . . . For the record: 
Brian Golden is announcing prep playoff games for Lancaster's KAVL (610), not 
Canyon Country's KBET (1220). The KBET announcers are Al Epstein, Barry 
McKeever and Mark Ceccanese. . . . The Mexican programming carried by XTRA last 
Thursday was new President Ernesto Zedillo's inaugural speech, not simply a 
news conference.

NCAA VOLLEYBALL / SOUTH REGIONAL; UCLA OVERWHELMS DUKE TO ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the NCAA volleyball tournament reaches the final 16, matches are usually 
very competitive. Third-ranked UCLA, however, made sure its contest with Duke 
Thursday night was an exception as the Bruins used a balanced attack to defeat 
the undersized Blue Devils, 15-3, 15-3, 15-4, in a South Regional semifinal 
before 232 at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center.Five Bruins had six or more 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (30-3) will play Houston, a 13-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-4 winner over Florida, 
in the regional final tonight at 4:30 PST. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played well, there's no question," UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski said. "Our 
hitting percentage as a team is well above what we've been doing through the 
season. We had an outstanding offensive night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins finished with a .476 hitting percentage. Senior outside hitter 
Alyson Randick posted 10 kills and no errors in 12 total attacks to finish with 
an .833 percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Banachowski said the offensive performance was somewhat surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were bigger, quicker and more powerful than Duke," he said. "And 
I thought we would be able to do some things offensively. I didn't think that 
we would put up the numbers like we did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA opened up leads of 7-0, 5-0 and 10-0 in the three games and never was 
seriously threatened. The first game set the tempo as Randick, senior outside 
hitter Annett Buckner and freshman outside hitter Kara Milling had three kills 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner finished with 12 kills and is now 35 short of breaking the school 
record for kills in a season, set by Patty Orozco with 627 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore middle blocker Kim Krull finished with nine kills, and junior 
outside hitter Jenny Johnson contributed eight. Sophomore setter Kelly 
Flannigan had 33 assists.

NCAA VOLLEYBALL / WEST REGIONAL; USC DEFEATS ARIZONA, MEETS STANFORD NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 USC left Arizona Coach David Rubio with a favorable impression as the Trojans 
swept his Wildcats out of the NCAA women's volleyball tournament Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they pass that well, Stanford will lose," Rubio said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC advanced to the West Regional final with a 15-7, 15-9, 15-7 victory over 
Arizona and will face the host Cardinal tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Stanford (29-1) eliminated Arizona State, 15-8, 15-3, 15-6, 
behind junior Cary Wendell, who posted match highs of 14 kills and 30 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've felt like we've been on a collision course with Stanford for a while," 
USC Coach Lisa Love said. "We're going to have to tie our digging shoes on 
tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, USC is 9-2 against teams other than Stanford in the postseason but 
0-6 against the Cardinal. And playing Stanford, which beat USC in both 
regular-season matches, in Maples Pavilion is a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been an exceptional sideout team the last month," Love said. "A lot of 
it has to do with our passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Meika Wagner led USC (.358 team hitting percentage) with 18 kills in 31 
attempts. Senior Lauri Yust added 13 kills and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (22-7) jumped ahead, 6-0, in the second game, but Arizona (17-10) rallied 
to within two points three times. A block from Wagner and kills from Kilee 
Hughes and Vesna Dragicevic sealed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC opened a 6-0 lead in the third game, but allowed Arizona to even the 
score, 6-6, before coasting home.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RHETT NEXT BIG TEST FOR RUSHING DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After New Orleans' Mario Bates rushed for 96 yards and three touchdowns 
against them Sunday, the Rams face the task of stopping another top rookie 
tailback -- Tampa Bay's Errict Rhett. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are ranked 12th in the league in rushing defense, giving up 103.3 
yards a game. Bates averaged only 3.8 yards a carry against the Rams last week 
but scored on runs of one, 11 and 26 yards. Only one back has rushed for more 
than 100 yards on them this season -- the Giants' Rodney Hampton (112 yards in 
27 carries). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been vulnerable at times, but statistics can be misleading too," Coach 
Chuck Knox said. "We have to play tougher against the run. They have a great 
running back who's having a heck of a year. I'm sure they're going to try to 
run it on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhett, a second-round pick from Florida, has averaged 117.5 yards in his last 
four starts. He gained 192 yards in 40 carries in the Bucs' 26-21 victory over 
Washington on Sunday, a team rookie record and the second-best effort by a 
Buccaneer running back behind James Wilder's 219 yards in 1983. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Assistant Coach Rod Perry and scout Lawrence McCutcheon, who have sons playing 
football at Mater Dei and La Puente Bishop Amat, respectively, offered their 
predictions on the schools' showdown in the Southern Section Division I 
championship game Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon, a senior running back at Bishop Amat, the nation's 
top-ranked team, has rushed for more than 2,000 yards this season. His father 
predicted a Bishop Amat victory "going away."  
</P>
<P>
 Rod Perry Jr., a sophomore wide receiver, has more than 1,100 yards receiving 
for the Monarchs. His father, of course, predicted a Mater Dei victory. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Knox said an MRI exam of linebacker Joe Kelly's injured knee showed no tear, 
and he is expected to be ready for Sunday's game. . . . Knox won't make a 
determination until Sunday on defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (ankle). MIKE

 Miami Dolphin Coach Don Shula will undergo outpatient surgery today in Miami 
to repair a ruptured right Achilles' tendon, but he expects to be on the 
sidelines for Monday night's game against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula, 64, sustained the injury while walking to his office after practice 
Wednesday. Surgery was scheduled after an MRI exam on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation will require Shula to miss a regular-season practice for the 
first time in his 25 years with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino was sidelined by a ruptured Achilles' tendon 
last season.

 Rookie star Marshall Faulk was hospitalized in Indianapolis as a precaution 
after developing a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the virus. It's just that the team felt he could get the best care in 
the hospital," club spokesman Craig Kelley said of the running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ted Marchibroda said that he anticipates Faulk will play Sunday at New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's any problem of a serious nature," Marchibroda said. "It's 
not anything that we're concerned with at this point." 
</P>

<P>
 Seattle Seahawk defensive tackle Mike Frier, paralyzed in a car crash in which 
two teammates also were hurt, sat up for the first time since surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 His neck was taken out of traction Wednesday, allowing him to sit up 30 to 40 
degrees. He did so without feeling dizzy, said Ann Evans, spokeswoman for 
Overlake Hospital Medical Center in Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier's condition has improved, but he remains in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland police, meanwhile, received blood-alcohol and polygraph results as 
they continued their investigation of the single-car accident last Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, running back Chris Warren and rookie running back Lamar Smith were in 
Smith's 1992 Oldsmobile Bravada when it struck a utility pole near the 
Seahawks' Kirkland, Wash., headquarters.

 Tampa Bay Buccaneer special teams standout Curtis Buckley is appealing a 
$7,500 fine the NFL levied against him for a tough hit on Brian Mitchell of the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley leveled Mitchell on the opening kickoff last Sunday, forcing a fumble 
that he recovered. The Redskin returner remained on the ground for several 
minutes but was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL ruled that Buckley led with the crown of his helmet, although the 
reserve safety maintained he hit Mitchell with his shoulder.

 Tim Krumrie, a 10th-round draft choice from Wisconsin in 1983 who became a

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; INJURED STANDOUTS RETURN TO LINEUP 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At this point, most NFL teams' weekly injury reports get longer with each 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 games, the Raiders have more players returning from injuries than 
being sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington, having one of his best seasons before suffering 
a lower leg injury against the Rams Nov. 13, might play some Sunday against 
Denver at the Coliseum. Washington would join Albert Lewis, who returned Monday 
at San Diego, in the team's nickel coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming along pretty good now," Coach Art Shell said. "We're getting 
healthier. It was good to see Albert get through a whole game without an 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Including last season's wild-card playoff victory, the Raiders, who lead the 
series, 48-19-2, have defeated the Broncos five games in a row and 10 of their 
last 11 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the Raiders' secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "We match up well against them in all aspects of the game," Shell said. "It's 
basically just our players against theirs. Offensive linemen against defensive 
linemen. Wide receivers against defensive backs. Running backs against 
linebackers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Rocket Ismail joined the Raiders last season, wide receiver coach Fred 
Biletnikoff gave him an easy assignment for his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he told me was to line up on the right side, and that was it," said 
Ismail, who is second on the team behind Brown with five touchdowns in 26 
catches. LONNIE WHITE

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; NORTH CAROLINA (5-0) STAYS ON RIGHT TRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't forget about Donald Williams just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, the most valuable player of the 1993 Final Four who has been 
overshadowed recently by North Carolina's three sophomore stars, scored 14 of 
his 18 points in the second half Thursday night to help the top-ranked Tar 
Heels hold off No. 24 Villanova, 75-66, at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of talented offensive players," said Williams, who has 
struggled with his shooting since an injury-plagued 1993-94 season. "In my 
sophomore and junior years I was one of the top guys the team looked for, one 
of the two options, but this year we have so many people who can score it just 
has to balance out. I just have to be more relaxed. You just have to let it 
come to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams made two of eight shots before halftime, but broke the Wildcat zone 
with four key baskets over a four-minute span in the second half to keep the 
Tar Heels (5-0) from becoming the third top-ranked team to fall in as many 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half, Villanova (4-2) made 
seven consecutive shots in an 18-4 run to take its first lead, 49-48, with 
12:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't the No. 1 team in the country," North Carolina Coach Dean Smith 
said. "But the way we won is crucial. We executed down the stretch. I'd much 
rather win a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Arkansas 78, Southern Methodist 66 -- Corliss Williamson scored 21 
points and Clint McDaniel and Darnell Robinson each scored 15 to help the 
Razorbacks (5-1) hold off the Mustangs (1-4) at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending national champions came in averaging 99 points per game and 
built a big first-half lead but couldn't shake the Mustangs, who made 11 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU was led by Troy Matthews, who scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Arizona 81, Houston 67 -- Damon Stoudamire and Ray Owes scored 16 points 
each to lead the Wildcats at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (5-1) opened a 24-8 lead in the first 6 1/2 minutes but was as sloppy 
in the second half as it had been crisp in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (1-3) shot poorly most of the game, but Damon Jones made six 
three-point shots in scoring 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Maryland 113, Colgate 53 -- Johnny Rhodes scored 11 of his 17 points in 
a 28-4 first-half run, and Joe Smith had 12 points and 15 rebounds to lead the 
rout at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (6-1) topped the 100-point mark in a third consecutive regular-season 
game for the first time in school history. Exree Hipp had 17 points for the 
Terrapins, who will bring a four-game winning streak into Saturday's game 
against No. 5 Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Adonal Foyle of Colgate (0-6), coming off a 32-point, 25-rebound 
effort against Texas Southern, was held to nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Virginia 104, Bethune-Cookman 49 -- Cory Alexander scored 28 points to 
lead the rout at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, who scored only four points and had seven turnovers during a 70-65 
loss to Vanderbilt on Tuesday night, scored 15 points as the Cavaliers (4-2) 
took a 61-27 halftime lead over the Wildcats (2-2), who were playing their 
first NCAA opponent this season. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Wake Forest 53, Richmond 49 -- Rusty LaRue made a three-point shot and 
a steal in the last 20 seconds to help the Demon Deacons (5-1) hold off the 
Spiders (2-3) at Richmond, Va. OTHER GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Washington Bullets and Chris Webber are getting better acquainted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets won for only the second time in the eight games since they 
acquired Webber in a trade with the Golden State Warriors, outlasting the 
Dallas Mavericks in overtime, 124-121, on Thursday night at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really needed this win," Webber said after leading the Bullets with 23 
points and 14 rebounds. "We're playing a lot more comfortably now that we're 
getting to know each other a little better. Some of that showed on the floor 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Chapman's 18-foot jumper with 29.3 seconds to play broke a 118-118 tie and 
Scott Skiles added two free throws with 11.4 seconds left. Webber added a 
clinching dunk with three seconds to play for a 124-118 advantage before Jamal 
Mashburn's three-point basket at the buzzer accounted for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn finished with 45 points, the most by a Maverick at Reunion Arena 
since Mark Aguirre had 46 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 117, San Antonio 114 -- Karl Malone scored 28 points, Jeff Hornacek 
scored 26, and both made crucial free throws during the second overtime at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing in the second overtime, 114-112, Utah closed to 114-113 with 55 
seconds left on Hornacek's free throw after a foul by Avery Johnson. Hornacek 
then made two free throws with 28 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Del Negro scored 25 points and Sean Elliott scored 24 for the Spurs, who 
continued to play without suspended forward Dennis Rodman. Rodman passed up the 
game for a workout at a San Antonio health club. 
</P>

HARRY HORNER; DESIGNER WON 2 OSCARS, ACCOLADES IN THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Horner, performing arts designer and director who won Academy Awards for 
his work on the films "The Heiress" and "The Hustler," has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Horner died of pneumonia Monday at his home in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Oscars he won for design in 1949 and 1961, he was nominated 
for a third award for the film "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" 
</P>
<P>
 Equally at home in theater, Horner staged productions on Broadway and in Los 
Angeles. He earned a Los Angeles Drama Critics award for best stage design for 
"Idiot's Delight," which was presented in the Ahmanson Theater in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his many accolades, Horner remained a modest man. "I become fearful 
when people notice so much design," he said after earning kudos for the 
Ahmanson play. "Stage settings should be secondary. Shakespeare didn't even use 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Holic, Czechoslovakia, Horner moved to the United States in 1935, 
became an American citizen in 1940 and served with the U.S. Air Force during 
World War II. As a youth in Europe, he had earned a degree in architecture from 
the University of Vienna and another in acting from the Max Reinhardt Theater 
Company. He performed briefly as an actor in Vienna and Salzburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Horner's other films over four decades were "Our Town," "Separate 
Tables," "Born Yesterday" and "Lady Sings the Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 His theater projects included the original "Our Town" on Broadway in 1938, 
"Joy to the World" in 1948, "Little Foxes" in 1949 and, the same year, the Air 
Force's "Winged Victory." Horner designed the first revolving stage for Moss 
Hart's "Lady in the Dark" in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatile Horner also designed and directed operas such as "The Magic 
Flute" for New York's Metropolitan Opera and "Turandot" for the San Francisco 
Opera. He staged another, "David" in 1956, for the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 For television, Horner designed or directed such productions as "Four Star 
Theatre" and "Gunsmoke," and, for Canadian television, the series "Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, the former Joan Frankel; three sons, Christopher, 
Anthony and James, and two granddaughters. Services will be private. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Hospice 
Visiting Nurses' Assn., to the Harry Horner Scholarship Fund at the Society of 
Motion Picture Art Directors, or to a children's charity of the donor's choice.

GIAN MARIA VOLONTE; ACTOR IN THEATER, SPAGHETTI WESTERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italian actor Gian Maria Volonte, whose roles ranged from Shakespeare to the 
bad guy in the spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars," has died at age 61. 
</P>
<P>
 Volonte, who acted in more than 40 films in a 34-year career, was found dead 
Tuesday in his hotel room in the northern Greek town of Florina, where he was 
to appear in "The Gaze of Ulysses" by Greek director Theodoros Angelopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian news reports said Volonte was believed to have suffered a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world, not just Italy, has lost a great actor," said director Francesco 
Rosi, in whose films "The Mattei Affair" (1972), "Lucky Luciano" (1973) and 
"Christ Stopped at Eboli" (1979) Volonte played leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had extraordinary sensitivity, an enormous talent to bring out the 
personality of a character through a simple gesture, without saying a word," 
Rosi added. 
</P>
<P>
 Volonte, born into a middle-class Milan family in 1933, attended Rome's 
National School of Dramatic Art and made his theater debut in Shakespeare's 
"Romeo and Juliet" in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later he made his first film appearance with a small part in Duilio 
Coletti's "Under Ten Flags." 
</P>
<P>
 But his first major film role was in 1963 in "A Man to Burn" by Valentino 
Orsini and Paolo and Vittorio Taviani. In the film, he showed the first 
evidence of an intense realism he would bring to many roles, playing a Sicilian 
union leader who threatens to stage an uprising against the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 A militant left-winger, Volonte took part in protests during the 1960s and 
1970s and served briefly in parliament for the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as no surprise that his greatest award, the 1987 Silver Bear Award 
at the Berlin Film Festival, was for a political film, "The Moro Affair," in 
which he played Aldo Moro, the Italian Christian Democratic former prime 
minister kidnaped and killed by left wing guerrillas in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 He also won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1983 for his 
role in "The Death of Mario Ricci." 
</P>
<P>
 Volonte made his name outside Italy in the 1960s as the bad guy in Sergio 
Leone's spaghetti Westerns "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More."

ANTONIO JOBIM; COMPOSER CREATED BOSSA NOVA SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Carlos Jobim, the founding father of Brazil's bossa nova music who 
composed the world-famous song "The Girl From Ipanema," died Thursday in a New 
York hospital. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim died of heart failure at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, where he had been a 
patient since Monday. His attorney, David Grossberg, said Jobim underwent minor 
surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim, Brazil's most prominent songwriter and composer, burst onto the 
international music scene with the bossa nova sound -- a combination of jazz 
and samba -- in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Girl From Ipanema," sung by Astrid Gilberto, charmed listeners with its 
sensual rhythm and romantic lyrics. Jobim's distinctive rhythms and catchy 
melodies made bossa nova -- literally, the "new wave" -- a musical craze around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lived in Los Angeles briefly in the 1960s and again in the 1970s, 
Jobim did not make his performing debut here until 1986, when he sang and 
played piano at the Greek Theatre. He projected the image of composer rather 
than unpretentious performer, but critics called his concerts "consistently 
delightful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' late jazz critic Leonard Feather, evaluating Jobim's prolific 
output, termed his work "the gentlest, purest, least clamorous and most 
melodious music" of the 1960s rock era. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he reminded us of one hit after another," Feather wrote of a concert at 
the Wiltern Theatre, "one could only be astonished by the breadth and depth of 
his achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim's songs included "Desafinado," "One-Note Samba," "How Insensitive," 
"Wave," "Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars," and "Dindi." 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime pianist in bars and nightclubs, Jobim performed on Frank Sinatra's 
latest "Duets II" record, and had been expected to perform on the future "Duets 
III." He also recently recorded with British singer Sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim's unusual harmonies and many popular songs earned him induction into the 
Songwriters' Hall of Fame in New York in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim was born in Tijuca, a neighborhood 
of Rio de Janeiro, in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 He first played music on a piano that his parents had rented for an older 
sister. After working briefly in an architect's office, Jobim began his musical 
career in a Rio recording studio, transcribing songs by composers who were 
unable to write them down. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, he wrote his first song, samba-influenced "A Week Ago." In 1958, he 
met guitarist Joao Gilberto, with whom he would record some of the most famous 
bossa nova songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, playing the piano in Rio and heavily influenced by songwriter 
Cole Porter and jazz musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, Jobim and his 
friends began to infuse jazz with the traditional Brazilian samba sound, music 
writer Howard Mandel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That became bossa nova," he said. "It was the music that opened up Brazil as 
a modern cultural exporter." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Girl From Ipanema," recorded in 1962, was a smash hit, earning Jobim and 
U.S. jazz saxophonist Stan Getz four Grammy awards. The movie "Black Orpheus," 
for which Jobim wrote most of the soundtrack, also helped fuel the bossa nova 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 In an uncanny twist of musical fate, Getz, probably Jobim's best-known 
collaborator, was born on the same day, in the same year and at the same hour 
as Jobim. Getz died of liver cancer two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim also worked closely with Rio poet Vinicius de Moraes, who wrote the 
lyrics to "The Girl From Ipanema." 
</P>
<P>
 He recorded with Brazilian singers such as the late Elis Regina and Chico 
Buarque and first recorded with Sinatra in the 1960s.  
</P>
<P>
 Jobim last appeared in New York in April to mark the 50th anniversary of Verve 
Records at Carnegie Hall, where he performed many of his most popular songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim was married twice and had four children. He was married first in 1949 to 
Tereza Otero Ermani, with whom he had two children, Paulo and Elizabeth. In 
1978, he married Ana Beatriz Lontra, and they had two children, Jose Francisco 
and Maria Luiza Elena. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim's body was to be flown back to Brazil Thursday evening for funeral and 
burial.

MALIBU BLAZE TESTS NERVES, FIREFIGHTING PLANES; EMERGENCY: FLAMES BLAMED FOR 
FOUR MINOR INJURIES BLACKEN 100 ACRES OF CHAPARRAL. THEY OFFER A CHILLING 
REMINDER OF LAST YEAR'S DISASTER, BUT DO LITTLE REAL DAMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 No one was evacuated. Property damage was nil. And the most serious injury was 
to a woman whose Ford Explorer hit a battalion chief's Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malibu nonetheless got a sobering dose of deja vu Thursday as brush fires 
danced once again through canyons still scarred by last year's devastating 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 As gusting winds up to 50 m.p.h. sent tumbleweeds flying and knocked over 
metal trash cans, the first big fire of the season hit Latigo Canyon at 1:22 
p.m., officials said. The blaze, which blackened 62 acres of chaparral before 
it was extinguished, caused only four injuries -- all minor -- and no damage to 
the area's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for many in the rich but rugged area, it served as a chilling reminder 
of last year, when brush fires blackened 17,000 acres and destroyed 323 homes. 
Despite the addition this year of a new firefighting weapon -- two Super 
Scooper water-dropping planes leased from a Canadian company -- the flames 
immediately sparked a red alert as residents rushed to water their roofs and 
pack their cars, and television news helicopters went to live reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, an exact repeat," builder Pat Taylor, who was helping 
reconstruct a Las Flores Canyon building destroyed last year, said when his 
girlfriend warned him that the flames had crept to within a mile of his Corral 
Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 "(She) called me on the phone (at the job site)," Taylor said, "and it was 
like, here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu has never been a stranger to brush fires; some residents, in fact, were 
expecting this one. Humidity had hovered around 10% all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Adamson, whose family owns the Malibu Beach RV Park, said many of the 
families in his compound had hooked up their trailers early in the day and were 
ready to pull out at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through a lot of these over the years and we know how to prepare 
for them," he said, "but you never can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Inspector Gary Sutter said firefighters were summoned initially to 
a small blaze at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. Within 15 
minutes, the flames had covered 30 acres, he said, and the conflagration 
steadily grew as the high winds kept the Super Scoopers from flying low enough 
to accurately aim their water drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter said that although more than 50 homes are scattered throughout the 
area, no houses were damaged as the flames hopped from spot to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, smoke from the fire forced the closure for most of the afternoon of 
several local thoroughfares, including a section of the Pacific Coast Highway 
between Kanan and Malibu roads. And there were four injuries reported -- one 
from smoke inhalation, two more to firefighters and the fourth from a traffic 
accident that resulted from the massive traffic jams created by roadblocks in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said Sara Burdell, 69, of Malibu was taken to St. John's 
Hospital for treatment of minor injuries after she tried to make a U-turn to 
cut out of a traffic jam at the Pacific Coast Highway roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 As she swerved, officials said, she pulled into the path of an oncoming GMC 
Suburban truck driven by Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Dan Scott. 
Scott, who was uninjured, was heading down PCH in the center divider when the 
crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an unidentified 53-year-old transient was treated for smoke 
inhalation. Officials said a backfire set to halt the fire's advance ignited 
some magazines and books that the man had stored in trash cans near his 
encampment at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the burning papers blew across the highway, setting fire at one 
point to palm trees in front of luxury oceanfront condominiums at Tivoli Cove. 
That hot spot, however, was quickly contained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was an especially difficult one for the more than 300 firefighters 
dispatched to the scene, as the winds hampered the aerial assault from seven 
water-dropping helicopters and the two Super Scoopers. Access to fire lines was 
also impeded by the rough terrain, Sutter said. However, winds died down late 
in the afternoon, he said, and by 5 p.m., the fire was mostly contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said that the cause of the fire was under investigation, but 
that they were focusing at least initially on a downed power line. Vegetation 
was also a factor, Sutter said, noting that the fire Thursday "was in an area 
that didn't burn last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the dry Santa Ana 
winds were expected to continue into the weekend. Wind advisories were also 
posted Thursday on several transmountain and desert highways, including 
Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass and in San Diego County and U.S. 395 in San 
Bernardino and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisories cautioned against travel in high-profile vehicles such as 
campers and trailers, and motorists were warned that windblown clouds of dust 
and sand were reducing visibility to a few yards in some desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the Santa Ana condition was being generated by the circulation 
around a large high-pressure weather system centered over southern Idaho. He 
said the sporadic, gusting winds will keep pummeling Southern California until 
the system finally begins moving out to the east, probably on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair to partly cloudy weather is expected here Sunday and Monday, with mostly 
sunny weather Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 71 degrees, 
following an overnight low of 48. Relative humidity ranged from a relatively 
dry high of 49% to a low of 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total precipitation for the rainfall season -- which began July 1 -- is 0.8 of 
an inch, compared to a normal total for the date of 3.43 inches. Brack said it 
does not look as though any more rain will fall until late next week at the 
earliest.

 Lawyer about town: Robert Shapiro and the Rolling Stones -- you just can't 
keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're featured in Vanity Fair's "1994 Hall of Fame" photo spread, along 
with such worthies as TV's "Melrose Place Girls," magician David Copperfield, 
model Claudia Schiffer, actor Hugh Grant and Jimmy Carter (yes, the former 
President). 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro and the Stones were last linked up, you may recall, when an image of 
the head-bopping attorney popped up on the Rose Bowl's giant screen during a 
concert by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Vanity Fair shot, by Annie Leibovitz, the nattily attired Shapiro is 
seated in a cluttered office, with several scraps of paper on the floor. We 
thought we detected a mysterious look on his face -- related, perhaps, to a 
nearby box. It's labeled, "D A CLUE." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," cracked Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's 
office, "it's a new board game."

 Well-deserved faint praise?A few days before the election, a Diamond Bar 
assemblyman's bumper sticker was attached to a billboard that bore a radio 
station's partially finished blurb.  
</P>
<P>
 Considering the nature of the endorsement, we're not sure whether followers or 
opponents put it up. Especially since the assemblyman is Paul Horcher, who has 
since helped stalemate that body by defecting from the Republican Party and 
supporting Democrat Willie Brown for Speaker.

was introduced by Northrop Grumman Corp. on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept sounds like a ready-made bureaucratic explanation when a bus 
misses a stop. "It's a stealth bus," the MTA can tell a complaining rider. "Of 
course, you didn't see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Play poetry!While ballplayers and owners are haggling over money, broadcaster 
Vin Scully wrote the introduction to a poetry book, "It's the Most Wonderful 
Time of the Year -- A Child's First Look at Baseball," and donated all proceeds 
to charity. So did author Larry Harper and artist Brent Benger. If you've 
missed Scully's voice, he'll be signing copies at Vroman's bookstore in 
Pasadena at 2 p.m. Saturday.

 We hate to say L.A. told you so: It was a bit more than 100 years ago that a 
group of towns broke away from the comfort and security of L.A. County and 
established themselves as Orange County. Maybe if they ask nicely, we'll let 
them come back. miscelLAny We were shocked to come across "Mutant League," a 
Sunday morning cartoon show on KCOP. It's about a band of terrifying football 
players and equally terrifying spectators who wreak havoc in a stadium that is 
struck by a massive earthquake. How dare KCOP expose children to a series about 
the Raiders?

POLITICAL BRIEFING: THE LEGISLATURE HAS A WAY OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, SIGH

 UNLIKELY ALLIANCES: History was made in the state Assembly this week, and 
we're not just talking about Democratic leader Willie Brown's deft 
rabbit-from-the-hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
 The far left reached out to embrace the far right, and while the result was 
not completely warm and fuzzy, it was at least a start. 
</P>
<P>
 Following her swearing-in, Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, a Democrat representing 
Encino and West L.A., sought out one David Knowles, a Republican assemblyman 
from the Sacramento region. 
</P>
<P>
 A staunch conservative, Knowles is known for his infamous 25-minute floor 
speech in 1991 describing sexual practices of homosexuals in graphic detail. 
Kuehl is the first openly gay representative to be elected to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, wouldn't Kuehl approach Knowles with some 
trepidation? Well, no. Not the gregarious Kuehl, a law professor who may be 
remembered as the teen actress who played Zelda on "The Many Loves of Dobie 
Gillis." She wanted to give him a big hug, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He backed away and shook my hand. He appeared to be somewhat uncomfortable," 
Kuehl said afterward. "But he was extremely cordial. He said, 'I'm sure we'll 
find a way to work together.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'It's interesting to me,' " Kuehl replied, " 'the rules of civility almost 
dictate that we work together, don't they?' " 
</P>
<P>
 An even better story, Kuehl reports, was when she connected with Republican 
Assemblyman Bruce Thompson from Fallbrook, who approached her for help in 
arranging a get-together for new members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You bet! I'm great at social stuff.' He said, 'Incidentally, I'm the 
Mormon with eight children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kuehl: "Wow. When the Mormon with eight children and the lesbian get 
together to plan something, that is true bi-partisan work." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MORE UNLIKELY ALLIANCES: Also quite a distance apart on the political spectrum 
are San Fernando Valley Rep. Howard Berman and incoming House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich. But the two men found themselves in close quarters on a plane trip to 
Russia a couple of years back and their wives got to talking. 
</P>
<P>
 That marathon flight may be the reason Marianne Gingrich recently put politics 
aside and tapped Janice Berman as one of 10 members of a new GOP-sponsored 
Family Friendly Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is designed to make the House of Representatives a more compatible 
place for the many fathers and mothers serving there. Committee members held a 
meeting by conference call this week and discussed fiddling with the hours 
Congress is in session and organizing events in Washington to include spouses 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to change the culture of the House of Representatives," Janice 
Berman said. "It's not really family-friendly -- the hours, the 
unpredictability. They never give us a timetable, so you can't plan anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, more and more incoming lawmakers are opting to keep 
their families at home in the district and commute back and forth over the 
weekends. The House now meets Tuesdays through Thursdays but frequently holds 
last-minute sessions on days off, forcing out-of-town representatives to head 
back to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the U.S. Congress has been behind some innovative American businesses 
in incorporating families," Janice Berman said. "This is what good management 
is doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which will deliver its recommendations to the Speaker next 
week, is expected to propose ending Thursday sessions early enough so West 
Coast lawmakers can fly home that night, holding events for lawmakers' families 
several times a year and scheduling vacations well ahead of time so families 
can make plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more drastic ideas never made the cut -- such as Janice Berman's 
proposal that lawmakers be allowed to vote on some items from their districts 
to reduce cross-country commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, a Democratic activist and former aide to Mayor Richard Riordan, says 
serving on a body organized by the Republican majority has made her a bit 
uncomfortable. But she says congressional families are congressional families, 
no matter on which side of the aisle the lawmaker may sit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN: One person not present for the fireworks as the 
Republicans and Democrats duked it out over who would be elected Assembly 
Speaker was Pat Nolan, the former GOP assemblyman from Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, who led the charge as the Assembly's Republican Caucus leader for five 
years until a 1988 FBI raid and election losses forced him from that post, is 
viewed by some as the rightful heir to an era of Republican rule. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the one, devotees wistfully say, who worked tirelessly toward the day 
when the Grand Old Party might take over the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Nolan is now serving a federal prison sentence for political 
corruption because of his role in raking in campaign contributions. It was for 
the good of the party, not personal enrichment, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are privately saying that had Nolan still been around, he might not have 
failed to secure a Republican majority to elect the first GOP Speaker in 25 
years, as the current leadership did this week. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 GONE, BUT STILL GOVERNING: On Monday, Zev Yaroslavsky, a 19-year veteran of 
the Los Angeles City Council, was sworn in as the newest member of the County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the following day, the City Council approved a Yaroslavsky proposal to 
extend a contract for a company he hired in June, 1993, to help the owners of 
quake-damaged buildings get rebuilding aid from various city programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears Yaroslavsky can govern in two places at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote extended a $38,500 contract with P.S. Enterprises of Santa 
Monica by six months and added $47,000 to the firm's fee. The extension also 
calls on the firm to monitor a redevelopment plan for quake-wracked 
neighborhoods in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of public policy for P.S. Enterprises is Michael A. Jimenez, a 
former Yaroslavsky legislative aide and a top candidate to temporarily replace 
Yaroslavsky until a special election in April decides who the new council 
member will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez has already moved from his Santa Monica home to a rented room within 
the district in case he is appointed to the six-month post. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimenez wouldn't be able to keep the contract if appointed because city 
bylaws prohibit council members from having outside work. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SHAKE-UP: State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, moving from the Westside into the 
20th District to represent his new all-Valley territory, is stepping up his 
role as advocate for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 As the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, Rosenthal 
hopes to use his post to force opposing interests to come together to work out 
kinks in earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem is that nobody can buy or sell a home because insurance 
companies are not providing earthquake insurance -- and that's a terrible 
situation," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the Democratic state senator said he wants to bring together in 
one room the state insurance commissioner, the industry, consumers and bankers 
and, if necessary, "have everybody suffer a bit" until a solution is thrashed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also making a bid to continue the Senate's select subcommittee on the 
Northridge earthquake, a panel that was set to expire in November with the 
retirement of its then-chair, former state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys).

SPEAKING ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than city government "apologizing for the fact that English is the 
national language of Los Angeles" (Commentary, Dec. 1), I suggest that Diana 
Beard-Williams beg for forgiveness for her attack on multilingualism. 
Publishing city proposals, voting pamphlets and city notices in minority 
languages is an issue of access, not compromise.There are many immigrants who 
establish themselves in Los Angeles with a desire to participate in civic 
activities. These people, who may be proficient in English, may not have the 
grasp of the language required to understand the complex written materials in 
their second language that nonetheless have a direct effect on their community. 
As a college graduate, an English/Spanish/Korean-speaking L.A. native and the 
daughter of Korean immigrants, I often have difficulty understanding the 
nuances of city proposals and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste is not city money spent to publish written materials in several 
languages but the voices of the immigrant communities that are consistently 
ignored in the name of efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 SANDRA CHOE 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "We Speak English in L.A.; Don't Apologize" was absolutely correct. English is 
the business language of the world and it is spoken by cab drivers in Paris, 
waiters in Rome and salesclerks in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 We do a disservice to L.A. residents if we send the message that English is 
not a language they need to know. Encouraging people not to learn English will 
impede their ability to get better jobs and will make our country a weaker 
competitor in world trade.

SWEEPING AWAY A HARSH CLOUD; REACTING TO CONTROVERSY, POSTAL SERVICE WILL 
CHANGE NUCLEAR-CLOUD STAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service, asked by the White House and others to reconsider the 
controversial design of a commemorative stamp, has appropriately decided to 
abandon the mushroom-cloud image originally selected to mark the atomic 
bombings at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The stamp, one of the commemoratives scheduled to be issued next year to mark 
turning points in the war, depicted a composite of mushroom clouds created by 
the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and by postwar tests. Its caption read, 
"Atomic bombs hasten war's end, August 1945." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's factually correct that the dropping of atomic bombs ended the war 
sooner, the caption and the mushroom cloud-image were insensitive and in bad 
taste. That imageconveys such a special horror to the Japanese (more than 
200,000 were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that Tokyo complained to the 
U.S. State Department. The White House suggested that different artwork would 
adequately characterize the historic event. 
</P>
<P>
 The new design will show President Harry S. Truman, who authorized the 
bombings, as he prepared to announce the end of the war. The stamp is one of 50 
World War II commemoratives that will have been issued over five years. Next 
year's concluding "Victory at Last" series also includes stamps showing the 
U.S. flag rising over Iwo Jima and the famous photo of a sailor kissing a girl 
in Times Square on V-J Day. In 1991, a stamp captioned "Japanese bomb Pearl 
Harbor, Dec. 7" showed the battleship Arizona under attack. This too upset some 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese revulsion to the nuclear-cloud stamp is understandable. Even in 
the United States feelings about how the war was brought to an end have changed 
over the years. The shift to the Truman stamp, while still marking the 
bombings, will avoid an image that is unacceptable to many, both in the United 
States and abroad. The decision on the stamp is right.

SINGAPORE WATCH; RISKY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity poor S. R. Nathan. This loyal civil servant has the unenviable duty of 
defending Singapore's repeated outrages against freedom of expression and human 
rights.He is the island nation's ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Nathan obediently justified the flogging of an American teen-ager in 
a vandalism case that reeked of coerced confession. (Many Americans, fed up 
with juvenile crime, applauded the brutal punishment.) Now Singapore has 
started a criminal investigation of an American scholar at the National 
University of Singapore for merely writing a newspaper article about judicial 
repression in Asia -- that did not even mention Singapore.  
</P>
<P>
 The scholar, Christopher Lingle, understandably abandoned his career and 
belongings and fled Singapore. Nathan, in a letter to the New York Times, 
assures that Lingle would have "full recourse" to counsel and law in a trial. 
How comforting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan has experience in muzzling the press. Twelve years ago he was the 
government's instrument in cracking down on the Straits Times, the nation's 
main English-language newspaper, for paying too much attention to the political 
opposition. Two dozen journalists lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore sees itself as the commercial center of Southeast Asia after China 
takes control of Hong Kong in 1997. Singapore must bring its police and 
judiciary into conformity with modern norms of rudimentary legal rights and 
free expression. Until then, foreign business people must be wary about 
subjecting themselves and their families to this repressive regime.

NO RUSH IN SACRAMENTO; ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY SEEMS TO BE CAUSING FEW 
RIPPLES THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each passing day makes Sacramento's puzzling distance from Orange County's 
bankruptcy more problematic. After all, the crisis will not be confined to the 
state's third-largest county. Gov. Pete Wilson finally spoke out directly on 
the subject Thursday; while sympathetic, he did not offer much by way of 
assistance. Meanwhile, the Legislature tunes its fiddles while Orange County 
struggles to find ways to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy means that when any Orange County agency, or the county itself, 
tries to float bonds, it will face a tough sell. The taint is likely to spread 
to agencies across the state, according to Wall Street gurus. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to remember that Orange County's problems were compounded in 
recent years by the state solving its budget crises with raids on county funds. 
Unable to increase taxes under Proposition 13 and stung by plunging interest 
payments on investments, Orange County turned to risky methods of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also supplied a shovel to help the county dig its hole 15 years ago 
when the Legislature unanimously approved a bill championed by Robert L. 
Citron, who resigned this week as Orange County's treasurer-tax collector. It 
allowed localities to use the financial legerdemain that wound up plunging the 
county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature should quickly change that law, bringing California into line 
with the many other states that restrict investments by cities, counties and 
public agencies to conservative investments such as federal government bonds 
and top-rated corporate bonds.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did seem to recognize the need for state action on that front, but 
legislators -- presently squabbling over whether the Assembly Speaker is to be 
a Democrat or a Republican -- seem to be too busy to pay attention. We need 
action, not paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 How about considering speeding up state payments to Orange County to tide 
agencies over? Might the state, despite its own budget problems, guarantee 
loans? Sacramento must learn some lessons from last month's election. Govern. 
Lead. Offer help.

ANYONE REMEMBER U.N. ARTICLE 51?; THE BOSNIAN WAR MAY ONLY BE BEGINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday NATO gave its staff two days to produce a plan for the withdrawal 
of all 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia. On Thursday President Clinton 
offered U.S. ground troops to assist in the withdrawal. (The United States is 
expected to contribute about half of a combined NATO force of up to 45,000.) 
The causes of the U.N. collapse in Bosnia aside, we applaud the President's 
alacrity in offering American assistance in this grim evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 BLOOD BATH FEARED: Once the peacekeepers are gone, Serb victory may follow and 
thereafter an "ethnic cleansing" blood bath to which no outsider will be 
witness. In addition, the war may well widen before it ends. Croats are again 
fighting Serbs both in Bosnia and Croatia. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
has threatened to carry the war to Zagreb, the Croatian capital. And the war 
may not be waged by local combatants alone. On Wednesday Turkish Foreign 
Minister Murat Karayalcin said that Muslim countries are ready to provide 
troops and equipment for Bosnia when UNPROFOR leaves. A day earlier Bosnia's 
president met in Geneva behind closed doors with a new Islamic "Contact Group" 
-- Pakistan, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Malaysia, Turkey and Egypt. Some 
Muslim UNPROFOR contingents may decline to be evacuated, among them Jordan's 
(3,367) and Pakistan's (3,017), the two only slightly smaller than France's 
(4,489) and Britain's (3,405). 
</P>
<P>
 Once the United Nations has left Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council may seek to 
lift the arms embargo that has prevented Bosnia from effectively defending 
itself. Russia may use its veto to keep the embargo in place. But as respect 
for the United Nations drops to a new low, the veto may be ignored. The Islamic 
Contact Group may publicly reject it, and pressure could mount in the U.S. 
Congress to do the same. Under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, any nation has 
the right to defend itself. Watch for Article 51 to be widely invoked. 
</P>
<P>
 European antipathy to an enlarged Muslim force in Bosnia, particularly if it 
enjoyed any U.S. support, could be intense. Because of it, Russia could receive 
unexpected support for its suggestion that the Western European Union replace 
NATO (and that, by unmistakable implication, Russia replace the United States 
in European collective security). According to sources cited in the Guardian 
newspaper of London, "the (British) Government is for the first time giving 
serious consideration to alternatives to NATO." 
</P>
<P>
 TIME OF DESPERATION: The outcome of these developments is unpredictable, and 
just that makes them ominous. Because the Serb aggression aims not at 
domination but at expulsion and extermination, surrender may not be an option 
for the Muslims and Croats. But a battle to the death does not proceed like a 
forest fire burning itself out. Real people, whose fate will be known 
worldwide, are involved. No one knows what they or others reacting to their 
plight may do. Our only, hesitant advice to the Clinton Administration must be: 
Do not conduct American diplomacy as if this war were over. It may be only now 
beginning.

ORANGE COUNTY BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Orange County Files for Bankruptcy," Dec. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 The "surprise" bankruptcy of Orange County should go down as another "day of 
infamy" as our Board of Supervisors slept. 
</P>
<P>
 One should not be surprised that supervisors such as Thomas Riley and Harriett 
Wieder did not heed or understand the implications of the warnings sounded 
earlier this year. After all, these are the same supervisors who wasted $300 
million on an inadequate, noisy airport rather than investing this money for an 
intercontinental airport that both Orange and San Diego counties need and that 
could have been located at the border between the two without seriously 
impacting existing communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy they have presided over is not just financial. Our spirit is 
impoverished daily as our once-beautiful county is ground down by toll roads 
through environmentally sensitive and scenic spaces we once enjoyed so much, 
whole city areas become too dangerous to drive through, let alone walk through, 
and our health and education services are diminished by the massive onslaught 
of demanding legal and illegal immigrants and their Third World cultures. And 
our supervisors sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 They should resign. But they won't. Voters, wake up. Turn them out. Orange 
County needs change too, and if bankruptcy is not the wake-up call we needed, 
then nothing is. 
</P>

<P>
 So much can be said about this financial tragedy, but state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said it the best with her quote, "It's a shocking 
occurrence. We're going to have to look to Sacramento, to Washington and 
obviously to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the Republican cry for smaller government. Maybe now the citizens 
of this conservative bastion will appreciate how government can assist those in 
need. Or will they pay for their own bailout by themselves, without taxpayers' 
money from anywhere else? 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to watch.

<P>
 Twenty-twenty hindsight is remarkably clear. With it any damn fool can realize 
that Robert L. Citron made a mistake in September, 1993, when he told the Board 
of Supervisors that interest rates should not rise for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 It should have been apparent to any damn fool that the combination of the 
Reagan deficit and the Clinton economic expansion would create a situation 
where interest rates would have to rise. However, none of the members of the 
Board of Supervisors who received Citron's erroneous report made any objection. 
All they said was, "Bob, that's very interesting. Keep up the good work."

BORED WITH LAW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have never experienced as visceral a response to a commentary as I did to 
Cameron Kenny's "Hey, Have You Heard the One About the Lawyer?" (Nov. 24). 
Although Kenny has been privileged with great opportunities, the only thing she 
seems to be thankful for is the freedom to express sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 In case anyone needs to be reminded, many talented people have attended and 
enjoyed law school, and then gone on to become productive members of the legal 
profession and the community. Although lawyer-bashing has become all too 
prevalent, it is worth noting that many of the most prominent and gifted 
members of our society have been lawyers. These individuals have led our 
country, served the poor, battled for the defenseless and have tried to protect 
our civil liberties, many of which remain threatened today. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have hoped that Kenny would not have so quickly forgotten the plight 
of the women who preceded her, having valiantly battled for the rights she now 
enjoys. Moreover, at a time when many worthy students are denied the 
opportunity to receive higher education and student loans are at a premium, I 
regret that such valuable resources appear to have been wasted on Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 The message from Kenny's commentary is not about law school or lawyering, it 
is about taking responsibility for one's actions and being grateful for the 
opportunity to freely pursue one's goals. After all, many lawyers have given of 
themselves to ensure these freedoms. 
</P>

<P>
 Small wonder with a reason no more compelling than boredom that Kenny found 
law school disappointing. Lacking purpose and direction seldom yields a 
different result. 
</P>
<P>
 After being physically assaulted stopping an ongoing child abuse, I was 
appalled at the lack of recourse available to similar victims. Wanting to make 
a difference, I chose law school. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in my second year at Western State Law School, law still fascinates me. I 
clerk exclusively for Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer, one of our 
country's top DNA prosecutors at the Santa Ana DA's office. Interactions with 
our county's best line against crime and world-renowned FBI forensic experts 
exceed my expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The law deals with factual reality; fine-tuning one's ability to present each 
side in the best possible light.  
</P>
<P>
 I wish her success as a comedy writer for the selfish reason that it would be 
a travesty and great disservice to the general public, the very people she 
should have gone to law school to help, for her to represent anyone in any 
capacity.

'PROVISIONAL' BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am responding to the letter from Christopher Ward (Dec. 5) regarding 
"widespread voter fraud" allegations. I do not believe Ward's vote was counted 
and it certainly cannot be considered as "fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 My instructions as a precinct officer were that if a potential voter's name 
does not appear in our records, we issue a ballot in an envelope marked 
"Provisional." The voter then signs the envelope, not the record book.  
</P>
<P>
 "Provisional envelopes" are submitted to the registrar of voters for checking. 
If they find no proof of prior registration, these ballots are destroyed and 
are not a part of the total count. I have been a precinct officer for over 10 
years and have never seen any evidence of fraud -- in this last election or any 
other.

PERSPECTIVE ON NATO; DON'T PROVOKE A NEW COLD WAR; RUSSIA UNDERSTANDABLY VIEWS 
A U.S.-BACKED PLAN TO ADMIT STATES FROM EAST AND CENTRAL EUROPE AS THREATENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN SCHWARZ, Benjamin Schwarz is a foreign-policy analyst in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. decision to expand NATO eastward may drag America into a new Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 The American move to include the states of east-central Europe in NATO's ranks 
was made largely in response to what U.S. officials see as a dangerous 
development -- a more assertive, less cooperative Russia. Russians see this 
neo-containment strategy differently. They acknowledge that from Washington's 
perspective the American-Russian "partnership" has deteriorated, as is evident 
in disagreements over Bosnia and other matters. But they would point out, with 
considerable justification, that the American idea of a partnership is one in 
which the junior partner -- Moscow -- accepts the preferences and the economic 
and political beliefs of the senior one -- Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has discovered that this kind of partnership means that it is not 
allowed to assert its national interests in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere 
without being portrayed as an unstable threat to global peace. In this context, 
eschewing such a partnership is understandable and hardly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 But expanding NATO -- a military alliance organized and dominated by the 
United States -- is dangerous. The Cold War ended with the dissolution of the 
Warsaw Pact and the breakup of the Soviet Union. Moscow agreed to quit eastern 
Europe and to allow German unification -- a development that, given the history 
of German-Russian relations in the 20th Century, Moscow regarded with 
trepidation. Moreover, Russia acceded to the continued existence of an alliance 
that had been hostile to it and even agreed to the inclusion of the newly 
unified Germany in that alliance. In return, Russia received assurances from 
the United States and its allies that they would not take advantage of this 
situation to tip the geopolitical balance, thus potentially threatening its 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia sees it, the United States has reneged on this bargain. Of course, 
U.S. policy-makers argue that no democratic government in Russia could regard 
the enlargement of America's sphere of influence in east-central Europe as a 
hostile act and that only authoritarian Russians could harbor suspicions about 
NATO's intentions. Furthermore, if such Russians came to power, so this 
thinking goes, the United States would be justified in transforming NATO into 
an instrument of a new containment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who make these arguments assume that if the United States regards the 
expansion of NATO as a benign act, Russia has an obligation to view matters the 
same way. Any deviation from that "proper" perspective is evidence of faulty 
thinking, or worse, evil intent. 
</P>
<P>
 But across the political spectrum, Russians have good reasons to worry about 
an enlarged NATO. In the post-Cold War era, NATO remains a military alliance 
with impressive capabilities. Even Russians who are not closet aggressors are 
anxious about having such a powerful military association perched on their 
borders. They wonder, for example, what NATO's response might be if Moscow 
opposed Western policy toward the former Yugoslavia, or toward Ukraine, where 
Russia has longstanding ethnic ties and other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 An enlarged NATO bloc would, at the very least, be an intimidating presence. 
It would guarantee that Russia would have little choice but to go along with 
the alliance's policy preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Any great power would chafe at such constraints and the humiliating 
subordination they symbolize. To place the matter in perspective, imagine what 
the U.S. response would be if a Russian-led Warsaw Pact, heretofore confined to 
eastern Europe, decided to exploit a temporarily weakened American position by 
incorporating western Europe and Canada into an enlarged alliance. America 
would interpret this action as an encirclement strategy. We should not expect 
Russia to view an expanded NATO any differently. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO expansion, as its advocates acknowledge, is a means to preserve and 
consolidate America's military and political leadership in Europe. But Russia, 
a European power, must be a significant player in the continent's international 
politics and should not be excluded from the councils of Europe, as will be 
inevitable if the U.S.-led NATO becomes the dominant security organization on 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has thus advocated that, in the post-Cold War era, Europe's security 
not be tied to Cold War institutions but to broader organizations, such as the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now known as the Organization 
of Cooperation and Security in Europe), in which Russia plays an important, 
though not dominant, role. Why, Moscow legitimately asks, must Europe's 
security remain the responsibility of an organization run by a superpower 
across the Atlantic? 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five years ago, the French commentator J.J. Servan Schreiber defined 
America's role in Europe: "When a nation bears the responsibility for the 
military security and the economic stability of a geographic zone, that nation 
is in fact -- whether it wants it or not -- the head of an empire." Whatever 
America's motivations, for the United States to expand its imperial role in 
Europe cannot help but alarm Russia and thus create an enemy where none now 
exists.

THINK OF THE MIAMI SUMMIT AS A GIANT ROTARY MEETING OF THE AMERICAS; TRADE: 
GATT AND NAFTA HAVE PERSUADED LATIN AMERICA THAT THE UNITED STATES IS SERIOUS 
ABOUT ECONOMIC COOPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Frank del Olmo is deputy editor of The Times' editorial 
pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom in the U.S. news media regards presidential summits as 
little more than glorified photo opportunities. Even we journalistic policy 
wonks who write for the editorial pages tend to share that somewhat cynical 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the meeting President Clinton will hold in Miami this weekend with 
the 33 other elected leaders of North and South America will surely have its 
share of carefully staged "photo ops," the pictures that result this time will 
be notably different than those shot in 1967, when the last hemispheric summit 
was held at Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, there won't be any military uniforms on the dais. For the first 
time, every government at a Western Hemisphere summit will be represented by a 
civilian. Cuba's increasingly anachronistic leader Fidel Castro wasn't invited, 
obviously. He wasn't invited to Punta del Este, either. But some of the 
"democratic" leaders President Lyndon Johnson met with in 1967 -- like 
Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner and Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza -- were not a 
whole lot better than Castro. They weren't Marxists, however, which is all that 
counted during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, for the first time since World War II, the Western Hemisphere's 
leaders will meet without any external threats -- and the attendant "security 
issues" -- to deflect them from the far more important issue that Clinton has 
put at the top of the agenda: closer economic cooperation in the Americas. In 
effect, this will be less a political gathering than a business meeting. Kind 
of a high-level Rotary convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, economic cooperation is no stranger to summits. But this time, the 
Latin American leaders, most of them elected on promises of national 
prosperity, are primed to do something about opening up trade. The debut this 
year of the North American Free Trade Agreement and, more recently, the U.S. 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, gives Clinton a strong 
hand to take into the meetings. By signing onto NAFTA and GATT, the United 
States proved it is not just going to sermonize against protectionism but is 
willing to live by free-trade rules that give other countries the same access 
to our home market that we want to theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time ever, the other countries in the hemisphere agree with 
us. All are opening their economies to outside investment and lining up for the 
chance to sign onto an expanded NAFTA or other regional trade pacts, such as 
Mercosur, which covers Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of protectionist trade policies and statist economic plans that 
led even wealthy nations like Argentina to fiscal disaster, a new generation of 
Latin American political leaders has come to the fore. They not only believe in 
free markets and open economies; they have pinned their political futures on 
them. I refer here not just to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo or his 
predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who studied economics at Ivy League 
universities, but even to home-bred leaders like Argentina's Carlos Saul Menem. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this anecdote from Peter Hakim, the president of the Inter-American 
Dialogue, a forum of business, professional and political leaders from 
throughout the hemisphere. At a meeting with some leaders of the guerrilla 
movement that nearly toppled the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador in the 
1980s, Hakim asked what the former rebels wanted from the United States. 
Investment, they replied. Just a few years earlier, these former Marxists were 
targeting every U.S. link, from the embassy to soft-drink distributors, and 
running their capitalist countrymen out of their homeland at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I am not suggesting that the Miami summit will mark the dawn of an 
economic millennium for the Western Hemisphere. El Salvador, to cite just one 
case, still has monumental problems to resolve in the aftermath of its bloody 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 And so does the United States. Nasty gestures of anti-foreign sentiment, like 
California's vote in favor of Proposition 187, or the opposition to NAFTA and 
GATT by political dingbats like Ross Perot, are sad proof that the increasing 
cultural and economic integration between Latin and Anglo America won't be 
smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's inevitable, as any of those neatly tailored suits gathering for 
the summit photo ops in Miami could tell you. Opening doors is just too darn 
good for business.

LET'S GET OUR CHILDREN OFF THE CHEMICAL TREADMILL

Defense Council's public health program.

<P>
 Cancer among baby boomers is rising and may be linked to environmental 
hazards, according to a federal study. Whatever this means for adults, the 
meaning will be amplified for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1940, the annual U.S. production of synthetic organic chemicals has 
increased nearly 100-fold. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
more than 3.5 billion pounds of toxic chemicals are released directly into the 
air, surface water, land or underground injection wells each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most toxic chemicals exert multiple effects. Many are highly persistent in the 
environment and in our bodies. We know that 390 compounds cause cancer, yet 
most of these are not well-tested. 
</P>
<P>
 A disturbing body of data is also developing about the ability of these 
substances to disrupt the human endocrine system. Adverse effects can include 
reduced male sperm count, testicular atrophy and infertility. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more study and debate do we need? The release of massive quantities 
of chemicals into homes, and workplaces is not good for our health. Already we 
may be seeing the consequences in our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer is now the No. 1 disease killer of children from late infancy through 
early adulthood. The overall incidence of childhood cancer has been increasing, 
particularly brain and nervous system cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they eat more food, drink more water and breathe more air as a 
percentage of their body weight than adults, children receive a greater dose of 
whatever chemicals are present in the air, food or water. A significant report 
by the National Academy of Sciences clearly demonstrated that children receive 
greater doses of pesticides in food than adults, a fact ignored by the current 
federal regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal legislation to better protect our children from pesticides in the food 
supply would be an important start. But ultimately, we must get off this 
chemical treadmill.

TO MICHAEL HUFFINGTON: YOU LOST, MOVE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TUROVSKY, Ronald B. Turovsky is a lawyer who has represented 
Feinstein's campaigns. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you do if you spend $30,000.000 of your own money on a Senate race and 
lose? If you're Michael Huffington, you whine. It has been about a month since 
election night, and Huffington has yet to concede defeat. His original excuse 
for his boorish behavior was that there were 700,000 absentee votes that had 
not been counted, so, behind by 123,000 votes, it was premature to call the 
race. When Dianne Feinstein's lead stretched to more than 160,000, his excuse 
became alleged widespread voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument was asserted in court already and rejected when the judge found 
no credible evidence of any fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also an logic loop in Huffington's argument that he lost because 
illegal immigrants came out to vote against Proposition 187 and also voted 
against him. A lot of good they did, given the vote on Proposition 187. These 
illegal immigrants who cost Huffington the election obviously split their 
ticket, since Gov. Wilson -- a true friend of illegal immigrants -- won. 
</P>
<P>
 If Huffington's plan is to take this to the Senate, the outcome would be the 
same. The GOP may be feeling haughty; they have a majority. But they will not 
intervene on this one. Given the number by which Feinstein won, if the Senate 
were to seat Huffington, there would be civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's arguments will go nowhere. So why not let him go on with his 
quixotic nonsense and say, "So what?" To start with, he is calling into 
question our democratic process. His fundamental argument is that it is simple 
to breach the system and steal elections. If people truly believe him, they 
will inevitably question whether our electoral system works and wonder why they 
should participate at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he would not concede until the absentees were counted and show 
that Feinstein had won. When he won the primary, he predicted, come November 
Feinstein would have to call him senator". The absentees are counted, and 
Feinstein has won. It is time for Huffington to call her Senator.

 Knox said an MRI exam of linebacker Joe Kelly's injured knee showed no tear, 
and he's expected to be ready for Sunday's game. . . . Knox won't make a 
determination until Sunday on defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (ankle), who was 
held out of practice. If Jones isn't ready to play, David Rocker is a candidate 
to start, along with Gerald Robinson and rookie Brad Ottis. MIKE REILLEY

 A group of Tampa fans behind the Buccaneers' bench, unhappy with the team's 
4-9 record, has been tough on Coach Sam Wyche recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "You remember your first beer, don't you?" Wyche said of the hecklers."These 
guys are reliving their childhood. There are eight of them now (behind the 
bench). A guy who sits behind them called in on my weekly radio show and said: 
A. They're drunk. B. When you make a first down, they go berserk, just like 
they do when you have to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They memorized their one chant, and it they don't repeat it often enough, 
they'll forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 And what chant is that? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jimmy Johnson chant," Wyche said. "But some of them are chanting, 'Jimmy 
Jackson."'MIKE REILLEY

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; CLIPPERS BLEW CHANCE FOR NBA IMMORTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring immortality in the face, the Clippers blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently locked into a rendezvous with a destiny that seemed to have been 
waiting for them since Donald T. Sterling first met Danny Manning, or since 
Sterling heard of professional basketball, the Clippers did the improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 They won. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told 'em, 'Bring your cameras. When you get it done, when you get that 
monkey off your back, it'll be the ugliest and the biggest and there won't be 
enough bananas to feed it, so get out of its way,' " Coach Bill Fitch said 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fitch's players forgot their cameras, it's OK. Everyone else brought 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clipper players mobbed Pooh Richardson, and the crowd of about 4,500, 
pumped up to 6,433 for the official announcement, screamed like 45,000, five 
minicam crews danced around the fringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper coaches and players, mostly recent arrivals, are innocents in this 
play, which is more about Sterling's front office, but they were the ones who 
had been forced to shoulder the ridicule. The Donald could multiply their pay 
by 10 and still not be even. 
</P>
<P>
 The first four weeks of the season were their nightmare. Wednesday was their 
Game 7 of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," said Harold Ellis, asked if he had been through anything similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere. I had a little league football team, we forfeited one, lost six and 
tied three. But we did have that one. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Teams had gone through bad times but at least the record-smashing 9-73 76ers 
of 1972-73 didn't have to put up with smart-aleck anchors on ESPN. In the era 
of 500 channels, ridicule weighs heavily on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told the guys, 'If reading the papers bothers you, don't read 'em. If 
watching TV or listening to the radio bothers you -- just don't let that extra 
baggage that goes with something like this get too heavy for you,' " Fitch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this might cut a few things out of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Malik Sealy says he quit reading the paper when he was in high school. He 
still catches a glimpse of TV here and there, but lately he has been careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might catch some highlights, but when they start talking about us, I turn 
it off," Sealy said. "I might catch some college highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say they needed this night badly. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Bucks, losers of eight in a row. One could say the Clippers beat a 
road-weary team, tottering into its fourth game in five nights, but the Bucks 
are also one of the NBA's promising young franchises, with several fine young 
players and one budding superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody coming in here is going to think the same thing," said Coach Mike 
Dunleavy before the game. "You don't want to be the first to be beaten by the 
Clippers, but we can't think about that. We need a win desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wednesday was desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers led by 13 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks went on a 10-0 run at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers opened it up to 81-72 midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks closed to 88-85 in the closing seconds, then tied the score when 
Glenn Robinson, the budding superstar, rebounded his own missed 10-footer, took 
the ball out to the three-point line and canned one from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers led, 94-92, in the last 30 seconds of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson got caught up in the air, passed up a wide-open 15-footer to tie, 
lost the ball . . . and saw teammate Marty Conlon pick it up in the lane, score 
and draw a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in here, the gods must have decided they were tired of torturing the 
Clippers. Conlon missed the free throw. Richardson turned a busted play at the 
Clipper end into the dramatic game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers may not be the best team that ever came down the pike, but at 
least they wouldn't make any history this night. They deserved that much, at 
least.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V CHAMPIONSHIP; NEWPORT HARBOR VS. 
SERVITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RECORDS--Newport Harbor (13-0), Servite (11-2). 
</P>
<P>
 SITE--Orange Coast College, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 TV--Orange County NewsChannel, 7:30 p.m. Dimension Cable in South Orange 
County will show replays, the first being Monday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 SERVITE--The Friars are playing in their first section championship game since 
1983, when they defeated La Puente Bishop Amat for their second consecutive 
championship. Servite's history includes the likes of NFL players Steve 
Beuerlein and Derek Brown. Servite's best running back this season is David 
Bedard, who rushed for 168 yards and three touchdowns to help propel the Friars 
beat El Toro, 34-19, in the semifinals. Bedard has rushed for 1,100 yards and 
scored 28 touchdowns. Frank Patti, who has 803 yards rushing, and Marvin Smith, 
who has 496 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns, complement Bedard in the 
backfield. Quarterback David Martin, who has completed 46% of his passes for 
990 yards, will try to keep Newport Harbor's defense honest. Martin has thrown 
10 touchdown passes with only six interceptions, and he will need to be 
mistake-free for the Friars to succeed. Tony McCanta is one of Servite's best 
defenders, leading a unit that posted three consecutive shutouts before last 
week's semifinal victory. 
</P>
<P>
 NEWPORT HARBOR--The Sailors, winningest team in the school's 64-year history 
of playing varsity football, are seeking the school's first section football 
championship. Comebacks and close games are their signature. Last week in 
overtime, it took a fourth-down one-yard touchdown run by Brian Johnson to give 
the Sailors a 13-10 victory over Foothill. Coach Jeff Brinkley led Newport 
Harbor to the Division IV title game in 1992, but Irvine won, 30-8. As 
sophomores, linebacker Dan McDonough and nose guard Bill Johns played in that 
game. Now, McDonough, who has 118 tackles, and Johns, who has 13 sacks, lead a 
defensive unit that has given up only 10 points per game. Johnson, who has 
rushed for 983 yards, and Edon Kagasoff and Jeremy Mason have combined for more 
than 1,900 yards rushing and 22 touchdowns. Quarterback John Giordani has 
completed 53% of his passes for 1,348 yards and 16 touchdowns with eight 
interceptions. An effective night from Giordani would prevent Servite from 
stuffing the run with an eight-man front. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY TO THE GAME--This game will be a physical, no-nonsense contest. Both teams 
have strong defenses and running games, so the passing game could be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSENSUS--Pick tradition over destiny, the Friars will wear down the Sailors 
in a close one.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CAPISTRANO VALLEY GETS LIFT FROM FRESHMEN, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They are unbeaten teams with high hopes. And the season is still in its 
embryonic stages for them. But they met Thursday in the semifinals of the South 
Coast Holiday Classic at University High, and Capistrano Valley showed it might 
be a little better than anyone thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored a 48-36 victory over University, advancing to Saturday's 
championship against Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars got 15 points and 13 rebounds from senior Jennifer Garrett, but 
the play of freshmen Sarina Kissell and Elizabeth Fleming was critical. Kissell 
scored 13 points, had 11 rebounds and four steals, and Fleming had eight points 
and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the freshmen to play well to be competitive," Capistrano Valley Coach 
Pete Belanto said. "(Kissell) played about as well as she could play." 
</P>
<P>
 An common problem with an inexperienced team, such as the Cougars (3-0), is 
turnovers, and they committed 28 of them -- 22 in the first half. They trailed 
at halftime, 20-19, but Garrett scored six of her 15 points in the third 
quarter as the Cougars took a 34-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 University (2-1) is also young, but the Trojans had 27 turnovers and shot only 
29% from the field (14 of 48). 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Heather Snavely had 14 points and six steals, but her supporting cast 
of freshmen didn't match Capistrano Valley's: Natasha Combs had nine points and 
Monique Mathews had six. MARTIN HENDERSON

CRENSHAW RALLIES TO BEAT SANTA ANA VALLEY, 88-80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since it has lost only four times in its gym since 1970, it's not often Los 
Angeles Crenshaw finds itself trailing late in a boys' basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cougars had to stage a tremendous late rally to hold off Santa Ana 
Valley, which had a 10-point lead going into the fourth quarter, but ultimately 
fell, 88-80, Thursday at Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar forward Ronnie Arch was the catalyst, scoring 24 of his game-high 35 
points in the second half. He scored 16 in the fourth quarter, including two 
three-pointers. Raymond Palmer added 14 for Crenshaw (5-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the Falcons (3-2) was forward Ike Harmon, who had 31 points and 13 
rebounds. Olujimi Mann added 16 points but fouled with 6:36 to play. Mann was 
one of three Falcons to foul out, but his loss hurt the most because he handled 
Crenshaw's full-court press well. 
</P>
<P>
 No one missed him more than Harmon, who managed nine points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had (the game)," said Harmon, who also blocked five shots. "But we've got 
to show we have more than two players." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley Coach Rich Prospero said he was pleased by the effort despite 
28 turnovers. The Falcons, in turn forced 26 Crenshaw turnovers primarily using 
full-court pressure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we represented ourselves and Orange County real well," Prospero 
said. "No one has more (championship basketball) banners than these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Willie West, who has three players back from last year's State 
champion, knew he got a better game than he expected. "But we've been behind in 
games before," West said. "In that fourth quarter, I wanted to see what we were 
made of. We still don't have a real leader; just a bunch of guys who will play 
hard."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DEBACLE PRODUCES MIXED REACTION OF PANIC SELLING, 
BARGAIN SHOPPING; WALL STREET: MORE THAN 50% OF THE 100 LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED 
O.C. STOCKS FELL. NEARLY 25% GAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's financial debacle produced a mixed bag of winners and losers 
Thursday on Wall Street, with investors shopping for municipal bond bargains 
and bond insurers betting that a windfall of new business would outpace their 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A construction company watched its stock price drop after announcing that 
funding of a toll road it is building might be jeopardized. But a real estate 
investment trust's stock recovered when it assured investors that its fortunes 
are not tied to the county's $18.5-billion investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, Orange County-based businesses said their stocks 
-- and more importantly, their operations -- were so far unaffected by the 
county's filing for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 100 largest publicly traded corporations based in Orange 
County had lower stock prices Thursday, while nearly a quarter gained in price. 
The rest were unchanged. The modest losses, however, appeared unrelated to the 
bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of computer maker AST Research Inc. in Irvine, for instance, were down 
$1.13 to close at $14.75, and Costa Mesa drug maker ICN Pharmaceuticals' stock 
dropped $1.25 to close at $17. But Landmark Bank of La Habra saw its shares 
increase 75 cents to close at $9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to quite a few business customers and they don't seem overly 
concerned," said David McCoy, executive vice president of Southern California 
Bank, the largest county-based bank with more than $400 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies were indeed feeling the heat from their Orange County ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Granite Construction Inc. of Watsonville dropped 12.7% after it 
announced that part of the bond paying for a San Joaquin Hills toll road 
project, on which it is a major contractor, was invested in the county pool run 
by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is reacting to the Draconian scenario in which construction would 
stop permanently in the middle of next year. We think that is unlikely," said 
Michael Lawson, a spokesman for the contractor. "We let our investors know that 
although the transportation agency invested with Citron, we have not gotten a 
work stoppage order." 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Granite, a company that gained notoriety for demolishing sections of 
the quake-damaged Golden State Freeway earlier this year, closed down $2.63 at 
$18 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Irvine Apartment Communities real estate investment trust, which lost 
nearly 5% of its value Wednesday on rumors that it was linked to the 
bankruptcy, saw a rebound on Thursday. Its shares regained 4.3% to close at 
$15.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some panic selling" Wednesday, said Dick Moran, chief financial 
officer. "Today, Wall Street realized that the effect was more on governments 
and not so much on private companies. We think the panic was momentary and it 
seemed to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts seemed satisfied, too. "They told us they were free and clear" from 
Orange County's troubles "and we have to take their word on that," said Cathy 
Creswell, an analyst who follows Irvine Apartment Communities for Alex. Brown & 
Sons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market remained poised again Thursday for any panic selling by 
worried bondholders, but as in previous days, few sales materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have heard of a lot of bids out there today but no trades taking place," 
said Rich Ciccarone, director of municipal research for Kemper Securities in 
Chicago. Potential buyers were offering bids as low as 48% below the previous 
trading value of the bonds, but bondholders were staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have seen is very sophisticated buyers saying that if things get out 
of hand, call me," said W. Peck Ferrin, chief municipal bond trader for Bank of 
America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County trouble was expected to give a boost to bond insurers, those 
companies that provide protection against payment defaults for public agencies 
that issue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cathey, spokesman for the bond insurer Ambac Inc. in New York, said the 
Orange County bond crisis could expose his firm to potential losses of $17 
million, but the new business could far outweigh the payout. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a silver lining for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are going to demand higher security when they buy municipal bonds, 
he said, and that will cause more public agencies to see insurers to boost 
their ratings.

INTEL CONFIRMS PLANS TO BUILD $2.2-BILLION CHIP PLANT IN OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intel Corp. made it official Thursday: It will build what may become the most 
expensive computer chip factory in the world in this Portland suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the $2.2-billion project began leaking this summer as the company 
prepared to ask Washington County for a tax break to build the semiconductor 
manufacturing and development center. 
</P>
<P>
 But official approval of the project was delayed by executives at Intel 
headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-acre company campus and plant may be the most expensive single 
expansion project ever undertaken by a U.S. company, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to build plants in Austin, 
Tex., costing more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel engineers will use the Hillsboro facility to develop new generations of 
faster, more powerful chips to succeed the industry-standard Pentium, being 
challenged by competitors such as the PowerPC microprocessor.

ART REVIEWS; REVISITING SOME STRIKING COBRA PIECES

<TEXT>
<P>
 "CoBrA Revisited," at Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, features paintings, drawings and 
prints produced over a 40-year span by artists once associated with this 
post-war European movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1948 as one of the many splinter groups of the international 
Surrealist movement, CoBrA (whose name is derived from Co penhagen, Br ussels 
and A msterdam) lasted a scant three years, before evolving into the Movement 
for an Imaginist Bauhaus, which itself eventually transmuted into the 
better-known (if equally doomed) Situationist International. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinating historically -- especially when counter-posed to the monolithic 
"triumph of American painting," which occurred at the same moment -- this 
parade of overlapping, decomposing, European avant-gardes boasts very 
interesting work. The most important member of CoBrA, Asger Jorn, is an obscure 
figure in this country. His paintings conjure up those of Jackson Pollock in 
terms of their masses of color and nervous doodling; his tendency toward a 
perverse ornamentalism, however, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jorn, Corneille is rarely exhibited here, though he is currently enjoying 
a renaissance in Europe. His obsessively patterned surfaces and faux naivete 
suggest Dubuffet crossed with Peter Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more familiar are Karel Appel and Pierre Alechinsky. The former's 
exuberant canvases are remarkably consistent, whether paint is pulled over the 
surface, as thick and delicious as taffy, or whether the surface is composed of 
a patchwork of brightly colored pieces of felt. Alechinsky is amply 
represented, and offers the stand-out works: a series of antique stock 
certificates overlaid with calligraphic flourishes, which reconcile Conceptual 
art with unrepentant decoration and feel wonderfully, surprisingly new.

 L.A. Abstraction: A diverse array of paintings, drawings, collages and prints 
by Lorser Feitelson (1898-1978) and John McLaughlin (1898-1976) at Tobey C. 
Moss Gallery outlines important connections and differences between the two Los 
Angeles abstractionists. This historically minded exhibition is most engaging, 
however, in its presentation of rarely seen pieces -- curious experiments the 
artists undertook and rejected, as they struggled to discover their mature, 
signature styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earliest works, McLaughlin and Feitelson clearly crossed paths. Two 
small paintings from 1949 look as if they belong to the other artist's oeuvre: 
McLaughlin uncharacteristically explored colors and curves, and Feitelson 
limited his picture to straight lines and a black-and-white palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of McLaughlin's inquisitiveness abound. A compact still life from 
1946 reveals the magnitude of his leap to non-representational images in the 
mid-1950s. An actual tabletop from 1959, painted in a clunky, computer-graphics 
pattern, and an all-over, interlocking pink-and-green gouache from 1960 reveal 
two approaches he momentarily flirted with, but wisely did not pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Feitelson is the more consistent, less inventive artist. Early 
sketches containing figure studies and preliminary designs for larger linear 
compositions suggest that his abstract canvases are meant to be seen in 
relation to bodies twisting and turning in space. 
</P>
<P>
 A single, vertically oriented stripe painting from 1953 stands out as 
Feitelson's quirkiest work. Its odd combinations of burgundy, lavender, orange 
and lime green bands create a queasy, aggressive rhythm absent from his more 
graceful paintings of curved forms and flowing lines. Unlike McLaughlin, whose 
minimal paintings break free of their sources, Feitelson's images refer back to 
their roots, suggesting similarities to popular graphic designs.

 Orange County may be financially bankrupt, but the local arts organizations -- 
never much dependent on governmental largess in this bastion of conservative 
culture -- remain essentially unaffected. So far. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night it was business as usual at the crowded Performing Arts 
Center, where Carl St.Clair led his ever-responsive Pacific Symphony in a tough 
and taut program of Russian music. Everyone seemed happy. No one passed a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with the gusty thrust of Shostakovich's "Festival Overture," 
written in 1954 to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. 
The evening ended with the picturesque theatrics of Stravinsky's "Firebird" -- 
the suite, thank goodness, not the whole ballet score. At concerto time, 
violinist Robert McDuffie surveyed the passion and poetry of the Prokofiev 
Second, finding the latter element more rewarding than the former. 
</P>
<P>
 The central attraction turned out to be Mussorgsky's -- well, sort-of 
Mussorgsky's -- macabre "Night on Bald Mountain." The inspired composer, 
technically something of a primitive, left no definitive version of his 
symphonic fantasy for posterity. This has prompted numerous helping hands to 
muck about with the orchestration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rimsky-Korsakov provided the lush, so-called standard version, but most 
musicologists now question its fidelity to the composer's rough and unready 
intentions. Leopold Stokowski provided his own Technicolored revision for 
"Fantasia," and other orchestral editions have been provided by Vissarion 
Shebalin, Rene Leibowitz and Gottfried von Einem. The current record catalogue 
lists at least two CD mementos of Mussorgky's "original version," not to 
mention Alan Wiltshire's arrangement for brass and percussion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bad old days, it was generally felt that the composer needed all the 
boosting he could get. Charles O'Connell put it quaintly in "The Victor Book of 
Overtures, Tone Poems and Other Orchestral Works." "Mussorgsky," he wrote, "was 
so vacillating in his original conception of this music, and at times thought 
of inserting such fantastically unreasonable ideas, that the suspicion arises 
he may have been under the influence of drugs (as he often was) when he wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodness gracious. 
</P>
<P>
 Mussorgsky's muse was protected on Wednesday by Daniel Lochrie, a clarinetist 
with the Nashville Symphony who chose "A Night on Bald Mountain" as the subject 
of his doctoral thesis at Ohio State. The resulting reconstruction, which was 
receiving its first performance on this occasion, is well crafted, lucid and 
scholarly. It incorporates relatively unfamiliar melodic material here and 
there (including a mushy cello chorale at the end), avoids slam-dunk 
repetitions and restores harmonic clashes that Rimsky may have found too 
progressive (or may have deemed mistakes). 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations aren't exactly earth-shattering. Given the perverse vagaries 
of authenticity, Lochrie's work cannot be called definitive. Most of the time 
it sounds doggedly familiar. Still, it is bright, reasonably brash, 
historically sound and perfectly effective on its own limited terms. That 
should be enough for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochrie, incidentally, was not present to take a bow at the premiere. 
According to reliable sources, he was home playing in the pit for a 
"Nutcracker" gig. 'Tis the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair and his charges scaled the "Bald Mountain" with imposing bravado, 
even if they could only approximate the granitic force we have come to expect 
from a bona- fide Russian orchestra. They mustered plenty of festive pizazz on 
behalf of Shostakovich and the triumph of communism, and they lavished all 
manner of romantic indulgence (perhaps a bit too much) on Stravinsky's 
incendiary fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffie, the Prokofiev protagonist, projected restrained ardor in the dark 
allegro of the G-minor Concerto, and made an exquisite reverie of the 
long-lined andante. Although he missed some of the wild bravura one wants in 
the rondo finale, his taste and technique were never in question. 
</P>
<P>
 For an anachronistic encore, the visiting virtuoso added "Amazing Grace," 
solo. Ask not why.

ART REVIEW; 'LAYERED': PURPOSEFULLY DESPERATELY SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new show at the Santa Monica Museum of Art is called "The Layered Look: 
Towards an Aesthetic of Accumulation Among Six Los Angeles Artists." In 
addition to being too long, that title sounds a little odd for an art 
exhibition. It evokes the world of fashion and the shameless 
self-aggrandizement that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential viewers may rest assured the handle is ironic to the point of 
hostility. This exhibition is about desperation. The French call it de sespoir 
, which literally means "without hope." Naturally such a state of despair 
requires a light touch to give it the proper aura of pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 First you must select flimsy materials that bespeak the crumbly and fleeting 
nature of all humanity's attempts to perpetuate itself beyond its mortal 
compass. Doug Hammett gets right down to it by making architectural moldings 
out of cake frosting. These works, generically titled "Finger Licks," evoke 
classic architecture from Greek temples to Mayan pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit of a wonder that Hammett would pick on some of the rare human 
structures that actually endured. It's as if he wants to make fun of himself 
making fun of the human impulse to immortality. It's a double-take that 
minimizes the work's overt Dadaist cynicism and makes it kind of cute. 
</P>
<P>
 The cute syndrome is endemic to this show. Larry Mantello's two large 
installations are entirely fashioned of cultural cute. The largest is called 
"Continental Enter Chain" and has an automated Santa as its centerpiece. The 
Santa is surrounded by a myriad of cheap plastic objects, balloons and Japanese 
lanterns shaped like everything from leprechauns to bunnies, globes of the 
planet and a fire hydrant labeled "Top Dog Award." A tape loop of Asian pop 
music lends the piece a decidedly multicultural flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Its celebratory facade recalls the innocent delight on the faces of toddlers 
having their first Christmas. Its innards evoke an adult understanding of the 
monstrous consumerism, greed and infantile hysteria embedded in all this 
schlock. The whole is looped with a yellow plastic tape repeating, "Caution, 
caution, caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the others, Mantello gets wedged between an impulse to criticize 
society and a weakness for its vulgar energy and seductive sentimentality. All 
this work admits to a hopeless inability to set priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it derives a certain rigor from regressing into autistic compulsion 
like a kid whose games become his reality. Chris Finley collects all manner of 
objects common to suburban life from plastic containers to bottle-tops. "Seven 
Circles Are Removable, Please Reset When Finished" is an intricate wall relief 
in the form of a cross. Its combination of dusky blue and salmon pink objects 
make it look like a huge, infant's toy. Movable parts reveal progressively more 
intricate stashes inside. It's the secret universe of a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Stella Sanchez shows paintings from a series called "bubbles, bubbles, 
bubbles and bubbles that POP." The dreamy-kid title designates paintings built 
up of pigment in circular layers topped with a coat of fluorescent yellow. They 
are like serious theoretical abstract paintings made in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Lightbody's world is on the scale of a postage stamp. She uses them and 
other equally minuscule snippets to make small encrusted collages that manage 
to reach back to the poetics of Paul Klee and Joseph Cornell. They have lovely 
titles like "Potato Moon" and "40 Years of Booty." 
</P>
<P>
 Constance Mallinson comes at her problems from an adult perspective, but they 
are no less discouraging. Her "Las Meninas Mound" consists of 100 figurative 
paintings done over the past year. Their subjects tend to be those available to 
a wife and mother -- kids, meat from the supermarket, folks and friends. 
Canvases vary vertiginously in character as if done by several artists of 
divergent talent. They are piled in such fashion as to suggest imminent 
incineration. Their quality of hopelessness is chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is part of the LAX/94 festival. Santa Monica Museum of Art director 
Thomas Rhoads did a first-rate job of making his point. It bears on matters 
that have affected art for a long time now. Aspects of Jon Borofsky and Mike 
Kelley hover here. All of it feels like the gutted end of the once-liberating 
enlistment of popular culture to invigorate the fine arts. Now it feels like 
the pathetic dance of a precious child whose voice has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has happened before. The century bracketing the French Revolution 
produced curious haunted sentimentalist painters like the Le Nain brothers and 
artists like Antoine Watteau whose sense of the poignant made silliness into 
poetry. There were heartfelt genre artists like Chardin and kinky moralist 
scolds like J.B. Greuze.  
</P>
<P>
 What's happening today enlists sympathy while suggesting there are severe 
limits on art whose main purpose is to make you feel sorry for it. If it needs 
a category we can call it Rococo Pop. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: SINS OF RULING CLASS IN 'GREASEPAINT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who flee from street mimes may be well-advised to skip "The Roar of the 
Greasepaint . . . The Smell of the Crowd," the vintage musical by Leslie 
Bricusse and Anthony Newley, now being revived -- or rather, administered 
intensive CPR -- in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 All the heroic measures on the part of director Allison Bergman and her cast 
cannot breathe life into Bricusse and Newley's recumbent book -- an 
expressionistic parable about the evils of Britain's class system that mingles 
mime with vaudeville in a highly stylized but insubstantial jumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentleman con-man Sir (Andrew Craig) engages in a never-ending, chess-like 
"game" with his Cockney adversary Cocky (BK Kennelly), a virtual slave to the 
godlike Sir's every whim. Of course, the game is fixed, and the low-born Cocky 
can't hope to compete with Sir's breeding and guile. However, as surely as 
worms turn, dogs have their day, and turkeys gobble, Cocky eventually triumphs. 
Peripheral characters are roughly spliced into the formless collage, while a 
strange episode concerning the murder of a straw effigy provides meager fodder 
for a crisis and resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case at least, Bricusse and Newley may not have been able to tell a 
story, but they could certainly pen a tune. The show's score remains a 
phenomenon, with every other number a standard. Classics like "A Wonderful Day 
Like Today," "Where Would You Be Without Me?," "Look at That Face," "Who Can I 
Turn To?," "Feeling Good," and "Nothing Can Stop Me Now" uplift the flagging 
action along with the audience's spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 With his lithe physicality and commanding voice, Kennelly bears up this flawed 
vehicle by sheer effort of his considerable will and talent. Kennelly is also a 
gifted mime, as is Jennie Kaplan as the spunky Kid (who looks a lot like Jackie 
Coogan as a tyke). Add a bevy of cutely bedraggled urchins (shades of "Annie"!) 
to the mix and the show actually shows signs -- however brief -- of becoming 
animate. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Roar of the Greasepaint . . . The Smell of the Crowd," Studio Theater, 
Long Beach Playhouse, 5021 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m. This Sunday, Jan. 15 and Jan. 22, 2 p.m. Dark Dec. 18-Jan. 5. Ends Jan.

THEATER REVIEWS; EXPERT CREW KEEPS 'BILLY BUDD' SAILING SMOOTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any production of Herman Melville's seaworthy masterpiece "Billy Budd" is a 
tough nut to crack. There are not only its philosophical and social 
implications to sort out, but the very personal psychological veins in its 
rock-hard core. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress College's production, directed by Kaleta Brown, is a visually 
impressive staging of the Louis O. Coxe-Robert Chapman adaptation. Robert 
Mumm's lighting provides an almost Renaissance chiaroscuro that gives Linda 
Garen Smith's evocative scenic and costume design the right, realistic look. 
The deck, cabins and rigging and uniforms of the H.M.S. Indomitable look their 
1798 period in tone and feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has also been able to cast the central figures impeccably. In a 
generally superior company, Chip Boyd's Capt. Vere, Howard R. Patterson's 
Claggart, John M. Bradaric's Billy Budd and Milton Polsky's Dansker seem made 
to play these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradaric's Billy has a way of responding to the other seamen with a mental 
hesitancy that matches his tendency to stammer. It persuasively defines the 
character, along with Bradaric's physical sense of innocence, like a young lion 
stretching in the sun. The inhumanity of Claggart's passion for control is 
implicit in Patterson's characterization, his rich line readings echoing a 
small-minded man's pomposity and self-involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In an otherwise valid production, what Brown has not given her cast is the 
core of raw maleness that should permeate even the decks and masts. The crew 
members' adoption of the handsome Billy after his impressment from a merchant 
ship and a territory-defining combat with Maintop Capt. Jenkins (volatile 
Christian J. Bargados) is what would be called male bonding today. The crew's 
adoration not only of Billy's innocence but his physical beauty was called 
honesty then. There is little of that feeling here. And there are a few moments 
when the sailors are more like Errol Flynn's jolly pirates than a crew 
paralyzed by fear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there any evidence of the almost sexual tension, explicit in the novel 
and the play, that grows between Claggart and the new boy. Claggart is drawn to 
Billy as the others are, and it is his fear of that very dangerous weakness in 
his image of himself that breeds the need to destroy Billy. Without that 
tension there is no reason for Claggart's overwhelming wrath or their tragic 
Dance of Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd's Vere is fine, a sane, intelligent man torn between his affection for 
Billy and the letter of military law after Billy accidentally kills Claggart. 
Boyd's subtext is full and affecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mikawa, Stephen A. Shanahan and particularly Travis L. Wood are excellent 
as the junior officers, with detailed characterizations defining their weighing 
of uneven balances in the barrel-head court that condemns the boy. Polsky's 
shuffling doomsayer Dansker, as Melville's voice of reason, is exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Reyes is a fine, slimy Squeak, Claggart's treacherous accomplice; and 
in the crew, Dan Reutter's exuberant Irishman O'Daniel is noticeable for the 
reality of his portrait. Dialects, difficult for many actors, are detail 
perfect when coach James Taulli's guidance has taken.

THEATER NOTES; STAGES SEASONED WITH WILL ROGERS, NUNS, SCROOGE

 Notes from all over . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Christmas productions have taken over the county's stages -- not totally but 
almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts is one of the few places where you 
can catch a show unrelated to the holidays. It has the national touring company 
of "The Will Rogers Follies," beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This swanky revue will be slightly different from the version that played the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center 13 months ago. It won't have baby-faced 
Mac Davis reprising his Broadway performance in the title role. This time Bill 
O'Brien is starring as Will Rogers. Still, he'll be surrounded by the company's 
usual bevy of long-stemmed, Vegas-style showgirls. (310) 916-8500. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the center in Costa Mesa will be hosting a few Yuletide concerts -- the 
Fiesta Navidad mariachi program on Sunday and subsequent concerts by the Master 
Chorale of Orange County, the Pacific Chorale and the Pacific Symphony -- it 
has booked the national touring company of "The Sound of Music" for two weeks, 
beginning Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Osmond, starring as the singing nun Maria, got positive notices when 
this Rodgers and Hammerstein chestnut played the Pantages Theatre in Los 
Angeles in August. You might wonder if they were a fluke. Apparently not. 
Osmond has received raves in lots of cities around the country. (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
 And now for some of those seasonal offerings . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My favorite is the Laguna Playhouse production of "Inspecting Carol" at the 
Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach. It is a backstage farce that satirizes a 
down-at-the-heels theatrical troupe in rehearsal for their perennial offering 
of "A Christmas Carol."  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh, topical and outrageously funny, "Inspecting Carol" has just set a 
playhouse attendance record for a non-musical (surpassing "Teacher's Lounge"). 
And it's still running, with the last performance set for Dec. 18. (714) 
494-8021 
</P>
<P>
 "La Posada Magica," a new play by Octavio Solis that has its premiere at South 
Coast Repertory on Wednesday after previews tonight through Sunday, will run 
through Dec. 24. In addition, the production will tour to Santa Ana High School 
(Tuesday), Estancia High School in Costa Mesa (Dec. 17) and the Don Wash 
Auditorium at Garden Grove High School (Dec. 20, hosted by Santiago High 
School). These low-priced touring performances have been sponsored by a $15,000 
grant from Target Stores.  
</P>
<P>
 "The intent of these performances," an SCR spokesman said, "is to make it easy 
for people to attend in their local communities." (714) 567-4930 for Santa Ana; 
(714) 760-3571 for Estancia; (714) 663-6268 for Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton on Saturday, the Fullerton Civic Light 
Opera has Shirley Jones celebrating Christmas with a concert of holiday tunes. 
Jones also will reprise some of the Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes from shows 
that helped make her famous: "You'll Never Walk Alone" from "Carousel" (she 
co-starred in the movie version with Gordon MacRae); "Till There Was You" from 
"The Music Man" (she co-starred, again on screen, with Robert Preston); and 
songs from "Oklahoma" (she made the movie with MacRae). (714) 879-1732. 
Meanwhile, the Fullerton Civic Light Opera has signed its first full-scale 
contract with Actors Equity. This means the company will hire two dozen 
union-professional performers, in addition to Equity stage managers, when its 
1995 season begins in February. The contract is a step up the ladder, putting 
the company at the level of other major West Coast light opera companies. The 
Long Beach Civic Light Opera and the Fifth Avenue Theatre in Seattle operate on 
the same contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton company's 1995 budget is also higher than ever, projected at 
$1.3 million. Four musicals at Plummer will cost $1 million to produce (the 
Yeston-Kopit "Phantom," "Brigadoon," "The Secret Garden" and "West Side 
Story"). And $300,000 will finance outdoor summer shows at the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center, also in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday and Tuesday, for the second year in a row, the Garden Grove 
Historical Society will present a reading of Dylan Thomas' Yuletide story, "A 
Child's Christmas in Wales." It will feature Gary Bell, Marnie Crossen and 
Danny Oberbeck, who starred many times in the annual stage version that used to 
be produced at the Gem Theatre. Bud Leslie will direct. Chuck Estes will 
produce. Refreshments will be served. (914) 530-8871. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare Orange County begins its annual Christmas celebration, "A 
Shakespearean Christmas," on Thursday. The show, which will run through Dec. 22 
at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre in Orange, gives company actors the 
chance to offer seasonal poetry and prose and to relate their personal memories 
of the holiday. Pieces will include selections from Shakespeare, Dickens, 
Robert Frost, e.e. cummings and others, as well as traditional carols. You'll 
even get dessert. (714) 744-7016. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, during its regular summer subscription season, the company will 
stage "Richard III" (with Ron Campbell in the title role) and "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" (with Daniel Bryan Cartmell featured as Bottom). Dates have yet 
to be announced. A third show, to open the season, is still to be chosen.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes -- "A Christmas Carol." Who could forget that Dickensian chestnut? 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory is doing Jerry Patch's adaptation on the Mainstage for 
the 15th consecutive year. It continues through Dec. 24. (714) 957-4033.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want to see a different production of "A Christmas Carol" for a change, 
you might consider the Nebraska Theatre Caravan's musical stage version of 
Dickens' 1843 story. It will be offered Dec. 17 at Orange Coast College's 
Robert B. Moore Theatre in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caravan is the professional touring wing of the Omaha Community Playhouse, 
one of the nation's major community troupes. The first tour was launched 18 
years ago in the Midwest. Other tours were added in 1982. Separate Caravans now 
serve various regions of the country. The show, which travels with 36 
performers and technicians, is playing this season in more than 60 towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas carols featured in this production "stand apart from the text," says 
playhouse executive director Charles Jones, who wrote the adaptation. "Each 
carol has been chosen for the dramatic atmosphere. The songs are traditional, 
but the scoring is contemporary." A four-piece chamber ensemble accompanies the 
cast. (714) 432-5880. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a non-holiday note . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard Theatre Ensemble in Fullerton has announced seven plays for its 
1995 subscription season: A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters (Jan. 6-28); 
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" (Feb. 17-March 12 at Brea's Curtis 
Theatre); Edgar Lee Masters' "Spoon River Anthology" (March 24-April 15); 
Arthur Miller's "After the Fall" (May 12-June 10); David Hirson's "La Bete" 
(July 7-Aug. 5); Tennessee Williams' "Suddenly Last Summer" (Sept. 8-Oct. 7); 
Brandon Thomas' "Charley's Aunt" (Nov. 3-Dec.9, 1995). (714) 526-8007.

 Artistic director Douglas Jacobs' adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" has been 
performed 19 consecutive Decembers by the San Diego Repertory Theatre. But 
while the text remains the same, the show changes every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there was a rousing gospel production and before that a version that 
opened with contemporary homeless. This year, under Will Roberson's masterful 
direction at the Lyceum Stage, the story returns to Victorian origins. But not 
before Roberson pares the staging. During the course of the show, the visual 
details of Amy Shock's sets increase and crescendo with exquisitely 
orchestrated surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Gunderson composed and arranged poignant original music. Tom Lacy 
banishes memories of Scrooges Past with a performance that brings the audience 
from laughter to tears and back. Lacy plays off a 15-person ensemble that takes 
on many roles -- all well. And thanks to Ashley York Kennedy's impeccable 
lighting, the show glistens as the actors whirl in this still irresistible 
dance to the regenerative powers of the human spirit. 
</P>

TAIWANESE TROUPE SHARES ITS GLOBAL VISION; THEATER: PERFORMANCE WORKSHOP BRINGS 
CHINESE-LANGUAGE 'RED SKY' TO IRVINE. THE UNIVERSAL THEME OF AGING IS DELIVERED 
IN ENGLISH SUPERTITLES.

 You're going to die. With luck, you might also get old. 
</P>
<P>
 That's clear whether you live in Orange County or Taiwan, and it's the subject 
of "Red Sky," tonight and Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. While the 
Taiwan-based Performance Workshop previously has sold out productions in Orange 
County to Chinese-speaking audiences, this time the group will use English 
supertitles. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as January, PW director Stan Lai said he was "dead set" against 
translation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought our work was geared to Chinese-speaking people," he said this week 
on the phone from San Diego, where the troupe was appearing. "But seeing how 
our films have been received at international festivals, we realized that we've 
always had something to say to a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know now that we can be a window to something meaningful in Berlin and New 
York as well as Taiwan. Our vision is becoming more global." 
</P>
<P>
 PW's tour began in New York on Nov. 17 and has included stops in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles. The performances here are being sponsored by a nonprofit 
organization, Bravi 9. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lai, the title "Red Sky" refers to the last light of day (the 
production is in fact adapted loosely from "Twilight" by Shireen Strooker of 
Amsterdam Worktheater). All Performance Workshop plays are based on 
improvisation, and Lai's actors visited Taiwan's senior citizen centers to 
better understand a sector of society that only recently is emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old people's homes are actually quite new in Taiwan," Lai noted. "In our 
society you're supposed to take care of your elderly -- to send someone to an 
old people's home is quite disgraceful. But people are doing it, and to me that 
is an indication that something is falling apart in the fabric of our society. 
Here, of course, that is fairly normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the play is not meant to be a sermon. It's a poem. It's full of life, and 
full of laughter. In California more than anywhere else, people have been 
laughing heartily." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors in "Red Sky" use no makeup. Given the topic, "this is key," Lai 
said. "It creates an interesting dynamic: The audience is watching a young 
person, and only through the acting powers are they seeing old people. So 
there's a distance, a moving in and moving out, that heightens awareness 
(regarding death and dying) by allowing you to see two perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're young, for instance, you don't think about it, and when you're 
old you don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent a great deal of time in both Taiwan and the United States, Lai 
has a dual perspective on the theater scene here. He was born in Washington, 
but has been based in Taiwan since he was 12. He earned his Ph.D. in dramatic 
art at UC Berkeley, then formed Performance Workshop in Taiwan in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
 "Politics and the arts always move together," he said. "So it's interesting to 
me that the biggest issue here recently was Proposition 187, yet nothing has 
been done artistically about it. If 187 happened in Taiwan, we'd have produced 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Artistically, he said, "America chokes itself with economic restrictions. You 
need X amount of dollars to do (elaborate) sets and to deal with unions. . . . 
If you had a dynamite group with something to say that doesn't feel it has to 
work in big places like the Orange County Performing Arts Center, you'd have 
something. But here the urge to express yourself is more tied in with the urge 
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't make for very good creative work. It creates Hollywood, that's 
for sure, and a lot of dull theater -- theater that's done because there must 
be a season." 
</P>

U.S., EUROPEANS ACCUSED OF PUTTING TRADE OVER RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and other democracies lowered their defense of human rights 
to a whisper during the past year to concentrate on expanding trade, Human 
Rights Watch said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton rarely showed the moral leadership needed to build public 
support for tough human rights positions, allowing pursuit of trade and 
investment to dominate foreign policy," the U.S.-based independent monitoring 
organization charged in its 1994 report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Key members of the European Union shared in this retreat," along with other 
major economic powers, it said, naming Germany, France, Japan, Australia and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the (U.S.) Administration trumpeting trade and whispering about rights, 
victims worldwide were regularly abandoned" to torture, genocide and other 
horrors, the report said. "Governments shrank from the year's most urgent 
challenges -- stopping genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no comment from the White House and State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth said he hopes the new 
Republican-controlled Congress will take the initiative to defend human rights.

TURKS IGNORE PROTESTS FROM WEST, JAIL KURDISH LEADERS 
</P>

 A Turkish court sentenced eight elected ethnic Kurdish leaders to between 3 
1/2 and 15 years in prison Thursday, ignoring concerns expressed in the United 
States and the West that they were being jailed merely for expressing their 
views on Kurdish rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The military-dominated state security court in the capital, Ankara, accepted 
secret wiretaps and speeches to find six of the defendants guilty of working 
for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Two 
others were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail for making separatist statements. 
They were the only two to be released pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The military-dominated state security court in the capital, Ankara, accepted 
secret wiretaps and speeches to find five former parliamentary deputies -- 
Leyla Zana, Ahmet Turk, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak -- guilty of 
working for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or 
PKK. 
</P>
<P>
 The five all received the maximum sentence of 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sedat Yurttas received a sentence of seven years and five months 
for helping the rebels. Sirri Sakik and independent deputy Mahmut Alinak were 
sentenced to 3 1/2 years each in jail for making separatist statements. They 
were the only two to be released pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is being punished is Turkish-Kurdish brotherhood. . . . How can people 
call this democracy if this happens when we just say something?" asked Alinak 
in front of the steel gates of the Ankara jail, where the eight have been 
imprisoned for up to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Alinak , an independent deputy, retained his parliamentary seat. The other 
seven were all members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party, banned in June for 
alleged activities against the territorial integrity of Turkey. The ban 
automatically threw them out of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "These heavy sentences are shocking, incomprehensible. These sentences will 
not help Turkey's image abroad or its integration with Europe," one Western 
ambassador in Ankara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the trial will probably not divert European Union governments 
from concluding key negotiations this month on a 1996 customs union with 
Turkey. But the European Parliament has already suspended ties relations with 
its Turkey ish counterpart over the issue and may try to block any new 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government is deeply concerned" to learn of the court's verdict, U.S. 
State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkish government insists that it has the right to prosecute anybody 
linked to Kurdish rebels, who have used terrorist methods in a 10-year-old war 
aimed at self-determination for Turkey's 12 million Kurds. It has recently 
rejected renewed calls for peace by the Syria-based rebel leader. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 13,500 people have died in the fighting.

OVERHAUL OF STATE TECHNOLOGY OFFICE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bureaucracy that oversees more than $1 billion annually in state computer 
purchasing and use must be revamped to prevent more waste and mistakes, says 
the state's independent auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration defended its oversight of computers but 
agreed to review state management of information technology, essentially 
computer use and purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor Kurt Sjoberg reported this week that his office found so many 
management deficiencies that "the state must re-engineer the entire statewide 
information technology program to ensure that the state's interests and assets 
are protected and used to their maximum potential." 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Information Technology "has not provided the statewide 
leadership and coordination for information technology as intended by the 1983 
legislation that established the office," Sjoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every state department has its own computer system, but there is no 
standardized statewide electronic mail system, according to the audit. Two data 
centers serve several agencies but operate independently, without overall 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Information Technology, part of the state Finance Department, 
also has failed to oversee agencies' computer system development and 
installation, the audit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortcomings stem from the office's narrow interpretation of its 
responsibilities and a lack of funding, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg cited several computer problems that raised questions about the 
technology office's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles, for example, canceled a database 
redevelopment project earlier this year because of deficiencies after spending 
more than $49 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of the state's major information technology projects currently under 
development have experienced significant schedule delays and cost increases, 
indicating that there may be more trouble in the future," Sjoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the audit says, the cost of a Department of Corrections computer 
system has more than doubled, from $55 million in January, 1992, to $118 
million by August of this year, as it was developed and installed.

JUDGE RULES STATE ILLEGALLY WITHHELD PENSION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature illegally withheld $910 million in 
contributions to the Public Employees' Retirement System to help balance the 
state budget, a Superior Court judge ruled this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John Lewis ordered the state Wednesday to pay the overdue contributions 
plus interest, which could bring the total to more than $1 billion, state 
Finance Department spokesman H.D. Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is deciding whether to appeal the ruling, which applies to 
the 1992-93 and 1993-94 state budgets, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature and the governor approved the payment delay to help balance 
the state's books when the state was deep in the recession. The action was part 
of a number of cuts and budget shifts approved by the Republican governor and 
the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment represented funds intended to go to CalPERS for government 
employees' pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the withholding) did not affect the actuarial soundness of PERS and did 
not impair the state's contractual obligation that it has with the members of 
PERS," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS is the largest public pension fund in the nation, with $70 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased the court agreed with our position," said Yolanda Solari, 
president of the 130,000-member California State Employees Assn. "It is vital 
that the state adequately protect future retirees. This has far-reaching 
implications for other states."

 The federal judge who accepted former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. 
Hubbell's guilty plea in the Whitewater investigation stepped down from the 
case, citing his close relationship with President Clinton. U.S. District Judge 
William R. Wilson Jr. said in Little Rock that he was confident he could have 
been fair and impartial in sentencing Hubbell, but he questioned the appearance 
of his handling Hubbell's case. Wilson noted both he and Hubbell were Clinton 
appointees and personal friends of Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton.

NATION'S 1993 INFANT-MORTALITY RATE EDGES DOWN TO ALL-TIME LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's infant-mortality rate dropped to an all-time low in 1993, 
although the rate is still higher than that of 21 other countries, the 
government's record-keepers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant-mortality rate fell to 8.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1993, a 
decline from 8.5 deaths per 1,000 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also indications of a slight drop in life expectancy for newborns, 
according to provisional figures from the National Center for Health 
Statistics. Babies born in 1993 are expected to live an average of 75.5 years, 
down from 1992's all-time high of 75.8 years. But almost a third of babies born 
in 1993 are expected to reach age 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Myron E. Wegman of the University of Michigan, author of a report on the 
figures in the journal Pediatrics, said life expectancy fell because of an 
influenza epidemic in 1993 and because of higher death rates from pneumonia, 
influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Center for Health Statistics also released final mortality 
statistics for 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 * Age-adjusted death rates for the six leading causes of death -- heart 
disease, cancer, stroke, lung disease, accidents and pneumonia-influenza -- all 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Death rates declined for every age group except 35 to 44.

GENETIC BREAKTHROUGH SEEN IN HUNT FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists said Thursday that they have wiped out certain cystic fibrosis 
symptoms in mice, an advance in the search for a cure for the inherited disease 
that usually kills its human victims before their 30th birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, being published today in the journal Science, establishes for 
the first time that the disease in mice can be corrected with a human gene.The 
work focused on intestinal symptoms and researchers are now probing whether a 
similar approach will work on mice lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers took a normal copy of the cystic fibrosis gene, and inserted it 
into intestinal cells of mice. These mice had been genetically altered to show 
characteristics of cystic fibrosis, including the type of lethal intestinal 
blockage that strikes human babies with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 When the normal gene was inserted, the intestinal symptoms cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mice . . . lived a normal life span," Whitsett said, even though they 
would have died within a month without the genetic intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal gene did not have to be inserted into every affected cell to show 
these benefits. Treating just one section of the intestine was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the research strongly suggests a cure is feasible, it still remains 
years away, Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett, director of pulmonary biology at Children's 
Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and the lead author of the Science 
article, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Cystic fibrosis strikes the lungs, pancreas and intestinal tract, and is the 
most common genetic disorder among Caucasians, affecting 1 out of 2,000. People 
who have the disease cannot transfer salt and water normally across the cells 
of their lungs and other organs. Thick mucus secretions accumulate, clogging 
the airways of the lungs.

 The Army and Air Force announced personnel reductions that will cut tens of 
thousands from their uniformed and civilian ranks over the next two years.The 
Army will go from 12 to 10 active-duty divisions and cut thousands more 
positions from the support ranks for a net reduction of about 10% over the next 
19 months. Army cuts will fall most heavily on Kansas, Colorado and Texas. An 
Air Force plan cuts 11,700 civilian positions in the next seven months as the 
first phase in a reduction of 38,000 civilian positions.

CLIPPERS TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY AVOID WORST START IN 
HISTORY BY BEATING BUCKS, BUT STILL COULD THREATEN SEASON RECORD FOR FUTILITY.

 Coach Bill Fitch didn't have time to celebrate after the Clippers ended a 
16-game season-opening losing streak with a 96-94 overtime victory over the 
Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went home and took the (assistant) coaches and we did the routine," Fitch 
said. "We tore the game down and then we started on L.A. (preparing for 
tonight's game against the Lakers). About 2:30, they went home, and about 5:10 
this morning, I turned the VCR off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agree what's important is what we have to do now, not what we did 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers avoided tying the NBA record for the worst start -- the 
expansion Miami Heat lost its first 17 games in 1988 -- they still are on pace 
to break the NBA record for the fewest victories in a season, set by the 
1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who had a 9-73 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get into that until the time comes that it's a factor," 
Fitch said. "But you face that any time you go 0-16. Until we've got 14 games 
to go, don't ask me again. When you've got 14 games to go, then it's a 
creditable question." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Malik Sealy: "That's going to be the question on all your minds, 
'Can they break the record or win at least nine?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who had lost a franchise-record 20 consecutive games dating to 
last season, hope to start a winning streak instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the monkey is off our back and maybe we can string a few of these 
victories together," said forward Loy Vaught, who had a career-high 30 points, 
14 rebounds and five steals in 52 minutes against the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Pooh Richardson, who made the game-winning shot as time expired, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can build a winning streak," he said. "We've got a lot of young 
guys and nothing is ever going to come easy to this team. Things are going to 
get easier as we start being more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who made his reputation by rebuilding bad teams, has a lot of work 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Terry Dehere, the Clippers' second-leading scorer, is expected to be 
sidelined 10-14 days because of a sprained right ankle. Dehere, who averaged 
14.2 points despite shooting only 38.9% , was injured 5 1/2 minutes into the 
second half Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers collapsed after Dehere's injury, shooting only 27% in the third 
quarter while scoring only 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Injuries are part of the game and we've had a lot of injuries," Fitch said. 
"I don't think we played very well without Terry in the fourth quarter, but we 
adjusted well enough in the overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers can't put Dehere on the injured list because the NBA allows teams 
to have only three players on it at a time and the Clippers already have 
centers Stanley Roberts and Elmore Spencer and guard Gary Grant on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A platoon of Sealy, forward Harold Ellis and rookie forward Eric Piatkowski, 
who had seven points in the fourth quarter Wednesday night, is expected to 
replace Dehere. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch changed his starting lineup against the Bucks, using rookie forward 
Lamond Murray in place of center Matt Fish. Tony Massenburg, who started the 
Clippers' first 16 games at power forward, moved to center and Vaught moved 
back to power forward, the position he played last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, had 19 points, four rebounds and four 
assists in his first NBA start. He had four of the eight points the Clippers 
scored in the five-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamond made some big, big plays at both ends of the court," Fitch said. "He 
made some plays at the defensive end that you don't get credit for. He was 
there to prevent a lot of easy baskets. He made smart plays. That's the hardest 
thing to learn, and the thing that will keep him out on the floor is playing 
that kind of defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the seventh player selected in the draft, said he felt more 
comfortable starting than he had as a reserve. After averaging 11.4 points in 
his first 16 games, he scored 11 points in the first half against the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great to get out there on the floor early and get into the flow of 
the game," Murray said.

STRAWBERRY FACES FEDERAL CHARGES; JURISPRUDENCE: GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT FORMER 
DODGER AND HIS AGENT FAILED TO REPORT MORE THAN $500,000 IN INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Dodger outfielder Darryl Strawberry and his agent were indicted 
Thursday on federal tax-evasion charges, the government alleging that they 
failed to report more than $500,000 in income from autograph shows and personal 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, handed down by a federal grand jury in White Plains, N.Y., and 
distributed by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, alleges that Strawberry 
and Eric Goldschmidt conspired to defraud the Internal Revenue Service on taxes 
owed from 1986 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, each would face a maximum penalty of five years in prison on one 
count of conspiracy and two counts of income tax evasion. Each would also face 
possible fines of $250,000, or twice the gross loss to the government, 
whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment alleges that Strawberry claimed only $442,000 in income from 
the autograph shows, despite having earned $945,000. Strawberry should have 
paid $146,000 on the unreported income, according to the U.S. attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment also alleges that Strawberry and Goldschmidt concealed a Queens 
bank account from an accountant so that a substantial part of Strawberry's 
promotional income would not appear on his 1989 and 1990 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldschmidt, Strawberry's agent since 1988, prepared Strawberry's 1988 income 
tax return and assisted in preparing his 1989 and 1990 returns, according to 
the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, was unavailable for comment. His attorney, John Tigue Jr., 
said that Strawberry will be arraigned Wednesday in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "He denies the charges," Tigue said. "He hopes to have a trial schedule which 
will permit him to participate fully in the 1995 season, if there is one." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Thursday that although he 
frequently heard media reports of an investigation, he never was contacted by 
IRS officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this is something that Darryl can deal with and get behind him," 
Claire said. "I know he's worked very hard in getting his life in order. This 
is not good, but you hope he can get on with his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dodger outfielder Brett Butler: "Sometimes, you just don't understand it. 
You think things are going so well, and then something like this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, a Los Angeles native who was drafted by the New York Mets, signed 
a five-year, $20.25-million contract with the Dodgers on Nov. 8, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out 249 games during the 1992 and 1993 seasons because of back 
problems. He played last spring without problems, but failed to show for the 
Dodgers' final exhibition game April 3 against the Angels. The Dodgers 
announced the next day that Strawberry had a substance-abuse problem and he 
underwent treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers negotiated a $4.857-million settlement on the rest of Strawberry's 
contract, and he was released May 25. He signed June 19 with the San Francisco 
Giants, and the Giants planned to bring him back for the 1995 season when they 
offered him arbitration rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization was aware of the possibility this would happen before we 
signed him," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "He's not guilty yet. You just 
have to deal with things in your past, and handle it, and not let it affect 
your present and future." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Larry Baer, Giant executive vice president: "We're going to stand by him 
and help him in any way possible. We hope he'll be a member of the Giants this 
year, and we intend to have him in a Giants uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Rose is the only baseball star known to have been imprisoned for tax 
evasion. He was sentenced to five months in prison and fined $50,000 for 
failing to report $345,967 in memorabilia-sale income.

GIVING RAIDERS A LIFT(OFF); ROCKET ISMAIL MAKES HIS MARK AFTER CONVERSATION 
WITH HOSTETLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Get the football into the hands of Raghib Ismail and good things usually 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 From his early playing days in Newark, N.J., and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to Notre 
Dame and then to the Canadian Football League, that was the rule to live by for 
the team that had the player nicknamed "Rocket." 
</P>
<P>
 So when Ismail joined the Raiders before the start of last season, after two 
seasons in the Canadian Football League, it was understandable that fans 
expected instant results. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happens when you're nicknamed Rocket," said Qadry Ismail, 
Rocket's younger brother, a second-year wide receiver with the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 For Raider fans, however, Ismail's opportunities to touch the ball were few 
and far between in his first NFL season. Used primarily to return kickoffs, 
Ismail caught only 26 passes as a wide receiver, for 353 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail had missed training camp in 1993 because of contractual problems, 
though, and Raider fans predicted he would tear up the league this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine games, however, Ismail barely made a ripple and the big 
plays that had happened almost every time he touched the ball were fading 
further into memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, bam! Rocket took off again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four games, Ismail has caught 10 passes for four touchdowns, two 
in the Raiders' 24-17 victory over San Diego on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocket has always been a great player," Coach Art Shell said. "The key thing 
is that he has a better understanding now on how routes should be run and where 
he has to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail agreed, to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew I could (catch the) ball," he said. "I just had to take it to a 
different level between receiver and quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail said the turning point was a conversation he had with Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood how I saw a route run," Ismail said. "But what I really needed 
to know was how Jeff saw a pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 One day last month, Ismail approached Hostetler and told him that he was doing 
the best he could and asked how he could help the Raiders' struggling passing 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that conversation, it turned out that we really weren't on the same 
page," Ismail said. "I learned how he wanted me to do things. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'The reason why I like to throw to Timmy (Brown) is because I know 
exactly what he is going to do.' He really didn't know what I was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go into a game saying (to a defender), 'I have four different ways 
to run a curl route, see if you can stop me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But Jeff wouldn't know what I was doing. So he would drop back, see me, and 
then look for Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, he tells me what he wants and I'm, like, cool. That's all you have to 
say to me. I think what has started to happen between us is only the beginning. 
It's in the inception stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail, 25, who leads the team with 35 kickoff returns for 758 yards, also 
credits his recent success to newfound inner peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger, I was like everyone else who wanted to do well and have 
people tell you that you're doing great," Ismail said. "I don't strive for that 
anymore. I've learned that what you get doesn't bring satisfaction in, as far 
as peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get all the accolades and all the things that are supposed to make 
you happy and satisfy you. But you can have as much or more drama when you're 
doing well as when you weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, Ismail has seen his image go from that of a media 
darling who finished second for the Heisman Trophy as a Notre Dame junior in 
1990, to one of an immature NFL millionaire who avoided interviewers as if they 
were tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind his nickname, he has always been a guy who isn't all flash," Qadry 
Ismail said. "When he was in Canada and somewhat when he was at Notre Dame, I 
don't think that he took to the spotlight too comfortably. He didn't like the 
role he had to play." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ismail did not always have positive experiences playing in the CFL for 
Toronto Argonaut owner Bruce McNall, former owner of the NHL's Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing up the NFL to sign a four-year contract that guaranteed him $18 
million under McNall, Ismail could never live up to his media status as a CFL 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first year with Toronto, Ismail was an all-star as he helped lead the 
Argonauts to the Grey Cup title. But during his second season, things began to 
fall apart with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, I should have known that (McNall, who is facing four felony 
counts stemming from a federal bank-fraud investigation) was having problems," 
Ismail said. "After we won the Grey Cup, we came back for training camp and 
many things that were promised were not fulfilled to the players. We had to 
practice on the hardest field in the world because the groundskeepers weren't 
paid. People got hurt running on that stuff even before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt bad because not everyone (in the CFL) was paid well. We had players 
who had to work two jobs. Then, when McNall started not taking care of the 
team, I had players come to me and say, 'What's up?' about the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail finally got his chance to try the NFL when he was able to work out a 
release deal with McNall to play with the Raiders days before the start of the 
first regular-season game last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie, Ismail's biggest fear was not of NFL cornerbacks but of living in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole L.A. thing scared me when I first got here," he said. "My ideology 
about coming here was so wrong. I tried to see if I could get caught in that 
type of lifestyle. Then I realized that I didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
 After trying the Southern California night scene, Ismail began spending more 
time at home, talking to his family on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since my father died when I was 10, I've pretty much been the leader of 
my family," he said. "I realized that I needed to take care of them and try to 
do something besides pray. I also had to take care of myself and get my spirit 
together. Not that I wasn't before. But I wanted to become a man and it was 
time for me to stop taking myself for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a decision the Raiders are glad he made.ISMAIL, RAGHIB (

MIKE DOWNEY: FUNDS AND GAMES ARE ALL GONE

<P>
 The Rams might leave. Their county is broke. The Raiders might leave. Their 
stadium is broken. The Dodgers are on strike. They borrow millions from a bank. 
The Kings are on strike. They owe millions to banks. The Angels are on strike. 
They need a new stadium. The Mighty Ducks are on strike. The Lakers play to 
two-thirds capacity, the Clippers to one-third capacity. Schools everywhere are 
dropping sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi, it's me, president of Save Southern California Sports, asking: Won't you 
please help? 
</P>
<P>
 We have no money here. None. Zilch. All of us are hurting, even Burt Reynolds. 
We can't afford a ticket to a game. We can't even afford valet parking. We're 
busted. No bread. Orange County is in the red. They'll have to rename it. 
Newport Beach is no longer as well off as St. Louis . Man, that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 California has run out of money. All the clues were there. Even O.J. Simpson 
drove around in a Ford. Out here, we have money only for two things now -- 
vanity license plates and Skins Game golf. Otherwise, nada . No dough. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in our lives, we need bargains. Laker courtside seats, two 
for $10, let's say. Mighty Duck autographed pucks -- get 'em while they're 
cold, 10 cents apiece. Brother, we are so broke out here, the old goalie of the 
Kings had to post bail for the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Got me? We're cleaned out, bankrupt, Tap City, busto. Save the Rams? We're 
lucky we get our garbage picked up. We're New York with sun. Georgia Frontiere 
will be doing another of those United Way TV spots soon -- for herself. "I 
nearly made my Rams move to Missouri, of all places. But now, thanks to your 
generous contributions, we can stay and even pay our coach. Thanks to you, 
we're still working, the United Way." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how things got so bad. Somebody must be responsible for us being 
broke -- Charles Keating, Michael Milken, Darryl Strawberry, somebody . 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson bought something like 10% of the Lakers. I'm sort of hoping that 
he decides to buy 10% of Los Angeles. We need tourism. We need people to visit 
California who used to live in California. We need rich people from Oregon to 
come here during Rose Bowl week and spend their money. We know things are bad 
when that's what we need: Oregon donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even our poor athletes have no income. Want to hear something funny? I made 
more money last week than Wayne Gretzky did. I made more money last week than 
Ken Griffey Jr. and Sr. did combined. And to think my mama begged me to learn a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose the beginning of the end for California came a couple of years ago, 
when UCLA dropped water polo. You know the economy is going sour when UCLA 
drops water polo. All those needy kids, counting on that water polo scholarship 
money to get them through college. Think of it, some poor child, out there 
every day in his parents' swimming pool, working on his water polo, day and 
night, only to have his university throw the whole sport down the drain. Breaks 
your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 We Californians, maybe we lived too well. Instead of one team in each sport, 
we always had to have two. Instead of an AM Burger or a PM Burger, no, we had 
to have AM/PM Burger. We always had to have things our way. Now I'm hearing 
that California inflation is so bad, 7-Eleven convenience stores are about to 
be called 8-Twelve. 
</P>
<P>
 What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much. Some of us can continue to support our teams, best way we can. For 
example, if you should see a professional baseball player or hockey player 
outside a supermarket, holding one of those WILL WORK FOR FOOD signs, you might 
invite him over to rake your yard or paint your fence. These people need to be 
doing something. Pay one to clean your Jacuzzi. If you like, you can withhold 
15% and call it a luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, go to a Laker game. Maybe tonight, against the streaking Clippers. For one 
thing, the Lakers are playing very well. For another, many seats at the Forum 
remain empty because nearly everyone in California is either broke or too busy 
being host of a talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Our sports teams need ways of making money, fast. 
</P>
<P>
 I propose the following: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Taxpayers donate $1 per Raider penalty, wiping out the national debt by 
next Sunday. 2 -- Orange County offers an "enjoy the game or your money back" 
guarantee, like that "Miracle on 34th Street" movie. 3 -- We borrow from the 
Kings and give to other, less fortunate teams. 4 -- We offer all our teams to 
St. Louis, sort of a group-discount thing. 5 -- We start charging surfers and 
swimmers for ocean time. What do they think, water's free?

 That's about all we can do, here in the tarnished Golden State. We don't have 
much, but at least we have each other.

BLOOMINGTON'S RUN TO GLORY; COACH BRINGS RECORD SUCCESS TO SCHOOL WITH DOUBLE 
WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final scores are staggering: 86-8, 84-0, 70-0, 66-8, 62-9. 
</P>
<P>
 No, these are not the results of a college all-star basketball team playing 
against grammar school students. They are a sample of victories posted by the 
Bloomington High football team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who conclude their record-setting season tonight at 7:30 at La 
Mirada High in the Southern Section Division VIII championship game, have 
created a stir in their small community near Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington (13-0) broke the national single-season scoring record Saturday 
with a 34-21 semifinal victory over Laguna Hills. The Bruins' 832 points 
surpassed the 827 established by Big Sandy, Tex., in 14 games in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the accomplishment particularly astounding is that it was achieved 
with many of the players who finished with a 1-9 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 How did they do it?  
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach Don Markham, 55, offers an easy answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run a simple offense that creates a lot of problems for our opponents," 
said Markham, referring to his team's double-wing formation. "It's not popular 
because it's not what's in vogue -- it's not what's on TV. But it's easier to 
run than other offenses, and a lot harder to defend." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham's offense consists of five linemen, two tight ends, two running backs, 
a fullback and the quarterback. The two running backs are split behind each 
tight end, and the fullback is closely positioned behind the quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 On a typical play, one running back goes in motion toward the quarterback 
before the snap, the other converges on them after the snap, and the 
quarterback usually hands off to one of them or the fullback. But it is 
difficult for a defense to figure out which one since they are so close 
together at the point of the handoff. Sometimes the quarterback pitches to one 
running back who, in turn, pitches to the other heading in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a lot of power," Markham said. "The defense can't overload one 
side or another because there's lots of reverses, lots of misdirection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many gaps to cover along the line to keep (the running backs) all 
covered. It limits what the defense can do. They have to play us pretty 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Greg Oliver and Cheyane Caldwell have flourished in Markham's scheme. 
Oliver, who leads the state in scoring with 326 points, has rushed for 1,785 
yards and scored 41 touchdowns. He also has converted 40 two-point attempts. 
Caldwell has rushed for 1,426 yards and 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington, ranked No. 8 in the Southland by The Times despite playing in a 
low division, has gained 5,992 yards. It averages 64 points a game and has a 
margin of victory of 48. 
</P>
<P>
 The football team's success has improved school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The marching band has increased its membership nearly 50% since the start of 
the season. Students, faculty and parents can be seen around campus and at 
games wearing T-shirts bearing the scores of the Bruins' 10 regular-season 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morale of the kids is just tremendous," said Vic Molner, Bloomington vice 
principal. "They feel good about themselves and it's spilled over into other 
sports. More kids want to participate in other athletics. Any time there's 
success, there's school pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Markham, however, are not surprised by the turnaround or the 
lopsided scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he took over a slumping football team in Bandon, Ore. After a year of 
rebuilding, Bandon made the playoffs the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham's double-wing offense was so effective there, state officials adopted 
a rule unofficially called "The Bandon Rule" that ends a game when a team has a 
45-point lead at halftime or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Markham led Riverside Ramona to four consecutive playoff 
appearances from 1986-1989, while his teams averaged 40 points. He had similar 
results at Colton High, where he coached from 1973-84 and reached the playoffs 
nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is thrilled with Markham's style. He traditionally carries a 
small number of players, leaving some to question whether he takes only the 
best players in order to shorten the bench and cultivate higher scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Don LeGro, coach at Sierra Vista in Baldwin Park, watched his team lose its 
playoff opener to Bloomington, 70-0, last month. Although LeGro did not accuse 
Markham of running up the score, he did question why a school with an 
enrollment of 1,300 students could not get more players out for football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we play defense and they play offense, and it's our job to keep 
them out of the end zone," LeGro said. "To his credit, when the score got into 
the 50s, his play calling became simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to say he's running up the score because he's got a limited number 
of players and plays. With 1,300 students, you'd think he'd have more than (20 
players) on his roster. He probably doesn't take borderline players. He might 
be depriving other kids less talented a chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football was down here after last year," he said. "Kids didn't think this 
school could win. Only 25 kids showed up for spring tryouts. The ones that 
didn't make the varsity were put on the junior varsity team and are now suiting 
up for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the success of his offense is not dependent on the talent level 
of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been running this sort of offense for a long time, so I don't make many 
mistakes," said Markham, who has 10 players who play both offense and defense. 
"There's only eight running plays and two passing plays, along with some 
gadgets. The players run these plays over and over again in practice until they 
perfect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could run the same (offense) and do it well with average talent. The 
system itself will work as long as you have players that are willing to work 
and willing to block."  
</P>
<P>
 As to the question of running up the score, T-shirts worn by Bloomington 
supporters display the school's attitude on the subject. They read: "If you 
don't like it, play defense."

MAGIC MOUNTAIN IS HEART OF HART; HUGE LINE BLOTS OUT SUN BUT CAN IT BLOCK OUT 
ANTELOPE VALLEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: What do restaurant owners and defensive linemen have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An aversion to Hart's Hogs -- the five beefy Indians who play 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The all-you-can-eat places don't like us too much," says Sant Sikand, the 
300-pound right tackle. "They cry when they see us coming, and say, 'Go home!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, so do their opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them just think they have no chance," Sikand says. 
</P>
<P>
 That figures. The Indians outweigh many of the players they face by 60 pounds 
a man. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the quintet -- Sikand, Ryan Schienle, Paul Walters, Mike Espy and 
Mike Wambolt -- stand 6-foot-4, 266 pounds. The Great Wall of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's line coach Dan Houghton tells those numbers to his coaching friends. 
"They say, 'Your line averages what!? ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it. And though attention at Hart (a.k.a. Quarterback High) is usually 
reserved for its great skill position players, much of this season's spotlight 
falls on -- well, is blocked out by -- the Indians' offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a smorgasbord's worst nightmare, but a running back's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," says Hart's running back Ted Iacenda. "There's nothing more you 
could ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda has consistently run through gaping holes and scored an area record 40 
touchdowns this season. The line also has protected quarterback Steve McKeon 
well enough for him to pass for 2,593 yards and 29 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the offense will face perhaps its toughest challenge, staring down 
the lightning-fast Antelope Valley defense in the Southern Section Division II 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're big but they have the speed," Walters says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes also have some fair-sized line talent of their own, namely 
defensive linemen Chad Shrout (230 pounds) and Caleb Smith (225). But 
size-wise, no one can match up with Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the quintet, from tackle to tackle: 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 78, Sikand, right tackle, 6-7, 300, senior. This man-child with the 
bushy orange-and-black goatee and the ready laugh is the biggest of the five. 
</P>
<P>
 During one game, Houghton, who at 6-2, 240 pounds is accustomed to towering 
over his players, tried to talk authoritatively to Sikand. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to be stern while looking up -- way up -- at someone, so 
Houghton finally climbed on the team bench and continued the lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikand has played almost the entire season with strained ligaments and a cyst 
in his right knee. He will undergo surgery after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problem, coaches say he is playing better than ever. He is being 
recruited by Washington, UCLA, Colorado, Oregon and has already been offered a 
scholarship by Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Such success is a far cry from his freshman year, when, at 6-4 and 220 pounds, 
he mostly stood on the sidelines because he wasn't yet good enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's come a long way," Coach Mike Herrington says. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 71, Walters, right guard, 6-5, 280, senior. He was going to be a 
groomsman in his sister Adrianne's wedding, but the ceremony will take place in 
Valencia during tonight's game. So Walters will miss the nuptials and be one of 
the best men in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big day for both of them," says their mother, Ingrid. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents will attend the wedding, but they haven't forgotten their son. His 
father, Paul Sr., plans to leave the reception early and come watch the end of 
Paul's game still decked out in his tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jr. hopes to go out in style, also. This is the first time in his 
three-year varsity career that he will be playing at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed his entire sophomore season because of a broken leg, missed the 
final four games last year because of torn ligaments in his right knee and 
missed the first four games of this season because of torn cartilage in the 
same knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Resler filled in while Walters was injured this season and played well, 
though at 5-11, 190, Resler would need to swallow a Great Dane to be one of 
these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters has played well since his return and received interest from 
Washington, Nevada Las Vegas, and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Better to finish strong, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 55, Mike Espy, center, 6-0, 220, senior. He's a walking diet commercial 
compared to his high-caloric colleagues, though not for lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't eat as much as these guys, but I definitely enjoy it as much," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy didn't play football last season, quitting after starting on the varsity 
as a sophomore to concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He batted .269 last season as a designated hitter and tied for the team lead 
with three home runs, but he yearned for football and returned to bolster the 
interior line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my senior year and I wanted to make the most of it and have as much 
fun as I could," he says. "This is exactly what I wanted to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight will be Espy's final football game, because he plans to again turn 
exclusively to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 72, Ryan Schienle, left guard, 6-3, 280, senior. How much does Schienle 
like to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 He has a nickname for his stomach. Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thing that sets me apart from everyone else," he says. "No one 
else has Ralph." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loves Ralph, though," Sikand says. 
</P>
<P>
 "True," Schienle says. "Except for restaurants. They hate him." 
</P>
<P>
 His coaches love both Ralph -- offensive coordinator Dean Herrington gave 
Schienle's stomach its moniker -- and Schienle himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He is probably the team's best lineman and its strongest, too, with a 
335-pound bench press. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State, Brigham Young, Utah, UNLV and Nevada have expressed interest 
in his services. That makes it three of four seniors who will probably earn 
Division I scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite a legacy to pass to. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * No. 75, Mike Wambolt, left tackle, 6-4, 250, sophomore. Listed in the 
program at 230 pounds, "Baby Wambolt" has grown since the beginning of the 
season, which figures, because he is the biggest eater of the five. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a sophomore, he has learned a lot from the seniors, including how to 
take a fair amount of guff. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanders up to a reporter talking to Sikand and Schienle and is asked his 
opinion of the unit's play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "What have these guys been saying?" he wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said you're ugly," Sikand says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wambolt knows enough to ignore that and instead launches into a description of 
his favorite meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see, tri-tip (steak), nachos . . . " he begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Schienle: "And we're talking with rice and beans. It weighs about three 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Wambolt: "And a half-pound tri-tip dinner. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Schienle: "It's big." 
</P>
<P>
 Wambolt: "And a couple of Cokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Schienle: "He macks. " 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't fit in if he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday, Schienle and Sikand lead a restaurant review discussion at 
practice, comparing notes about the finest eateries in Southern California -- 
and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even talk about places we've gone when we've been on trips," Sikand says. 
"Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet jokes easily, poking fun at each other and laughing constantly. 
But the heavies know when to stop with their -- dare we say it? -- lighter 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about us is we all have a sense of humor and we can be close 
as far as that goes," Espy says. "But when we get on the field we know what we 
have to do and we know when to get serious." 
</P>
<P>
 They have, leading Hart (13-0) to the brink of the finest season in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians average 395 yards a game and blend the run and the pass almost 
perfectly (2,456 total rushing yards, 2,677 passing). In its three playoff 
games this year, Hart has scored 42, 51 and 55 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it good is that (the linemen) are good athletes," Houghton says. 
"They can do both aggressive drive blocking and go to passive pass blocking." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching them has been Houghton's privilege, he says. He lifts weights with 
the group and pals around with them during the season and also afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice when you can work with a kid, coach them, but also consider them a 
friend," he says. "I don't think I'll ever have a line like this again. I'm 
very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Houghton, 32, was touched when Sikand's parents orchestrated a surprise baby 
shower for Houghton and his wife (the Houghtons had a son in October). The 
linemen and their parents offered cards, gifts and congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really surprised," Sikand says. "It was pretty nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters muses about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was plenty of food there, too," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikand looks up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Wambolt got to it," he says. "There was all these croissant sandwiches 
and he ate about 15 of them." 
</P>
<P>
 That touches off another round of gastronomic debate. Wambolt jumps in to 
defend himself. The beat -- and the eat -- goes on.

VIRGINIA COMMANDS SPOTLIGHT; COLLEGE SOCCER: CAVALIERS OVERSHADOW UCLA, INDIANA 
AND RUTGERS WITH FOUR SENIORS WHO CAN WIN FOURTH NCAA TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia has four players trying to make history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana has one player trying to make it for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are UCLA and Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 They're just trying to make it to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what else the Bruins are trying to accomplish in soccer's final four is 
not readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, UCLA wants to add another NCAA championship to the titles it won under 
Coach Sigi Schmid in 1985 and 1990. But where's the angle? Where's the hook? 
What would make people outside Westwood care whether they win?  
</P>
<P>
 For Virginia, the answer is simple. The Cavaliers, under Coach Bruce Arena, 
have won the last three NCAA championships, all played -- like this one -- at 
Davidson College, 20 minutes north of Charlotte. If they can get past Rutgers 
in today's first semifinal and win again Sunday, four Virginia players will 
have accomplished something never done before. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards A.J. Wood and Nate Friends, midfielder Tain Nix and defender Clint 
Peay will have become the first soccer players to win four NCAA titles. They 
might well be the first athletes to do so in any Division I-A sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walton, Lew Alcindor and Fred Lynn were part of programs that won four 
consecutive titles, but, under NCAA rules in force at the time, they were 
ineligible as freshmen. The rules changed, and a four-peat for Wood, Friends, 
Nix and Peay could be a unique achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in their way today at 2 p.m. will be the next-to-last hurdle they 
must clear. Rutgers, under Coach Bob Reasso, is a decided underdog, but the 
Scarlet Knights are not awed by the fact that the Cavaliers are unbeaten in 
their last 23 NCAA matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tremendous amount of respect for Bruce Arena and his players and 
their program and what they've accomplished," Reasso said Thursday. "But, at 
the same time, we relish the challenge. This is one of the best final fours 
over the past few years because of the teams that are here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginia is a great soccer team. It's a team that has a tremendous amount of 
experience in a big tournament like this. The players have a lot of athletic 
ability. They have two great front-runners (Wood and Friends). I think one of 
the trademarks of Virginia soccer over the last three, four, five years is that 
they have a lot of players who are very comfortable on the ball. They send a 
lot of players forward. All their players can contribute in the attacking 
third. Whenever you face a team like that, it's a very difficult task." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers' hope lies in denying Virginia the scoring chances it needs and in 
perhaps getting a quick counterattack goal or two created by the speed of its 
own strikers, Rob Johnson and Hamisi Amani-Dove. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana, meanwhile, comes into its semifinal against UCLA seeded first and as 
the country's top-ranked team. But there are doubts about the Hoosiers' 
ability, even though they defeated the Bruins, 2-0, in Westwood in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jerry Yeagley has the added pressure of trying to win his son an NCAA 
title. Or rather, midfielder Todd Yeagley has the pressure of trying to win one 
for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in the final four and have the chance to win a national championship 
with your son, that's something you can't put into words," the elder Yeagley 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid, meanwhile, must replace starting goalkeeper Chris Snitko and defender 
Frankie Hejduk, both ineligible after being red-carded in the quarterfinals. 
Matt Reis, a freshman from Mission Viejo, will start in goal in what is 
unquestionably the biggest game of his career. The return of midfielder Eddie 
Lewis and defender Adam Frye will help UCLA's cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid, like Reasso, knows his team is the underdog but is equally 
unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the first time we played Indiana, we were a little bit in awe of 
them," he said. "But once we realized we could play with them, I thought the 
second half was pretty even. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eager about the game. This is a team that believes it can win. It doesn't 
matter what anybody else thinks. It doesn't matter what the odds look like. It 
doesn't matter what the adversity is. They have this belief they can win."

PLAYING THROUGH GRIEF; LONG BEACH STATE VOLLEYBALL STAR CARRIES ON AMID ORDEAL 
OF FATHER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tears come to Traci Dahl daily, except on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl blocks out the painful thoughts of her father's death, albeit only 
momentarily, because of her responsibilities as the starting middle blocker for 
defending Division I national champion Long Beach State. Although she sometimes 
wonders if volleyball should be in her life right now, Dahl is confident her 
father wouldn't want it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Dahl will be paramount in his daughter's thoughts tonight at 8 as she 
tries to help Long Beach continue its title defense. Long Beach (26-5) will 
play host to Hawaii (25-4) in a semifinal match of the NCAA tournament's 
Northwest Region at the Gold Mine gymnasium on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my dad would be proud of me," said Dahl, whose father died late 
Wednesday night after a short battle with lung cancer and pneumonia. "This is 
basically what he (lived) for. . . . This is what kept him going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know if I let that go, I'll be letting him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Dahl couldn't have been more proud of his only daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended as many of Traci's matches as he could during her career at 
Cerritos Gahr High, Cerritos College and Long Beach State. A transportation 
superintendent for a grocery distribution company in Santa Fe Springs, Dahl 
even made volleyball fans out of his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here keeps up with Traci's career," said Wes Buller, who worked 
with Dahl. "He talked about her all the time, and he used to bring in all of 
her articles from the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Gary got sick, we all started to bring in the clippings. We put them up 
everywhere in the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl was found to have lung cancer Oct. 6. He underwent radiation treatment 
until Nov. 1. On Nov. 16, he had to be hospitalized in Bellflower after 
contracting pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so weak," Traci said. "The radiation is what gave him pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
 His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was moved to intensive care about 
three weeks ago. A machine was needed to assist in his breathing, and he 
received powerful medication in an attempt to lessen his pain, Traci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The end came Wednesday at 10 p.m. Gary, 53, was surrounded by his family -- 
wife Susan, son Gary and Traci. Traci said services for her father will be held 
Monday at St. Barnabas church in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't describe this feeling," Traci said. "I don't think it's hit me yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the struggle, Traci was with her father as often as possible. She 
accompanied her mother to the hospital in the morning and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been real strong about all of this," Susan said. "She's been super. 
She's been with me as much as she can." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary wanted his daughter to keep her mind on volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say, 'I'm going to go to the doctor with you guys today,' and he'd 
say, 'Did (Coach) Brian (Gimmillaro) give you a day off practice?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Time at the hospital often required Traci to miss school and practice. A 
senior, she expects to receive grades of "incomplete" in her courses this 
semester. Gimmillaro has supported her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to watch a person grow up and mature," he said. "Traci is a 
truly exceptional person. She just has such spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 12, Dahl led Long Beach with 22 kills and 12 blocks in the Big West 
Conference-clinching match at Pacific. It marked the 49ers' fourth consecutive 
Big West title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traci took over the match," Gimmillaro said. "She is one of the top middle 
blockers, if not the top one, in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl has missed only one match, the 49ers' sweep of San Francisco on Nov. 25 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers' home victory over UC Irvine on Nov. 8 will always carry special 
significance for her. It was the last match her father attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was still walking," Traci said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her ordeal, Dahl's play has not suffered. At 6 feet 1, she provides a 
powerful presence at the middle of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished second in the conference with a .370 hitting percentage, was 
third with an average of 1.35 blocks and fourth at 4.16 kills per game. She was 
selected first-team all-conference after being chosen for the second team as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 She stepped into the starting position last season and helped Long Beach win 
its second national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Dahl led Cerritos to the state community college title and was 
named state player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like when I'm out there on the court, I can kind of erase everything 
from my mind," she said. "Once the adrenaline gets flowing, it's not real hard 
to focus on what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl's perseverance has impressed her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect her a lot," senior captain Nichelle Burton said. "She's been 
through a lot, and she's handling it as well as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Said senior defensive specialist Prentice Perkins, "She's been strong. But, of 
course, there's been a lot of tears. There's no way there couldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 That prompts the self-questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think, 'What the hell am I doing here at practice when. . . . ' 
Maybe I shouldn't really say that," Dahl said. "Sometimes I have a bad 
practice, and I just wonder what I'm doing there because my mind's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 But then she remembers her father's support. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of another national title keeps Dahl going now. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying to play in the final four in Austin, Tex., is in her thoughts when 
she's not thinking of her father. First, the 49ers must get past Big West foe 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, Long Beach faces another tough opponent in the regional final, 
either Ohio State (27-2), the region's top-seeded team, or fourth-seeded 
Pacific (23-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl played well in Long Beach's key victory over Hawaii on Nov. 1, with 15 
kills and seven block assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dahl completely dominated in the middle of the net," Hawaii Coach Dave Shoji 
said. "We hope we can slow her down because we're in big trouble if we can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to do everything I can to beat this team," Dahl said. "This whole 
season is for my dad. I know he'll be there with me."

MCCANTA FINDS THE POWER IN PREPARATION; FOOTBALL: SERVITE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN 
DOESN'T FRIGHTEN ANYONE WITH SIZE OR QUICKNESS, BUT HE BEATS OPPONENTS WITH 
GUILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Servite defensive lineman Tony McCanta's 5-foot-11, 195-pound frame isn't 
going to scare many offensive lineman. His quickness isn't going to remind 
anyone of Michael Dean Perry or even William Perry, and his strength doesn't 
afford him the luxury of bull-rushing many offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask McCanta if any of that matters once he steps on the football field, 
and he'll tell you what matters is what he does before he steps on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm not the biggest or strongest guy," he said. "That's why I put in 
the extra time in the film room. That's why I spent the off-season in the 
weight room and that's why I concentrate so hard on little things like staying 
low, so I can get as much leverage as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a coach's dream? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like having another coach on the field," Servite defensive line coach 
Bob Salerno said. "He doesn't make a mental mistake -- ever. If he ever makes a 
mistake, it's a physical error because some guy is just bigger and stronger 
than he is." 
</P>
<P>
 In Servite's 34-19 victory over El Toro last week in the Division V 
semifinals, McCanta had an almost error-free game as he spent much of the night 
in the Chargers' offensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The key? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had them scouted very well and we knew exactly what they were going to 
do," McCanta said. 
</P>
<P>
 For McCanta and the rest of the defensive line, the scouting begins in the 
film room at 7 a.m., three mornings a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, that's one of the big things that helps us," he said. "I know we 
wouldn't be in the finals without the extra time studying film. We didn't do 
this as intensely last year and we went 3-7. By watching film you can pick up 
what a team will do in certain formations, and you can find out what your 
(individual) opponent's weakness is." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he see any weaknesses in Newport Harbor, tonight's opponent in the 
Division V title game? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have excellent technique and they're low and quick off the ball," 
McCanta said. "They're very tenacious and they stay with their blocks. We're 
going to have to be at our best to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 McCanta will likely line up tonight over one of Newport Harbor's guards. Then 
again, he could line up over the center, or he could even play some inside 
linebacker. He's done it all this year, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he could play defensive end if we asked him to," Salerno said. "I 
call him our Iron Man. Wherever you put him, he'll play his heart out. He 
understands the concept of what we're trying to do, so it really doesn't matter 
where you play him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, he's at nose guard and he loops and slants and slips his way to 
the quarterback. From the linebacker spot, he has really good control of his 
body and he can really deliver a lick. Then, you put him at defensive tackle 
and he's a real hell-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you put McCanta in the classroom, you'll get a student with a 4.28 
grade-point average who wants to be a pediatrician. Put in him in politics, 
he's the school's student body president. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his size, McCanta probably will never play Division I football. But 
Servite Coach Larry Toner said he's not worried about McCanta's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can go play at an Ivy (League) school or Villanova if he wants to do 
that," Toner said. "But even if he doesn't continue to play football, he'll do 
plenty with his life. I always tell the staff, he'll be richer than we are by 
the time he's 25. He's got a lot going for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's offensive linemen might get first-hand knowledge of that 
tonight.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; DESPITE HIS SIZE, JOHNS PACKS A WALLOP; 
PREP FOOTBALL: NEWPORT HARBOR'S 5-FOOT-9, 195-POUND LINEMAN HELPED SAILORS 
ADVANCE TO DIVISION V FINAL WITH OVERTIME VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bill Johns, Newport Harbor's little big-play man, isn't the most imposing 
figure on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior stands only 5 feet 9, weighs 195 pounds . . . and he plays nose 
guard . 
</P>
<P>
 He is a two-year starter on the defensive line, and he contributed, well, sort 
of, the last time Newport Harbor played in a Southern Section football 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a 15-yard clipping penalty on special teams," said Johns, who was a 
sophomore when Newport Harbor lost to Irvine in the 1992 Division IV title 
game. "That's my claim to fame in that game." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johns is no longer confined to special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 His play on both sides of the ball helped the top-seeded Sailors (13-0) 
advance to the Division V championship game against third-seeded Servite (11-2) 
at 7:30 tonight at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Newport Harbor defeated Foothill, 13-10, in overtime. Johns, the 
Sea View League's defensive player of the year, set the tone on the first play 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their guard was lining up wide all night," Johns said. "It was the kind of 
play that Coach says if you can make it, it's a great play. If you don't . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the California tiebreaker -- in which each team gets a 
possession starting on the opponent's 10-yard line until the tie is broken -- 
Johns burst through the gap between Foothill's center and right guard and 
sacked quarterback Tyler Lang for a five-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 After a clipping penalty pushed the Knights back farther, the Sailor defense 
eventually held them to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor trailed, 10-7, and had moved the ball inside the one-yard line. 
But faced with a fourth down, a timeout was taken and the Sailors conferred 
with Coach Jeff Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked us what we wanted to do," Johns said. "We all wanted to go for it. 
We knew we could get it in because we were blowing them off the ball better in 
the overtime than we had during the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Sailor quarterback John Giordani handed off to running back Brian Johnson, who 
plowed over the right side for the game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being at the bottom of the pile and we were yelling, 'Did he get 
in? Did he get in?' " said Johns, who also starts at right guard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise that Brinkley chose to run to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the chips are down, Bill will make a play," Brinkley said. "He plays 
with a lot of heart and desire. He gives you 100% and he's the guy with the 
dirtiest uniform at the end of the game; just look for the little dark spot in 
the middle of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkley isn't alone in his praise for Johns. Opposing coaches know he has 
racked up 13 sacks and 95 tackles, including 10 for losses, to spearhead a 
defense that gives up only 10 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask people who have seen the undersized-overachieving lineman play and the 
superlatives begin to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Servite Coach Larry Toner: "He's unbelievable; one of the quickest 
guys I've seen. He's not 6-3, but holy catfish, he's a complete football 
player. He's a coach's dream because he does exactly what you need and makes 
things happen when you need it most." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Irvine Coach Terry Henigan: "He's one of my all-time favorite players. 
Usually linemen you don't love to watch, but you do with him. He's a kid who 
loves the game and it comes across." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Johns is a small defensive lineman, he demands a large amount of 
attention from offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so quick and has explosive strength," Brinkley said. "Offenses always 
have to account for Bill, a lot of times with two people." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns and his teammates have reached the big game but they won't be content 
with just an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like we knew we were going to get here," Johns said. "A lot of the 
younger guys have stepped up. Our coach always said that if we played to the 
best of our ability, we can achieve anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal was to win the whole thing. I don't think we're cocky. I'd call it 
determination. We've been behind in six games and haven't lost yet. We just 
refuse to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a fun game." 
</P>

COMMENTARY; ROSE, STRAWBERRY TURN OUT TO BE TWO OF A KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a night in San Diego when Darryl Strawberry was a kid with the New 
York Mets, and he hit two home runs against the San Diego Padres with that 
uppercut swing of his built for home runs the way sports cars are built for 
speed. Dick Williams was managing the Padres then, and when the game was over, 
they asked him what he thought of Strawberry, and Williams actually talked 
about a "young Ted Williams." Strawberry never turned out to be Ted Williams, 
or anything close. If you had to compare him to any baseball immortal on 
Thursday, it would have been Pete Rose, and only because Strawberry might end 
up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Darryl Strawberry is in the kind of trouble that 28 days in rehab 
does not make right for him. The indictment is charges of federal income tax 
evasion, and the government has already proved with Pete Rose that it does not 
care what kind of swing you have or how many times you are in the baseball 
record books. If they can prove you cheated on your taxes, you go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not guilty," Strawberry's lawyer says. We heard that from Rose's people 
four years ago, until Rose finally stood in court and pleaded guilty to two 
charges of filing false tax returns. The bigger the name, the better the IRS 
likes it. A big baseball star behind bars is a much better deterrent for tax 
cheats than an audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose and Strawberry could not have been more different as players. Rose got 
everything out of his talent, and Strawberry never came close to doing that. 
But they might be alike in this way: Maybe they thought the rules did not apply 
to them, that they were above the law, because they could hit a pitched ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they are two more who thought their names made them bulletproof. 
Wouldn't you? They both get paid a fortune just to sign those names. It turns 
out those signatures can get you indicted like a common criminal. Rose is an 
ex-con now, and there is a chance Strawberry is headed in the same direction. 
This is not the kind of trouble for which you just write a check. Pete Rose 
found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose came along before Strawberry, played half his career before the money in 
sports exploded because of free agency in the 1970s. Rose never came close to 
the kind of money Strawberry has made from baseball, even though he should have 
made more. Rose ended up with more hits than anybody else in baseball history, 
and he once figured out he had played in more winning games. He was always 
great with numbers but terrible with money. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Rose broke Ty Cobb's record for hits, the autograph and 
memorabilia businesses were booming, and he would have signed his name with 
both hands if he could have switch-hit with a ballpoint pen. It was said he 
even sold the bat he used to break Cobb's record. Eventually, the IRS caught up 
with him. To the end, Rose thought he would beat the rap. He was Pete Rose. He 
was the all-time hit leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come the same kind of charges against Strawberry, a 32-year old member of 
sports' Generation $. This is the generation of athletes with an outrageous 
sense of entitlement about every dollar coming to them. Strawberry made a 
fortune from the Mets and Dodgers. When the Dodgers effectively fired him this 
spring, they had to buy him out of his contract. Strawberry made about $5 
million on that one, in a lump-sum payment. Then he signed with the San 
Francisco Giants. When the Dodgers and Giants were fighting for the title in 
the National League West, it was as if Strawberry was getting paid by both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever the money is, it is never enough, for any of them. It never 
surprises any of them that they get paid to sit there and sign their names. 
</P>
<P>
 It was always such a great name. Pete Rose had that kind of great baseball 
name, until he ended up with this prisoner I.D. number -- 01832061.

UNION, AGENTS DISCUSS FREEZE ON SIGNINGS; LABOR: EXPECTATION IS THAT THE OWNERS 
WILL IMPLEMENT SALARY CAP DESPITE NEW PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing was decided, but officials of the baseball players' union met with 
about 40 prominent agents in Atlanta on Thursday and discussed the possibility 
of a freeze on signings if the owners vote to unilaterally implement their 
salary-cap proposal next Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents left it in the hands of the union, but a freeze would be mostly 
cosmetic since the players will resume their strike next spring if the owners 
implement and attempt to open the camps with replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fair to say that there is an assumption on the part of the agents that 
the owners will implement no matter what we do," union leader Donald Fehr said, 
referring to a proposal the union is expected to deliver to special mediator 
William J. Usery tonight and to the owners' negotiating committee in Rye Brook, 
N.Y., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a veteran agent: "I think the owners will spit on the proposal because it 
doesn't give them their backdoor salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal doesn't provide a cap of any kind, doesn't modify arbitration or 
free agency in any way, and the upgraded tax rate is unlikely to satisfy the 
owners' demand for cost controls, a drag on salary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, the proposal is more philosophical than fiscal, designed 
to challenge the owners' frequent assertions that they ultimately want to 
develop a partnership with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls for the players to have a vote in major industry decisions, such as 
the hiring of a commissioner, and to participate with the owners in joint 
marketing and capital ventures such as international expansion and inner-city 
development, with the players contributing about $25 million from their 
licensing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It also calls for about a 5.33% tax on the highest payrolls, generating about 
$58 million for the small-revenue clubs, up from the $30-million plan the union 
proposed in September but far short of the more than 100% rate in the owners' 
recently proposed tax plan, a cap in disguise according to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bold proposal," San Diego-based agent Tony Attanasio said. "I think it 
will clearly get a lot of attention from those owners interested in making a 
move forward. For those with preconceived notions of implementation, it won't 
do anything."

POLL: FANS WOULD WATCH REPLACEMENT PLAYERS

<P>
 Scrap the strikers, more than half of baseball fans say. Bush leaguers would 
be just as entertaining as Clemens and Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-one percent of fans say they would attend the same number of games next 
season even if replacement players are used, according to a national poll 
released Thursday by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 If Griffey and Glavine won't play, fans say they would still pay to watch 
unknowns in big league ballparks. And 63% say they'd watch just as many games 
on television next year if replacements take the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Americans identifying themselves as baseball fans dropped to 
26% from 33% in July, according to the survey. While 33% of Americans age 65 
and over identified themselves as fans now, only 22% of the population from 
18-34 consider themselves to be fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me that you're asking a lot of questions that are hypothetical," 
union head Donald Fehr said. "I don't give the questions or answers 
significance one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners say they would start the 1995 season with replacements if the strike 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL owners used replacement players in 1987, a move that crushed the football 
union. Attendance during the three weeks that replacements were used was way 
down, with an average of 23,626 per game.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; STANFORD MAY HIRE FORMER ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Stanford assistant coach Tyrone Willingham, now with the Minnesota 
Vikings, is expected to be named new Cardinal head coach at a news conference 
today, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The university would not comment on a report in Thursday's San Francisco 
Examiner that Willingham, the running backs coach with Minnesota, will replace 
Bill Walsh, who resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candidates for the head football coach position at Stanford remain Tyrone 
Willingham, Terry Shea and Ron Turner," Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland 
said. "I cannot confirm or deny at this time that a candidate has accepted the 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is offensive coordinator with the Chicago Bears, and Shea is offensive 
coordinator at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Willingham, 40, met with Leland and advisory committee members Tuesday, then 
flew back to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ty is an extremely demanding coach," said Viking Coach Dennis Green, who 
hired Willingham as an assistant coach at Stanford in 1989, then brought him to 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Turner or Shea, Willingham has no head coaching experience and has 
never been an offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who served as offensive coordinator under Green, was thought to have 
the Stanford head coaching job locked up in 1992 before Walsh entered the 
picture. He moved to San Jose State for one year as head coach, leading the 
Spartans to a 7-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Willingham would become the fourth black head coach of a Division I-A program, 
joining Jim Caldwell of Wake Forest, Ron Cooper of Eastern Michigan and Ron 
Dickerson of Temple.

 Penn State's Kerry Collins, who led the nation's top scoring offense, edged 
Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam for the Maxwell Award as the country's 
outstanding college football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins also won the Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's finest quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," Collins said. "The other two guys that vied for this honor 
are certainly very deserving. I'm very fortunate. . . . I'm just thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam did, however, pick up the Doak Walker Award that goes to the top 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving the coach-of-the-year award was Rich Brooks of Oregon, who coached 
the Ducks to their first Pacific 10 title and Rose Bowl appearance since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Hurricanes' Warren Sapp won the Football Writers Assn. award for top 
defensive player of the year, one of a number he has collected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other award winners: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Thorpe (defensive back): Chris Hudson, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outland Trophy (interior lineman): Zach Wiegert, Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>

LINGERING INJURY FORCES DEHERE'S RETIREMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dehere, who sizzled at Saratoga in the summer of 1993 en route to the 
2-year-old championship, will not race again. 
</P>
<P>
 The colt, in training for a comeback from a broken leg, is being retired to 
breeding at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky., it was announced on Thursday by 
John Perrotta, general manager of Robert Brennan's Due Process Stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere, trained by Reynaldo Nobles, suffered a broken right hind leg during a 
workout March 4 at Palm Beach Downs in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The colt was back in training, but Perrotta said, "He was getting sore in the 
spot where he hurt himself. He was about 99%, but that is not good enough for a 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere won his debut, a maiden race at Monmouth Park July 30, 1993, then swept 
all three 2-year-old stakes at Saratoga (the Saratoga Special, Sanford and 
Hopeful). He then was beaten by Holy Bull in the Futurity at Belmont Park, won 
the Champagne at Belmont and finished eighth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Nov. 
6.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; DON'T EXPECT TO SEE BREAKAGE USED TO SETTLE JOCKEYS' 
CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breakage? Until a couple of weeks ago, Gary Stevens thought that was what 
happened when a jockey went down in a spill and was crushed by the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in racing most of my life," said Stevens, who was grooming horses 
as an 8-year-old in 1971. "But until I went to that meeting at Hollywood Park, 
this breakage stuff was something I'd never heard of." 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting was in late November, another in a series between the Jockeys' 
Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing Assns., who are at loggerheads over a new 
contract for the riders' health and accident insurance. They are rushing toward 
a deadline on Dec. 31, when the current three-year deal expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ways to raise the millions of dollars in premiums have been suggested, 
none acceptable to both sides. The jockeys suggested a tax on the handle, 
holding out a penny for every $10 bet. The TRA, which represents about 40 
tracks, including most of the biggest, has proposed that each track, based on 
its size, pay a fee per racing day into the insurance fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hirsch, Daily Racing Form columnist, thinks that if each track ran an 
extra race a year, turning over the proceeds to the jockeys' insurance needs, 
most of the money could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakage has also been mentioned as a possible cash source. That is more than 
touching a nerve. Messing with the breakage fund would be tantamount to 
slashing an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakage, which has been around for decades, is a cash cow for state and local 
governments, tracks and purse funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting as pennies and ending in the millions, breakage is the money that 
tracks withhold from bettors when payoffs don't average out to an even dime. 
(It is a nickel in a few jurisdictions, including New York, which recently got 
off the dime). For example, with 10-cent breakage, if a horse is supposed to 
pay $5.88, the payoff will be rounded off to the lower dime, and the price will 
be $5.80. The extra eight cents goes into the breakage kitty. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all very subtle and very legal and a windfall for those on the receiving 
end. New York, despite its change to five-cent breakage, still penalizes 
off-track players, who bet about two-thirds of the handle, with a 5% surcharge 
on payoffs. That gives the house double breakage, the advantage of keeping the 
odd pennies both on and off-track. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Racing Commissioners International, eight states allow state 
and/or local governments to share breakage. In 1992, the most recent year that 
data is available, governments in these states collected $11.4 million in 
breakage from betting on thoroughbreds. California hauled in $4.2 million of 
that amount. Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar totaled $2.1 million as 
their share of breakage, and another $7.3 million went to California purses. 
</P>
<P>
 All horseplayers do is put up the money. One argument against jockeys possibly 
using breakage for insurance premiums is that they are already tapping into 
purse money with the standard 10% commissions that they get for riding winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The California tracks' share of 1992 breakage is slightly less than what the 
jockeys' health and accident insurance cost nationally for 1993. The state's 
share of 1992 breakage is more than 1 1/2 times what the jockeys' national 
insurance cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens might have been late to class for the lecture on breakage, but, as a 
jockey with more than 20,000 rides, he's an expert on the need for insurance 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of whether you're going to get hurt," he said. "It's a 
question of when ."  
</P>
<P>
 One of those whens for Stevens came in the fall of 1987, a week before the 
Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park. Riding at Santa Anita, Stevens suffered a 
broken ankle in a gate accident and missed the seven mounts he had on the 
$10-million card. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens is a member of the Jockeys' Guild's board of directors. The guild, 
which has about 1,000 members, says that its riders ride about 90% of the 
horses. At the guild's annual meeting in Las Vegas this week, John Giovanni, 
the jockeys' national manager, was urged by his membership to continue 
hard-nosed negotiations with the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a clear mandate," he said. "The riders want no half-hearted solutions. 
They're in a profession with the highest risks, and yet they have miserable 
benefits. This should be an embarrassment to the industry. We need new ideas 
from the TRA, and the tracks are advised to take our concerns seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's no settlement by the end of the month, Giovanni said that his 
members won't be riding. Tracks such as Santa Anita would be forced to use 
replacement jockeys in order to stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least 90% of the riders (in Southern California) are guild members," 
Stevens said. "Up North (at Bay Meadows), Russell Baze (400 victories in each 
of the last two years) and Tommy Chapman aren't members. But Russell Baze and 
Tommy Chapman won't be riding on Jan. 1 if we don't have a contract. We're 
together on this." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, battling flu for more than a week, took off his mounts at 
Hollywood Park Thursday. . . . Hollywood Park's three stewards reviewed a race 
from Wednesday, in which Desormeaux's mount was disqualified to second place, 
and held the jockey blameless. . . . Facing a five-day suspension from an 
infraction last week, Desormeaux obtained a court order that will allow him to 
continue riding, including his mount on Wekiva Springs in Saturday's $100,000 
Underwood Breeders' Cup Stakes. . . . Gundaghia, winner of the race in 1992, is 
among the 10 entered in the six-furlong sprint. Cardmania, third in the 
Underwood twice and third in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last month, is also 
expected to run. Others in the field are Minjinsky, Lost Pan, Demaloot 
Demashoot, Concept Win, Polar Route, Gotta Groove and Saratoga Gambler. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela has been winning races this week while riding much heavier than 
he did before his 20-day suspension. Valenzuela rode Wednesday at 121 pounds, 
unable to make the assigned weight on four mounts, and he was riding at 120 
pounds Thursday. The heaviest local jockey in recent years has been Laffit 
Pincay, usually at 117 pounds. According to the rules, jockeys can't ride a 
horse if they're more than seven pounds over the assigned weight. . . . New 
York-based Eddie Maple, winner of more than 4,100 races, is the winner of the 
1995 George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Mooney, a racing executive who once headed the Ontario Jockey Club, 
Arlington International and Laurel Race Course, died Saturday in Toronto after 
suffering a heart attack. Mooney, 70, was born in 1924, about four months after 
his father, J.D. Mooney, rode Black Gold to victory in the Kentucky Derby. 
Among the survivors is Mike Mooney, director of publicity at Hollywood Park and 
Santa Anita.

 Come on, Kevin. Shed the shyness routine and string together a few sentences

school with a strong athletic tradition, played for a football section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney, who also is the school's athletic director, is as aware as anyone of 
the significance of this game. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the eve of the biggest game in school history, Rooney -- wide open on 
the playing field in his pass-catching prime at Santa Clara University -- 
characteristically is making like a clam in his office, fidgeting his way 
through an early-morning interview, visibly and admittedly uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I'm that way, I just am," Rooney, almost apologetically, 
says. "I'm just . . . bashful, I guess. I never knew how to deal with the media 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that newspapers cover high school football as much as they 
do. But for me, personally, I don't care if there is anything ever written 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated sportswriters might concur. Comments from Rooney routinely are 
cautious and usually as bland as they are brief. "Our guys played well," or 
"This is a big win," is about as catchy as it comes with this Notre Dame coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He laughs sometimes because he says reporters always tell him he's dull," 
says Maureen Rooney, Kevin's college sweetheart and wife of 14 years. "But he's 
just uncomfortable being the center of attention. I said, 'Gosh, Kevin. It's 
really great what you've done.' He said, 'Well, it's the kids who have brought 
us there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Rooney, 44, who prefers to discuss the contributions of 
others -- even if it means filling reporters' notebooks one tight-lipped, 
hand-wringing, pause-fractured, dry-as-dust utterance at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 A clam? You bet. But just as happy as one. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching, Rooney says, is his favorite recreation. And a trip to the final 
means another joyous, workaholic week spent scrutinizing game film every spare 
minute and huddling with his tight circle of assistants until wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've learned is that you can win if you prepare well and you execute 
well," Rooney said. "I think this team is, probably, not as talented as last 
year's team. But our kids are sold on the fact that if they prepare hard enough 
and they play hard enough, they can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney leaves his Palmdale home at 5 each morning in order to get in a 
90-minute workout at school before classes begin. He returns late in the 
evening, preferably before his three young daughters are put to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Spartan life is the good life for Rooney, who doesn't swear, rarely 
drinks, ceaselessly exercises and leads his team in the Lord's Prayer before 
games, during halftime and moments after the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition be, er, darned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at some programs and you see recruiting violations and illegal 
players, and they're almost commonplace," said Jeff Kraemer, a Rooney assistant 
since 1980. "But those things will never happen at Notre Dame. Kevin just won't 
allow them to." 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy has a lot of class," quarterback Ryan Bowne said. "And he's a great 
coach. You look at our team and there are no big guys there. But the big thing 
he keeps telling us is that we can win if we work harder than the other team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights, with only three starters returning from last season, are far from 
overflowing with talent. The team's top college prospect is kicker Chris 
Sailer, who has booted a state-record 20 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Notre Dame hammered Mission League rival Chaminade, 41-8, and twice 
defeated both Royal and Serra on its way to the final. A swarming defense 
yields an average of 10 points and 209 yards a game. A ball-control offense 
keeps the chains moving and the clock ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit and talk after the games and we all scratch our heads as to how we're 
doing it," Kraemer said. "But the success of our program is due to Kevin 
Rooney." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistants have been few and fiercely loyal during Rooney's reign. Aside from 
Kraemer, who coaches the offensive line, Rooney, recruited defensive 
coordinator Joe McNab out of Santa Clara in 1981. Assistant Bob Hamm played for 
Rooney at St. Francis High in Mountain View, where Rooney was a varsity 
assistant from 1973-79. Jerry Slimak, a former St. Genevieve assistant, joined 
the staff three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney himself was recruited by Father John Bitterman, a former principal at 
Notre Dame who was dean of students at St. Francis. "I think it's important to 
surround yourself with people you trust and believe in," Rooney said. "One 
reason we have such success is because we have a talented coaching staff that's 
been here a long time and they all believe in the things we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part Rooney, his teams mired in mediocrity for much of his tenure, 
appears to be hitting his stride. The Knights, two-time defending league 
champions, are 22-4 over the past two seasons and have advanced to the section 
semifinals three times since 1989, including each of the past two years. Notre 
Dame has won four league titles in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "His teams are always well-prepared," said St. Francis Coach Bill Redell, who 
squared off against Rooney four times as coach at Crespi during the 1980s, as 
well as in each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat him when I was at Crespi, but, quite honestly, our talent was better 
than his. But even when we won, his teams played with great character and 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rooney, whose career record is 90-69-4, has never been voted coach of 
the year by any league or publication. "I don't really care about those 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does care about is humility and character. In line with his own 
beliefs, players are counseled to be humble and are encouraged to credit 
teammates when talking with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A prohibition on profanity is another longtime edict that stems from the top. 
In 1983, players presented Rooney with a plaque with the inscription, "God 
Bless America!", the coach's favorite interjection when angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always made sure to make numerous references to the offensive line," said 
Errol Small, who rushed for 1,567 yards and 21 touchdowns for Notre Dame in 
1989 and is now a linebacker for USC. "And I know I used to swear all the time 
and he used to tell me to cool it. I'd let my emotions get the best of me, but 
he would never lose his cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Attention to detail is what Small remembers most about playing for Rooney. 
"Little things," he said. "Fundamentals. Blocking, tackling. Simple things that 
other coaches take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 The second of six children of a prominent Bay Area forensic pathologist, 
Rooney transferred from American River College in Sacramento to his father's 
alma mater and immediately became one of Santa Clara's top receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, he hauled in 39 passes from quarterback Dan Pastorini, who 
went on to star for the NFL's Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders. His junior 
and senior years, Rooney caught 40 and 52 passes to lead the team. With 131 
catches, he ranks fourth on the school's career list. 
</P>
<P>
 He also played rugby, a sport he continued to play on a club basis until 
suffering a rotator cuff injury that required surgery in 1989. Rooney coached 
that season with his arm in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2 and a trim 180 pounds, Rooney is 10 pounds lighter than his 
playing weight. When he's not working out, he's shooting baskets in the school 
gym or embarking on ski trips with his family and members of his coaching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't stand it if he doesn't get some kind of exercise each day," Maureen 
said. "He's not a guy who ever wants to sit around the house." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Rooney was worth writing about, and newspapers featured him in 
several articles -- whether he liked it or not. Usually, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never very happy how they came out," Rooney said. "I don't know why. It 
was just friends giving me a hard time about things I said and that kind of 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney doesn't dislike the media, but he admits being miffed at times by what 
he considers over-aggressive or careless reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, he was angered when a story about the firing of a campus 
coach was published before he could notify the coach. On another occasion, he 
says he was misquoted and his remarks angered administrators at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has answered more questions than he cares to about his relationship 
with Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson, a former assistant whose contract was not 
renewed after he served one year under Rooney in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson has declined to discuss the matter, saying only that it was "a 
personality conflict." For the record, Rooney, who likewise has said little 
about the matter, said he simply wanted to assemble a staff of his own 
assistants. "It wasn't anything he did, necessarily," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Lawson is a good football coach and he's done a great job at Chaminade." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the measure of whether you're doing well or not is the attitude of 
the players and whether they're still playing hard at the end of the season," 
Rooney said. "The bottom line is, we play as hard as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, come on, Kevin. Enough already. Go ahead and say it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I just don't feel . . . comfortable talking about me." 
</P>
<P>
 God Bless America! The guy is a good coach.

FELDMAN GETS FINAL SHOT AT GIRLS' CITY TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taft High tennis player Julia Feldman has developed a more aggressive game 
that might help her strike the target at which she has aimed for three years: 
the City Section girls' singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, a senior, and defending champion Kendra Segura of Dorsey will square 
off at 1:30 p.m. today at The Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman has a 47-2 record in three seasons, her losses coming to former 
teammate Brahna Pastorini in the 1992 final and to Segura in the 1993 
semifinals. But Feldman returned this year with a powerful serve and a new 
serve-and-volley attack that has overwhelmed most opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But can she avenge her 6-3, 6-3 loss to Segura, a sophomore who also has 
improved? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going out there to play my game, and I think my game is enough to 
win," Feldman said. "I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's semifinals, Feldman had four aces, several service winners and 
narrowly missed several more aces in her 6-4, 6-3 victory over Los Angeles High 
freshman Ilona Kordonskay. Segura turned back Dorsey teammate Delana Daniels, 
6-4, 6-2, after trailing, 4-3, in the first set.  
</P>
<P>
 An unheralded player last year, Segura dealt defending champion Pastorini her 
only high school loss, a 6-7 (7-2), 6-2, 6-3 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Feldman's serves are on target, Segura could be in trouble.

NHL; LEAGUE CANCELS ALL-STAR GAME IN SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual NHL All-Star game, scheduled for Jan. 21 at San Jose, is the latest 
victim of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 The league on Thursday canceled the game, which was to kick off its five-year, 
$155-million deal with the Fox TV network.The dispute with players "makes it 
impossible to go forward," Stephen Solomon, the NHL's chief executive officer, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As consolation, San Jose will play host to the 1997 game. The 1996 game 
already has been awarded to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the season can be saved remains unclear. Commissioner Gary Bettman and 
the league's Board of Governors will meet Monday in New York, where they are 
expected to draw up a final proposal and deliver a take-it-or-leave-it 
ultimatum to the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and union chief Bob Goodenow have not spoken since Tuesday, but a 
source indicated they might talk before Monday's league gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star game has been played annually since 1947, when it matched the 
Stanley Cup winner against a team of players from the rest of the league. The 
format changed to East vs. West in 1969. The game was played before the season 
until 1967, when it was moved to midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which acquired the NHL's over-the-air TV rights in September, issued a 
statement saying it regretted the cancellation.  
</P>
<P>
 "But our broadcast agreement with the NHL is a long-term commitment, and we 
fully understand the more pressing issues needed to be resolved that are 
necessary to insure the future growth and stability of the game of hockey," Fox 
added. "We look forward to televising NHL hockey in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Players who participate in All- Star games are paid by the league, but the NHL 
Players Assn. does not benefit from the contest.

FORMAT IN SPOTLIGHT IN DESERT; GOLF: DINERS CLUB EVENT AT PGA WEST GIVES 
PLAYERS A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR MATCH PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a format so unusual it is used in big-time golf only three times a year, 
the only non-international match-play event of 1994 began Thursday at the 
Nicklaus Resort Course at PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
 Match play, in which players win individual holes and add them up to see who 
has won the most, is almost as rare as a double eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diners Club Matches at PGA West are new to the PGA Tour calendar and 
constitute the only match-play event in the United States this year other than 
the biannual Presidents Cup, which also began this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in the Ryder Cup, which is played the years the Presidents Cup is not, 
and the World Match Play Championships on the European Tour and you have the 
extent of match play.  
</P>
<P>
 Teams from the Senior PGA Tour and the LPGA tour will join the PGA players 
today. The winning teams will earn $125,000 each of the $2.1-million total 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Match play is a popular format for the players, if not necessarily spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every hole is like playing the 18th hole to win a tournament," Lee Janzen 
said. "It's like it's always sudden death." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, match play may be sudden death to golf's most important 
partner, television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work for TV," Rick Fehr said. "The tournament opens with Nicklaus 
and Palmer, but will you see them on Sunday? They're two big draws and it would 
hurt to lose them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what makes the senior tour so successful. They have no cut." 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Championship used match play from its inception in 1916 until 1958, 
when it was changed to stroke play. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Tour hasn't had a match-play event since 1986. The Seiko Tucson Match 
Play Championships lasted three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the very least, any match play can't hurt as preparation for the Ryder 
Cup, said Janzen, who was on the 1993 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's going to help," he said. "It's different strategy out there. It 
doesn't matter how many holes you have won before, you've got to win the hole 
you're on now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus and Palmer, who open the Senior PGA Tour play today against Simon 
Hobday and Tom Weiskopf, are celebrating a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time they have played together since the 1973 Ryder Cup. Their 
match-play record is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost to somebody?" Palmer joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Bembridge and Brian Hugget defeated Nicklaus and Palmer, 3 and 1, in a 
four-ball in the 1973 Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Tour players began match play Thursday and not a moment too soon for 
Scott Hoch, who chipped in from 20 feet on No. 18 to win with partner Chip 
Beck. Hoch had also chipped in on No. 16 to tie the match against Mike Springer 
and Neal Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoch: "What all this means is, we were real lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch and Beck will play Janzen and Rocco Mediate, who defeated Lanny Wadkins 
and Paul Azinger, 4 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson and Ben Crenshaw were ahead by a hole with one to play, but 
both hit balls into the water on No. 18 and fell into a tie with John Huston 
and Brian Claar, who won on the 19th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston and Claar will play Fuzzy Zoeller and Curtis Strange, who defeated 
Ronnie Black and Brad Bryant, 3 and 2.  
</P>
<P>
 Other winners were the teams of Rick Fehr-Loren Roberts, Hale Irwin-Jay Haas, 
Bill Glasson-David Edwards and Jeff Maggert-Jim McGovern.

SIDELINES; ANTELOPE VALLEY, HART KEEPING THEIR DISTANCE IN REGULAR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't wait for the high school football teams at Hart and Antelope Valley, 
which haven't met since 1981 but play tonight for the Southern Section Division 
II championship, to play each other again soon -- unless it's in playoff 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a matchup between the two makes sense geography-wise (Lancaster and 
Newhall), competition-wise (both are perennial area powers) and would generate 
significant fan interest, neither school will schedule the other after Antelope 
Valley of the Golden League joined Hart (Foothill) in Southern Section Division 
II this season. 
</P>
<P>
 No effort was made to schedule a game when the two played in different 
divisions, and now neither coach will risk playing a tough team he might have 
to face again in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we're in the same division, I definitely wouldn't think of it," Hart 
Coach Mike Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb: "It's hard to beat the same team 
twice." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had played each other as members of the Golden League, but Hart left 
for the Foothill after the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Get a leg up: The Thousand Oaks High girls' cross-country team was upset by 
Peninsula, 82-91, in the Division I race of the State championships at Fresno's 
Woodward Park on Nov. 26, but the Lancers should have a great chance next year: 
Only one of their top seven runners is a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Lancer boys, who won their second consecutive Division I 
title, have five seniors among their top seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect our girls' team to be (there) again next year," Coach Jack Farrell 
said. "But I don't know about the boys. I've got to go and find some runners." 
</P>
<P>
 Frosh by gosh: Crescenta Valley freshman Michelle Greco is averaging 17 points 
and 11 rebounds after six games. On Saturday, she scored 37 points in a loss to 
Simi Valley. "She's already better than anyone I've coached here," Coach Marc 
Ward said of the 5-foot-10 Greco. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a mouthful. Last season, Crescenta Valley's Sarah Hagman set a 
single-season Southern Section record with 121 three-point baskets and led 
players in the region with a 25-point scoring average. Quotebook  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Cassidy, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball coach, after the 
Matadors upset Long Beach State, 64-58, on Tuesday: "I feel better all over 
than I do in any one place." Stats  
</P>
<P>
 With 39 total blocks in the National Invitational Volleyball Championship, 
middle blocker Ana Kristich ended her career as Cal State Northridge's all-time 
leader with 382, breaking the record of 360 set by Kathleen Dixon from 1987-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristich also set a record for most games with 450, topping the mark of 444 
set by Nancy Nicholls from 1989-92.

COACH SAYS FREEDOM IS A SUPER BOWL; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UTAH'S MCBRIDE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO DEC. 27 MATCHUP WITH ARIZONA AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are the Freedom Bowl organizers lucky, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 They thought they chose two also-rans, albeit quality ones, to play in their 
game Dec. 27 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, guys. 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup of Utah vs. Arizona features the best the Pacific 10 and Western 
Athletic conferences have to offer. Don't believe it? Just ask Utah Coach Ron 
McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're looking at is probably the best team in the Pac-10 and probably 
the best team in the WAC playing in this game," McBride said Thursday during a 
Freedom Bowl news conference at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have two very fine football teams in this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Dick Tomey won't quite go as far as McBride, one of his former 
assistants at Arizona. But Tomey does agree with this much: Neither participant 
lacks talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Conference champion) Oregon is the best team in the Pac-10," Tomey said. 
"They won the games they needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had a great team. This year we have a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's unquestionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah (9-2, 6-2 in the WAC), ranked 14th in the nation, finished second in the 
WAC. The Utes' record equals the best of any team to play in the game. Colorado 
State (10-1, 7-1) won the WAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah lost last year's Freedom Bowl, 28-21, to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Utes were 8-0 and preparing to play a bit farther south in 
San Diego's Holiday Bowl -- the annual final stop for the WAC champion. 
However, two losses in their final three games, including an embarrassing 23-21 
road loss to lowly New Mexico, prompted the change in travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 8-0 and all of a sudden we were getting all this national attention," 
McBride said. "The players started thinking they were pretty good and the 
coaches started thinking they were pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk down the street and people tell you how good you are. Then you go 
down to New Mexico and get your (butt) kicked, and you get back to reality 
pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, whose defense was labeled with a popular marketing moniker, "Desert 
Swarm," last season, opened this season with a No. 1 ranking by Sports 
Illustrated and an appearance on the magazine's cover. One of the two is 
usually tantamount to a kiss of death. The combo? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Arizona never looked much like the nation's best team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the No. 15 Wildcats (8-3) had a fine season. They tied USC for second 
in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Desert Swarm thing, I think for our players, has been something they've 
taken pride in," Tomey said. "But obviously this past (season), we weren't as 
strong a defense as we have been in previous (seasons)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes' defense wasn't impressive in last year's loss to USC. The Trojans 
put the game away early, taking a 28-0 first-half lead and cruising in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But something has changed, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were without a secondary last year," McBride said. "Our defense is vastly 
improved."

BOXING AT THE IRVINE MARRIOTT; ARMIJO, FLORES FIGHT TO DRAW; BOTH SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promoter Ted Luckow's last boxing card at the Irvine Marriott also might have 
been Huntington Beach welterweight John Armijo's last fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo, nicknamed "The Fighting Lifeguard," survived a rocky start to earn a 
10-round draw with Gilberto Flores of Mexico City Thursday night in front of 
1,072. But afterward, ringside doctors Michael DeLuca and Robert Karns 
announced that both fighters will be suspended until they are cleared to box by 
neurological exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both took a lot of head blows," said Karns, who said the suspensions 
would probably be at least 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo (18-7-2), who has fought five times since taking a year off, said he 
will continue to fight and wasn't pleased with the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," he said. "That's the name of the game. I don't see the point." 
</P>
<P>
 But his trainer Jesse Reid wasn't convinced Armijo should continue his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a tough one," Reid said. "Maybe (Armijo will continue), maybe not." 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo appeared ready to go down in the third round when Flores nailed him 
with a solid right to the head, then followed with a flurry of blows for about 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flores (23-15) ran out of steam and took the next six rounds off while 
Armijo landed most of the serious blows. Armijo was penalized a point by 
referee Marty Denkin in the ninth round for delivering a low blow, and he was 
outworked in the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Gwen Adair scored it 95-94 Flores, Burt Gilliam had it 95-94 Armijo and 
Bill Scott called it 95-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Dynamo (6-2-3) of the Westminster Boxing Club, started fast but tired and 
wound up fighting Frankie Hanks (3-2) of San Diego to a six-round draw. In a 
five-rounder, John John Palaki from Tonga improved his record to 12-0 with an 
impressive unanimous decision victory over Cecil Thompson (4-3) of Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckow, who had the promotion rights at the Marriott for two years, announced 
Thursday that he sold the show to Roy Englebrecht, who had been helping Luckow 
promote for the past year.

AROUND TOWN: HAPPY TRAILS ARE HERE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The King of the Cowboys and the Queen of the West came riding into town the 
other day. In a white stretch limo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd both break in two if we tried to get on a horse," said Dale 
Evans, 82, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bowling ball gets heavier and my horse gets taller every year," said Roy 
Rogers, 83. His heart isn't the best and "with all the kids I've got, I want to 
stay around as long as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Say "kids," and Roy's and Dale's faces light up like a starry sky 
way-out-West. They've had nine -- his, hers and theirs, five of them adopted -- 
and are doting grandparents of 15 and great-grandparents of 29. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Pepper Edmiston, a Pacific Palisades children's advocate, drove over 
to Victorville to tell the couple she wanted to start a cowboy camp for 
disabled kids and call it "Happy Trails," they had readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 They said yes again when Edmiston asked if they'd be guests of honor at a 
fund-raiser at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dale says, "We have a special affinity for these children," it's not 
empty rhetoric. Their daughter Robin, who had Down's syndrome, died when she 
was 2. A disabled son, Sandy, died at 18. Their daughter Debbie was killed in a 
church bus accident when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Invitations to last Sunday's barbecue bore a photo of the couple as they 
appeared in the 26 films they made together, starting in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Happy Trails" benefit was also a wedding anniversary celebration for 
Hollywood's most famous cowboy and cowgirl -- their 47th. They were married on 
Dec. 31, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 (As Dale told it in their new autobiography, "Happy Trails," Roy proposed at a 
Chicago rodeo. "We were on our horses, in the chutes, when Roy said, 'What are 
you doing New Year's Eve?' " He slipped a ring on her finger and galloped into 
the arena before she had time to answer.) 
</P>
<P>
 In his pin-striped cowboy suit, boots and trademark white Stetson, still 
reed-slim if a bit stiff in the knees, Roy Rogers still has his crinkly-eyed 
cowboy charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in love with Roy and Dale my whole life," said Laura Plotkin, 49. 
"He was the first man, after my father, I had a crush on." Today, she'd had a 
chance to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pony rides, sack races, hay rides and Western tunes by the Overland 
Express. Midafternoon, the crowd gathered at the bandstand for a few words from 
Edmiston on behalf of the children with cancer, cerebral palsy, mental 
retardation and other conditions, who have a chance to be "rootin', tootin' 
buckaroos" at "Happy Trails." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston's son David, 20, suffered severe brain damage as a result of 
treatments that cured his leukemia when he was 2. "This camp," she said, "is 
created in his honor and for all the other children who deserve to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time for an impromptu Roy-and-Dale stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale: "When I was a little girl, I used to dream that when I grew up I was 
going to marry Tom Mix. He had the prettiest horse in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy: "That was before Trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke of their own special children. And they exchanged affectionate 
chitchat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy: "I was blessed also with a wonderful horse." Turning to Dale, he hastened 
to add that he wasn't comparing her to Trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale: "Trigger always got top billing." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Roy and Dale led everyone in singing "Happy Trails to You." They 
sounded good. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can still wow a crowd. Young and old flocked around. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad and I used to sit around and watch Roy Rogers and Dale Evans 
(on TV). When they sang 'Happy Trails,' the whole family would break into it," 
recalled Dianne Ford of Malibu. Her daughter, Colleen, a talented 12-year-old, 
belted out a song for the anniversary couple. 
</P>
<P>
 As the band played "I Can't Stop Lovin' You," 12-year-old Elisa Moraes, a 
developmentally disabled child, pushed Ryan Hill, 13, around the dance floor in 
his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was one of the first-year campers. For the first time, said his mother, 
Diane, of Pacific Palisades, "He was part of everything. He can't walk, but he 
can ride a horse, with support." And he could hike. "Pushing a wheelchair at 
9,000 feet gets a little tough, but we tied a sweater to both ends of his chair 
and two people pulled and one pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 At day's end, the white limo whisked Roy and Dale back to the Mojave Desert, 
where there are plans for a RogersDale theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston was pleased. The barbecue will help underwrite this June's camp at 
Coffee Creek Ranch in Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 And the predicted rain had stayed away. She was never really worried, she 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 When she'd called Roy Rogers Jr. (Dusty), about a rain check date, he'd told 
her, "You know, my mom's got connections upstairs." Oy, What a Christmas Party 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Dr. Harold La Briola, 77, a professor at USC School of Medicine, 
said: "We've got a spot in Catholic heaven for him. It's all arranged." 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Diane Fuqua, an orthopedic technologist at the hospital, said: 
"He's our honey." 
</P>
<P>
 He is Dr. Herman Epstein, 88, a retired orthopedic surgeon who is the 
County-USC Medical Center's Jewish Santa Claus. Even though he doesn't believe 
in Christmas, for almost 50 years he's made sure Santa remembers the children 
who do. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tradition that began in 1945 when Epstein, then a resident in 
orthopedics at the hospital, began thinking about how many material things his 
own children had, and how few his pediatric patients possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked our kids if they'd mind if we took their toys" to the youngsters, he 
recalled. Over the years, his little ward party grew so big that it had to be 
moved to the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 In those early days, Epstein played Santa. He and his wife, Beatrice, brought 
peanut butter, milk and cookies, and volunteer nurses made sandwiches. When it 
got "so large I couldn't afford it," he began asking friends and family for 
money or toys. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's party, $18,000 worth of new toys were stacked onstage -- games, 
stuffed animals, trucks, dolls. Mariachis played as the children, all 
orthopedic outpatients, and their families filed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers frantically filled huge Santa sacks with toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 9-year-old boy and two girls, 6 and 8 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Two boys, 7 and 5 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 families, many with three or four children, would go home happy. 
"Feliz Navidad," said the men in the Santa suits -- Epstein's son Norman, 58, 
and family friend Shelly Balzac. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children stopped by to thank Epstein, who sat on the sidelines, fretting, 
"We don't have much of a crowd." It was smaller than in years past, and some 
speculated that Proposition 187 was a factor, although the hospital has tried 
to make clear that it's not turning away illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, as his son suited up, Epstein grew melancholy. His health has been 
frail and, he lamented: "This may be my last year." This would have been the 
50th party, but for one year, 1962, when he was teaching in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 All six of the doctor's offspring have been involved. This year, grandson 
Scott, 35, was a camera-toting elf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're passing it down," said Norman Epstein, Scott's father. "This is going 
to go on for 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, turning to his dad, he asked, "How are we going to let you know?"

 Dodge Avenger. Even the name suggests something dark and unstoppable; a 
turbosled that Mighty Morphin Power Rangers would drive to the store for fresh 
zords and spandex repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenger's grille is low, slotted and seems to be snuffling for warm and furry 
things to eat. It's certainly sinister in black. This coupe scrunches down and 
with its rear spoiler, startled yawns for tailpipes and five-spoke wheels comes 
a promise of pace, haste and things that go romp in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the car is mostly looks. 
</P>
<P>
 And in its attempt to re-enter the market for nifty, sporty coupes, Chrysler 
may have stumbled by equipping Avenger with a combination of engine and 
transmission that is less than sporting and is generally raucous and 
ungentlemanly. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, we're talking top of the line here. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the stiffly sprung Avenger ES with a 155-horsepower V-6 and four-speed 
automatic -- the only transmission sold with the ES, in itself an odd, sloppy 
coupling for a car billed as the mechanical gymnast of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst, Avenger may have splotched a daring recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the past two years of happy glories as Chrysler legitimized handsome 
vulgarity in the Dodge Viper sports car; gave us innovative, cab-forward LH 
sedans and LHS luxury liners; wowed an industry with the honest pep and 
headroom of the Neon subcompact, and last month, introduced Cirrus/Stratus 
twins that combine compact agility with the load factor of a mid-size sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 All were priced with the competition. Most were equipped beyond it. As a crew, 
they formed a hugely successful cluster that has led Chrysler and its divisions 
-- Dodge, Plymouth and Eagle -- from valleys of the shadows of death and 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such triumphs, by contrast, probably magnify shortcomings of the Dodge 
Avenger, soon to be cloned as the softer, more luxurious Chrysler Sebring. 
</P>
<P>
 Base Avengers -- priced at $13,341 -- are propelled by a 2.0-liter in-line 
four producing 140 horsepower. That's either equal to or generally less than 
power offered by sport coupes from Ford, Mazda, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Acura. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad gun of Dodge, however, is not Matt Dillon, but the Avenger ES with the 
firepower of a 2.5-liter V-6. Yet even its 155 horses are far inferior to 
premier versions of Probe (215 horsepower), MX-6 (164), Eclipse (210) and 
Integra (170). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But let's forget figures. The vital element of any personal vehicle is its 
spirit of involvement, the willing communion a car creates with its driver. In 
particular, the rapport a sporty car establishes with an enthusiast driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than communicate, the ES seems to ignore the poor stiff at the wheel, 
greeting our motoring efforts with noise, truculence and moments of 
disinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 The automatic transmission falls three curses short of pure evil. It's 
efficient enough when at peace during dawdling commutes, or when subjected to 
mild authority on relatively open roads. But drop the right foot hard to avoid 
a standard difficulty, ask for action right now, and there's a screeching 
seizure with long moments of little happening before only the middling response 
of 155 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine isn't smooth. It isn't enough to drive a sport coupe weighing 
several hundred pounds more than others in the class. It isn't quiet or 
especially responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 And it certainly isn't the fun usually associated with Probe, Integra and 
others in this category dedicated to inexpensive, athletic motoring for two 
adults and small litters of children or puppies. 
</P>
<P>
 In its defense, a Chrysler spokesman argues that Avenger should be seen as 
more than a sport coupe, replacing the unlamented Daytona. Because Avenger's 
back seats are large enough for upright, conscious adults. Also, the car is 
longer, wider and heavier than, say, Acura's Integra, Chevy's Beretta or Ford's 
Probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore Avenger, claim its salespeople, is something of a nomad bopping 
around the market place, maybe seducing a Honda Accord buyer here, possibly 
snaring a Mustang owner there. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bet your earthquake-insurance check on Avenger denting Camaro or 
Mustang sales. Our ES test car came with a price of $18,781. A full-house 
Camaro Z28, with a V-8 Corvette engine and six-speed manual, can be had for 
only $16,779. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Externally, Avenger is a stunner and borrows the best angles from some very 
fine motor cars. The front end definitely has all the snarl of a Viper. The 
boomerang spoiler and wraparound rear lights are from Dodge Stealth, 
doppelganger of the muscular Mitsubishi 3000GT. 
</P>
<P>
 Internally, things aren't quite so impressive. The cabin is roomy enough, but 
nothing appears original. Who reached into whose parts bin? Seems that 
Avenger's dashboard, instruments, steering wheel and power-window switches are 
borrowings from the Eagle Talon and Mitsubishi Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 The insides are also stark and unstylish, flat, wan and have all those basic, 
obvious visual deficiencies that should have been dumped during the recent 
revitalization of Chrysler and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Our test ES showed enough battleship gray to deserve USN stencilings on the 
door panels. Floor mats, upholstery and dashboard. Duller than zinc. With 
enough acres of gray furry stuff to leave the thought that 7,000 mice probably 
gave their lives to create such a headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Powertrain shortages to one side, the performance of Avenger's systems may be 
rated as a smidge better than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Steering steers, but doesn't amaze one with its precision. Brakes brake, but 
don't feel like anchors. Suspension suspends and is taut enough for sporty 
driving. But a little too choppy for routine moving around ordinary towns. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, a car that's more average than avenging. 
</P>

 In the news: The holidays have arrived in L. A., but it's difficult to tell,

theory."

<P>
 Comedy writer Leslie Coogan, on the man Howard Stern prevented from jumping

INK: HOT SELLERS, SHAKE-UPS, POWER PLAYS 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a year when many more players in the wide world of print came to 
share the vision of a so-called information superhighway, which someday may 
carry text and video traffic from home to home.  
</P>
<P>
 More magazines and newspapers staked a place in this wired future by offering 
on-line extensions of their news-gathering operations. HarperCollins and other 
publishers launched interactive divisions to develop CD-ROMs and book spinoffs 
that need no stitched binding. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even as the electronic horizon came into view, a look back at 1994 
shows bestsellers, magazine shake-ups and corporate power plays were still the 
big stories among ink media. Here are some of the year's greatest hits: 
</P>
<P>
 Crimson Ink: By now stores could set up separate sections to hold books about 
Diana, Charles and the dysfunctional royal family. There were five major titles 
in the burgeoning genre in 1993, and this fall brought five more, including 
Jonathan Dimbleby's authorized bio, "Prince of Wales" (Morrow). 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's Harvest: Conservative magazines such as the American Spectator and 
National Review enjoyed newfound visibility and circulation surges as voices of 
opposition to President Clinton. Celebrity confessions in Vanity Fair and other 
glossies continued to generate pickup coverage in newspapers. But which mag 
walked off with an industry-leading total of three National Magazine Awards? 
Old, reliable Harper's -- for essays and criticism, feature writing and 
fiction. Its ad revenue through October was up 19.2% over the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Movers and Shaken: Richard E. Snyder, the tough chief executive of Simon & 
Schuster, survived internal squabbles and changes in corporate ownership from 
Gulf + Western to Paramount Communications Inc. But soon after Viacom Inc. 
swallowed Paramount, Snyder was fired -- and the book biz rumbled at the exit 
of its most powerful player. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Howard Kaminsky, another publishing heavyweight, resigned for family reasons 
as president of the Hearst Book Group, which includes William Morrow & Co. 
Having suffered months of uncertainty and author defections as Hearst 
considered selling it, Morrow began to regroup under a new publisher, Liz Perle 
McKenna, and a new editorial director, Will Schwalbe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At Random House, it was whispered the company would fold Villard Books, one of 
its many divisions. But the publisher of David Halberstam and Robert Fulghum 
received a new lease when Random House Executive Editor David Rosenthal added 
to his duties as Villard's new publisher -- and signed boxing champ George 
Foreman to write an autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit a Legend: After 31 years as editorial director of the Conde Nast 
magazines (Vogue, Glamour, Vanity Fair and 10 others), the influential 
Alexander Liberman, 81, was succeeded by a 35-year-old upstart, James Truman, 
British editor of Details.  
</P>
<P>
 Exit Another Legend: John Mack Carter, editor in chief of Good Housekeeping 
for two decades, stepped down to concentrate on magazine development at Hearst 
Corp. Succeeding him at the 5-million-circulation giant was Ellen Levine, who 
brought spark to the pages of Redbook. 
</P>
<P>
 More Spanish Read: No single development generated greater interest from 
readers of this column than the belated but growing evidence that New York 
publishers want to reach the Hispanic market. Example: Dell's publication of 
Danielle Steel's "The Gift" in a special Spanish edition. Vintage Books, 
joining with Grupo Santillana of Spain and Latin America, said it would release 
36 fiction titles in Spanish next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Death, Resurrection, Limbo: A market-research study done for Hearst Magazines, 
publisher of Country Living, found that 46% of the population embraces a 
country lifestyle. But Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing still decided to fold Mary 
Emmerling's Country after seven issues . . . RIP, too, to Lear's magazine . . . 
Spy magazine returned from the grave under new ownership . . . Mouth2Mouth -- 
the flashy mag for older teens -- put out two test issues and waited to hear if 
Time Inc. Ventures would give it a full-blown launch.  
</P>
<P>
 Old Faithfuls: People magazine turned 20 . . . American Heritage marked its 
40th anniversary with an engaging (January, 1995) issue that lets Walter 
Cronkite, Richard Reeves and a chorus of other voices size up the past four 
decades . . . Seventeen turned 50 . . . The Daily Racing Form ("America's Turf 
Authority") and Billboard each began their second century. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-ups Awaited: They include George, a political mag being planned by John 
F. Kennedy Jr. and a partner, and This Old House Magazine, being developed by 
Time Inc. Ventures and WGBH Boston, producer of public television's "This Old 
House" series. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Liberal" Media?: Rush Limbaugh was hired by the New York Times to appear 
in a TV ad . . . Times Books, a division of Random House, announced last week 
that it would soon ship about 100,000 copies of "Contract With America: The 
Bold Plan by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Rep. Dick Armey and the House Republicans to 
Change the Nation."

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: REACHING NEW LEVELS OF DUMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's benefit world premiere of New Line Cinema's "Dumb and 
Dumber" at the Cinerama Dome. A party followed at the Hollywood Palladium. This 
is a film that wallows ecstatically in the joy of dopiness. "It's on the 
cutting edge of stupidity," said studio chairman Bob Shaye. 
</P>
<P>
 How Dumb? "We wanted this to be the dumbest premiere of all time," producer 
Brad Krevoy said. "We were going to have the red carpet lead to doors that 
didn't open. Then we decided that wasn't dumb enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels; director Peter 
Farrelly; producers Krevoy, Charles Wessler and Steve Stabler; among the 1,000 
guests were Richard Pryor (who drove himself on an electric three-wheeled 
vehicle), Dennis Miller, Pauly Shore, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Tilly, Stephen 
Baldwin, Rodney Dangerfield, Mike Marcus, Sid Ganis, David Colden, Joely Fisher 
and Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This movie is about two of the dumbest guys you've ever met in your 
life," Daniels said. "The combined IQ of these two characters would be that of 
Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Dumb: Fortunately, the film wasn't merely dumb. It was also tasteless. 
Among the sources of jokes were urine swigging, parakeet decapitation, 
laxatives, blind children, bestiality, flatulence, saliva, belching, death by 
poisoning, and Leslie Abramson. "I hate PC movies," said New Line President 
Mike De Luca. "Humor is for taboo subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "It lives up to its title"; "It was more than dumb. It rose to 
stupidity." And, "Who was the guy who said 'No one ever went broke 
underestimating the taste of the American public?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $150 each and more than $100,000 was raised for 
the Magic Johnson Foundation. The funds will be used for AIDS patient care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz: It's universally expected to be a hit. The timing of the film's release 
is too perfect, coming at a time when the country is dumbing down, was the 
consensus. One guest said that if the country's dumb enough to elect Newt 
Gingrich Speaker of the House, it's dumb enough for this. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wisdom: "For the audience it's intended for, this movie will do 
spectacularly," an exec from a rival studio said. "For the audience it's not 
intended for, who cares?"

 "This is like realizing your dream," said Lilly Tartikoff as she surveyed a 
room filled with celebrities, entertainment industry power brokers and super 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't just the company she was describing. Tartikoff's dream has been 
to fund breast cancer research and increase awareness and education about 
women's health issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In five years she's done that, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night marked the fifth annual Fire and Ice Ball, a black-tie gala to 
raise money for the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program. The event was 
held in two 20th Century Fox sound stages to accommodate a half-hour show of 
Giorgio Armani's spring and summer men's and women's fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1,000-per-person ball is expected to raise $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman, generous guy that he is, kicked in 
another $7.5 million, which will create the Revlon/UCLA Women's Health Research 
Program, as well as continue to support the cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Armani wanted to do something especially for women," Tartikoff said of 
the designer's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thrilled. He's such a perfectionist -- I keep equating him to George 
Balanchine (for whom she danced at the New York City Ballet). It's working with 
another artistic genius. I keep having deja vu. " 
</P>
<P>
 Armani found this "a very big compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 Cold temperatures didn't deter the 1,200 really beautiful people from showing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the audience (instead of on the runway) were models Cindy Crawford, Claudia 
Schiffer, Veronica Webb and Linda Evangelista, as well as Jim Carrey, Robbie 
Robertson, Penny Marshall, Herb Ross and Lee Radziwill, Mariel Hemingway, 
Michelle Pfeiffer, Jay Leno, Ellen DeGeneres, Brendan Fraser, Mickey Rourke and 
Antonio Banderas. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Carrey, "I usually don't do this kind of thing. I came for the cause and 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the show, guests entered another sound stage, this one designed by 
Armani to look like an Italian garden, complete with hedges, fruit-dripping 
candelabra and people dressed in 18th-Century period costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 During speeches, Tartikoff thanked her co-chairs Rupert Murdoch and Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabella Rossellini told emotional stories of her mother Ingrid Bergman's 
struggle with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was a table-hopping festival although some guests actually stayed put 
during the four-course meal and just craned their necks to see who was around. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd included Michael Ovitz, Jon Peters, Mark Canton, Rob Reiner, Barbara 
Davis and daughter Nancy Davis, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, Pia Zadora and, 
from UCLA, Dr. Dennis Slamon and Dr. Susan Love.

CARVING THE SAINTS; NEW MEXICO SANTEROS ARE A VARIED GROUP OF ARTISANS WHO 
CREATE COLORFUL RELIGIOUS IMAGES .  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The complex cultural process whereby present-day New Mexican santos are made 
and marketed is the subject of an ambitious new show at the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Crafting Devotions: Tradition in Contemporary New Mexico Santos," the 
exhibit is an anthropological exploration of how artists, tourists and 
collectors, including museums, are contributing to the popularity of these 
contemporary religious images, inspired by the devotional objects made by 
earlier craftsmen in Catholic New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 According to James Nottage, the Autry's chief curator, the show, which opens 
Saturday, "includes visually compelling objects that illustrate the various 
cultural influences that shape art." He thinks the show will have wide appeal 
"to anyone interested in the vitality of contemporary folk art." The show is 
being presented in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 As Laurie Beth Kalb, who curated the show, explains, the event that brings 
together all the forces involved in the modern santos phenomenon is the Spanish 
Market, held each August and December in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The market begins with a preview at which the participating santeros , or 
saint-makers, compete for the approval of judges from the Spanish Colonial Arts 
Society, founded in the 1920s by Anglo artists and others to encourage the 
traditional crafts of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish Market, like the city's complementary Indian Market, is a huge 
tourist attraction, and it also draws serious collectors of contemporary santos 
. By tradition, the carvers don't sell their work during the preview. But the 
preview is not without its commercial aspects, since a prize can cause a 
carver's work to surge in value. Museum interest also enhances an artist's 
reputation, so much so that some carvers post the business cards given to them 
by curators at the Spanish Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although modern santeros work in a relatively narrow tradition, they are a 
remarkably varied group. "Some have grade-school educations, and some have 
Ph.D.s," Kalb says. Many, but not all, are devout Catholics. Some do not sell 
their work, but carve and paint only for churches, friends or family. At one 
time, all santeros were men, but that too is changing. Highly respected santera 
Gloria Lopez Cordova started out carving under the name of a male relative. 
Many women who paint the carvings of their husbands have begun adding their 
signatures to the works as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kalb's view, this heterogeneity accounts for much of the vitality of 
today's santos . Contemporary santos -making, she says, "encompasses tradition, 
diversity and change, and that's what keeps it flourishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many modern santeros also make furniture and non-religious objects, 
traditional santos take two basic forms: carved wooden sculptures, called 
bultos, and flat paintings on wood, called retablos.  
</P>
<P>
 Artists in what was then northern New Spain began making their own santos in 
the 18th Century when official church supplies dried up. Those early colonial 
santos were displayed only on altars in churches or in the homes of the pious. 
The modern tradition began with the founding of the Spanish Colonial Arts 
Society. Many of the early works of the santos revival were left unpainted, 
Kalb points out, because the bright colors associated with traditional santos 
"were thought to be too gaudy for Anglo tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the 1970s emerged a generation of santero activists who were 
interested in exploring the roots of the tradition they were continuing. "They 
attempted to take back ownership of their tradition," Kalb says. A major result 
was that color returned to the santos. Collectors loved it. As she notes, some 
carvers now do abstract, unpainted pieces that hearken back to the fine-arts 
influences of the 1920s revival. Ironically, this work tends to be of little 
interest to today's collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalb, who is the former curator of folk art at the Autry, acknowledges that 
her role made her an integral part of the process she observed for more than a 
decade. She would chose choice pieces for the museum at the Spanish Market, 
such as Victor Goler's "Our Lady of Mt. Carmel," which took first prize in 
1992. Kalb is now director of the New England Folklife Center in Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Goler says that there are a couple of dozen first-rate santeros working in the 
Santa Fe area today. A resident of Taos, Goler, 31, was raised in a family of 
art conservators and restorers who specialized in traditional santos. By the 
time he was in his teens, he says, "I was fixing fingers on saints." 
</P>
<P>
 Goler began carving while still in high school, making saints for his friends 
and family. "The first pieces I ever carved were replicas of early ones," he 
says. Today, he honors tradition by making sure that any religious habits he 
depicts are accurate, and limiting himself to the time-honored symbols 
associated with particular saints. But he also finds distinctive ways to 
re-create moments from the saints' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His style is always evolving, Goler says. One change is the gift of time. "I 
can carve better hands, better lips, better faces, more folds in the costumes," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, tourists are part of the cultural equation in Santa Fe. 
According to Kalb, visitors to the Autry show will be invited to board an 
actual bus like the ones that take tourists from the home workshop of one 
carver to another, "to learn how New Mexico is sold to tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 As a santero, Goler isn't unduly disturbed by the part tourists play in the 
process. "I tend to hide out," he says. He also thinks consumers, including 
Anglos, have an important role to play in the complex dance that keeps his art 
alive, helps satisfy his religious faith and puts food on his table. "It takes 
both groups to make it work," he says. "The Hispanics feel it's their 
tradition, but it has to be shared as well." Where and When

LINKED WITH NATURE; DEANNE BELINOFF AND SAM ERENBERG CONVEY THEIR SPIRITUAL 
OBSERVATIONS IN A SHOW AT PLATT GALLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beauty in art need not always come in the form of a pretty picture. It can be 
found in much more abstract depictions of our connections to nature and to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanne Belinoff and Sam Erenberg see the magnificence in our relationships to 
the Earth and the sky, to the past and the future. In their exhibit at the 
University of Judaism's Platt Gallery, "Fragments and Notations: recent work by 
Deanne Belinoff and Sam Erenberg," they convey such observations in different 
but highly complementary bodies of work based on their personal bonds to the 
people, places, things and ideas they hold dearly in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is part of "Towards a Greater Realm," a series of 11 shows taking 
place this fall throughout Southern California that focus on spirituality, myth 
and inner journeys as expressed in contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 Erenberg's most prominent work on display, the oil on wood panels "Alphabet of 
the Angels," presents symbolic images of the Hebrew alphabet. He created the 
piece out of a combined fascination with aspects of religion and science. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in archeology and anthropology," Erenberg said. "Whether it's 
painting, sculpture, installations or book making, I like to bring in as much 
as possible in my work. This piece came from visits to archeological sites -- 
Asian, Egyptian, Pre-Columbian, Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally significant, "Alphabet of the Angels" also reflects his reading of the 
Cabala, a Jewish mystical interpretation of Scriptures that was developed by 
medieval rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes from the Book of Splendor in the Zohar, a medieval text that began 
to be written in early 14th-Century Spain by Moses de Leon, a Jewish mystic," 
Erenberg said. "These symbols become part of his toric events in people's 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Erenberg has also spent "many years collecting images of nature," he said. In 
recent years, he has scanned some of the images into a computer, intensified 
them, and printed them out. In this show, there are two works formed by a 
series of six small images each -- his own abstracted views of our cosmology. 
In both works, each panel contains a word from the phrase, "In the Year of The 
Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel like something in the distant past or the far future at the same 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the show are three books Erenberg has created. Two are collaborations 
with his late father, Arthur, who wrote the "Grin and Bear It" comic for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the father-son collaborations, "Other Fantasies," sports a picture of 
boxer George Foreman, who, it happens, has become a boxing champ again during 
the run of this exhibit. "That's quite Cabalistic, that coincidence," Erenberg 
said. "The idea of chance is a big part of my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance is also an important aspect of Belinoff's astute contemplation of 
humanity's relationship with nature. In her installation, which she dedicated 
to her father, she created what she calls "Homologies" -- correspondences in 
structure or origin -- by bringing together elements from the human and natural 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 A latex hand holds a tree branch. A brain cactus is paired with the picture of 
a human brain, a piece of quartz with a dental mold of teeth, a stone with a 
latex nipple. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants people to recognize, she said, that "such objects as a tongue and 
leaf are deeply and originally associated in more than the aesthetic sense." 
She added, "I feel so strongly about us needing to connect with the natural 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 These pieces were formed as a "matter of coincidence and synchronicity," she 
said. "I have always collected the parts. I have always taken photographs. They 
came together very magically. I had such faith in the putting together of this 
installation. When I'm working well, I feel I'm collaborating with something I 
know about but can't put a name to." Where and When

STAGE FOR LATINO TALENT; IMMIGRANTS FIND A CREATIVE OUTLET IN CONSTELACION. 
ACTING GROUP HOPES TO INCREASE APPRECIATION OF THEATER IN THE SPANISH-SPEAKING 
COMMUNITY.

<P>
 Francisco Tenorio is weeping openly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, my God?" he cries. "Why now that I've turned my life around?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the jampacked auditorium of Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando, 
approximately 250 people of all ages raptly follow the plight of Tenorio, who 
has led a life of debauchery in the drama played onstage, and now has infected 
his wife, played by Araceli Ochoa, with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the skit, written by Tenorio and Ochoa, the audience claps 
enthusiastically, and the pair bows, their pride obvious in their beaming 
faces. They have never performed before such a big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is difficult to imagine that a scant four months ago these two 
people were strangers, brought together in a San Fernando church in response to 
an advertisement for free acting lessons in Spanish -- lessons they hoped would 
help them cope with their painful shyness. 
</P>
<P>
 This night, as part of "Latino Talent Night," Tenorio and Ochoa are two of 
almost 60 students who are making a reality of Ivan Olivares' dream of 
promoting Latino talent and building an audience for theater in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares, 37, of Canoga Park, a psychologist and actor in his native Peru, is 
the mastermind behind Constelacion, a theater group that offers free acting 
lessons to nearly 100 students in San Fernando and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception 2 1/2 years ago, more than 500 people have "graduated" 
from Constelacion's rigorous four-month classes, where two instructors meet 
every week with about 50 to 60 students per class and carefully lead them 
through the basics of acting, from "uninhibiting" exercises to three year-end 
performances that are now attended by hundreds in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on two levels," says Olivares, who immigrated six years ago from 
Peru, where he also directed a Constelacion theater group. Here in the Valley, 
he said, with the help of several churches that lend their auditoriums for 
classes and performances, "we promote theater and its appreciation in the 
Latino community, and at the same time, we discover and promote new talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant director Juan Zepeda takes the goal of the group a step further: 
"Many Latinos don't have the means or the space for positive activities. Many 
of us, before coming here, went from our home to our job and back. Here we 
offer an option for people to develop their intellect." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Sapien, who travels two hours every Friday from Long Beach to the 
Valley to make the three-hour lessons, thoroughly agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a truck driver," he explains. "We're rough people. But here I've learned 
about poetry and culture. I've come to know a different world." 
</P>
<P>
 All of Constelacion's students are Latino immigrants -- although this is not a 
requirement -- and they vary in age and come from all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent rehearsal brought together high school students, cooks, engineers and 
factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here because my wife saw the ad . . . and she wanted me to bring our 
children," says Juan Vasquez, a father of two teen-age sons. "But they left and 
I stayed," he says laughing. "I never thought I'd be in something like this, 
but I feel like I'm born again." 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, most students credit the lessons with making them more 
assertive and even better at their jobs, something founder Olivares can 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, theater is not only for actors," Olivares says. "It's a technique 
that can be used by people who want to better themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of their original motivation for attending Constelacion, once they 
finish the classes, most students want to continue in theater, and many have 
professional aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day of class," says Araceli Ochoa, "they had us work on the 
'uninhibiting technique.' We had to act like dogs, like children, like 
everything! I had always liked theater, but I never thought you had to do this 
kind of stuff. That first day, I almost left. I thought, 'If my family sees me 
doing this, they'll think I've lost my mind.' But I decided to stay, and now I 
feel this theater thing is like a drug. You want more every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Constelacion's classes may be free, but there is nothing improvised about 
them. The uninhibiting exercises that kick off the program are designed to 
break communication barriers. Students then go on to dramatic and character 
exercises. They are gradually exposed to an audience and receive a monthly 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares thinks his program is just as good as any of the better-known 
English-language counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give Spanish speakers the same kind of training English speakers 
get," he says. "So before we started, we did some 'spying' and enrolled in 
(several private theatrical) academies and colleges to compare our style and 
make sure we were competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares and his crew regularly send their students out on theater and 
television auditions, and some of them are already working regularly on local 
Spanish-language television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares, who has a day job as a nurse's assistant at the Motion Picture and 
Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills, has already invested about $2,000 
out of his own pocket into the venture. At this point, students buy their own 
costumes, make their own sets and use the lighting available at the churches. 
But make no mistake, Olivares has big plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, aside from the basic theater program, Constelacion will offer more 
advanced lessons, for a fee, and a program for theater promoters who plan to 
establish Constelacion groups in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, I truly believe this will work," says Olivares. "We will work with 
the audience we've built and will continue to build, and we will dispel the 
myth that Latinos don't go to the theater." Where and When

AN INSPIRED START; SEEING LOUIS ARMSTRONG PERFORM LAUNCHED TIGER OKOSHI ON A 
LIFELONG INFATUATION WITH JAZZ. HE'LL PLAY AT LA VE LEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Armstrong was a trailblazer. As the first major soloist in jazz, he has, 
at least indirectly, served as the primary musical model for most of the jazz 
players who followed him. But in the case of Tiger Okoshi, the influence was 
more immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Okoshi was a 13-year-old living in Japan, when he traveled with his family to 
Kyoto and heard the famed Armstrong. The experience was the springboard for the 
life as a jazz musician he lives today. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had this big, big smile, and I didn't understand any of the music or the 
lyrics he was singing," said Okoshi. "There were so many American people in the 
audience, and compared to Japanese audiences, Americans are much closer to this 
music, and after five or 10 minutes, it felt like we had been together for 
days. So it was a big question for me: How did he make this happen, make all 
these people happy?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Okoshi had been playing trumpet for just six months. After the 
concert, he found he had as much fondness for Armstrong's likeness as he did 
for his music. "Every night I looked at Satchmo's smiling face on a photograph 
from a movie I had by my bed," the now 44-year-old Okoshi recalled in a phone 
interview from Niihama, Japan, where he was touring. "I'd say good night to 
him, and then good morning to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Okoshi, who plays tonight and Saturday at La Ve Lee, later encountered other 
trumpeters. Among them were Herb Alpert -- "I played his 'Tijuana Brass' music 
in high school and the girls went crazy" -- Kenny Dorham, Lee Morgan -- 
"Something about his open tone reminded me of Louis" -- and Miles Davis -- 
"especially his 'Live at the Fillmore' period." He incorporated the last three 
influences into his style, which is based on long strands of notes, a bright, 
compelling sound and crisp, rhythmic phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trumpeter still felt moved enough by Armstrong to record an album of 
tunes by, or associated with, the man who was affectionately called "Pops." 
Okoshi's 1993 "Echoes of a Note" (JVC Records) features such notables as 
guitarist Mike Stern and drummer Peter Erskine delivering solid contemporary 
versions of classics such as "Hello, Dolly," "St. James Infirmary" and "What a 
Wonderful World." 
</P>
<P>
 That album, Okoshi said, opened his ears to a new way of making music. He had 
long been accenting the contemporary aspect of jazz, playing more fusion style, 
getting "more into arrangements and danceable grooves." 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to feel that that was not enough, that it was mostly soloist and 
background," he said. "So on that album I found I wanted to concentrate not on 
what I was doing as a soloist, but how I carried on a musical conversation 
with, how I reacted to, the great musicians around me. I felt like for many 
years I was developing my speech, and there I stopped talking and started to 
listen and to make conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At La Ve Lee, Okoshi will make his first Los Angeles appearance in 14 years. 
His last was "probably before the Civil War," he quipped, referring to a 
performance with vibist Gary Burton in 1980. The trumpeter, who has lived in 
Boston since 1972, will work with a quartet that includes guitarist Jeff 
Richman, bassist Jimmy Earl and drummer Joel Taylor. The group will play pieces 
from "Echoes of a Note" and from Okoshi's new album, "Two Sides to Every Story" 
(also on JVC). "I'll want to feel my way around the audience," said Okoshi. "If 
they want something harder, something loud, maybe I'll solo for 20 minutes. But 
these days, I'm playing soft songs softer, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Okoshi has garnered plenty of critical acclaim. Bill Milkowski, who has 
written for down beat, Jazz Is and other magazines, wrote in the liner notes to 
"Two Sides" that Okoshi plays "with emotive power and soulful nuance." 
</P>
<P>
 The musician started to learn trumpet when he wanted to join his school's 
marching band at age 12. "I picked up this dirty trumpet and made a sound," he 
said, sounding happy at the memory. In high school, he worked leading various 
bands, and in 1972 he came to the United States to study at the Berklee College 
of Music in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Okoshi says he loves jazz "because it gives me the freedom to speak up. Music 
is a tool for me to reach people. It's a beautiful way to go around the world, 
offering some kind of message." Where and When

NOTHING BUT THE BLUES; SINCE THE '60S, WHEN HE SCOFFED AT THE BEATLES, SINGER 
AND HARMONICA PLAYER JAMES HARMAN'S LOVE OF A MUSICAL FORM HAS SHAPED HIS LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's something altogether fitting about blues man James Harman gig Saturday 
aB. King's Blues Club. Back in the '60s, Harman was just another white 
youngster playing blues classics, although talented and fortunate enough to 
find himself touring as the opening act for B. B. King. 
</P>
<P>
 One day backstage, while they listened to tapes together, King suggested that 
Harman focus on singing his own material. "Where would I be if I only did 
T-Bone Walker songs?" Harman remembers King telling him. "I never would have 
become B. B. " 
</P>
<P>
 That was advice the young singer and harmonica player immediately accepted. 
Now 48, Harman spends an average of 250 nights a year performing passionate 
blues numbers he's written himself, though deeply influenced by such masters as 
Walker, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who lives in Huntington Beach, has also adopted King's habit of 
encouraging new talent. His band's new guitar player is 19-year-old Robby 
Eason, nicknamed "Sugar Boy." He was discovered one night by Harman two years 
ago during a gig at the Belly Up in Solana Beach, when Eason (accompanied by 
his mother) climbed the stage during a jam session and stunned the bandleader 
with his passionate playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said this is the next guy," Harman says. "I didn't even audition anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable Los Angeles music figures have passed through Harman's band, 
from the late Hollywood Fats to a group of eager young players who later became 
the Blasters. Before that band of players -- Dave and Phil Alvin, Bill Bateman 
and John Bazz -- were signed to Slash Records, and became major cult figures on 
the local club scene, Harman helped them record 22 songs on his tape machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you call it producing," Harman says. "I turned on the tape 
machine, moved the microphones around, and we all just stood around." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's own musical life began early, with piano lessons by the time he was 4 
and singing in the church choir soon after. By 1962, he'd left his native 
Alabama for Panama City, Fla., where he painted on a mustache to persuade club 
owners that he was old enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
 He had discovered the blues. "When you turn on the radio and hear Perry Como 
singing, you know that's not it. I luckily flipped that dial one more notch and 
got Muddy Waters." 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, other styles of music arrived, but Harman was unmoved. 
"By the time '64 and the Beatles came around, they were like a joke to me," 
Harman says. "It sounded like an amateur garage band. I was never reached by 
the hippie music scene at all." 
</P>
<P>
 He still laughs over his memories of the Byrds, for whom he opened once in the 
South, and their suede outfits. "These guys were dressed like some kind of 
supernatural characters." Byrd member David Crosby, he says, once demanded a 
pencil so he could scratch his head without mussing his styled hair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the '60s were largely a good time to be playing the blues, with such 
British bands as the Rolling Stones, Cream and others embracing the American 
musical style and incorporating it into their own sound. "We thought that was 
funny, these British guys with long hair playing the blues. But we could tell 
that they didn't just listen to the records, they heard them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of white kids got turned on to the blues through these groups, so it 
was very beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 The next decade was a less hospitable time, as disco and the "urban cowboy" 
phase of country music distracted listeners. Paying gigs were fewer, and it 
became harder for Harman and his ilk to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the '70s were over, he had divorced and found himself in the hospital 
with a drinking problem and bleeding ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost died," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Harman is healthy and he and his band are busy, on the road and 
recording regularly for the Black Top blues label. 
</P>
<P>
 He's released nearly a dozen albums thus far, and enjoyed some regional hits. 
And one of his songs, "Kiss of Fire," was used in the Academy Award-winning 
film "The Accused." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stays close to home during the winter months, no longer willing to risk 
the icy roads of the East Coast. "This is when I make my records, this is when 
I play my home games," he says of his months in California. "All I ever wanted 
to do was sing songs that I made up and get the best guys I could to play it."

COVER STORY; FALL IN LOVE; THE AIR IS CRISP AND CLEAR, SUGGESTING A ROMANTIC 
OUTING, AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACESWHERE THE ATMOSPHERE FOR A DATE IS IDEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 In a Los Angeles autumn, there aren't too many opportunities to gaze at 
changing leaves or crunch them underfoot on a long walk -- at least not like 
there are back East. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty of ways to exploit the season's potential for romance. 
The crisp evening air and clear view of the mountains ought to be enough to 
inspire any self-respecting romantic (and even a few skeptics). 
</P>
<P>
 There are a variety of priorities for a good fall date. Some are fans of cool 
nights and warm fires; others prefer to return to the outdoors now that 
oppressive summer temperatures have flown south for the winter, and then there 
are those who choose to enjoy the vistas, recently emerged out of the summer 
smog, from the privacy of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 great fall dates. Candlelight and Firelight  
</P>
<P>
 Any romantic fall evening should include a fireplace. Some good ones are: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1. AROMA COFFEE & TEA CO. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a pretty terrace, decorated with plants and trees, Aroma sports 
a back annex decorated like a living room. So while eating pastries and sipping 
lattes, customers can cuddle on the couch in front of the fire, or curl up in 
the big chairs for some cozy conversation. And take your time. You are unlikely 
to be rushed at this lovely cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday to Saturday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. 4360 
Tujunga Ave., Studio City. (818) 508-6505.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 2. BIG OAKS LODGE 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in the Angeles National Forest, this weekend-only dinner restaurant 
provides both a woodsy atmosphere, complete with rock fireplace, and wonderful 
opportunities for walks. Come early and enjoy the forest before it gets dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 6 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday only. Price: average $13 per person. 
33101 Bouquet Canyon, Saugus. (805) 296-5656.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 3. INN OF THE SEVENTH RAY 
</P>
<P>
 This lush Topanga hideaway caters to vegetarians -- about 50% of the menu is 
meatless -- but has something for everyone. With gourmet natural foods, a 
fountain courtyard (with heaters for when the temperature drops) and a creek 
running right by the building, the Inn fills the romantic bill. In addition to 
a wood-burning stove in the original A-frame building, the Inn has a room with 
a large, open fireplace and has recently added a plexiglass ceiling -- perfect 
for stargazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 6 to 10 p.m. for dinner daily; 10:30 
a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday brunch; 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday brunch. Price: for 
lunch, $12 (average) per person; for dinner, $25 (average) per person; for 
brunch, $15 (average) per person. 128 Old Topanga Canyon Road, Topanga. (310) 
455-1311.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 4. SADDLE PEAK LODGE 
</P>
<P>
 If a romantic -- and extravagant -- dinner is in order, try the rustic, woodsy 
Saddle Peak. Although it's called a lodge, and sports a massive stone 
fireplace, it's not exactly a drop-by-after-fishing type of establishment. If 
there's any doubt about how special this place is, manager Lennart Lehman says 
that there are marriage proposals at least once a week. "Lately they're all 
saying yes, so it must be working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: If dinner is out of your price range, but you still want to check out 
Saddle Peak, head in for a drink at the small bar. The bar, which has about 10 
seats, does not serve food, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 6 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday; 6 to 9:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 
11 a.m to 2 p.m. Sunday brunch; 5 to 9 p.m. Sunday dinner. Price: for dinner 
Wednesday to Sunday, average of $50 per person; for Sunday brunch, $19.95 per 
person. Dress code: No jeans, sweats or shorts. 419 Cold Canyon Road, 
Calabasas. (310) 456-7325.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 5. TRULY YOURS, TARZANA 
</P>
<P>
 If the small rooms, vaulted ceiling and hip art don't provide enough ambience 
at this trendy eatery, check out the fireplace in the back room. (There is 
another fireplace in the main room, but there's a table in front of it, so it's 
only lit when the restaurant isn't busy and someone requests it.) 
</P>
<P>
 And with late hours, Truly Yours can be a great place for a fireside 
after-dinner coffee and dessert. Try the chocolate bag for two -- Belgian 
chocolate formed like a paper sack and filled with gelati and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and 
Saturday. Price: average of $14 per person; desserts average about $4.95. 18588 
Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. (818) 996-3131.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 6. VINCENT HILL STATION 
</P>
<P>
 You have your choice of fireplaces in this restaurant, decorated like an 
old-fashioned train station complete with antique wood tables and train 
cabooses out back. One fireplace is in the main dining room, there's one in the 
bar area, and a small, more private room (to be completed soon) will have a 
wood-burning stove. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 3:30 to 10 p.m. daily. Price: average of $12 per person. 553 Sierra 
Highway, Acton. (805) 272-4799. Romantic Walks  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some outdoor spots to take in the cooler temperatures, as recommended 
in "Walking Los Angeles: Adventures on the Urban Edge" by John McKinney, The 
Times' hiking columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7. ORCUTT RANCH HORTICULTURE CENTER 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Sombre del Roble was once a 200-acre vacation retreat owned by 
William Orcutt, the geologist who found the La Brea Tar Pits. The large adobe 
house, gravel paths, gardens, fountains and statues make for a lush and lovely 
walk. Make sure to follow the trail to the creek and rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Ventura Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard and head north to Roscoe 
Boulevard. Turn west on Roscoe Boulevard. Park entrance is at 23600 Roscoe. 
Open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed major holidays.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 8. SERRANIA RIDGE TRAIL 
</P>
<P>
 At the southern edge of Woodland Hills is a patch of a park with fantastic 
views of the Valley. Head south on the path along the eastern side of the park, 
toward Mulholland Highway, and enjoy the panorama. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Ventura Freeway to De Soto Avenue and turn south. The street becomes 
Serrania Avenue after you cross Ventura Boulevard. Park is about one mile down. 
Cheap Thrills 
</P>
<P>
 Here are two of the best places in the Valley to, well, "park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9. TOPANGA CANYON BOULEVARD VISTA 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of romantic pull-offs as you head south along Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard, with beautiful views of the hills behind and the West Valley below. 
On a clear night, one of the most spectacular is the view of the Valley from 
the Topanga Overlook, the first turnout as you leave the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10. MULHOLLAND DRIVE 
</P>
<P>
 Along the north side of the roadway, especially just east of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard, are a few key areas to pull off and enjoy one of the most beautiful 
nighttime views of the Valley floor.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: LOTS IN STORE AT OUTLETS; GIFT-BUYING CAN BE WRAPPED UP 
AT A SINGLE DESTINATION. FACTORY MALLS OFFER A GOOD MIX OF MERCHANDISE AT OFTEN 
HEFTY DISCOUNTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Shoppers, it seems, are always searching for convenience, and one-stop 
shopping is a com mon goal. General stores, department stores, malls -- they 
all offer the promise of one-stop shopping, and all malls want a "good mix." 
</P>
<P>
 When you can combine these two requirements -- one stop and a good mix -- with 
good value, you've got a winner. At no time during the year is this combination 
needed as much as during the holiday season. So how about a full day at a 
factory outlet mall to finish off the holiday shopping list? 
</P>
<P>
 A drive to the Desert Hills Factory Stores in Cabazon, outside of Palm 
Springs, could fill the bill. Clean desert air, sparkling sunshine and some 
upscale labels at greatly reduced prices; how's that for a good mix? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach, Donna Karan, Adrienne Vittadini, Barbizon, Anne Klein, Jones New York, 
Adolfo, Esprit and Guess? are some of the outstanding labels for women. For men 
there's Eddie Bauer, Brooks Brothers, Dockers, Van Heusen and A / X Armani. 
You'll find bargains on just about all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 For gift-giving, top labels can impress recipients. Give her a Donna Karan 
jacket that retails for $850 and she'll be thrilled, even though you only paid 
$385 for it at the outlet store. 
</P>
<P>
 If she adores Coach handbags, there are many to choose from. All the inventory 
has slight flaws in the leather, but I couldn't see any of them. Deduct 30% for 
those flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 At Esprit we found some remarkable deals, such as denim overalls that started 
at $58 and were down to $10.50. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Brooks Brothers outlet, their only West Coast factory store, the 
merchandise is all first quality, and many items are regular Brooks Brothers 
stock reduced about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the Movado watch outlet. Prices are reduced 25% to 65% on all the 
inventory, which consists of discontinued styles. A woman's watch that had sold 
for $3,900 was $2,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear comfortable shoes -- there's a lot of walking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lot easier to circumnavigate The Citadel, in the City of Commerce, 
which is not such a long drive from the San Fernando Valley, and there's a good 
mix of stores for everyone. If you have a woman age 15 to 30 on your list, you 
are bound to score at the Betsey Johnson outlet. The current season's 
merchandise is only 20% off, but if you go to last season's goods, the tag will 
reflect a reduction of 80% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of doors away from Betsey Johnson, you'll find Primetime, where we 
couldn't believe the prices on top-name watches. This wholesale operation 
offered a man's Fendi watch that retailed at $685 for $150. Other reductions 
were not quite as dazzling but well worth the drive. Check out the Armani 
sunglasses for $110. 
</P>
<P>
 All the way to the rear of the Max Studio outlet, we found fantastic buys on 
last season's lines, marked 50% to 80% off the original prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Bargains in kitchenware, china, crystal, linens, lingerie, books and perfumes 
are all included in this outdoor mall setup. 
</P>
<P>

BRING ON THE LIGHTS; ALTHOUGH HARD-HIT BY THE QUAKE, MANY CANDY CANE LANE 
RESIDENTS SAY HOMES WILL GLOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the day after Thanksgiving, and it's a beautiful day in Dave and Cathy 
Rodgers' neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Strings of Christmas lights are being wrapped around houses, trees and white 
picket fences. Plywood figures of Disney, Peanuts and Sesame Street characters 
are popping up on front lawns. And Santa Claus is standing 19 feet tall at his 
annual post, the corner of Oakdale Avenue and Martha Street. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is no ordinary neighborhood. This is "Candy Cane Lane," an 
eight-square-block area of Woodland Hills renowned for its Las Vegas-like 
display of colored lights and other lavish holiday decorations every December. 
</P>
<P>
 Since residents began a tradition of decorating en masse in the early 1950s, 
generations of Southern California residents have flocked to the upper-middle 
class community just southeast of Pierce College and north of the Ventura 
Freeway. They cruise past homes with their headlights dimmed and their eyes 
aglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things that, if it was gone, it would be disappointing to 
so many people," said Dave Rodgers, who moved his family to Jumilla Avenue in 
1975. "That's what makes this so special." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, perhaps, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers and his wife had to move out of their house for more than three months 
after the Northridge earthquake while more than $125,000 in repairs were made. 
Dozens of other of the community's ranch-style houses, built in the early 
1950s, were similarly damaged and several remain vacant. The rubble of 
collapsed chimneys and other brickwork remains a neighborhood presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there figure to be a few dark spots on Candy Cane Lane this season. But 
most of those fortunate enough to be home for Christmas say the lights show 
must go on. And they plan to do what they can to make up for those who won't be 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking forward to the holidays this year more than any other year," 
Cathy Rodgers said. "This area got hammered so hard, we figured if we made it 
this far, we'd really deck it out." 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents of the four streets that make up Candy Cane Lane -- 
Penfield, Lubao, Oakdale and Jumilla avenues -- the notion of not decorating is 
absurd. Over the years, circumstances ranging from the energy crisis of the 
mid-1970s to a rash of vandalism a few years ago have had a brief chilling 
effect on the decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic also has created problems. For many years, the Los Angeles Department 
of Transportation dispatched traffic officers to help with congestion around 
Candy Cane Lane, and members of the Los Angeles Police Department added 
assistance on a volunteer basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But police stopped helping about five years ago, according to Mary Moss, a 
transportation supervisor, and the transportation department is short-staffed 
and can no longer manage the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't afford to fund it anymore," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the spirit prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year it was just dark, nobody decorated," Jean Harwood, a Lubao Avenue 
resident since 1951, recalled of the year in which the energy crisis dampened 
spirits. "Oh, it was just awful. We were afraid it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Bergstrom, who lives across the street from Dave and Cathy Rodgers, 
decided to forgo decorating one year because she was having a new roof 
installed. "I felt like such a Scrooge," she said. "I felt like it wasn't even 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, Bergstrom said, she has spotted a flyer urging neighbors to 
curtail decorating in deference to those still scrambling to recover from the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rush, whose Lubao Avenue house served as the polling site for the Nov. 8 
election, said the topic was on the lips of almost every resident that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was talking about it -- whether to decorate or not decorate," Rush 
said. "But I'd say, maybe, about 10% of the people said they wouldn't decorate 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, for some who have moved back home, decorating has had to take a 
back seat to more important tasks such as painting, cleaning and settling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Grover, a general contractor who has lived on Oakdale Avenue since 
1984, with his wife Debbie and two daughters, sustained more than $150,000 in 
damage to their house. In addition to making their own repairs, Grover's 
company is doing the work on 13 other houses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that was brick just fell apart -- all of it," Grover said. "I 
never thought we could be hit so hard. From what I've seen, I think (the 
earthquake damage) is going to affect this season. Some people are not even 
living in their homes. And some people are so stressed out with anxiety, they 
can't even think about decorations." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, recovery can only be enhanced by decorating. Judy Gray, who has 
lived near the corner of Jumilla and Martha avenues since 1971, was displaced 
for eight months while her house underwent more than $160,000 worth of repairs. 
Gray re-entered her home in late September and has been planning her 
decorations ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I ordered a bunch of new stuff, including a three-piece wooden 
train . . . and reindeer," Gray said. "And I'm going to replace whatever I 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 It all should mix well with Gray's surviving figures of Snow White and the 
Seven Dwarfs and the sign that she erects each year that proclaims Jumilla 
"Avenue of the Bells." 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about (the flyer) a few days ago," Gray said. "I just don't 
understand it. If you don't want to decorate, fine. But it's been such a 
(lousy) year, if anything, I think you should decorate more . 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine Christmas around here without all of this." Where to Go 
</P>
<P>
 What: Christmas decorations along "Candy Cane Lane." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Penfield, Lubao, Oakdale and Jumilla avenues in Woodland Hills. East 
of Winnetka and west of Corbin avenues, between Oxnard and Martha streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Many residents start decorating by Dec. 1. Although there is no 
official time for lights to go on, residents generally display lighting from 
dusk until about 10 p.m.

TEACHING BY EXAMPLE; WHILE THE HOLIDAYS CAN HELP INSTRUCT CHILDREN ABOUT 
TOLERANCE, EXPERTS SAY IT'S BEST LEARNED IN EVERYDAY BEHAVIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The holidays may seem like a natural time to teach children the basics of 
tolerance. On many streets, blue and white light displays stand next to the red 
and green, stimulating children to ask about the celebrations of other 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are useful ways to use such questions as a stimulus to discuss the 
historic richness of other religions, experts say tolerance is actually taught 
to children primarily through the adult behavior and conversation they witness 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tolerance is very difficult to teach," said Dee Shepherd-Look, a clinical 
psychologist and psychology professor at Cal State Northridge. "It's learned 
mostly by watching their parents treat and talk about people who are 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Most children identify closely with their parents and tend to develop 
attitudes about politics and religion that are similar to their adult models' 
-- at least until mid-adolescence, Shepherd-Look said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are especially attentive to the way people talk about other cultures 
and to the underlying messages in jokes that have racial or ethnic overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have to be mindful all the time of what they are conveying," said 
Gerald Margolis, director of the Museum of Tolerance in West Los Angeles. 
"Children are keen observers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Woken, pastor at the Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church in West 
Hills, said parents need to define what they would like their children to 
understand about their own world view and religion. The risk some parents take 
in thinking about their personal perspective is that they often discover they 
do not have a faith of their own, or have not spent much time considering their 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the parents really have to make that journey first, on their own," Woken 
said. Margolis, too, said parents who are interested in fostering tolerance in 
their children need to first examine their own attitudes and comfort levels 
regarding the variety of populations that live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents need to create "points of engagement" -- ways in which the children 
can actually work with others from different cultures in a meaningful way. 
Doing something together is far more valuable than just walking through an art 
exhibit featuring work by those of a different culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to give children such opportunities for real-world contact is to 
find ways they can work together on a project with a mutual goal, Shepherd-Look 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests that parents encourage children to invite friends of diverse 
backgrounds over to play and try to find scouting groups or other community 
activities that will offer meaningful time with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Woken suggests that parents ask their friends who acknowledge holidays 
different from theirs to include the family in their celebrations when they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children who have long celebrated Christmas can appreciate the lighting of the 
menorah and playing dreidel games, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warns that in sharing traditions, some families may find they have so 
secularized their holiday festivities that they are left with little that 
explains their religious base. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd-Look also suggests that parents provide explicit teaching about 
others, including taking their children to places such as the Museum of 
Tolerance, and specifically pointing out the common goals that all humans 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 She also recommends giving children cross-cultural toys, such as dolls 
representing other ethnicities, or board games based on the world's geography 
and divergent cultures. But none of these approaches is a quick fix for 
incipient intolerance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When children do express a lack of tolerance, Shepherd-Look suggests parents 
try to help them feel empathetic to the other person's perspective or 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of intolerance in children is often based in their own insecurity, 
she said, and studies have shown that children with high self-esteem are more 
tolerant of others.

CLUB SCENE; LESS STRESS WITH A BEER AND A SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes the best way to spend Friday night is at the local pub eating, 
drinking and relieving stress. At Adam's Rib in Encino, the crowd certainly 
subscribes to that philosophy. The bar is a no-frills place with fun 
entertainment -- a good place to pass an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: One large bar serves everything, but the drink of choice is beer, 
plain and simple. Dollar bills with messages scrawled on them are stapled to 
much of the available ceiling space and behind the bar. Popular statements 
include "I love (fill in the blank)," along with assorted sorority and 
fraternity symbols. More creative sayings include "Money for Nothing," and "Jus 
2 Hot," and more scandalous phrases. Thanks to the large corner windows, the 
stage offers a view of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Early- to mid-20s, this mostly casual group is out to drink and 
sing along with the live entertainment. The dress is very informal, with jeans 
on everyone. "It's a place where the whole bar gets involved," said Tom Szulga, 
29, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Gary Ballen entertains Friday night audiences with his witty 
interpretations of classic rock 'n' roll tunes, a gig he's had for more than 
nine years. With Ballen's encouragement, the crowd sings along to chestnuts 
like "American Pie" and "Runaround Sue." After 22 years playing a repertoire of 
more than 1,000 songs, he says he sometimes gets creative with the lyrics. 
"When you play it that long, you try to keep it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The entertainment is interactive, allowing the crowd to sing along 
and have a good time. "It's lots of fun and everybody can relate to the music," 
said Patti Lukehart, 25, of Moorpark. "We can hang out and have a lot of fun." 
For her housemate, 26-year-old Leo Medina, the club has a slightly different 
appeal. "It's five minutes from my parents' house, so I can get a buzz and take 
a taxi there after," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Some former regulars who came for the food said the place has changed 
since they attended Cal State Northridge. "It was fun when we were in college," 
said Dave Stibor, 28, of Sherman Oaks, "but we're out of college now." Ron 
Brooks, a former fraternity brother, agreed. "It got old." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Go ahead, throw the shells on the floor," the bartender said of the 
free peanuts. "It absorbs the alcohol when (customers) get really drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam's Rib, 17500 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 990-7427. Hours: 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. Friday, 5 to 11 p.m. Monday to Thursday, 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday and 4 
p.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday . SYLVIA L. OLIANDE

PICTURE OF WELLNESS; SOME EXPERTS SAY WOMEN SHOULD HOLD ON TO COPIES OF 
BASE-LINE MAMMOGRAMS FOR FUTURE USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray, a 
registered nurse, writes regularly about health for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as the medical community continues to debate the issue of just how 
valuable base-line mammograms may be and how early women should start regu 
larly getting mammograms, there's another question to consider: What good is a 
base-line mammogram if it's not kept safely somewhere and easily accessible? 
</P>
<P>
 Many women assume that the facilities at which they have their mammograms done 
keep the films indefinitely, and some do. But others have policies to retain 
the films for only five to 12 years. That means that the chances are -- just 
when a doctor suggests that looking at a base-line film might be helpful -- it 
could be gone, off to a landfill to make room for other, more recent films. 
</P>
<P>
 How long a facility keeps the films varies from place to place. Dr. Parvis 
Gamagami, radiologist at the Breast Center in Van Nuys, says his center has 
kept all the mammography films it has done since it opened 13 years ago, and 
plans to continue to retain them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills, John Hunt, 
administrator of diagnostic imaging, says mammography films are kept five years 
at the Woodland Hills site, then are sent to a storage center for an additional 
seven years, after which they are destroyed. The legal standard, according to 
Hunt, is to keep all X-ray films for a minimum of seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt says tracking down old films from other facilities can be difficult, 
however, often taking weeks or months from the time that the physician first 
requests them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why some experts recommend that women, especially those moving out of 
town or changing health care providers, get copies of their mammograms to 
ensure that the films are easily and quickly available in case they are needed. 
"Especially if the patient has a family history of breast cancer, or a history 
of multiple breast nodules or surgery, it's good to have the mammogram films on 
hand," Gamagami says. 
</P>
<P>
 By state law in California, facilities must provide copies of medical records, 
X-rays and tracings -- which include mammograms -- within 15 calendar days, 
said Laurie Holoff, director of medical records at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. Most other states have no such requirement, Holoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on how valuable a base-line mammogram will be if 
symptoms should appear. Although the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists recommends mammograms every one to two years for women 40 to 50, 
and annually for women older than 50, other experts question the value of films 
taken years before a problem developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Susan Love, director of the UCLA Breast Center, says base-line mammograms 
are often not as clinically useful because a woman's breast tissue typically 
changes over time. "What you want is to compare to the previous year or two," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some still value the base-line film, saying it gives the physician a frame 
of reference from which to assess changes in the breast tissue pattern, 
Gamagami says. "It's helpful to be able to go back to the base-line film and 
study it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are downsides to getting your own mammogram copies. If films are not 
stored properly, they may be worthless. Hunt says one woman who requested her 
films immediately plopped them into the trunk of her car, exposing them to heat 
that probably ruined them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the films are best protected and safer kept in the facilities where 
they were taken," Gamagami says. But storing the films appropriately is not all 
that difficult. They need to be kept flat, away from light or heat, at about 70 
to 75 degrees Fahrenheit, Gamagami says. And if something should happen to the 
copies, the facility may still have the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most places charge for mammogram copies -- even though technically the films 
are the property of the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser, for example, requires a clerical fee of $12 and a copying charge of $5 
per film. Kaiser keeps the original and gives the patient the copy to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients are asked to sign a printed release form, which verifies that they 
have received the films. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty McCaleb, 39, was moving from Thousand Oaks to Paradise Valley, Ariz., 
and wanted to be sure that she always had access to both her base-line 
mammogram and another done just before she left the Los Angeles area. So for 
about $22, she bought copies, which she plans to store in her closet. 
</P>
<P>
 For McCaleb, getting the copies is an effort to hedge her bets, in case a 
quick interpretation is ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facility had told me they would keep the films indefinitely -- unless 
they ran out of storage," she says. Tips for Getting Copies 
</P>
<P>
 For many women, the best bet may be to let the facility that did the mammogram 
keep the films until they are needed. But for others -- especially those who 
are moving, or who are at greater risk for needing quick access to a base-line 
film -- having a copy could be a good idea. Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out how long the facility keeps mammograms. Ask about the center's 
policy on providing mammogram copies and what the charges are, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you plan to move, or switch physicians or mammography centers, consider 
getting copies of your films, or have them sent to your new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * The recently passed federal Mammography Quality Standards Act requires that 
all facilities be government-certified and inspected. For a list of centers in 
your neighborhood that are accredited, call the National Cancer Institute's 
Cancer Information Services line in Los Angeles at (800) 4-CANCER.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TRIED AND TRUE; LITTLE CHINA IS A SIMPLE, CUTE CAFE WITH A 
MENU THAT FEATURES OLD STANDARDS, BUT THE COOKING SHOWS REAL FLAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not sure what prompted me to try Little China, a Mandarin-style cafe 
located directly across the street from Universal City Nissan. But I know what 
brought me back. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it takes daring or unusual dishes to get me through the door of a 
Chinese restaurant -- say, steamed sea bass with yellow chives and pine nuts. 
Or even better, the stunner of minced pork, shrimp, green bean and dried bean 
curd skin I ate for lunch last week at Lakespring Restaurant in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in Monterey Park, Chinese restaurants have to feature something unusual 
-- it's a competitive market. The Valley isn't, so we tend to have mom-and-pop 
places like Little China. It fits the pattern: a cute, simple place with a 
glass front and hard chairs. Dishes are ordered from a counter, then hustled to 
your table by the courteous staff. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did I try it? Maybe it was instinct. As soon as I was seated, I had a 
sudden rush of good feeling. Never mind that the menu lists nothing but old 
standards; it boasts a zeroed-out MSG symbol, definitely a badge of honor in a 
Valley Chinese restaurant. Above all, the smell of cooking oil coming out of 
the kitchen was unusually fresh, another good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 So this week it's back to moo shu pork, pan-fried noodles and kung pao shrimp. 
No problem. A few of Little China's versions, cooked by a shy chef who seldom 
peeks out from behind his wok, have real flair; they're the state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Pot stickers and paper-wrapped chicken are two good beginnings. These items 
are often mundane in lesser hands, but Little China's pot stickers, for 
example, have a firm, chewy skin, golden brown on one side, and their filling 
exudes hot, tasty juices when the skin is pierced. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper-wrapped chicken is a misleading name these days, though at exclusive 
Hong Kong establishments the minced chicken, with its ginger and soy flavoring, 
still is cooked in parchment (for about five times the price of what you pay 
here). 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as in most places, it's cooked in foil. The chicken softens beautifully 
inside the foil triangles and blackens slightly. You'll be fine if you open 
them with care. If not -- whoops, burnt fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a couple of the starters aren't worth a look. Little 
distinguishes the cafe's murky, pungent hot and sour soup from any of a hundred 
others locally. And I, for one, don't see the appeal of the Chinese chicken 
salad, though it's a big seller here. Its dressing is sweet enough to make your 
gums throb. Forward, then, to the wok. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't praise Little China's moo shu pork enough. What comes to the table are 
four enormous Chinese pancakes, stuffed to bursting, looking sort of like 
extra-large burritos from an East L.A. snack stand. The filling, however, is a 
delicate saute of cabbage, carrot, pork, egg, julienne bamboo and tree ear 
mushrooms; what you taste is mostly the egg with subtle undertones of the 
mushrooms and the meat. Smeared with a little plum sauce, it's a masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lesser but nonetheless deserving dishes are twice-cooked pork and kung pao 
shrimp. Twice-cooked pork is a specialty from Hunan province that is meant to 
have a fiery tang. The dish is called twice-cooked because it is supposed to be 
steamed pork finished in a wok with green pepper, onion, cabbage and an 
abundance of chiles. I'll tell you now, they don't hold back on the chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many customers seem to favor another spicy dish here, the kung pao combo, 
composed of shrimp, chicken, beef, mouth-numbing fagara peppers and a large 
handful of heat-blistered peanuts. I want to try to talk you out of ordering 
it. Sure, it's a nice idea to combine the meats, but I say the kung pao idea 
works best when the palate isn't so crossed up by a multitude of flavors. Try 
it with the fresh-tasting shrimp alone, and I promise the dish will make you 
sit up straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rice and noodle dishes are simple and tasty, as befits the 
straightforward style of this kitchen. (On the other hand, the vegetable 
dishes, such as the one-dimensional spicy eggplant and Sichuan-style bean curd, 
border on the monotonous.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are no desserts and no alcoholic beverages, though nonalcoholic beer is 
offered. Little China also delivers in a limited radius within Studio City, 
North Hollywood and the east side of Sherman Oaks.

 STILL FAB: It's been 30 years since they invaded America, but the Beatles are 
still a big hit. Their new double CD, "Live at the BBC," was released Tuesday 
and quickly sold out at some Valley locations, including the Wherehouse in 
Sherman Oaks. . . . "We got 10 of them in, and sold out Wednesday afternoon," 
says manager Dan Bauman. "Nirvana didn't do that well." Thursday was the 14th 
anniversary of John Lennon's death. 
</P>
<P>
 HEAVY TASK: Where's the beef? That's an easy one. It's in Hart High's 
offensive line. The Newhall quintet average s 6-foot-4, 266 pounds. "The 
all-you-can-eat places don't like us too much," says Sant Sikand, the 300-pound 
right tackle. . . . But the big bodies will be tested tonight against the speed 
of Antelope Valley High in the Southern Section Division II championship (C1). 
</P>
<P>
 DATES: Fall is in the air, and so is romance, which means it's the perfect 
time for Valley lovers, above, to cuddle by the fire, eat by candlelight, kiss 
by moonlight, or walk in the woods. . . . From the Inn of the Seventh Ray in 
Topanga to the Aroma Coffee & Tea Co. in Studio City, the Valley offers plenty 
of cozy dating alternatives. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDY CANE: Mr. Rodgers' neighborhood is again lighting up the Valley. Dave 
and Cathy Rodgers, along with other residents, have spotlighted their area of 
Woodland Hills -- "Candy Cane Lane" -- with holiday decorations. (Valley Life! 
Page 27) . . . Not even the quake could stop tradition. Homes were hit hard, 
but, says Cathy, "we figured if we made it this far, we'd really deck it out."

VENTURA'S NEW MANAGER TAKES A LOOK AT CITY HALL; ADMINISTRATION: DONNA LANDEROS 
SAYS THE COMMUNITY APPEARS TO BE IN SOLID FINANCIAL SHAPE. SHE STARTS JAN. 17. 
</P>

 Donna Landeros, Ventura's next city manager, made her first visit to her new 
city Thursday since accepting the job last month, meeting with local officials 
and touring the marbled corridors of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 During an afternoon news conference, Landeros said she anticipates working 
with the council on such issues as economic development and revitalizing the 
downtown. Otherwise, she did not detail any specific plans she had for her new 
job, besides trying to help the often-fractious City Council work more smoothly 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome discussion, I welcome debate, but at the end, it has to conclude 
with some direction," she said. "That's when the manager has to step in (and 
say), 'All right, what do you want to do, what do you want the staff to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Describing herself as a workaholic, Landeros said she sees her job extending 
beyond City Hall to frequent interactions with the community. She said she 
hopes to regularly attend Chamber of Commerce mixers and other civic club 
meetings to get to know city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 From what she has seen, she said, Ventura seems to be in solid financial 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city is very strong and I think the council has made a lot of 
really tough (budget) decisions," she said. Landeros will be the first 
permanent woman city manager in the county when she begins her job Jan. 17 and 
will make $105,000 in her first year.  
</P>
<P>
 She replaces John Baker, who left the city in July after 12 years to start his 
own consulting business. Ventura has had two interim city managers since Baker 
resigned -- the former top administrator in Santa Barbara and, since Dec. 1, 
Ventura's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the council is pleased with her work, Landeros is scheduled for merit 
raises in the next two years of her three-year contract, to $112,000 in her 
second year and $121,000 in her third year, city officials said. She will also 
receive a full benefits package, which under previous City Manager Baker was 
worth about $23,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros now makes $86,292 a year, plus $8,950 in benefits as Yolo County 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least the first six months, she said, she plans to commute between 
Ventura and her family's home in Woodland, the Yolo County seat, where her son 
attends eighth grade and her husband supervises a migrant education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband and son will move to Ventura next summer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros comes to Ventura with rave reviews from Yolo County, where county 
supervisors and private citizens alike praise her ability to finesse 
negotiations and make scarce resources stretch far through careful money 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old Landeros grew up in Santa Paula and has visited the county 
many times since on trips home to see her parents. But on Thursday, she saw a 
new side of Ventura -- the one within City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials gave her a tour of the building, and she lunched in the 
council's offices with city department heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, the city's director of community services, said he is looking 
forward to having a city manager in place so officials can stop postponing such 
items as budget planning. "She's personable and she displays self-confidence," 
said Millais, who met Landeros for the first time Thursday. "I'm looking 
forward to working with her -- and frankly, I can't wait for her to get here."

NEIGHBORS LOSE FIGHT TO UNFENCE PARK; PLEASANT VALLEY: DIRECTORS OPPOSE PLEA TO 
OPEN UP PLAY AREA NEXT TO TIERRA LINDA SCHOOL, EXCEPT AFTER CLASSES END. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite strong protests from neighbors, directors of the Pleasant Valley park 
district voted to keep a chain-link fence around a public park that doubles as 
a play field for an east Camarillo elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District voted 4 to 0 
Wednesday to retain the six-foot-high fence that lines the perimeter of a 
five-acre play field next to Tierra Linda School. The fence will be closed to 
the public during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member William Marsden was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors cited a 1991 agreement between the park district and the 
Pleasant Valley School District that granted the school exclusive use of the 
field when classes are in session. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living near the school at Woodcreek Road and Lynwood Drive pleaded 
with the park board to push back the fence and leave a portion of the field as 
a full-time public park. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this (configuration) is still in the community's best 
interest," said Nancy Bush, chairwoman of the park board. "I think once it is 
fully developed, things will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Johanna Milford called the board's refusal to move the fence both 
wrong and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't listened to a word we've said all along," Milford said. "The 
park isn't their land, it's the public's land. As residents and taxpayers, we 
should be able to enjoy it when we want -- not at the school district's 
discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Joel Granath agreed that the fence should be moved to provide 
neighborhood access to the park and said a smaller play field would mean 
increased security for the 750 students attending Tierra Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you don't agree that we deserve our park, I would think you would 
want to move the park for the safety of the children," Granath said. "But as it 
stands now, you have an increased safety risk and we are stuck with a hideous 
chain-link fence." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials at the meeting asked the board to honor its 1991 
agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hamilton, the school district's associate superintendent, said that 
because Tierra Linda could be forced to expand to accommodate more students and 
because its current student body needs a field for physical education classes, 
the fence line should be kept where it is. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed out that under the agreement, the park district pledged that 
it would build Woodcreek Park years ahead of schedule if the school district 
built Tierra Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school wouldn't be there today if it wasn't for your board agreeing to go 
ahead and develop Woodcreek Park," Hamilton said. "We thought this would be a 
win-win situation that everyone could accept." 
</P>
<P>
 With the park board's decision, landscapers will soon begin installing 
children's play equipment and picnic tables on the field's Woodcreek Road side 
-- both amenities that were put on hold until Wednesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Milford and other park neighbors said after the meeting that they 
will consider taking legal action against the park district to press their 
case.

NEW MAYOR VOWS TO END RV PROJECT; PORT HUENEME: CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS ITS STAFF 
TO FIND OUT THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COSTS OF DROPPING THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after being elected Port Hueneme's new mayor, Toni Young vowed 
Thursday to try to kill a city plan to build a 139-space recreational vehicle 
resort on a city-owned beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's City Council meeting, the council directed the city staff to 
study scrapping the proposal, which was approved last month by the California 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we need to know what are the legal and financial implications for 
the city to put the RV project on a shelf," Young said. "It may take time, but 
we certainly will kill this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the council's three new members -- Jon Sharkey and Robert Turner -- 
backed Young's nomination to the mayor's job and agreed with her that the 
proposal to build the resort on a 10-acre beachfront site near the municipal 
pier should die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that by retiring the RV project, we'll be serving the interest of the 
people of Port Hueneme, and that's why I was elected to office," Sharkey said 
in an interview Thursday. "The message that the people sent us in the election 
was clear: Let's abandon the RV project and let's look for other ways to 
increase city revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 The third new council member, Anthony Volante, said he has not yet decided on 
the issue. The remaining council member, former Mayor Orvene Carpenter, has 
been a staunch supporter of the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Carpenter, along with former council members Dorill Wright, 
Ken Hess and James Daniels, pushed for the resort, despite opposition from 
environmentalists and nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission officials were not available for comment Thursday. But Port 
Hueneme City Manager Richard Velthoen said the city has no legal obligation to 
build the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the project can be halted, however, Velthoen said the city must hold a 
public hearing and a majority of council members must vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have estimated that the resort would raise $400,000 a year in 
revenue. So far, the city has spent more than $600,000 on environmental and 
market studies of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, opponents of the resort pleaded with newly sworn 
council members to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge you to use this opportunity to kill the RV resort project," said Tom 
Brigham, president of the Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. "The 
destiny of this project is to be dead, dead, dead, dead." 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, opponents vowed to sue the city if the resort were built. 
But former Councilman Wright addressed the new council, saying the city could 
afford to fight such a lawsuit because the state attorney general would pick up 
legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there will be lawsuits, but the city would not be financially 
responsible," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's comments angered some residents, who said no matter which agency pays 
to defend the city, the funds would ultimately come from taxpayers' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter -- who is in the middle of a four-year term -- warned the council 
that if the resort is not built, the city may not be able to keep its Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to consider that if we don't build the RV, we may have to contract 
with the sheriff's to provide us with law enforcement," Carpenter told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the city adopted a 4% utility tax that will raise an estimated 
$500,000 yearly -- money the council pledged to use earmark for law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter said that in an emergency, the city might have to use that money 
for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The RV project was not the only source of tension during the four-hour 
meeting. Young's election to the mayor's job also led to a sharp division on 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who has publicly criticized Velthoen and in the past often cast the 
lone vote against the four veteran council members, was nominated for mayor by 
Sharkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Volante, however, a longtime supporter of the former council, nominated 
Carpenter, who has served on the council since 1964 and was the mayor for the 
past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey said he supported Young because Carpenter had just served in the post, 
and Young was the only other returning council member. "I think the rest of us 
are too inexperienced to have that position," Sharkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents celebrated Young's victory, others were sad to see the 
former council members leave office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider people like Dorill Wright part of my family," said Sydney Malin, 
who has not missed a City Council meeting in 16 years. "This place used to be a 
slum, and they turned this city into a pretty little town. I sure am going to 
miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 During an emotional parting speech, 22-year City Councilman Wright gave each 
new council member a Bible in which he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "My guide book for nearly 30 years of public service. Perhaps it will serve 
you as well."

DEFENSE CONCLUDES CASE IN THORNTON MURDER TRIAL; COURTS: SOON AFTER, 
DEFENDANT'S MOTHER IS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF VIOLATING PROBATION ON A WELFARE 
FRAUD CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attorneys for accused Thousand Oaks murderer Mark Scott Thornton rested their 
case Thursday without calling the defendant to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the defendant's mother, Markita Sarrazin, was arrested outside 
the courtroom on a Los Angeles County warrant alleging she had violated her 
probation on a welfare fraud conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Wednesday afternoon, Thornton's attorneys were saying they were 
unsure whether he would take the witness stand to defend himself against a 
charge that he killed Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, however, testimony in the six-week trial lasted barely an hour 
before Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said abruptly that the defense 
case had concluded. During the brief court session, defense attorneys 
questioned their own investigator and two prosecution investigators on 
statements other witnesses had made to them outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense appeared to be trying to establish inconsistencies in the 
statements of other witnesses, who had testified earlier in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were then sent home until Monday and told they will hear rebuttal 
evidence from the prosecution before closing arguments begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarrazin, who attended her son's trial Thursday for the first time in a month, 
was put on notice almost immediately by Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris 
that she would be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sarrazin sat in the courtroom with her mother, Kossoris told Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath about the warrant and said his office ethically could 
not ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't wish to do anything that would disrupt the trial, for that would be 
contrary to the court's wishes," Kossoris said in court. "On the other hand, I 
think the court can understand when you're dealing with law enforcement 
agencies, we're damned if we do and damned if we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing more information about the warrant, McGrath ordered that the 
arrest not take place "in this courtroom or in the presence of any of the 
jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarrazin stayed in the courtroom for the morning session. At the conclusion of 
the testimony, she was led into a court anteroom and arrested, district 
attorney's investigator Richard Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
 A district attorney's official who did not want to be named said Sarrazin was 
"very cooperative" during the arrest. She was escorted by district attorney 
investigators to the Ventura County Jail, where sheriff's deputies prepared to 
transport her to Los Angeles County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarrazin's sudden reappearance in her son's trial came as a surprise, because 
just two days earlier defense attorneys publicly complained that Thornton felt 
abandoned by his mother while fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is charged with murder in the Sept. 14, 1993, shooting death of the 
33-year-old O'Sullivan. He also is charged with using O'Sullivan's truck to 
kidnap his 16-year-old former girlfriend later that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 If jurors convict Thornton of first-degree murder in the course of either a 
kidnaping or a robbery, the trial would enter a second phase to determine 
whether he should be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson said earlier this week that Thornton was 
upset because his mother had moved out of state and had made only one 
appearance at his trial. Olson's complaints echoed fears Thornton himself 
expressed to his grandmother in a taped conversation, in which he said he 
feared she and others would "leave me in jail to rot." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarrazin's performance as a parent has been a major theme for the defense 
during the trial. According to testimony and court documents, Sarrazin 
constantly belittled her son and kicked him out of her home when he was 17 or 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Sarrazin's arrest was unclear. Asher told the judge that 
Sarrazin was on probation for a welfare fraud conviction in Los Angeles County 
and may not have kept up with her restitution payments. Haas told McGrath that 
the warrant, issued Nov. 28, was for failing to make a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles district attorney officials confirmed that they had prosecuted 
Sarrazin, but were unable to provide details of the case Thursday.

OFFICIAL DISMISSES REPORT ON BASE CLOSURE; POINT MUGU: ASSISTANT DEFENSE 
SECRETARY GOTBAUM SAYS PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL MAY NOT INFLUENCE FATE OF 
NAVY INSTALLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top Pentagon official on Thursday said that the Defense Department cannot 
use a controversial report that advocates shutting down Point Mugu's Navy base 
in drawing up its official hit list of bases recommended for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of Defense Joshua Gotbaum said that the department's 
inspector general does not have the legal authority to influence the fate of 
military installations under the nation's Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress has set up a special set of tests and procedures in making these 
obviously difficult and painful decisions," Gotbaum said in an interview. "The 
inspector general's report was developed for a different purpose and cannot be 
used for a BRAC recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum's interpretation of the rules is significant because he is overseeing 
the Pentagon effort to decide which bases should be offered for sacrifice in 
next year's round of closures. 
</P>
<P>
 His stance on the issue sides with Navy and congressional critics, who have 
raised objections to the report's suggestion to move most of Point Mugu's 
missile-testing functions and thousands of jobs to its sister base at China 
Lake in the upper Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, it just reinforces the argument we've been trying to make from Day 
1," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). "This kind of report is not 
germane to the base-closing process." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's office issued the confidential report last June as an 
official base-closing document, arguing that the office has the authority to 
make such recommendations because it is deeply involved in the base-closing 
process. Specifically, its auditors have been assigned the responsibility of 
verifying all military data used in the base-closing process. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a Nov. 18 letter to Gallegly, Acting Inspector General Derek J. Vander 
Schaaf seemed to back off that position, even though he said he stood by the 
report's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote that Gotbaum was aware that the report had been given to officials 
weighing which bases should close and it was up to Gotbaum to decide if the 
recommendations were useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum said they were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inspector general does not have the authority to make a BRAC 
recommendation," Gotbaum said. "He has a job in the BRAC process, but it not 
one to make independent BRAC recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Gotbaum said the inspector general audits do not use the same 
criteria as official base-closing documents and the list of recommended 
closures will be based only on such official documents.  
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum all but dismissed the significance of the report on Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that there are lots of concerns in the base-closing process," he 
said. "But this is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum's response came as a relief to Navy officials who have challenged the 
accuracy and assumptions of the report. It contends that the Navy could 
eliminate overlapping programs and save $1.7 billion over the next 20 years by 
moving most of Point Mugu's operations to China Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors acknowledged there would be no net savings in the first five years 
because it would cost $518 million to move Point Mugu's facilities and scatter 
most of its 9,000 jobs to China Lake and other bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Navy officials have challenged the notion there would be any savings, 
citing what they called the faulty assumption that Point Mugu is scheduled for 
a major reduction in workload. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the inspector general audit projected that ongoing weapons 
testing work on the FA-18 Hornet jet fighter would amount to $15 million rather 
than the Navy's estimate of $70 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said that not only were the auditors' projections off the mark, 
but the targeted program was literally off base. The vast majority of the work 
on the Hornets are done at China Lake, where they are stationed, not at Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the case that this massive duplication exists," said Adm. Dana B. 
McKinney, commanding officer of both Point Mugu and China Lake, who signed a 
43-page rebuttal to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many of the programs at Point Mugu have merged with those at 
China Lake, making both bases more efficient, McKinney said. "I think we've 
made the point that we have done a lot of consolidation already." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Secretary of Defense is scheduled to issue the list of bases 
recommended for closure. An independent base-closing commission then decides on 
a final list, which can be adopted or rejected as a whole by the President and 
Congress.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; LEGAL, MORAL QUESTIONS ON 
HOMELESSNESS

<P>
 Arguments about the constitutionality of a Santa Ana ordinance aimed at 
controlling the city's homeless population began Thursday before the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by more than 90 city attorneys, Santa Ana is attempting to overturn 
a 1992 state appellate court decision that disallowed a city law prohibiting 
camping, the use of camping equipment -- including sleeping bags or blankets -- 
and the storage of personal items on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ordinance call it a "punishment for poverty," saying the law 
is an example of local government attempts to rid communities of their homeless 
without addressing the root of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who support the legislation argue that cities are right to guard against 
the use of public property for private purposes. Certain uses should be 
prevented, they say, because it would exclude others in the community from 
enjoying that property. 
</P>
<P>
 What role should local governments play in dealing with the homeless?  
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Caughey, executive director, Women's Care Cottage, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand the need for some kind of law to be imposed against 
panhandling. I don't like being harassed at night by some stranger in a park. 
But governments should not put those laws into effect without dealing with the 
issue. They should present solutions alongside those ordinances. There's a lot 
of mean legislation out there. People are reacting to their frustrations with 
the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Nat Hutton, executive director, Valley Shelter Inc., North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 "Other things can be done besides forcing them out of the community. But it 
should be a concerted effort. We need to give the homeless an alternative. 
There are no suitable centers for the homeless in the Valley. We are looking 
into establishing some kind of soup kitchen where they could come in, take a 
shower, have a nice meal and relax. We would include counseling and assistance 
to get them the things they need to survive. To resolve the problem, local 
governments should be involved in those efforts."

 "We've received complaints from business owners about panhandlers who were 
harassing their customers. One woman was followed into a supermarket and 
knocked down by a guy she didn't give money to. We thought the best solution 
would be to educate the community through posters and booklets that listed L.A. 
organizations who helped the homeless. Instead of giving money to panhandlers, 
they have a list of places they could help. If we all gave money to those 
organizations, they could build bigger shelters and the truly needy people 
would have a place to stay."

 "Local governments should be both intelligent and humane in dealing with the 
homeless. They should not look for quick-fix solutions that force them to move 
from one area to another. They should work to create real regional solutions to 
the problem, which would include getting all resources together and using their 
political clout to effect solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Scheidegger, legal director, Criminal Justice Legal Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 "Local governments should play a leading role in this issue because it's 
primarily a local problem. The biggest complaint people have about the homeless 
is that some are intimidating people out of their money. A local government 
should crack down on those cases. . . . Homelessness is often a problem that 
includes mental illness and substance abuse. . . . People who give cash to 
panhandlers are largely subsidizing substance abuse."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MAN CONVICTED OF CHILD MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo man was convicted Thursday of 10 counts of child molestation for 
having an affair with a young girl he met while he was director of a Catholic 
youth program. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Rose, 49, faces a mandatory prison term but will remain free on bail 
pending his Jan. 27 sentencing, Deputy Dist. Atty.Saundra T. Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum possible sentence is three years in prison. Brewer said she has 
not determined what the maximum sentence would involve. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated just over a day before convicting Rose on all 10 felony 
charges involving the girl, who is now 14. She testified that she met Rose 
while attending religion classes at St. Mary Magdalen Church in Camarillo, 
where he was director of the youth education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually they began fondling each other in his car when he gave her rides 
home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was 12 when the affair began in January, 1993, testified that 
for several months she did not resist Rose's sexual advances. But she 
eventually stopped the relationship out of fear she might get pregnant if they 
had sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley is expected to seek a new trial at the 
sentencing hearing. Last week, Farley unsuccessfully requested a mistrial after 
a witness unexpectedly blurted out information that the jury was not supposed 
to hear. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA CRUZ ISLAND; CONTROLLED BURN JUMPS FIRE LINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prescribed burn aimed at regenerating trees on Santa Cruz Island jumped fire 
lines early Thursday and continued to burn out of control late in the evening, 
National Park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand crews and an air tanker fought as 30 m.p.h. winds helped push the blaze 
across 520 acres on the northeast side of the island near an area called 
Chinese Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which came within four miles of a U.S. Navy radar station, 
threatened no homes or sensitive wildlife habitats, said Mack Shaver, 
superintendent of the Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The controlled burn was set Tuesday as part of an experiment to help spread 
the seeds of bishop pine trees, Shaver said. Winds that kicked up early 
Thursday fanned embers from the burn and spread fire outside the 400-acre 
control area, burning mostly dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for losing control of the fire is always there, but the weather 
forecasts indicated that this was totally safe," Shaver said. "You kind of pay 
your money and take your chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver said three fresh hand crews from the California Department of Forestry 
would join three crews on the island to continue battling the blaze today.

 After the end of the year, the public will no longer be able to file 
unemployment claims in person at Ventura's Employment Development Department, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura EDD office will be converted to a phone center after Dec. 30, 
handling unemployment claims and job service functions exclusively by mail and 
telephone, manager Annette Havens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in automation technology and telephone call processing allow EDD 
workers to perform their duties more efficiently by phone or mail, Havens said. 
The Ventura office is one of several EDD offices throughout the state that will 
become phone centers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People needing assistance with unemployment claims or with job searches can 
receive it by calling 654-6900. 
</P>
<P>
 The EDD offices in Oxnard and Simi Valley will remain open to the public, 
Havens said. Both offices are open Mondays through Fridays 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PLANNERS APPROVE IN-LINE HOCKEY RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claiming that an in-line hockey rink proposed for a site near a church at 
Camarillo Airport would not be a good neighbor, the Camarillo Planning 
Commission nevertheless approved the project, saying it met city planning 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said the rink fit within the framework of the city's General 
Plan but would be better off located away from St. Demetrios Church at Skyway 
Drive and Eubanks Street in Freedom Park.The planners, who met Tuesday, said 
they feared the church would be exposed to excess noise and traffic congestion 
created by the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete oval skating rink, which will sit on a 225,000-square-foot parcel 
at the park, is to be privately financed, said Robert Hawekotte, one of the 
rink's two private backers. The Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District 
will receive a fee for allowing the developers to use the parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line roller hockey, a dry form of the sport played on ice, is growing 
quickly as both an amateur- and professional-level sport, Hawekotte said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Board of Directors of the park district, which will have 
final say on the proposal, was briefed on the rink and the recommendations of 
the Planning Commission but delayed action on the proposal until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawekotte and his partner, Stephan Desjardins, who were not present at the 
park district meeting, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier in the week, they said they expect the open-air rink to cost 
as much as $150,000. If approved, groundbreaking on the rink could come as 
early as January, with completion expected about 90 days later. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COURT DATE PUT OFF IN WORKERS' COMP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dozen lawyers and chiropractors arrested on suspicion of participating in a 
workers' compensation scam appeared in court Thursday and were released after 
being told prosecutors have not filed criminal charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were given a February date to return to court, but the chief 
prosecutor in the case said it is doubtful his office will finish examining 
thousands of seized documents and be ready to file charges that soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were arrested two weeks ago during 26 simultaneous raids at their 
homes and offices throughout Ventura County. Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury 
said at the time that the arrests followed a yearlong undercover investigation 
by Ventura County prosecutors and state and national insurance investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are accused of participating in a scam that includes double- and 
triple-billing insurers for single treatments and "buying" patient referrals 
with fees that often are billed back to the insurance companies -- an illegal 
process known as capping. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. John L. Geb said his office is not ready to file 
criminal charges because searches of the suspects' offices netted volumes of 
material that must be studied to determine the extent of the criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors had enough evidence against the men to file charges at 
the time of the arrests, the new information makes it prudent to wait, Geb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation involved two district attorney's investigators who set 
themselves up in a Thousand Oaks office for almost a year, posing as a referral 
service that offered to steer workers' compensation claimants to doctors and 
lawyers for a fee. BARBARA MURPHY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA NEWSPAPERS' EDITOR IRBY RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The editor of the Ventura County Newspapers chain resigned suddenly Thursday, 
citing philosophical differences with management. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Irby said he was disappointed by his sudden departure, but declined to 
comment further. His resignation is effective immediately, Irby said. 
</P>
<P>
 A replacement for Irby has not been announced. The newspaper chain's 
publisher, John P. Wilcox, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Irby was hired as editor of the Ventura County Star-Free Press in September, 
1992. A year later he was named editor of the Ventura County Newspapers chain, 
supervising the editorial content of the Star-Free Press and its Camarillo and 
Oxnard editions, the Thousand Oaks News Chronicle and the Simi Valley 
Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation is the latest in a series of management changes in the chain, 
which is owned by the Ohio-based Scripps Howard newspaper group. Before Irby's 
arrival, the Star-Free Press editor was John Bowman, who has since resigned 
from the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain's daily newspapers have undergone several changes since publisher 
Wilcox arrived last year. Coverage of local news has been shifted to pages 
deeper inside the main section, the price of home delivery has been increased 
and, two weeks ago, the Star-Free Press and its editions changed their names to 
"The Star." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks papers also added "The Star" to their 
mastheads. One source said Irby and Wilcox had clashed over some of the 
changes, particularly Wilcox's decision to move most local news deeper inside 
the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Irby has more than 23 years of experience in the newspaper industry. He was 
editor and publisher of the Tulare Advance-Register for two years and was 
managing editor of the Bakersfield Californian for six years, among other 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Irby, 45, who lives in Ventura, said he does not have any immediate plans. "I 
don't know what I'm going to do," he said. "I'll probably take a couple of days 
to play a little golf and think about it." KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AUDIT FINDS LACK OF COMPUTER TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County spends $5.8 million on computer equipment and personnel each 
year but provides little training, an audit released Thursday says. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's agencies and departments have made progress at keeping pace with 
advances in computer technology, providing one personal computer for every 
three employees, the report by Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon says. 
</P>
<P>
 But training on the computers and their software applications has been 
minimal, the report says. As a result, county employees were not taking 
advantage of their computers to increase job performance and productivity, 
according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees might have the latest software programs, but they often didn't have 
the manuals to go with them, Mahon said. The problem was found throughout 
county departments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to make all of this investment in the machinery, we should 
also make an investment in the training," Mahon said. KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; UNION WANTS SCHOOLS DECLARED AS UNSAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of several violent encounters between teachers and students, the 
Moorpark teachers' union is sending out a letter today asking state and county 
officials to declare their schools unsafe working environments. 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators and school board members dismissed the union's move as an 
attempt to gain leverage in protracted and bitter contract negotiations. Board 
members rushed to reassure parents that their children are safe in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorpark schools are safe," said board member Greg Barker, who teaches high 
school in Thousand Oaks. "What we have is a union making an effort to create 
and inflate issues that don't exist to gain ground in negotiations and public 
sympathy. I think this will backfire on them." 
</P>
<P>
 But union representatives have cited a recent series of violent incidents, 
including one two weeks ago when a middle school student tried to break a 
teacher's fingers. Union President Richard Gillis said teachers have been 
assaulted on two other occasions. Also, he said the school board was not taking 
a strong enough stand against weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis cited a recent incident in which a 12-year-old middle school student 
was caught with a knife on campus and then not expelled by the board. More than 
200 teachers, parents and staff members signed a petition asking for a "zero 
tolerance" policy, under which students caught with weapons would automatically 
be expelled. Board members oppose the idea as too rigid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also asking the district to accept the remedies we think could correct 
this," Gillis said, adding that corrective measures include the zero-tolerance 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Tom Duffy said the union was giving a false impression of 
Moorpark schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a recent survey showed the top priorities for students at Moorpark 
High School are their grades and their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't already feel safe I don't think they would be answering that 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would welcome a state representative or anyone else to come see what fine 
campuses we have here." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PROPOSALS FOR ZOO, GOLF COURSES ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors have postponed consideration of proposals for two 
new golf courses and a zoo for endangered species planned for the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 The board this week delayed hearing the proposals until Dec. 20 because 
Supervisor Vicky Howard, whose district includes the properties on which the 
projects would be built, was unable to attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Ralph Mahan is seeking to build two 18-hole golf courses at Happy 
Camp Regional Park, a county-owned park north of Moorpark. Mahan wants to enter 
into a lease agreement with the county that would enable him to raise the money 
to build the golf courses, which officials estimate could generate between 
$250,000 and $500,000 annually for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate proposal, a Los Angeles-based group wants to lease a county park 
between Moorpark and Simi Valley that it plans to eventually develop into a zoo 
for rare animals. Supporters say the zoo would be a world-class tourist 
attraction that would pump millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark officials have expressed concerns about traffic that would be 
generated from both projects, and have complained that the county is moving 
ahead too quickly on both proposals. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; EIR ON WIDENING OF CHANNEL APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on a massive widening project planned for the 
Arroyo Simi Flood Control Channel in Moorpark has been approved, clearing the 
way for the first phase of the $6-million project to begin next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors approved the environmental report at its meeting this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The report found that the improvement project would not cause any significant 
environmental damage to the surrounding area and would actually create 11 
additional acres of wetland, said Ed Gunen, a county public works engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for widening a three-mile-long section of the channel and 
replacing a 16,000-foot section of its concrete lining to guard against floods. 
The improvements would enable the part of the channel between Hitch Boulevard 
and Spring Road to withstand a once-in-a-century storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would also help reduce annual maintenance costs along the channel, 
while at the same time protect against erosion of its banks, according the 
environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the project, which could take six years to complete, is 
expected to begin within the next six months, Gunen said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

 Starting next year, Moorpark residents will pay slightly more to have their 
trash taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to allow the city's two 
trash haulers to raise residential rates by 18 cents.With the new increase, the 
haulers, G.I. Rubbish and Anderson Rubbish, will charge $17.40 per month for 
their service, which includes recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors who now have reduced rates will also see an increase. Their rates will 
go up 14 cents to $14.10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to shield residents from increases over the last two years,"said 
Councilman John Wozniak, who serves on the council's Solid Waste Committee. 
"This increase, though, is one that we felt was necessary to keep up with fuel 
costs and maintenance costs." 
</P>
<P>
 G.I. Rubbish hauls trash for about 60% of Moorpark's 7,000 customers, and 
Anderson Rubbish picks up the remainder. Both companies had also asked for 
increases of 28 cents to 49 cents for collecting recycled materials, but were 
denied that request. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE CATCH SUSPECTS AT BURGLARY SCENE 
</P>

 Carrying stolen coins and jewelry, two would-be burglars left the Simi Valley 
house they were looting and walked into the waiting arms of several police 
officers, a police report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devin Colwell, 18, and Benjamin Connell, 22, were held on suspicion of taking 
part in a midday burglary, according to Officer Vernon Trujillo's report. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor reported that a burglary was going on inside the house of Gary 
Kinoshita, 49, on the 2300 block of Collier Court on Wednesday, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers and detectives took up posts around the house and grabbed the 
men when they left, the report said. Police reportedly found property stolen 
from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also found that Connell -- who is a friend of a girl who lives at the 
house -- was holding a key to the house that he had no permission to use, Sgt. 
Archer Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police booked the two men at the East Valley Sheriff's Station in Thousand 
Oaks. The men were taken later to Ventura County Jail, where they were being 
held Thursday evening: Connell in lieu of $20,000 bond and Colwell without bond 
because of an outstanding warrant for defrauding an innkeeper, jail officials 
said. MACK REED

LLAMA DRAMA; SIMI VALLEY: DESPITE NEIGHBORS' COMPLAINTS, OFFICIALS SAY THE 
ANDEAN BEASTS CAN REMAIN IN EQUESTRIAN DISTRICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Somehow, despite an organized effort to run them out of Simi Valley, and the 
blistering remarks about how they smell and their bad teeth, and the jeers 
about their funny looks, Greg Dames' lowly llamas appear wholly unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Dames' neighbors asked the city to classify the beasts far 
below the lofty horse, down somewhere with barnyard and circus animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Forget the storm whipped up in two of Simi Valley's prestigious equestrian 
communities this week over the presence of the sturdy South American pack 
animals -- with their camel-like heads and long necks -- in territory zoned for 
horses and ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 The llamas mean no harm to anyone, owner Greg Dames said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, residents of the Bridle Path Homeowners Assn. asked the Simi Valley 
Planning Commission on Wednesday night to exclude llamas from their 
neighborhood, an area crisscrossed by horse paths and peppered with stables. 
</P>
<P>
 After pleas from the Dames and another llama owner, Maxwell Pelter, to spare 
their back-yard pets, three commissioners voted unanimously to include the 
beasts among the animals allowed in Simi Valley's horse country. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour meeting pitted Dames and Pelter against their neighbors, who 
contended that the presence of llamas in a horse-only zone would diminish 
property values and pose a threat to children riding on skittish horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners listened intently as the arguments unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Wilson, secretary of the Bridle Path Homeowners Assn., said it was not a 
question of the animal's curious looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has nothing to do with how cute or sweet or wonderful the llamas 
are," Wilson said. "Our community was created to be exclusively equine. No 
matter what anyone says, the llama is still a member of the camel family." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and neighbor Marlane Gregoire argued that a horse plodding down one of 
the area's dirt riding paths would be spooked if it came across a llama. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horses are terrified of the llamas," Gregoire said. "If someone less 
experienced were to come across a llama on the bridle path, they could get 
thrown." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood fought for the horse zone expressly to avoid run-ins with 
farm animals, she said. Simi Valley has another zoning classification where 
people can keep any kind of animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it makes us sound like snobs, but the horse zone is an elite area," 
Gregoire said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gregoire spoke, Janet McKinney rose to tell the commissioners about her 
experience with the llamas. "I am the only person who has to work right next to 
the llamas," said McKinney, whose complaints seven months ago sparked the 
neighborhood feud. "I can tell you they have a very distinct odor and the wind 
pushes it right into my yard." 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to the commission, McKinney and her husband complained that the 
llamas spit, and argued that in buying the strange animal, the Pelters were 
creating an "Old McDonald's Farm" in their own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks left Pelter and Dames cringing in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If llamas had been in the chamber to hear these attacks, Dames said the docile 
animals' feelings would have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, as he shoveled straw into feeding bins for his 11 llamas, 
Dames explained how he came to purchase this animal that looks less like a 
horse than it does a creation of Dr. Seuss. 
</P>
<P>
 On a packing trip some friends offered Dames the chance to visit a llama 
ranch. Despite only having seen mention of the beasts in a Doctor Doolittle 
book, Dames dropped more than $1,000 on the table and bought one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw one being born and I became really enthused. I had just turned 40 and 
the llamas just seemed to fill a gap in my life," Dames said. "Let's face it, I 
fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 The herd in Dames' yard grew quickly. Two weeks ago, the birth of a 
black-haired llama named Whitney brought the number to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the one-acre corral where the llamas wander, occasionally tugging at 
hay or peering out at passing horses, remains clean and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The only noise the llamas make is a soft humming noise, and their padded feet 
allow them to prance across the yard quietly, as if they were wearing slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an impassioned plea for the creatures, Pres Lovato described his experience 
as a llama's next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The llamas do not bark, like my neighbor's dog. They do not smell bad, like 
the horses. They won't kick you or bite you," Lovato said. "To know these 
simple creatures is to love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Only when Dames sold one of his llamas to Pelter did the anti-llama fever 
begin to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Dames, Pelter took his llama out on the bridle path for a walk. 
Homeowner association secretary Wilson said she began receiving complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this year, she consulted city officials, who told her that they 
had agreed in 1987 to permit llamas in the equestrian community. The city 
argued that a llama could be allowed because it was close in size and 
temperament to a pony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any concerns about this for nearly eight years," Planning 
Commissioner Michael Piper said. "So the question that is before us now is 
essentially, did the city make the right call in 1987? I think they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Sherida Simmons said it was clear that horses were easily 
frightened by many things, not just llamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard from someone tonight that her horse was afraid of a head of 
lettuce," Simmons said. "I just don't believe this is a safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dames and Pelter, the 3-0 verdict was, in a way, confirmation that it was 
OK to love a llama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they'd have an opinion on all this," Dames said outside the 
hearing. "But I'm going to give them an extra ration of hay tomorrow to let 
them celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Pelter, he plans to take his llama out onto the bridle path for a 
victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to walk her right over to the Dames' for a breeding," Pelter said 
with a smile. "The more llamas we have in this community the merrier."

COUNTY'S 2ND NEONATAL UNIT OPENS; HEALTH: BUT HEAD OF VENTURA INTENSIVE-CARE 
NURSERY CRITICIZES THOUSAND OAKS CENTER AS A DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sick and prematurely born babies from eastern Ventura County will no longer 
have to travel to Ventura or the San Fernando Valley for medical care, doctors 
said Thursday, celebrating the opening of a neonatal intensive-care unit at Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real step up in the level of care that is available to newborns in 
eastern Ventura County," said Dr. Paul Hinkes, director of the new unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the medical director of the county's only other neonatal intensive-care 
nursery criticized the Los Robles addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really wasting a lot of resources, duplicating services that are already 
in existence," said Dr. David Kasting, head of the neonatal unit at Ventura 
County Medical Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinkes defended the nursery, saying it is medically needed regardless of costs 
that can run to $100,000 per bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transferring these babies is not in their best interest," Hinkes said. 
"There's always a risk in transferring a sick baby." 
</P>
<P>
 If economics were the only concern, Hinkes said, the cheapest thing to do 
would be to build one 200-bed intensive-care unit in Downtown Los Angeles for 
every sick baby in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Robles' new $4-million Women and Children's Pavilion includes remodeled 
labor, delivery and recovery rooms as well as the 10-bed intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Raymond Poliakin, chief of obstetrics, said the renovation "makes the 
hospital look less like a hospital or a factory and much more like a caring 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful," Poliakin said. He said between 100 and 120 babies are 
delivered at the hospital each month and that he expects those numbers to 
increase by at least one-third with the opening of the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 One new delivery in the new unit will be the baby of Cindy Petrak, a clinical 
nurse in the existing Los Robles maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," Petrak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of doctors and nurses cycled through the hospital's plum-colored 
pavilion late Thursday as it was officially opened to hospital staff members. 
The public opening is scheduled Saturday from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kasting of the county hospital questioned the wisdom of installing a 
neonatal intensive-care unit at Los Robles, he and county hospital 
Administrator Pierre Durand both said they believed the new competition would 
draw few patients from their hospital's busy 30-bed intensive-care nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Durand even praised Los Robles' move, saying it will result in more convenient 
service for patients in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said instead of going to the county hospital in Ventura, many east 
county patients now go to American Medical International's Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery rooms have been used for nearly two months, Poliakin said. The 
neonatal intensive-care unit is finished but will not have its first patient 
until January, when the entire pavilion is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Ventura County's eight hospitals have engaged in a fierce 
competition for patients, threatening the survival of the smallest. At the same 
time, critics have maintained that medical costs have soared because hospitals 
purchase the same expensive equipment and duplicate services.

PLEASANT VALLEY DELAYS SCHOOL BOND ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a lack of time to organize an effective campaign, members of the 
Pleasant Valley school board agreed Thursday to delay a special $55-million 
bond election from March until June. 
</P>
<P>
 After two failed bond election attempts in 1991, board members said they were 
leery of setting another election without proper preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the board's five members, however, denied the need for funds to build 
three elementary schools and modernize aging buildings, many older than 30 
years, in the 14-school, 6,900-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came before the board because the district must give notice to 
county election officials this month if it plans to hold a special bond 
election in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want to take a chance and fail again," school board member Jan 
McDonald said. "Personally, I would favor trying for a June special election. 
It would give us the time we need." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald added that the decision was not based solely on campaign logistics. 
With the possibility of one or both of the county's two Navy bases turning up 
on a federal base closure list March 1, it makes sense to delay a special 
election until then, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, our county's economy will be in serious trouble if they close one 
of the bases," she said. "Running an election right at that time would be a 
mistake in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said base closings could also reduce the number of students in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 But based on community meetings and phone surveys, district officials say they 
believe 1995 could be their year to see a bond measure approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hamilton, the district's associate superintendent, said though both 
1991 bond measures were defeated, they garnered more than 60% of the vote in 
each contest. Bond elections require a two-thirds vote.

CHILDREN SINGING FOR CHILDREN; HUNGER: A UGANDAN CHOIR PRESENTS A HIGH-ENERGY 
CONCERT TO RAISE FUNDS FOR VICTIMIZED YOUNG AFRICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Fred Otukuru makes a rather unusual missionary. For starters, he's only 9 
years old. He'd love to hang out day and night at a Chuck E. Cheese pizza 
joint. And though he ministers to Americans, he speaks English only haltingly. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to delivering religion -- and hope, and faith, and cheer -- 
Fred is an old pro. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the African Children's Choir, Fred proved his flair for missionary 
work in a supercharged concert at a Thousand Oaks church Wednesday night. Along 
with two dozen other impoverished or orphaned students from war-wracked Uganda, 
Fred exploded into song and dance to raise money for victimized children 
elsewhere in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times we see on TV or hear on the radio that a huge number of 
children are starving to death in East Africa, and the problem seems so 
overwhelming," choir director Gordon Tonn said during a fund-raising 
intermission. "These children are here to show you that you can make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The high-energy concert drew more than 500 people to Emmanuel Presbyterian 
Church. Backed up by a booming sound system and a driving drum beat, the choir 
belted out African and American religious tunes -- and threw in a few secular 
favorites as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children had suffered horrors in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had lost parents to the ethnic violence that has shredded their homeland 
during recent years. Others had endured gripping famines. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorizing the nation from 1971 to 1979, dictator Idi Amin persecuted 
Christians with special vigor. The regime that followed his was equally brutal. 
For years, the children endured hunger, war, isolation, fear. But through it 
all, they kept their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Thousand Oaks concert, they set aside their nightmares to focus on 
their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic to see that, even though they're orphans, they have so much 
hope," said Holly Emerson, who towed her two children to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded a decade ago by the nonprofit Christian charity Friends in the West, 
the African Children's Choir tours the United States each year, showcasing the 
talent of several dozen children ages 5 through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 After stops in Washington and Oregon, the choir arrived in Thousand Oaks this 
week. They will sing in Disneyland on Dec. 19, and then swing through Arizona, 
New Mexico and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 While the children receive several hours of schooling each day, their main 
focus remains the performances -- up to 250 during the yearlong tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're singing to raise money for the other children, so they can have 
clothes, go to school and have a house to live in," explained 11-year-old 
Charity Nyamungu, who hopes to one day be an airline stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir's hearty, heartfelt performances tend to fill collection plates 
everywhere. Bolstered by donated clothes, food, shelter and even medical care, 
the choir tour costs very little to stage. So more than 80% of the money 
collected during concerts goes directly to Africa, according to tour leader 
Debbie Tonn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the African Children's Choir raised enough money to support 3,500 
orphaned children in Sudan. This year, the group will dedicate its profits to 
building orphanages and schools in the devastated nation of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show people that these kids are worth saving," Debbie Tonn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even as they teach Americans about far-off Africa, the Ugandan children 
delight in learning about the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bopping from host family to host family, the children are grateful when they 
are served traditional Ugandan foods like chicken, rice, yams and mangoes. But 
they are equally thrilled when presented with exotic treats like pizza or 
spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour leaders forbid the children to drink soda, watch television or play video 
games, since they will not be able to experience such luxuries when they return 
to Uganda. Still, the kids have tasted other all-American activities -- and 
most have become fanatics about swimming, roller skating and Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They have also picked up some cultural savvy: "I think all the people in 
America want to go to Disneyland," Fred said, grinning broadly at the thought 
of his planned visit to the enchanted theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allure of American life, several members of the choir said they 
will be glad to return home next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Uganda, they will live and study in a Friends in the West orphanage. 
They may also witness -- or perhaps even spark -- their country's renewal. Last 
summer's reinstatement of a long-suppressed monarchy has raised hopes that 
Uganda may soon overcome its history of corruption and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so encouraging to imagine their futures," said Debbie Tonn.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BOND JITTERS EASE BUT STOCKS GET SLAMMED; MARKETS: 
THE DOW INDEX PLUNGES 50 POINTS IN HEAVY TRADING WHILE SELLING OF MUNI BONDS 
SLOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Investors' jitters about municipal bonds abated significantly on Thursday, but 
the bond market's gains were no help to the stock market, where prices plunged 
in a brutal selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing some of the bond market's anguish over Orange County's shocking 
bankruptcy, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 49.79 points to 3,685.73 
in extremely heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county's financial ills don't have a direct effect on the broad 
stock market, analysts said the bankruptcy raised fears about widespread 
financial losses among other municipal investment funds nationwide, which in 
turn could have implications for the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a radiation cloud over the market," said Alan Ackerman, investment 
strategist at Reich & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In the muni bond market, traders said the theoretical prices of Orange County 
bonds improved sharply on Thursday from Wednesday, when a few bidders were 
offering 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said bids on Orange County and related bonds were in the range of 80 
cents to 85 cents on the dollar Thursday as interested investors stepped up, 
though they said few bond owners were actually selling even at those improved 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts fear that potential buyers will again lower their bids 
today, in the wake of news late Thursday that the county officially defaulted 
on two series of taxable pension obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bankruptcy filing, many analysts have been hopeful that the county 
would continue to make timely interest and principal payments on its bonds, as 
some other bankrupt municipalities have done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 One bond trader said the pension-bond default "shows a willingness on the part 
of the county to walk away" from its obligations, which he said won't be 
well-received in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, traders said bid prices for San Diego County bonds plummeted on 
Thursday amid mounting worries about losses suffered in its investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of most California muni bonds, however, were only slightly lower on 
Thursday, which was reflected in minor losses among California muni bond mutual 
funds -- following sharp price declines on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most mutual fund companies that manage California muni bond or money-market 
funds continued to insist that relatively few individual investors are bailing 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard Group said shareholders pulled about 1% of the assets from the 
firm's $1-billion California tax-exempt muni money-market fund on Thursday. The 
Benham Group and Franklin Resources both said they were experiencing net 
outflows from their California bond and money-market funds on Thursday but that 
the amounts were small. 
</P>
<P>
 A Franklin spokeswoman said that although many investors are calling to ask 
about their muni funds' ownership of Orange County bonds, "once we explain how 
low our exposure is, they feel better." Franklin and most other fund firms say 
their muni funds have less than 1% of assets in direct, uninsured obligations 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, to calm investors Franklin said its holding company Thursday 
purchased $7.1 million in Orange County notes from two of the firm's money 
market funds, thus removing any threat of shareholder loss on those notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Treasury bond market on Thursday, yields were mixed, reflecting fallout 
from the Orange County mess. Yields on shorter-term Treasury securities, 
meaning those maturing in six months to five years, rose as major brokerages 
dumped similar-maturity U.S. government agency bonds held as collateral for 
loans they had made to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month T-bill yield jumped to 6.47% from 6.38% on Wednesday, while the 
five-year T-note rose to 7.74% from 7.71%. 
</P>
<P>
 But longer-term bond yields continued to ease. The yield on the 30-year T-bond 
dipped to 7.87% from 7.89% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term yields' continuing slide was no tonic for the stock market, however, 
as share prices plunged across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The market opened mostly lower and could not regain its footing. The Dow, off 
1.3%, masked an even deeper decline in many market sectors. Falling stocks 
swamped rising stocks by 18 to 5 on the NYSE as volume soared to 363 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation stocks were particularly hammered, with the Dow transports 
index tumbling 38.19 points to 1,377.48, as investors bailed out of airline 
stocks on worries about earnings prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks plummeted 15.15 points, or 
2.1%, to 719.12, hurt by a selloff in tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said many investors appeared to be throwing in the towel on stocks, 
responding in part to the surge in short-term interest rates in recent months 
that has made bank CDs and other savings vehicles more attractive than at any 
time since 1991. What's more, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted 
Wednesday that the central bank may push short-term rates even higher to 
restrain the strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters also said the Orange County debacle is providing a 
convenient excuse for investors who have wanted to sell stocks anyway but 
needed a push. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get something like Orange County happening, the people who have been 
thinking about selling do it right away, while the people who have been 
thinking about buying put it off," said Michael Burke, analyst at research firm 
Investors Intelligence in New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 In one measure of investors' deteriorating view of the market, Investors 
Intelligence's weekly survey of investment newsletter writers shows 59.1% now 
bearish on stocks -- the highest percentage since March, 1982, Burke said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SOME EXPERTS SAY COUNTY MAY HAVE TO LIQUIDATE 
FUND; FINANCE: AMONG OPTIONS DISCUSSED TO SALVAGE TROUBLED PORTFOLIO ARE DEEP 
DISCOUNTS OR A COMPLICATED DERIVATIVES SWAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It seems increasingly likely that Orange County will eventually be forced to 
restructure and possibly liquidate all or most of its huge bond portfolio, 
either through deep discounts or some type of complicated swap, experts said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows this stuff is going to have to hit the street sooner or 
later," said Steven Clarke, a former director of fixed-income investments at 
Goldman Sachs & Co. in Los Angeles, who was called in to help the city of San 
Jose sell parts of its $325-million bond portfolio when it got into similar 
trouble a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of what the restructured bonds will look like and who will 
buy it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, which on Tuesday filed the largest government bankruptcy in 
U.S. history, said Thursday it has assembled a financial team led by former 
state Treasurer Thomas Hayes to guide the county out of its crisis, but details 
about their strategy to salvage the portfolio were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can continue business as normal under Chapter 9 bankruptcy and they can 
start to liquidate or restructure the portfolio," said Ron Rus, a bankruptcy 
lawyer in Newport Beach. "But to me, it's frightening. The problem here is that 
the portfolio is so highly leveraged that there is not a sufficient asset 
there. Somebody or a group of somebodies are going to have to take a (big 
loss)." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the wealthiest areas in the state, Orange County ran into trouble when 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned under fire 
earlier this week, used a risky investment strategy to leverage county money in 
a massive bet on bonds -- a bet, in essence, on falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of focusing on portfolio safety and liquidity, Citron concentrated on 
rate of return as a measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly leveraged pool -- valued at $20 billion at its peak -- included 
only $7.5 billion in county and municipality funds, while more than $12 billion 
had been borrowed. The county said last week it has lost $1.5 billion on the 
portfolio since Jan. 1, but some analysts say those losses have grown this week 
as major investment banking firms such as CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley 
have sold off -- at discounted prices -- most of the bonds previously bought on 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, the city of San Jose also was lured by high yields, 
investing heavily via reverse repurchase agreements, following the advice of 
Wall Street brokerages to borrow short-term funds to buy long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a scenario similar to Orange County's, the high-risk reverse repo 
transactions began to lose money as interest rates rose in 1983. But unlike in 
Orange County, San Jose city officials caught the problem early, acting quickly 
to sell off $106 million in bonds, allowing it to raise enough money to pay its 
debts. The city's losses were confined to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County will probably attempt to solve its problems through some sort of 
a portfolio restructuring, though the bankruptcy adds a new spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they are bankrupt, you have a whole new ballgame," said Clarke, who 
advised San Jose. "You have two ways you can go: You can continue to manage the 
portfolio, or you can restructure and sell it. As long as they hold the 
securities, they are exposed to further interest rate risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bond market in recent days has absorbed $9 billion in U.S. 
government agency bonds sold by the fund's brokerage lenders as they liquidated 
their collateral, it's unclear how much some of the more complicated 
"derivative" bonds left in the portfolio would fetch if sold. The derivative 
securities' yields generally decline as market rates move up. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is looking for help from Capital Market Risk Advisors Inc. in 
New York, a company that typically advises banks, mutual funds and large 
corporations on how to avoid or control losses from derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a loss is posted, you can't really do anything," said Leslie Lynn Rahl, 
principal of the firm. "You can put out a new (derivative) bet and hope it will 
do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rahl would not elaborate, one of the options reportedly being 
considered by Orange County is another risky transaction -- some type of 
derivatives swap arrangement that would hedge Orange County's previous bets 
that interest rates would decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the solutions to a derivative that's underwater is that you buy 
something else" to balance the risk, said Zane Mann, publisher of the 
California Municipal Bond Advisor in Palm Springs. "Then you have to find some 
way to sell it or wait until it matures to prevent future losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But turning to additional investments in derivatives -- the same type of 
transactions that led to the county's current troubles -- could be unacceptable 
to the more than 185 local agencies whose investments in the county's pool are 
effectively frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 County administrators said they filed bankruptcy to avoid a run on the fund 
and to give them some time to enlist expert help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are going to use some time to sort it through in a rational, 
thoughtful way," said Barbara Shipnuck, former chair of the National Assn. of 
Counties Tax-Exempt Finance Committee.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NO CALL FOR BOLD GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, EXPERTS 
SAY; INVESTING: SUCH ACTION WOULD SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL TO OTHER 
MUNICIPALITIES, A BANKING PROFESSOR ARGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's too bad for Orange County, but its financial hardship does not demand any 
bold government action, municipal finance experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal government helps with some kind of emergency financial aid or 
regulatory help, "it would send a signal to other treasurers: 'Why don't I try 
gambling too?' It would be an encouragement to make bigger and bigger bets," 
said George Kaufman, professor of banking and finance at Loyola University in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the immediate shocks are over, other experts suggested, the Orange County 
financial debacle could even prove salutary for various U.S. counties, cities 
and districts as they make investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long range, this could be good for municipalities . . . making them 
more prudent in what returns they expect on their funds," said John Antonellis, 
vice president of municipal trading at J.B. Hanauer & Co., a retail bond firm 
in Parsippany, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's clients, affluent individuals, have expressed interest and some 
concern, but there is no sense of panic and no fear that the Orange County 
problem will be duplicated elsewhere, Antonellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shannon, an expert on state and local finance and a consultant to the 
Urban Institute, said Orange County's troubles offer a painful but beneficial 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to learn by experience," Shannon said. "If you try to devise a 
master plan from Washington to prevent people from making mistakes, you create 
more problems than you solve." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan "made darn good sense not to go for 
some knee-jerk manufactured solution," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was general acceptance of Greenspan's deliberate inaction in 
telling a congressional hearing Wednesday that the massive losses Orange County 
and other unlucky investors suffered were simply part of the "bumpy process" in 
falling bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of billions of dollars has been lost as bond prices fell, Greenspan 
reminded the members of the committee. As interest rates rise, bond prices 
fall. The Fed's policy of driving up interest rates to nip any resurgence of 
inflation has had the effect of wiping out a significant portion of bond 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 In borrowing money to invest in bonds, Orange County was betting on low 
interest rates. As rates kept rising this year, the bonds' value fell. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping hands off the Orange County situation, Greenspan "was acting 
appropriately," said Barbara Shipnuck, chairwoman of the Monterey County, 
Calif., Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good judgment for now," she said. "To overreact based on the partial 
knowledge of one incident is not the best way to deal with financial issues in 
the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the Orange County supervisors are trying to put together a 
workable plan to solve the fiscal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they find they are unable to come up with a plan that satisfies them, then 
they ought to be able to ask for (outside) help," said Shipnuck, who has also 
led the tax-exempt finance committee of the National Assn. of Counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan and his Fed colleagues could not intervene because helping Orange 
County "would have been contrary to their anti-inflation policy of raising 
interest rates," noted Edward Furash, managing partner of Furash & Co., a 
Washington financial consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund managers "crossed the line from prudence to gambling," Furash said. 
"These people gambled, and rates went up faster than they expected," he said. 
"That doesn't mean the rest of the country should pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate market effect of Orange County's problems will be difficult but 
manageable, though, according to Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond 
Investors Assn., which provides advice on municipal and corporate bonds, and 
publishes newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
 "California paper generally will get hurt," he said. "There probably will be a 
widening of spreads between lower and higher quality bonds, with a flight to 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 But the market will settle down, he predicted, as states and municipalities 
involved in pooled investing "step forward and say they were not engaged" in 
this kind of highly leveraged, risky activity.

MORGAN STANLEY AND LONDON'S WARBURG IN MERGER DISCUSSIONS; DEALS: A PAIRING OF 
THE TWO FINANCIAL GIANTS WOULD CREATE A GLOBAL POWERHOUSE. MORGAN WOULD BE THE 
MAJORITY PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that would create a financial powerhouse on both sides of the 
Atlantic, Wall Street's Morgan Stanley Group and S. G. Warburg Group of London 
on Thursday said they were discussing a merger of the two financial bluebloods. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of two of the world's top financial firms -- under control of 
Morgan Stanley -- would give the merged company greater access to corporations 
and investors around the globe. It also would transform Europe's financial 
center by making an American firm dominant in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably make them the premier transatlantic investment bank," said 
Peter Toeman at the investment bank Hoare Govett in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan -- the fourth-largest U.S. securities firm -- and Warburg -- Britain's 
largest brokerage house -- served as advisers to a combined $62 billion, or 
17%, of the world's merger business this year. Together they underwrote about 
$66 billion, or 6.5%, of all stocks and bonds sold in the United States and in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger talks are taking place amid the worst year on Wall Street since 
1990, underscoring the growing competition among financial companies in 
worldwide capital markets. Morgan is also entangled in Orange County's current 
financial fiasco, after lending the county an estimated $2 billion to buy bonds 
on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Warburg has been the subject of merger or buyout rumors since early October, 
when the company warned that its profits would fall. After rumors about other 
banks bidding for Warburg hit the London Stock Exchange, pushing Warburg's 
shares sharply higher Thursday, the company issued a terse statement 
identifying Morgan Stanley as its potential partner. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Morgan Stanley confirmed that the two were discussing a 
combination that would be "uniquely complementary" and involve the formation of 
a new holding company that would be held two-thirds by Morgan Stanley 
shareholders and one-third by Warburg shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Warburg's stock closed 18% higher at $12.26 in London. Morgan Stanley shares 
fell $1.625 to $55.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would give Morgan the benefit of Warburg's extensive ties in Britain 
and elsewhere on the Continent. A merger with Morgan Stanley would give Warburg 
a strong presence on Wall Street, although as a minority partner in the new 
company it would lose a measure of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a very strong, very well-regarded bank, each on its own turf. What 
they can make of it together, time will tell," said Raphael Soifer, a financial 
services analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Both financial houses have served a long and wealthy line of clients ranging 
from German kaisers to American Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Morgan was founded in 1935 after Congress broke up the J. P. 
Morgan empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warburg family, whose firm was founded in the mid-17th Century, was among 
Europe's most powerful banking families. In 1934, the Warburgs fled their 
native Germany for Britain to escape Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The news did not sit as well with employees of the investment banks, which 
might eliminate overlapping departments and positions. At Morgan Stanley's 
London offices, where workers learned of the merger talks when a bulletin 
flashed on financial trading screens, there was rampant fear of job loss, 
according to one employee.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; LOSERS -- AND WINNERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crisis breeds opportunity -- both to make good investments and to tumble into 
bad ones. Orange County's shocking decision to seek Bankruptcy Court protection 
could rock firms like Granite Construction Inc. that counted on the county's 
business -- in its case, a contract to build the San Joaquin Hills toll road. 
Some analysts say that it could boost the shares of companies whose businesses 
could expand -- such as Ambac, a New York firm that insures bond issues. Shares 
in Merrill Lynch, one of the country's key financiers, continued to slide as a 
result of the debacle. BONDS TO BET ON? 
</P>
<P>
 Some municipal bonds with "Orange County" in their name may not be poison. 
Bond traders say bonds issued by agencies that did not invest in the county's 
loss-wracked investment pool and that are paid from an independent revenue 
stream -- such as municipal utility issues -- could be a good bet. Indeed, they 
might rebound as their distance from the county's problems become more evident. 
But be careful, traders say; some may have indirect ties to the pool. BOND FUND 
VALUES DECLINE

 Intel Announces New Chip Plant: Intel Corp. said officially that it will build 
what is likely to become the world's most expensive computer chip factory in 
Hillsboro, Ore.Last summer, the company raised expectations that the plant 
would be built there after receiving a tax break from Washington County for it. 
The first phase of construction will cost $565 million, and completion is 
scheduled for 1997, the company said. A second phase is expected to bring its 
total cost to $2.2 billion.

 Edison Signs More Side Deals With Power Generators: Southern California Edison 
Co. said it has negotiated options to buy electricity from three more of the 
independent energy producers that previously won power-purchase contracts from 
Edison under an auction mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Edison, which is contesting the auction, has long contended that it does not 
need the new power, which it estimates would cost ratepayers $200 million to 
$300 million more a year.Edison signed a similar deal last month with Kenetech 
Corp., a windmill energy producer. Wednesday's deal with U.S. Generating Co. -- 
an independent power producer owned by subsidiaries of Bechtel Group Inc. and 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- is for an option to buy 372 megawatts of power. 
Edison also said it has bought out the auction contracts won by two smaller 
producers -- BTI Chino, a biomass energy company, and Mammoth Pacific, a 
geothermal producer. Edison wants the PUC to accept these deals in place of the 
30-year auction contracts that would force it to buy power.

active Wall Street investment firm, and its investment adviser affiliate, Gamco 
Investors Inc., also agreed in the $100,000 settlement with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to a cease and desist order and appointment of an 
independent consultant to review the firm's trading policies. Gabelli, based in 
Rye, N.Y., did not admit or deny SEC allegations that it failed to prevent 
misuse of confidential information. The firm described the SEC's charges as a 
"technical debate" and said it settled in order to conclude the matter.

FINAL HURDLE FOR MACY, FEDERATED DEAL CLEARED; REORGANIZATION: MERGER OF 
RETAILERS WILL CREATE NATION'S LARGEST DEPARTMENT STORE FIRM. 
</P>

<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. cleared its final hurdle before exiting from bankruptcy when a 
federal judge on Thursday approved a plan for the renowned retailer to merge 
with Federated Department Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've signed the order of confirmation," U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton L. 
Lifland intoned just before 1 p.m. EST at a hearing, effectively ending Macy's 
nearly three-year refuge from a legacy of big debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifland's endorsement was the last significant step before the combination of 
the former rivals could be completed. The union of Macy and Federated will 
create the nation's biggest department store company, encompassing more than 
335 stores with annual sales exceeding $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The retailer known for its Thanksgiving parade and store in Manhattan's Herald 
Square still has a few loose ends to tie up before the merger can be 
accomplished, which is expected by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very bright day indeed," beamed Myron E. Ullman III, chairman and 
chief executive of Macy's, after the hearing. He said, "Macy's has been 
restored to financial health and its franchise preserved, saving tens of 
thousands of jobs at hundreds of department and specialty stores in communities 
around the nation, while enabling our creditors to be fairly compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman, and James Zimmerman, the company's 
president, said in a statement they believed the merger will create "a stronger 
competitor and more effective provider of value to our customers in the years 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Federated's purchase of a $449.3-million bankruptcy claim against Macy gave it 
the leverage to negotiate a merger with its rival.  
</P>
<P>
 Creditors will receive about $4.12 billion as Federated pays off Macy's debts 
after the merger.

 British Firm Sues Bankers Trust: Bankers Trust New York Co. Inc., a big 
derivatives trader, has been hit with another lawsuit by a customer who alleges 
it was misled about the risks of the exotic securities.A subsidiary of Carlton 
Communications, a British media firm, charged in the suit that the bank's 
investment management division used deceptive practices when it traded in risky 
securities on Carlton's behalf. Carlton lost $4.4 million on the investments, 
according to a suit filed in October but first disclosed in Thursday's editions 
of the Wall Street Journal. The company seeks restitution plus expenses. 
Bankers Trust denied that it misled Carlton, saying the firm knew how its money 
was invested.

Treasury said. The average price and yield to maturity on the bills were 93.175

 Ford to Fix Transmission: Ford Motor Co. has sent letters to 437,000 owners of 
1991 Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental cars with automatic 
transmissions warning that the transmissions might exhibit "erratic operation." 
Ford dealers said "erratic" refers to transmissions that shift gears suddenly 
or sluggishly or, in some cases, not at all.Both Ford and the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration say the problem does not amount to a safety 
hazard. "There is no danger that the car would suddenly stop in traffic," a 
spokeswoman for Ford's customer service division said. In explaining the 
defect, Ford said the transmissions "were not meeting durability expectations." 
A transmission typically costs about $1,500 to replace. Ford's letter promises 
to extend the transmission warranties on the affected cars for another six 
months. Coverage includes 1991 models whose original transmission warranties 
have expired. Ford is agreeing to give refunds to owners of those cars whose 
transmissions have already been repaired or replaced.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; INVESTORS ARE TOLD THAT STAYING PUT IS SMARTER 
THAN SELLING INTO PANIC; WALL STREET: MORE THAN 50% OF THE 100 LARGEST PUBLICLY 
TRADED O.C. STOCKS FELL. NEARLY 25% GAINED.

<P>
 To frazzled holders of Orange County-related stocks and bonds, experts offered 
some simple advice Thursday in light of the bond fiasco that forced the county 
into bankruptcy: calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic selling will make losses a certainty, they said, and harm an investor's 
long range interests. Investors should think twice even if they hold bonds of 
municipalities that invested in the troubled fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sell now, you could be looking at a 20% loss on an individual bond. That 
is a substantial depreciation," said Doug Fabian, co-publisher of monthly 
mutual fund newsletter based in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was the original goal when it was purchased, to hold it to maturity? 
This should not interrupt it." 
</P>
<P>
 The same advice held true for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks will not be affected . . . nor will companies' earnings be affected in 
any significant fashion," said Ian Gilson, a stock analyst at Van Kasper & Co. 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not send Orange County companies running to set up headquarters in 
Nevada." 
</P>
<P>
 Most investors were apparently heeding the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few sales offers for Orange County bonds Thursday, and the stock 
prices of companies with connections to the county were relatively stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to quite a few business customers and they don't seem overly 
concerned," said David McCoy, executive vice president of Southern California 
Bank, the largest county-based bank with more than $400 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The tranquillity was especially noticeable in the bond markets, where few 
holders were willing to part with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond specialists repeatedly pointed to the record of safety for municipal 
bonds: even during the Great Depression, fewer than 1% of municipal bonds 
failed to pay back their bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction to the bonds would be to sit tight and don't worry," said 
W. Peck Ferrin, head municipal bond trader for Bank of America in San Franciso. 
"If there is a revenue stream tied to the bonds, there should be no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue bonds, as they are called, are among the safest because they are 
backed by a specific revenue stream, like a special tax or fee, that keeps them 
separate and distinct from most of the troubled county bond pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue bonds are "a reasonable speculation. Let's put it that way," said 
Robert Gore, a bond trader for Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 So reasonable, in fact, that potential investors continued to swirl around the 
fringes of the Orange County financial disaster, ready to snatch up some of the 
better Orange County bonds if panic selling developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have seen is very sophisticated buyers saying that if things get out 
of hand, call me," Ferrin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers were offering bids as low as 48% below the previous trading 
value of the bonds, but bondholders were staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some movement among county-related stocks Thursday, but nothing 
dramatic, given the steep falloff on Wall Street generally. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 100 largest publicly traded corporations based in Orange 
County had lower stock prices Thursday, while nearly a quarter gained in price. 
The rest were unchanged. A few companies said that their stock prices were 
swinging in response to the bond news. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Granite Construction Inc. of Watsonville dropped 12.7% after it 
announced that part of the bond paying for a San Joaquin Hills toll road 
project, on which it is a major contractor, was invested in the county pool run 
by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock closed down $2.63 at $18 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is reacting to the Draconian scenario in which construction would 
stop permanently in the middle of next year. We think that is unlikely," said 
Michael Lawson, a spokesman for the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let our investors know that although the transportation agency invested 
with Citron, we have not gotten a work stoppage order." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Irvine Apartment Communities real estate investment trust, which lost 
nearly 5% of its value Wednesday on rumors that it was linked to the 
bankruptcy, saw a rebound on Thursday. Its shares regained 4.3% to close at 
$15.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some panic selling" Wednesday, said Dick Moran, chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Wall Street realized that the effect was more on governments and not 
so much on private companies. We think the panic was momentary and it seemed to 
pass."

DEAL TO WED 2 MAJOR MORTGAGE LENDERS; MERGER: NORWEST OF MINNESOTA WILL BUY 
RIVERSIDE FIRM. PRICE IS ESTIMATED AT $250 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Minneapolis-based financial services firm Norwest Corp. said Thursday it has 
agreed to acquire Directors Mortgage Loan Corp. of Riverside, the nation's 
largest privately held mortgage banker. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies would not disclose terms, but analysts had estimated a value of 
about $250 million for the deal, which was under negotiation for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors will be merged with Norwest's Des Moines-based Norwest Mortgage Inc. 
subsidiary, the nation's fourth-largest home mortgage lender. Directors ranks 
15th among U.S. mortgage lenders. As of Sept. 30, it held $4.7 billion in new 
mortgage notes and a mortgage loan service portfolio of $13.1 billion. The 
company operates in 25 states, but more than two-thirds of its business is in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will expand Norwest Mortgage's lending and mortgage servicing 
business -- particularly in the West -- said Mark Oman, president of Norwest 
Mortgage. It will also strengthen Norwest's relationship with builders, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about the merger of Directors Mortgage with our mortgage 
banking business," said Oman. "Directors Mortgage brings deep management 
strength, an operating philosophy consistent with ours, a proven track record 
and a tremendous reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Directors officials said they entered the negotiations with Norwest in 
September, to help them gain stability as mortgage banking undergoes 
"fundamental changes," and because they felt Norwest would make a good match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norwest brings Directors financial strength and the ability to weather the 
changing economic cycles," said Directors Senior Vice President Robert Garman. 
"They have a proven commitment to retail mortgage banking, enhanced technology 
and a growing national market share." 
</P>
<P>
 Garman said many Directors branch offices would continue to operate under the 
same name and that he did not expect the merger would result in any reduction 
in the company's 2,000-person work force. Directors would also maintain its 
current management, Garman said.. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest Corp. with $56.6 billion in assets has interests in banking and 
insurance as well as mortgage lending among other financial services.

INVENTORIES RISE FOR A 4TH STRAIGHT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wholesale inventories increased for a fourth straight month in October, the 
Commerce Department said Thursday, and sales increased moderately. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady rise in stocks of goods on hand during the fall indicates that 
wholesalers anticipated strong holiday sale prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said inventories held by merchant wholesalers grew 0.6% to a 
seasonally adjusted $230.13 billion following a revised 0.5% rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
 During October, wholesalers' sales increased 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted 
$174.93 billion after falling in September by a revised 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the department said inventories had risen 0.4% in September and 
that sales had fallen 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The additions to inventory in October were entirely at the durable goods 
level, as stocks of products like automobiles and furniture increased 1.0% to a 
seasonally adjusted $148.15 billion. By contrast, inventories of non-durable 
items like food and petroleum products fell fractionally from September's 
levels, by 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted $81.98 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventory-building adds to the economy's vigor by keeping production of goods 
and services at a relatively brisk level. 
</P>
<P>
 At October's sales pace, merchants had on hand 1.32 months' worth of goods to 
sell, a slight rise from 1.31 months' worth in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing 
new claims for state unemployment benefits climbed by 6,000 last week to 
322,000, up from a revised 316,000 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial claims for the Nov. 26 week were previously reported at 317,000. New 
claims for jobless benefits typically go down in a holiday week. 
</P>
<P>
 The closely watched four-week moving average, which irons out weekly 
fluctuations and is considered a more accurate indicator of jobless trends than 
the weekly totals, dipped in the Dec. 3 week by 2,750 to 323,000 from a revised 
325,750 a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The total for the week ended Dec. 3 came in below Wall Street economists' 
expectations of 325,000 initial claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said 17 states reported decreases in claims, on an unadjusted 
basis, of more than 1,000 in the week ended Nov. 26, the latest period for 
which the data were available. California led the nation with 35,181 fewer 
claims, followed by North Carolina with 5,405 and New Jersey, off 4,671.

 With the holiday shopping season under way, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission has announced massive recalls of a number of products, most of which 
have small parts that might cause a child to choke. The makers of all the 
products have agreed to go along with the recalls. Most of the products can be 
taken back to where they were purchased for full refunds. The items include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The children's book "Christmas in the Manger" by Nola Buck and Felicia Bond 
(HarperCollins Inc.). Forty-six thousand copies are being recalled because one 
page is decorated with plastic jewels that can peel off and are small enough to 
be swallowed by small children. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 2.5 million beanbag chairs made by Baseline Design Division of Crain 
Industries Inc. of Fort Smith, Ark., and sold nationwide by Kmart Corp., 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other big retailers. Agency Chairman Ann Brown said a 
19-month-old Missouri boy died after he unzipped the bag and crawled inside, 
and one girl nearly suffocated after her brother zipped her inside a chair. The 
maker has offered to replace the chairs with new ones that don't have zippers, 
Brown said. Other beanbag-chair makers are being urged to stop using zippers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hasbro Inc.'s Kid Dimension's Littlest Pet Shop Tea Sets. The small plastic 
animals on the teapot and sugar bowl can come off and become choking hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imaginarium's $22.95 battery-operated "Fun Music Center," which has keys, 
drums, cymbals and two bells. It does not meet small-parts safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bicycles made by Specialized Bicycle Components Inc., Cannondale Corp. and 
the Fisher Bicycle Division of Trek Bicycle Corp. The agency said 186,700 are 
being recalled because their seat post bolts can break or crack, and another 
21,000 bikes made by Specialized, Answer Products Inc., Girvin Inc. and 
Marzocchi Suspension will be called in because of reports of front forks 
breaking. Riders can check with their bike shops to see if their models are on 
the recall list.

 Content Labeling: Makers of hot dogs, bologna and other processed foods will 
soon be required to tell consumers whether the poultry meat in their products 
was boned by a machine, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Labels must 
say "mechanically separated chicken" or "mechanically separated turkey."The 
intention is to alert consumers to the possibility of bone content in processed 
poultry. In mechanical boning, high-pressure machinery crushes meat and bone, 
then forces the product through a sieve to remove the larger bone fragments. 
Under the rule, which is to take effect next year, bone content will be limited 
to 1% in mechanically separated poultry, and its use in baby foods will be 
largely prohibited, said Michael Taylor, acting USDA undersecretary for food 
safety.

 Toppled Toilet Draws Lawsuit: A woman who fell from a handicapped-accessible 
toilet at a McDonald's outlet in New York state is suing the restaurant's 
former owner for $600,000. Michelle Verdicchio and her husband, Louis, filed 
the suit this week in Saratoga County Court against Donald John Connelly, who 
owned the restaurant in Clifton Park, N.Y., about 15 miles north of 
Albany.According to the suit, Michelle Verdicchio was seated on the commode in 
June, 1993, when the toilet suddenly shifted and tipped to its side, causing 
her to lose her balance. Verdicchio, whose age was not disclosed, was thrown 
against the wall and suffered injuries to her right arm, shoulder, chest and 
breast, and she suffered emotional distress, the lawsuit said. It was not clear 
whether Verdicchio was using the stall because of a disability.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; IN TURNABOUT, GIANT'S AZOFF MAY STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Giant Records Chief Irving Azoff is in promising discussions to extend his 
contract with Warner Music Group, after threatening to defect earlier this year 
in a battle with senior management. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that Azoff would remain on board through 2000 under the deal, in 
which Warner would also buy the remaining 50% stake in his successful Giant 
Merchandising company. The veteran executive declined to comment on the 
specifics, but confirmed that he hopes to stay with Warner, which is also half 
owner of Giant Records. He said he's encouraged by the company's new 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really got me to sit still for awhile," Azoff said this week. "It showed 
me there was light at the end of the tunnel . . . that this was a place that 
could accomplish what needs to get done." 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff is close to outgoing Warner Bros. Records Chairman Mo Ostin, but was 
formerly at odds with Warner Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado, who oversaw 
the labels. Azoff was infuriated earlier this year when Warner Music Group 
refused to let him release the Eagles reunion album because of unresolved 
litigation. Azoff manages the Eagles. The corporate office also nixed a deal 
that Azoff was pursuing to distribute Rap-A-Lot Records. Warner Music, for its 
part, reportedly felt the Giant Records joint venture was too heavily weighted 
in Azoff's favor. At one juncture, Morgado was said to be demanding a massive 
payout for Warner's share in Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Those strains led to widespread speculation that Azoff would move his business 
elsewhere, possibly to Bertelsmann Music Group or one of the major studios 
without a music division. But it turned out that Morgado's internal problems 
extended beyond Azoff. Morgado's efforts to reorganize the powerful music group 
led to threats of an executive revolt, which was resolved when Morgado turned 
over most domestic responsibilities to his chief lieutenant, Doug Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff called Morris's appointment the "turning point" in his deal discussions. 
He said he's also high on Danny Goldberg, who is replacing Ostin, and also 
comes from the management world. "If there has to be a successor to Mo, he's an 
excellent choice," Azoff said. "Between Danny and Doug, I've got 45 years of 
personal relationships and I'm hardly that old." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are said to be optimistic about a deal being concluded by early 
next year. Warner Music Group declined formal comment on the discussions. But 
one source close to the company said of Azoff: "This is not someone you want to 
lose, as long as the deal works." 
</P>
<P>
 While Warner is said to be negotiating a tougher deal with Azoff this time, 
sources concede that the company is anxious to keep Giant in the fold -- partly 
because of expectations that the Eagles and/or Don Henley will sign with Giant. 
The label, which is distributed by Warner, also has a deal to release a Steely 
Dan album culled from recent live shows and including two new tracks. Giant's 
other hit acts include Big Head Todd and Clay Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renewing his deal with Warner would cap off a strong year for Azoff, a shrewd 
deal maker who's also one of the most colorful music industry figures. The 
Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over" reunion tour is one of the top-grossing acts of 
1994. It resumes Jan. 9 in Tacoma, Wash., and is scheduled to conclude in May. 
The group is mulling further U.S. and overseas dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Merchandising is coming off a similarly strong year, with revenue of 
nearly $100 million from tie-ins with groups such as The Eagles and Metallica. 
As part owner of the Irvine Meadows concert venue, Azoff is also said to be in 
joint operations discussions with one of the other major Orange County venues, 
the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion. 
</P>

<P>
 Sony Pictures employees got a signed letter from film chief Mark Canton this 
week inviting them to special screenings of two upcoming Sony movies -- "Little 
Women" and "Mixed Nuts." The screenings are being held on the Culver City lot 
tonight as a "special gift" to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mixed Nuts" is a comedy from TriStar Pictures starring Steve Martin. Columbia 
Pictures' "Little Women" is based on the classic Louisa May Alcott novel. In 
case people have other plans, the invite lists the exact running time of each 
film. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As they approach the new year, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David 
Geffen still haven't announced a name for their new studio, though they have 
struck a potentially lucrative TV deal with Capital Cities/ABC and hired two 
senior executives -- Helene Hahn and Ronald Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 One reader, Lillian Rae of Oxnard Shores, suggests they turn to the 
dictionary. Rae points out that the plural of genius is Genii. Based on their 
reputations for business smarts she suggests naming the new company Genii 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no response so far from the Big Three. But Katzenberg may be 
playing around with some ideas. Sources say that the restaurant staff at the 
Four Seasons Hotel in West Los Angeles is under orders to place a scratch pad 
and pen at Katzenberg's regular breakfast table each morning on the off chance 
he needs to record a thought or doodle.

COMPANY TOWN; GERMAN MAKES WAVES BY COURTING HOLLYWOOD; BROADCASTING: HELMUT 
THOMA RUNS EUROPE'S MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL TELEVISION COMPANY, AND BUCKS 
THE RULES.

 As managing director of RTL, Germany's leading commercial broadcast company, 
Helmut Thoma has always gone his own way. He's a compatriot of Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and is the person responsible for introducing David Hasselhoff 
and the "Baywatch" phenomenon to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Thoma is bucking the tide again by wooing Hollywood in a major way, just 
as most of his European colleagues are piling up the sandbags in a bid to turn 
back the American cultural invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 As the European Union was revealing plans to change the Broadcasting Without 
Frontiers directive to further restrict U.S. programming in November, Thoma was 
building business ties in New York. He is unapologetic about his pursuit of 
Hollywood, saying: "RTL has always striven to emulate American strategy and 
structure in our own network. We have gotten where we are today by investing 
lots of money in American know-how and American partners." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is not popular in Europe. Current EU regulations say European 
broadcasters must carry a majority of European programming "where practicable." 
That left a loophole for channels like RTL, which are dominated by U.S. 
programming. But the draft EU plan revealed in November removes the "where 
practicable" phrase and forces member countries to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. television, the stakes in Germany are massive. United Germany now 
represents the strongest economic force in Europe and, as the former East 
German market develops, it will become an even stronger world media market with 
a population of some 80 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many new broadcasters in Europe, RTL was the first non-government channel 
in its territory when it started in 1984. In the last decade Germany has gone 
from two state broadcasters -- ARD and ZDF -- to 12 television stations, nine 
of which are commercial. RTL is now the most successful commercial broadcaster 
in Germany and, indeed, in Europe in terms of revenue, which last year hit 
$1.68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Thoma started RTL with 25 staffers working from the small country of 
Luxembourg, home of parent company CLT (Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de 
Television), he produced cheap, attention-getting programming.  
</P>
<P>
 Nightly shows included "Lederhosen" -- or "Love Letter From the Leatherpants," 
a series of soft porn films from the 1970s -- and "Tutti-Frutti," a strip show 
that caused outrage across Europe and brought more than 4 million curious 
viewers to the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 As RTL became more established and took on shareholders like Bertelsmann, it 
expanded its programming budget to $650 million and developed genres that did 
not exist in Germany, such as daily soap operas and sitcoms. While close to 
$200 million of RTL's budget is spent on finished U.S. programs, a large chunk 
of the $650 million is spent on importing talent from the United States, 
Australia and Holland to create German versions of their shows with varying 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such deal with Columbia Television, RTL brought U.S. writers to its 
Cologne headquarters to make a German version of "Who's the Boss?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the British remake of "Boss," called the "The Upper Hand," succeeded, 
Thoma concedes that "it looked like an American sitcom perfectly dubbed into 
German with not-so-good actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a version of "Married With Children" was "more or less a failure, 
too close to the American product," according to Thoma. He says that a Germanic 
"Maude," which has had some success in its French remake, is RTL's next 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thoma himself has a sense of humor that has helped him crack the world of 
German broadcasting. Being Austrian-born is an advantage in German television, 
he says, because "we do not take ourselves so seriously." As his colleagues 
weave across the foyer of the Four Seasons hotel carrying their bounty from a 
Manhattan shopping expedition, Thoma chuckles: "You would think we came from an 
underdeveloped country. All they want to do is shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoma's colorful style has occasionally gotten him into trouble. For example, 
he once compared Leo Kirch, the media entrepreneur who holds German rights to 
many U.S. film libraries, to Hugenberg, the press lord whose newspapers did not 
oppose the Nazi SS coming to power in pre-World War II Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirch took him to the German Trade Court over those remarks and won a case 
that said his comments were unfair, but Thoma is challenging the ruling in 
another court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirch, who owns shares in German commercial broadcasters SAT 1, Pro 7, 
KabelKanal and Premiere, has a stranglehold on U.S. rights in the 
German-speaking market. But Thoma's campaign on Hollywood is positioning RTL so 
it can scoop up Kirch's U.S. deals when they run out over the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoma said he stands by his comments about Kirch.

 Television: NBC fired another regulatory lob at rival Fox, formally contesting 
the emerging network's plan to take away an affiliate in Wisconsin. NBC filed a 
petition to the Federal Communications Commission asking it to block the 
acquisition of WLUK-TV, Green Bay, by Fox and partner Savoy Pictures 
Entertainment Inc. The acquisition, NBC said, would violate FCC rules limiting 
the number of stations one broadcaster can own nationally to 12 and limiting to 
25% the amount of equity a foreign company can take in a U.S. broadcaster.NBC 
raised the same issues before the FCC in August, but stopped short of filing a 
formal petition against the acquisition. Peggy Binzel, vice president of Fox's 
parent News Corp., called the petition "another attempt to use the regulatory 
process to prevent competition." Binzel said she expects further assaults by 
NBC on other station acquisitions. NBC has signed long-term agreements 
extending the network's affiliations with KRON-TV in San Francisco and WOWT in 
Omaha. The agreements -- announced by NBC and Chronicle Broadcasting Company -- 
are said to be for seven to 10 years.

NORTHRIDGE QUAKE CLAIMS TO REACH $900 MILLION, 20TH CENTURY EXPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 20th Century Industries Inc. said it now expects claims related to last 
January's Los Angeles earthquake to be $900 million, up from the $815 million 
estimated two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills insurer said it will have access to the money through its 
planned sale of preferred stock and warrants representing up to a 40% stake in 
the company to New York-based American International Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, the company had paid $722 million to its customers for 
earthquake damages and expenses. In addition, the company paid $46 million for 
claim adjustment expenses, mainly for independent adjuster services. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will hold a special shareholder meeting Thursday to approve its 
capitalization plan with American International Group. Shareholder approval is 
anticipated. The plan won approval from state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, 20th Century will receive $216 million in cash in return for 
convertible preferred stock and warrants.

A CRUCIAL CONNECTION; HOW TO BRIDGE THE LANGUAGE GAP BETWEEN HEARING AND DEAF 
FAMILY MEMBERS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RISK OF ABUSE IS SO HIGH? LOCAL AGENCIES 
THINK THEY HAVE THE ANSWER: OPENING THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The worst thing about deafness is not the lack of hearing, but the inability 
to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being blind cuts you off from things (but) being deaf cuts you off from 
people," Helen Keller, who was both, said a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, much has changed. Actress Marlee Matlin and Miss America Heather 
Whitestone are just the best-known of the many deaf people who have overcome 
difficulties to achieve their goals. But still very real are the frustrations 
that occur when deaf children are born to hearing parents -- or when hearing 
children are born to deaf parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, how can parents and child connect?  
</P>
<P>
 Unless a means of communication is quickly established, experts say, deaf 
children today are at greater risk than others of being abused or neglected. 
Not because they can't hear, but because they lack something hearing people 
take for granted: the ability to express their feelings and thoughts, to 
understand what is happening around them. And to be understood. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of deaf children are born into families where everyone else can 
hear. In some of these families, there is emotional and economic stress, there 
are other siblings to care for -- and there is little time for individual 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It is these deaf children, experts say, who are at greatest risk of being 
ignored, excluded or abused. Because such children communicate so poorly, 
abusers often rightly assume that their crimes will not be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems are no less daunting for deaf parents, 90% of whom give birth to 
children who can hear. In these families, too, the inability of parents to 
communicate with their children may lead to frustration -- and sometimes to 
neglect or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 For these and other compelling reasons, some local institutions that deal with 
child abuse have recently created special units to help families in which there 
is a deaf parent or child. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, a special Deaf Unit was set up in the L.A. County Department 
of Children's Services. All cases involving deaf parents or children will be 
handled by social workers who are also deaf and who are trained to deal with 
problems unique to deaf people. 
</P>
<P>
 Two courtrooms in the Los Angeles Dependency Court have also been set aside 
this year for cases involving abused or neglected deaf children. Judges, 
attorneys and other court personnel undergo training to better understand these 
children's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The forerunner of all this was a Deaf Services program started in 1990 at Five 
Acres in Altadena, a nonprofit treatment center for abused and neglected 
children. The program offers therapy, in-home counseling, in-home parent-skill 
training, family communication assistance and aid in obtaining medical, social 
or other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, hearing parents don't discover their child is deaf until the child 
should be learning to speak," says Deaf Services Director Rick Mitchell, 37, a 
psychotherapist who specializes in abuse issues of deaf children. "Then there's 
a period of grief. Next comes the confusion -- what world should my child grow 
up in? The world of the hearing or the world of the deaf?" 
</P>
<P>
 To join the world of the hearing, children must learn to speak and to read 
lips. To join the world of the deaf, they must learn sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is crucial. But for parents suddenly propelled into a culture 
about which they know nothing, both options have daunting drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents start out wanting their kids to join the hearing world -- that 
is, to read lips and to speak. That is the only world the parents know," 
Mitchell says. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly learn that for toddlers who have never heard sounds, the effort 
to produce speech is slow and exhausting. First, children must understand that 
those mysterious lip movements people make are shaping sounds into words. Then 
they must learn to make those word-sounds with nothing to guide them, no way to 
imitate what they have never heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell says it can take months of patient training to teach a child to say a 
single word as simple as ball. It is "enormously difficult," he says, for any 
deaf child to learn language, speech and lip-reading simultaneously, even under 
the best circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitestone, the first deaf Miss America, was blessed with a schoolteacher 
mother who spent thousands of hours teaching her to speak. Even so, she has 
said, it took her six years just to learn to pronounce her own last name. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell says another downside of choosing the oral method is that deaf 
children often wind up with ongoing developmental delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a critical phase of development during which children learn 
language," he says. "Deaf children can learn as quickly as hearing children if 
they use sign language. For example, they learn the word ball in about two 
minutes and go on to the next word. But with the oral method, the child gets 
stuck trying to pronounce the word and delays are inevitable."  
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the oral equation -- learning to read lips -- is no less 
harrowing, Mitchell says. Dozens of words look exactly alike when spoken, even 
though they sound different and mean different things: Cat and hat . Mat and 
bat . Mama and Papa . No new taxes and Go to Texas. Imagine the problems trying 
to decipher sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell says even the most proficient adult lip-readers catch only 50% of 
what is being said. They must intuit the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The option of sign language begins to sound better. But parents and siblings 
must learn it too, Mitchell says. "You are then encouraging them to join the 
foreign world of the child." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if they are able, he adds, the rest of the world will not oblige. How 
will the child ask the ice cream vendor for a vanilla cone with sprinkles? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given all these challenges, it is easy to see why deaf children are easy 
targets for abuse. Without committed parents and appropriate assistance, they 
cannot comprehend what is happening to them or around them, nor do they develop 
self-protective mechanisms or the simplest social skills. Their mere presence 
in an already dysfunctional family can cause added friction, frustration, 
confusion, guilt -- any of which can trigger abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Murphy, 25, is a counselor in the Deaf Services program at Five Acres. 
She goes into homes in which children have been abused or are at risk of abuse 
and "tries to break the cycle of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent case, she says, involved deaf parents with four children under age 7 
-- all of whom could hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of visits, I observe what is going on. I see no structure, 
no discipline, no communication. A toddler lights the gas stove and walks 
around with flaming paper. Another plays with knives and jumps on furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are trying to deal with one child at a time, using sign 
language," Murphy says. "But the kids don't know how to sign back -- except 
they've figured out how to ask for milk and crackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents were hitting the kids because it is the only way they can impose 
order. That doesn't work because the kids never got an explanation of why they 
were being hit. The mother can take the flaming paper away and hit the child, 
for example, but she has no way of explaining to him the dangers of playing 
with fire. They do not share a language. It is total chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who cannot hear and uses sign language, says she suggested ways to 
punish the children without using force, advised the parents on how to relieve 
stress, and is working on improving communication within the household. "These 
parents and kids never had a conversation. They had no way to communicate with 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy says many deaf parents don't want their hearing kids to learn sign 
language because they want them to join the hearing world. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to leave the radio and TV on all the time, so the children will 
learn. They invite relatives and friends over to converse with the kids. All 
that is fine. But there must be a relationship and communication between parent 
and child -- which can (only) be accomplished by the children learning sign 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was 3 when she lost much of her hearing to spinal meningitis. Doctors 
recommended hearing aids and said she would be fine. But her hearing continued 
to worsen until, at 14, she became deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated. I knew no sign language and the hearing aids no longer 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
 But she had already learned to talk and was learning to read lips. Murphy was 
"mainstreamed" through high school, struggling to stay with the hearing culture 
in which she had grown up. To survive, she tried to lip-read what her teachers 
said, then studied her friends' notes at night. ("It is impossible to lip-read 
and take notes at the same time," she explains. "Your eyes cannot be on two 
different places at once.") At 17, she finally decided to learn sign language, 
registered at Cal State Northridge -- and her life altered dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The university provides sign-language interpreters for deaf students. "I 
learned more in one semester at CSUN than I did in all four years of high 
school," she says enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time in my life that I knew everything that was going on. 
And for the first time in my life, I could understand 100% of everything said 
at the dinner table with my (deaf) friends. Growing up, I'd just accepted the 
fact that I would not understand 70% of what was said in my home and at school. 
I never knew there was a deaf world out there, a deaf culture of which I could 
be a part." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, an energetic young woman who loves sports, is training her "hearing 
ear" dog, a German shepherd named Sierra, to tell her when the phone or 
doorbell rings, or when there's a danger signal, such as a siren or someone 
breaking in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog alerts me to the noise and takes me to it. She even picks up my keys 
if they drop and I don't know it. And most important, she can let me know when 
my baby cries." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy has no baby -- yet. "I don't even know who I'm going to marry." But 
she's planning ahead, she says with an optimistic smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if my child were born deaf," she adds, because deaf parents 
with deaf children have comparatively few communication problems. The child 
learns sign language from parents at the same time and pace as a hearing child 
would learn to speak with hearing parents. "And the deaf culture is very rich, 
very satisfying," Murphy says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Maria Banda, 21, is just beginning to learn about all that good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Born deaf into a family with seven children in Mexico, Banda was thought to be 
retarded because she didn't learn to speak. She remembers a childhood of total 
isolation: "I talked to no one. Everybody made fun of me. I really thought I 
was the only person on Earth who couldn't hear. I felt really alone," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She still shudders at the terror she used to feel awakening in the dark to an 
empty house. "They'd wait until I fell asleep, then all leave without telling 
me. They thought I was dumb and wouldn't care. I wasn't dumb; I just couldn't 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father brought her to the United States when Banda was 14. An aunt 
enrolled her in the deaf program at Alhambra High School, and "when I saw 
people talking with their hands I was shocked. I had no idea that was 
possible," Banda says. She had never been to school and began by learning 
simple words, such as the names of animals, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to continue learning, she enrolled in summer school, where friends 
noticed that she cried a lot and never wanted to go home. She finally told one 
friend that she was being abused by a family member. The friend told a teacher, 
who called the Department of Children's Services. Banda was placed in foster 
care with Jan and Don Harwick. It was love at first sight, says Jan Harwick, 
who was fluent in sign language because her mother couldn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at the Harwick home, Banda has received counseling at Five 
Acres, has graduated from high school and has just learned to drive. She works 
three days a week cleaning houses while going to school part-time. "I want 
much, much more education," she says. "I want to go to college and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 And she continues to live with the Harwicks because "we love her," Jan Harwick 
says. "She is part of the family," she says about Banda. "To this day, if I go 
out and she's asleep, I leave a note. I remember how she used to wake up and 
cry and cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwick has grown children of her own and has provided long-term foster care 
for deaf youngsters in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communication is the key," she says. "So many deaf people grow up angry 
because their parents never learned to talk to them. Too many parents say, 'I 
don't have the time to learn sign language.' The deaf child interprets that to 
mean, 'You don't love me.' "

THE GOODS; CONSERVATION PIECES; FURNITURE MADE FROM MILK JUGS? SWEATERS SPUN

 Toss aside the usual gift list this holiday season and start another 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy something "green," urges the Califor nia Department of Conservation. That 
is, give a gift made from recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper goods aren't the only things made from recycled products. Shoes, 
clothes, serving trays, even computer mouse pads can be found that contain 
recycled tires, plastics or paper. 
</P>
<P>
 That annual Christmas sweater can be made from recycled plastic soda bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste materials that would otherwise end up in the landfill are also used to 
make socks and envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are doing their part by recycling. More than eight of 10 beverage 
containers sold in the state are recycled, but collecting beverage containers 
is only half the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time you purchase a product made of recycled material, you're closing 
the loop on recycling," says Michael Byrne, director of the California 
Department of Conservation. "That's good for the environment, good for the 
economy and good for the gift recipients on your list." 
</P>
<P>
 "By changing our buying habits, we can provide a boost to the emerging 
recycled products industry," Byrne adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Below are examples of the range of green gifts available. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Conservation provides this list as a public 
service, and makes no assurances as to the quality of these products. 
</P>

TECHNO WATCH: THE GOODS; AN IMPROVED NEWTON HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOU 
</P>

<P>
 For executives on the go, Apple Computer has introduced a more versatile 
version of its Newton technology, the Newton MessagePad 110. This lightweight 
compact device (1.28 pounds) not only organizes and categorizes information, it 
allows the user to take notes with a telescopic pen, then translates them into 
computer text that can be printed out later. It also has an infra-red beaming 
capacity, so information can be sent to others nearby using the Newton system. 
</P>
<P>
 With an additional External FAX Modem card ($220), MessagePad 110 can send 
faxes, receive E-mail and connect to on-line services. Newton Messaging Card 
($229) allows the device to act like a pager. 
</P>
<P>
 The MessagePad 110 has three times more memory than the original, longer 
battery life and a fast recharge feature. It contains a database for phone 
numbers, special dates and other lists, a dictionary of 13,000 words (names and 
other words can be added) and a "to do" list that will automatically transfer 
items not finished on a given day to the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 40 software titles that can be used with the MessagePad 110. 
The newest are Zagat Guide to Top U.S. Hotels and Restaurants (in 26 U.S. 
cities) and the Berlitz 5 Language Translator. 
</P>
<P>
 As a special promotion for its upgraded MessagePad 110 (suggested retail 
$599), Apple will include free a Newton Power Organizer Pack that's valued at 
about $250 until Dec. 31. Featured in the pack are the External Fax Modem, 
ExpensePlus to keep track of expenses while traveling, and Notion: the Newton 
List Manager with 100 ready-to-list templates, as well as a travel bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton MessagePad 110 is available at retailers nationwide. For a store in 
your area, call Apple at (800) 365-3690, Ext. 100. An Easy Way for Night Owls 
to Read in Bed 
</P>
<P>
 Like to read in bed? Then Nite-Owl, a high-tech book light, is for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Lumatec Industries of Austin, Tex., NiteOwl is lightweight (2 
ounces) and has a reflector lamp that provides a glare-free white light 
directly on the page. A retractable neck allows the reader to slide the lamp to 
the desired height for reading and the adjustable head can be positioned 
properly for both hardcover and paperback books. 
</P>
<P>
 NiteOwl (suggested retail, $25-$30) is cordless (it takes two AA batteries), 
has an automatic switch (when you move the neck in place to read, it switches 
on) and anti-slip pads so it stays on the book. It can even double as a 
bookmark.  
</P>
<P>
 An A/C adapter kit ($15) is also available if you want to plug Nite-Owl into 
an electrical outlet at home and save the batteries for traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 NiteOwl can be purchased at Sharper Image stores or through its catalogue, 
(800) 344-4444, from Brookstone, (800) 926-7000, or from Lumatec, (800) 
776-7945. Get Those Stains (and Smells) Out 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry's Miracle II is a new liquid stain remover and odor dissolver that 
neutralizes odors on carpet, upholstery or wood floors by using bacteria and 
enzymes to rid the affected area of smells. 
</P>
<P>
 Biodegradable and solvent free, it seems especially effective on pet odors and 
stains on carpet and upholstery, but also removes a variety of stains, 
including crayon, grass, blood, coffee and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 To order, send a check to Sherry's Miracle, 12115 Magnolia Blvd., North 
Hollywood, Calif. 91607. Or, in California, call (800) 774-3779. Sherry's 
Miracle II comes in several sizes: one pint ($10); two ($20); three ($29); four 
($36); five ($45); six ($54). Add $2.50 for shipping and handling.

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; PINING FOR THE PERFECT TREE FOR THE HOLIDAYS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's trim-the-tree time, which brings up the annual debate: Artificial? Live? 
Cut? Potted? There are even a few rental places. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is no matter what type of Christmas tree you choose, these days 
you can find some environmental benefit. "People have more options every year," 
says Stephanie Alpting-Mees at California ReLeaf in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut trees are back on the acceptable list, she says, because 90% of 
California's cities now have tree recycling programs. "We think it's fine as 
long as you consider where it comes from -- grown on a tree farm as a crop, not 
dragged out of a forest where it was part of an ecosystem -- and where it's 
going."  
</P>
<P>
 One warning: trees with flocking or tinsel are nightmares for recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club weighs the pros and cons of tree choice in its new "Green 
Holiday Guide." Artificial trees, which can be quite realistic, are 
non-biodegradable plastic and metal. If you buy one, suggests the Sierra Club, 
make it last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut trees can be recycled into your city's curbside pick-up and mulching 
programs, the group says, but too many still end up in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club warns that if you get a live tree to plant in your yard or 
donate for planting, you should check to be sure the species can be replanted 
and realize it needs more care and attention than a cut tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' TreePeople (which doesn't accept post-Christmas donations of 
trees) suggests the Norfolk Island Pine as a good species for replanting in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 TreePeople is promoting its Tree Dedication Program for gift shoppers, says 
Karen Johnson. "For $15, you can have a tree planted, and the recipient gets a 
beautiful greeting card saying a tree has been planted in their name. Sometimes 
the recipient wants to go with us to plant it." Information: 1-800-753-TREE. 
</P>
<P>
 Potted trees top the shopping list from the California Public Interest 
Research Group, which issued its annual "Buy Green" report in Los Angeles last 
week. The report identifies 10 clean and green alternatives to environmentally 
unsound products that abound during holidays, such as solar-powered toys and 
strings of popcorn and cranberries instead of tinsel and plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We added trees to the list this year because our shoppers found a lot more 
available at nurseries," says CALPIRG's Adam Skolnick.  
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate in eco-efficiency is a tree in a pot that is brought in every 
year, says Samm Coombs of San Francisco, whose Halo Books publishes the 
handbook "The New Green Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can keep it outdoors in a pot, or bury the pot in the garden, or knock 
out the bottom, until the tree gets unwieldy," he says. "You'll need to trim 
the roots, but anyone who would take this much trouble knows how to do that."

 FIVE-DOLLAR BOUNCE? Just about everyone is talking about Orange County's 
sudden financial crisis, even if it's gallows humor. . . . Superior Court Judge 
John M. Watson this week was routinely explaining to jurors the county's 
payment of $5 per day for jury duty. Watson suggested: "I'd cash those checks 
quickly if I were you."

 REMEMBERING HOME: Many members of the local Vietnamese American community will 
be thinking of their homeland Saturday. At their request, Westminster and 
Garden Grove have declared Saturday as "Vietnam Human Rights Day." . . . Nguyen 
Tu Mo, head of a local committee for Vietnamese rights, explained: "While we 
live in peace and prosperity here, we cannot forget the depressing situation in 
Vietnam, where the people are still ruled by communists." . . . The city 
proclamations include a call for the release of political prisoners there.

 WHATTA GUY: Patty Beeler of Fountain Valley thinks so much of her cousin, 
Brian Harris of Stanton, that she sent his name and picture into Teen magazine 
for its "Guy of the Year" contest. Turns out the magazine considered him quite 
a guy. Harris, 14, was one of two runner-ups -- among 10,000 entries -- 
pictured in the December issue. . . . He made news last year -- leading to two 
national TV appearances -- when he started a pen-pal club to promote better 
understanding among the races. His reaction to the Teen recognition: "It was 
like, a neat thing. A lot of the girls noticed it."

 LOCAL LOYALTY: When La Palma officials wondered what were the best trees for a 
street median and sidewalk planting plan, they surveyed 19 neighboring cities 
to see which trees they liked. The winners: crape myrtle, bradford pear and 
brisbane box. La Palma officials chose those three, but added a fourth: palm 
trees. . . . After all, they explain, the city is La Palm a, not La Crape 
Myrtle.

DANA PARSONS: A TALE OF 2 CITIES: NOVEL TREASURERS AVOIDED CHAPTER 9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public officials often don't want to talk to the media, and who can blame 
them? Questions, questions, so many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they almost always return our phone calls, but we usually get the feeling 
we're on their "Things to Do" list, just beneath calling the repair shop for 
the fender estimate or the dentist to schedule that much-delayed root canal. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, I had this funny feeling that Anthony Andrade and Cynthia Pendleton 
would be more than happy to talk this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were. Not only that, but they'd be happy to take calls from every one 
of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 As city treasurers in Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano, respectively, 
Andrade and Pendleton represent the only two cities in Orange County that 
stayed out of the county investment pool that is imploding. Never even got 
their feet wet. Given that the pool's misfortunes have led the county to 
declare bankruptcy, cost Treasurer- 
</P>
<P>
 Tax Collector Robert L. Citron his job and caused consternation among its 185 
participants, Andrade and Pendleton are two of the few financial managers 
around here who don't have to wear paper bags over their heads when they go to 
work in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Andrade and Pendleton see that others didn't? In the midst of what 
must have been some pressure to reap the higher returns that the fund was 
generating over the years, why did they resist? 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said she thinks San Juan Capistrano first considered the Citron pool 
a few years ago, during David Bentz's tenure as treasurer. "We were invited to 
earn higher interests rates (in the pool), and we requested a copy of the 
investment portfolio," Pendleton said. "Neither of us was comfortable with a 
couple different things. The reverse purchase agreements that they used to 
generate those nice returns had maturities that weren't matching, and also the 
county statute that required 30 days to withdraw funds. So, we thought those 
type of investments were riskier than we would want to invest in, and the 30 
days to withdraw funds was kind of cumbersome." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two years ago, Pendleton, who had since become treasurer, reviewed the 
Citron fund again to see if she wanted to commit any of the $15 million that 
the city averages in its investment portfolio. "We looked at it again, got a 
copy of the (Citron) portfolio again, and the same things were true that were 
there two years before. Everything was the same." 
</P>
<P>
 She knew that nearly all of her colleagues throughout the county praised the 
fund and that, about the time she was reviewing it, the local water district 
dived in for the first time. Similarly, some people at City Hall applied mild 
pressure, but Pendleton held firm. Driven in part by the fact the city simply 
didn't have the time to study Citron's complex investment strategy, Pendleton 
concluded that participation "was too risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade, the Garden Grove controller since 1980, said the city doesn't permit 
the kind of speculating inherent to Citron's investment strategy, or as he 
says, "What I would call gambling on interest-rate moves, because no one can 
consistently forecast interest rate moves. As a result of that, it's 
speculation. We try to match our cash flow to our investments, and we do not 
leverage our investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Since other municipal finance managers presumably know the same things he 
does, I asked Andrade, why did so many opt to go with Citron? "I think they 
think they can get a higher yield," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrade said the issue also revolves around "what your training and 
beliefs are." Andrade said his philosophy is that the safety of the principal 
is the paramount concern, especially when investing public funds. "Secondary is 
liquidity, and third is yield." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Andrade nor Pendleton was gloating over their decisions to avoid the 
fund. Pendleton said she breathed a "sigh of relief" that she had stayed out, 
and Andrade said, "We feel bad because of the tragedy. I feel bad for Bob and 
especially for this county. Believe it or not, we're in this county too. It's 
not like we're in Nova Scotia. But I feel good about that fact that we have no 
money in that pool and can show we have yields over all those years that are 
very competitive (with the county's pool)." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when a lot of people are applying hindsight, Pendleton and Andrade 
deserve kudos for their foresight. When their peers were unwilling to resist 
temptation, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 I was prepared to sound the trumpet for him, but Andrade made his actions 
sound so simple: 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," he said, "all we did was do our job." 
</P>

 A Santa Monica judge has taken the rare step of reconsidering the sentence of 
a check forger facing 25 years to life in prison under the state's "three 
strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Leslie W. Light this week reluctantly sentenced Michael 
Leon James, a 30-year-old career criminal, saying that he felt obliged to 
follow the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday the judge announced that he had discovered new information and 
would reconsider the sentence in a court hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to describe the new facts. However, arguments at the hearing may 
center on whether the judge has the authority to rule out a defendant's prior 
convictions when deciding a "three strikes" case, lawyers said. That would 
appear to directly clash with the nature of the law, signed in March by Gov. 
Pete Wilson, which requires a sentence of 25 years to life for any defendant 
who has previously been convicted of two violent or serious felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Light said he believes that he has the authority to not take prior convictions 
into account when imposing a sentence -- even though he followed the "three 
strikes" law in sentencing James on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the bench 27 years and sentenced a lot of people," Light said. 
"I know you usually have to make the call and not stew about it. But sometimes 
you make the call and you find yourself stewing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Light said the sentencing of James was his first "three strikes" sentence "and 
that's why I'm in a state of flux about it."  
</P>
<P>
 In refusing to talk about the new information he had found, the judge said: 
"I'm not running the O.J. Simpson trial here." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said it is rare for a judge to consider changing a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 James' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Charles Cervantes, praised Light's 
decision to reconsider the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would applaud (the judge's) courage for having the strength of character to 
do this because (recalling the sentence) would be a politically unpopular move, 
especially among law and order types," Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori Aiu argued that James' sentence was appropriate 
because of the defendant's lengthy criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that the judge doesn't have the authority" to ignore the 
prior convictions in this case, Aiu said. "We went to trial and the jury 
convicted the defendant knowing what his record was. We were in total agreement 
with the judge's sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 James was arrested at a Culver City supermarket June 23 on suspicion of trying 
to pass a forged check for $94 and carrying a fake driver's license. A jury 
convicted him of the two charges in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, he had been convicted of six felonies dating to 1982, including 
two burglaries, two auto thefts and one count of assaulting a police officer. 
His burglary and assault convictions made him eligible for sentencing under the 
"three strikes" law.

WILSON OKS BAY CLEANUP PLAN, BUT OBSTACLES REMAIN; POLLUTION: DISPUTE AMONG 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND A PROBE HEADED BY SENATE COMMITTEE LEADER TOM HAYDEN 
THREATENS PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite approval Thursday by Gov. Pete Wilson, a long-awaited strategy to 
clean up Santa Monica Bay faces formidable obstacles because of a rift between 
environmentalists and rebukes from state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who 
heads a legislative committee that has begun investigating the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan -- which outlines priorities for spending $67 million on repairing 
one of the Los Angeles area's most popular and beleaguered natural resources -- 
was conceived last spring after five years of consensus building among warring 
factions of business representatives, environmentalists, government regulators 
and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wilson endorsed the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project's action 
plan "without condition," calling it a vital, ambitious and broad approach to 
reduce pollution and restore the ecology of the bay, which stretches along 50 
miles of Los Angeles County coast. The plan awaits approval from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and funding from the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Bay project "reinforces my belief in the effectiveness of 
bringing together industry, government, conservationists and the general public 
to create cost-effective solutions to environmental problems," Wilson said in a 
letter sent Thursday to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the blueprint for bay cleanup has divided local environmentalists. 
Some call it a half-hearted effort that could worsen ocean pollution, while 
others say it is a pragmatic approach given the difficulty of the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, chairman of the Senate's natural resources committee, said he wants 
the plan either strengthened or dumped into "the dustbin of history" after 
hearing the concerns of some environmentalists at a four-hour hearing Thursday 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I remain open to argument, it is my judgment that the plan does not 
live up to expectations," Hayden said. "It fails to adequately address many of 
the most serious sources of bay pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 The senator lambasted the committee that drafted the plan for giving more 
votes to members from industries and state regulators -- whom he blamed for the 
bay's problems -- than to environmental and scientific groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the plan targets urban runoff and wetlands restoration, 
but goes easy on the bay's industrial polluters -- most notably Chevron, Los 
Angeles International Airport and two power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts a Band-Aid on a gaping wound and makes everybody believe that's 
enough. Unfortunately, it probably has poison within the Band-Aid," said Terry 
Tamminen of Santa Monica BayKeeper, a citizens program that monitors threats to 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, members of Heal the Bay and the American Oceans Campaign -- which 
helped draft the plan -- defended the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all (the proposals) were implemented, the bay would be much better off 
than it is now," said Mark Gold, a senior scientist at Heal the Bay. "There are 
a lot of very, very positive recommendations, but there are certainly some 
shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. EPA Western Regional Administrator Felicia Marcus -- a former leader of 
Heal the Bay -- joined Wilson in supporting the plan, saying it has widespread 
support and urging Hayden to endorse it and seek creative sources of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local officials and environmentalists have been struggling for 
almost 20 years to find ways to improve the condition of the bay, where 
swimmers and aquatic life are threatened by a mix of urban runoff and 
industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan contains about 250 suggestions, emphasizing 73 as priorities, 
including $9 million to hire more city and county staff to manage storm water 
runoff, $3.5 million to educate small businesses about pollution prevention, $5 
million to restore the Ballona Wetlands and $1 million to investigate illegal 
sewage connections. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does not offer recommendations about Chevron's oil tankers off El 
Segundo, a proposed oil pipeline, commercial sale of contaminated fish or how 
to handle the millions of pounds of the pesticide DDT that pollute the waters 
off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about $22 million for the plan could come from private donors and 
government grants, there is no known source for another $44.5 million that is 
needed, said Catherine Tyrrell, the project's director and a state water 
quality official. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing was largely a forum for Hayden, a longtime 
environmentalist, to denounce the plan and the state's Los Angeles Regional 
Water Quality Control Board for being "too cozy with the polluters."

MALIBU FIRE SINGES RESIDENTS' NERVES, BUT LITTLE ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No one was evacuated. Property damage was nil. And the most serious injury was 
to a woman whose Ford Explorer hit a battalion chief's Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malibu nonetheless got a sobering dose of deja vu Thursday as brush fires 
danced once again through canyons still scarred by last year's devastating 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 As gusting winds up to 50 m.p.h. sent tumbleweeds flying and knocked over 
metal trash cans, the first big fire of the season hit Latigo Canyon at 1:22 
p.m., officials said. The blaze, which blackened 62 acres of chaparral before 
it was extinguished, caused only four injuries -- all minor -- and no damage to 
the area's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for many in the rich but rugged area, it served as a chilling reminder 
of last year, when brush fires blackened 17,000 acres and destroyed 323 homes. 
Despite the addition this year of a new firefighting weapon -- two Super 
Scooper water-dropping planes leased from a Canadian company -- the flames 
immediately sparked a red alert as residents rushed to water their roofs and 
pack their cars, and television news helicopters went to live reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, an exact repeat," builder Pat Taylor, who was helping 
reconstruct a Las Flores Canyon building destroyed last year, said when his 
girlfriend warned him that the flames had crept to within a mile of his Corral 
Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 "(She) called me on the phone (at the job site)," Taylor said, "and it was 
like, here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu has never been a stranger to brush fires; some residents, in fact, were 
expecting this one. Humidity had hovered around 10% all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Adamson, whose family owns the Malibu Beach RV Park, said many of the 
families in his compound had hooked up their trailers early in the day and were 
ready to pull out at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through a lot of these over the years and we know how to prepare 
for them," he said, "but you never can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Inspector Gary Sutter said firefighters were summoned initially to 
a small blaze at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. Within 15 
minutes, the flames had covered 30 acres, he said, and the conflagration 
steadily grew as the high winds kept the Super Scoopers from flying low enough 
to accurately aim their water drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter said that although more than 50 homes are scattered throughout the 
area, no houses were damaged as the flames hopped from spot to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, smoke from the fire forced the closure for most of the afternoon of 
several local thoroughfares, including a section of the Pacific Coast Highway 
between Kanan and Malibu roads. And there were four injuries reported -- one 
from smoke inhalation, two more to firefighters and the fourth from a traffic 
accident that resulted from the massive traffic jams created by roadblocks in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said Sara Burdell, 69, of Malibu was taken to St. John's 
Hospital for treatment of minor injuries after she tried to make a U-turn to 
cut out of a traffic jam at the Pacific Coast Highway roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 As she swerved, officials said, she pulled into the path of an oncoming GMC 
Suburban truck driven by Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Dan Scott. 
Scott, who was uninjured, was heading down PCH in the center divider when the 
crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an unidentified 53-year-old transient was treated for smoke 
inhalation. Officials said a backfire set to halt the fire's advance ignited 
some magazines and books that the man had stored in trash cans near his 
encampment at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the burning papers blew across the highway, setting fire at one 
point to palm trees in front of luxury oceanfront condominiums at Tivoli Cove. 
That hot spot, however, was quickly contained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was an especially difficult one for the more than 300 firefighters 
dispatched to the scene, as the winds hampered the aerial assault from seven 
water-dropping helicopters and the two Super Scoopers. Access to fire lines was 
also impeded by the rough terrain, Sutter said. Two firefighters suffered minor 
injuries -- one from a cactus, the other to his eye. Sutter said winds died 
down late in the afternoon, and by 5 p.m. the fire was mostly contained. 
Officials expected the flames to be extinguished by dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said that the cause of the fire was under investigation, but 
that they were focusing at least initially on a downed power line. Vegetation 
was also a factor, Sutter said, noting that the fire Thursday "was in an area 
that didn't burn last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the dry Santa Ana 
winds were expected to continue into the weekend. Wind advisories were also 
posted Thursday on several transmountain and desert highways, including 
Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass and in San Diego County and U.S. 395 in San 
Bernardino and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisories cautioned against travel in high-profile vehicles such as 
campers and trailers, and motorists were warned that windblown clouds of dust 
and sand were reducing visibility to a few yards in some desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the Santa Ana condition was being generated by the circulation 
around a large high-pressure weather system centered over southern Idaho. He 
said the sporadic, gusting winds will keep pummeling Southern California until 
the system finally begins moving out to the east, probably Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair to partly cloudy weather is expected here Sunday and Monday, with mostly 
sunny weather Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 71 degrees, 
following an overnight low of 48. Times staff writers Eric Malnic, Alan 
Abrahamson and Shawn Hubler, and correspondent Kathleen Kelleher contributed to 
this story.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: ON THIS ONE, JURORS' RIGHTS OVERRIDE THOSE OF THE 
PRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the issue of jurors' rights come up, my first instinct is to sympathize 
with the jurors even if it goes against the interests of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday when Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito and the lawyers discussed allegations of unspecified 
juror misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions were private despite the objections of Kelli Sager, attorney 
for The Times and other media outlets. Sager asked that transcripts be released 
of a discussion of alleged jury misconduct that took place in Ito's chambers 
Wednesday afternoon. She also asked that a hearing Thursday be held in open 
court -- with the media present -- because of the importance of the issue being 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito disagreed. He said he was more concerned about the jurors' welfare, 
fearing that they would be subjected to "a public crucifixion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he was balancing "the jurors' right to privacy" with the "court's 
need to investigate misconduct." Obviously, he felt he could conduct a more 
effective investigation behind closed doors. So he held the Thursday afternoon 
session in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury misconduct allegations have raised a difficult and complex question: 
What is a juror's right to privacy? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the issue has come up. Concern was expressed in an 
extreme form recently by two Los Angeles County Municipal Court judges who 
ordered that jurors remain anonymous in minor cases, a move overturned by an 
appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the issue becomes part of the Simpson case, where jurors are 
anonymous, it becomes a big story and highlights one of the most interesting 
new currents in the justice system -- the jurors' rights movement. The 
advocates demand better pay and working conditions for jurors and more respect 
from judges and attorneys. Recently, jury reform in the huge Los Angeles County 
court system was advocated by the county commission on efficiency and economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the current misconduct furor aren't known, except that one juror 
wrote a letter to the judge about another juror. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro apparently doesn't think it's serious. He 
objected, he told Judge Ito, "to the term juror misconduct. " He said he's seen 
no evidence that "there has been tampering or anything close to misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said the allegations, if true, mean "we 
have a problem of jury misconduct." And the term misconduct was used by court 
officials Wednesday when they announced the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If Shapiro is correct, and this is a furor over nothing, it's easy to see the 
danger of a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you're a juror. One of your colleagues takes a dislike to you and, in 
a letter to the judge, accuses you of gossiping about the case, or taking a 
forbidden drive to the Simpson mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge must look into it. It's usually done quietly, outside public view. 
That permits a quiet dismissal of a juror, without public disgrace, if the 
allegations are true. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a public hearing would, as Ito said, expose the suspected 
juror to heavy cross-examination by both sides, plus public dismissal if the 
charges were found true. Granted, the jurors in this case are anonymous and 
they can't be photographed. But their occupations and neighborhoods are known, 
and certainly their friends, neighbors and co-workers would be able to figure 
out what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 A convicted shoplifter or burglar would get much less attention than a 
publicly dismissed Simpson juror. That's what Judge Ito meant when he mentioned 
a "public crucifixion." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, I called media attorney Sager for a longer discussion of 
the press' side. 
</P>
<P>
 Sager said she understood Ito's concern for the jurors' welfare. But she said 
these matters are so serious that they should be aired in public. 
</P>
<P>
 If there has been misconduct, Sager said, then the public should know how the 
process has been tainted. And if nothing happened, "there will be a suspicion 
that the jurors have been tainted until there is an open investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ito noted Thursday morning, there are few judicial decisions on this 
important issue and the existing cases are not, in his mind, conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sager cited one case that made an important point. An appellate court 
decided in favor of open hearings on misconduct on the grounds that it's easier 
for people to lie in private. A public lie, the court said, may be detected by 
a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reporters didn't like Ito coming down on the side of privacy. They 
felt it is an example of his hostility toward the press. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I listened to the proceedings, and watched the jurors, I thought the 
judge was ahead of the curve on this one, reflecting a growing feeling in the 
courts that the jurors have been the forgotten element in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 We reporters are entitled to get the story. But jurors have rights, too, 
including the right to be spared humiliation after they signed on for a 
difficult and unpleasant civic duty.

MALIBU BLAZE TESTS NERVES, FIREFIGHTING PLANES; BATTLE: SUPER SCOOPERS RUN INTO 
TROUBLE, AS STRONG WINDS FORCE THEM TO AVOID LOW-FLYING WATER DROPS. BUT 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE PLEASED WITH THE AIRCRAFT'S PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The much-heralded Super Scooper firefighting planes ran into trouble trying to 
battle the Malibu blaze Thursday, their first major test against the classic 
Southern California fire conditions of strong winds hurling flames over 
forbidding mountain slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fire officials said they were pleased with the planes' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 35 to 50 m.p.h. winds affected the dropping capabilities," said Los 
Angeles County Fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela. Because the winds and terrain made 
it difficult to fly close to the fire-ravaged slopes, the pilots "had to drop 
from a higher altitude, which ended up causing the water to turn into a finer 
mist before hitting the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenzuela maintained that the two planes were nonetheless effective at 
helping to contain the fire by dropping water during the blaze's crucial early 
moments and working with the department's seven water-dropping helicopters, 
which were able to fly lower and score more direct hits. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman added that the Super Scoopers were more 
effective than they might have appeared. From the ground, along Pacific Coast 
Highway, he watched one of the planes make a drop -- and, at first, was 
startled to see the water appear to evaporate in the gusty winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as it dropped alongside and across PCH," Freeman said, "it was like being 
in a downpour of rain, which tells you that although the water dropped may 
appear to dissipate, it still has a significant cooling and wetting effect on 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 He added later: "I can tell you I'm pleased."  
</P>
<P>
 In ideal conditions, the planes can drop water from 150 feet above the fire. 
But owing to Latigo Canyon's steep terrain, the planes were often forced to fly 
150 feet above ridge crests -- while the fire burned 200 feet or more down the 
hill. That meant, Freeman said, that the water had to fall 350 to 400 feet 
before reaching the target. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran firefighter on the scene, who asked that his name not be used, was 
unconvinced of the planes' capabilities. The Super Scooper, he said, obviously 
has to fly high enough to clear the crest of the mountains; on a windy day like 
Thursday, from that altitude, that means the water can blow a quarter-mile to 
half-mile away from the target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some hellacious winds, but that's what you've got with brush fires. 
It's usually very windy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighter pointed to a helicopter as it dropped its load and created a 
giant puff of smoke as flames were extinguished. "You watch this helicopter, he 
can maneuver up, down and through this canyon -- there, just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Thursday night how many runs each of the Super Scoopers had 
made, but Freeman said there were at least 12 drops -- each one about four 
times the size of a helicopter load. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Super Scooper pilots were able to use the ocean for water 
pickups, Freeman said, the high winds forced them to make a slight detour two 
miles up the coast to the shelter of Paradise Cove; on a calm day, the planes 
could have scooped water within sight of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department acquired the two Canadian-made amphibious aircraft 
in October on a three-month lease from the Quebec government.  
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual partnership, the county shared the cost for leasing one of the 
planes -- $719,000, including two crews and mechanics -- with the California 
insurance industry and the federal government. The other plane is being donated 
for three months by Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, parent company of Canadair, 
which manufactures the planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plane costs $515 an hour to fly; buying a plane outright would cost $16.5 
million. The two are based at Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The high costs are among the reasons that opponents blocked extensive testing 
of the planes here more than a decade ago. They had also argued that the planes 
cannot fly at night, have trouble in gusty winds and cannot refill from a 
choppy ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But last fall's two dozen wildfires and their $1-billion price tag spurred the 
county to become the first California jurisdiction to acquire the planes. Gov. 
Pete Wilson signed a bill in September to allow the arrangement, reversing his 
decision two years ago to veto a similar program. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes carry two tanks capable of holding 1,410 gallons of water -- which 
they can scoop up in 10- to 12-second nonstop runs, skimming the surface of a 
body of water -- and 129 gallons of soapy fire-retardant foam. 
</P>
<P>
 To be usable, a body of water must be at least 4,000 feet long, 300 feet wide 
and six feet deep, giving the county Fire Department 15 "scoopable" local water 
sources, including the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, after the fire was declared contained, newly sworn county 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky met with Freeman and other fire officials in the 
garage at Los Angeles County Fire Station 71 at Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This county would, in the long run, be well-served by having one of its own 
Super Scoopers," said Yaroslavsky, sporting a yellow Los Angeles City Fire 
Department slicker. "If we could find a way to finance it, it would be very 
useful. I thought it was very, very effective in tandem with the helicopters." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Super Scooper Performance 
</P>
<P>
 The county's newly leased Super Scoopers, two amphibious planes used in 
firefighting, were among the first pieces of equipment to respond to Thursday's 
blaze. Although the carry four times as much water as the county's firefighting 
helicopters, their effectiveness was up for debate. High winds hampered their 
ability to make direct hits. Because the Super Scoopers can't fly as low as 
helicopters, the wind affects their drops more.

 The Super Scoopers need not land to replanish their water supply. Ten seconds 
of contact with the surface of a nearby lake, reservoir or in this case, the 
ocean is all that is needed between drops. The plan's ability to fly in narrow 
canyons makes it ideal for battling fires in Southern California.

 Through a unique partnership between the county and insurance companies, the 
Canadian-made aircraft have been leased from the Quebec government for a 
three-month trial.

 The plane scooped from the Pacific Ocean while battling the Latigo Canyon

KIDNAP TRIAL FOCUSES ON 'WILLING COMPANION' THEME; COURTS: UNDER AGGRESSIVE 
QUESTIONING, PAULA HARRINGTON ACKNOWLEDGES SHE JOKED WITH TIMOTHY SHUE AND 
REFERRED TO SEX WITH HIM AS 'MAKING LOVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to show that an alleged kidnaping victim went willingly, a lawyer 
forced her to acknowledge on the witness stand Thursday that she joked and 
bickered with her accused captor while they were together and later referred to 
sex with him as "making love." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Public Defender Ellen Barry also sought to undermine initial 
statements to police by Paula D. Harrington of the Santa Clarita Valley in 
describing the time she was with Timothy Daniel Shue, who is being tried on 
charges of kidnaping her. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry questioned Harrington's use of the word "erotic" and other nonviolent 
terms when she first told police that she had sex with Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you described the sex acts to officers as 'making love'?" Barry asked 
Harrington in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have," Harrington replied quietly. "I've learned some new words since 
then. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you saying, Mrs. Harrington, that you didn't know the word 'rape'?" Barry 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington replied that she did, but was in a state of shock at the time of 
the initial police interviews and "hadn't processed" what had happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry also drew from her an admission that in describing to police how Shue 
forced her to model fishnet stockings for him and other sexual acts, that she 
described the experience as "erotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, under redirect questioning by Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang, 
Harrington said she used the words "making love" for having sex with Shue 
because that was how she related to sex with her husband and the term was 
familiar to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, a 27-year-old former real estate agent, says Shue abducted her at 
gunpoint on June 29 while she was showing him homes in Val Verde. She was found 
July 1, bound and gagged but otherwise unharmed in a Gila Bend, Ariz., hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, a 38-year-old Michigan native and convicted armed robber, was arrested 
July 6 at a Utah bar. He could be sentenced to life in prison without parole if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense has been that Harrington, unhappy in her marriage, was a "willing 
companion" on a trip across Southern California until she learned he was on 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Thursday's testimony was highly intimate and graphic, just as it was 
earlier in the week when a tearful Harrington told jurors that Shue had kept 
tight control of her every move, repeatedly threatened her with his handgun and 
raped her during a terrifying trip to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During cross-examination Thursday, as Barry repeatedly challenged Harrington's 
credibility, Harrington seemed resigned to her public exposure. Grilling her 
over her failure to even try to escape, Barry asked Harrington: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you were really afraid of was the damage to your reputation, 
no?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Harrington answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you were afraid of was divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 "Never." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you were afraid of was being publicly humiliated," Barry 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Harrington replied, "I'm being publicly humiliated now, but I'll live 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Living through the experience was the only motive for her actions while she 
was with Shue, Harrington testified later, and if she joked with him during 
lighter moments, it was because "when I was playful with him, he was calmer and 
nicer to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harrington maintained "I was a victim of a crime" and repeatedly 
denied running off with Shue, she acknowledged under Barry's aggressive 
questioning that he bought her a hamburger dinner while they were viewing 
property together, and that he allowed her to choose any music tape she wanted 
to hear in his Jeep after she complained about his endless playing of songs by 
Anita Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was driving me nuts," she responded in court. 
</P>
<P>
 She also admitted to boldly criticizing Shue's driving, calling him "stupid" 
when he got lost looking for a camping goods store, and to arguing with him 
over a pizza he ordered but she didn't feel like eating. At one point, 
Harrington acknowledged, she refused his demand for her bank card access code, 
prompting him to quip: "I'm the man with the gun, lady, remember?"  
</P>
<P>
 "You weren't really afraid of him, were you?" Barry asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've testified a number of times how afraid I was of him," Harrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry also challenged Harrington's demeanor during interviews with detectives, 
suggesting that she was inappropriately calm, repeatedly laughed and even 
jokingly demeaned her husband's sexual prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington countered, "It was an embarrassed, uncomfortable kind of laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution rested its case Thursday and so did the defense, without 
calling any witnesses.

STATE MAY CONDEMN SOKA LAND, JUDGE RULES; CONSERVANCY: VICTORY PUTS PARKS 
AGENCY'S FOCUS ON COST OF ACQUIRING CAMPUS ACREAGE. COLLEGE SAYS IT WILL 
APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a critical victory for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a judge on 
Thursday ruled that the agency may condemn Soka University's scenic Calabasas 
campus for public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barnet M. Cooperman's ruling changes the focus in the fight for the 
campus from whether the conservancy may condemn to how much it must pay -- a 
price ultimately determined by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it," said conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle. Parks officials have 
long coveted the land as a showpiece acquisition that would serve as a visitors 
center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as conservancy lawyers savored victory outside the courtroom, Soka 
spokesman Jeff Ourvan vowed that the university would appeal the ruling and 
characterized the conservancy as a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling ironically kills the conservancy's effectiveness," he said, 
explaining that it "forces them to begin selling off existing parkland to start 
saving for the Soka acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the toughest part of the conservancy's fight may lie ahead. Although 
conservancy officials have set aside more than $19 million to buy Soka out, the 
jury may award the school many millions more, perhaps pricing it beyond the 
agency's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the conservancy board will meet to discuss which of its park 
holdings could be sold off to raise cash. Already, Executive Director Joseph T. 
Edmiston has told the board that all new acquisitions -- such as the Canyon 
Oaks project in Topanga Canyon -- must be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy -- a state agency that acquires parkland -- is trying to take 
over 245 of Soka's 662 acres at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland 
Highway for use as a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, on the other hand, wants to expand its 200-student language school into 
a liberal arts college enrolling 3,500 students at the site, which includes the 
former ranch of razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 The school rejected an offer to buy the property in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a considerable step forward for the conservancy, Thursday's decision 
by no means assures the university will pass into public hands. Soka attorneys 
have said that if the jury values Soka's property at more than the conservancy 
can pay -- roughly $20 million -- then the school will sue the agency for 
dealing in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conservancy can afford the ultimate price of the property, Soka 
lawyers have threatened to sue to force the agency to purchase the remaining 
417 acres on the argument that it would then become unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is unlikely that the final outcome of the battle will be decided 
by the trial courts. Both sides acknowledged that the state Court of Appeal and 
the California Supreme Court -- possibly even the U.S. Supreme Court -- will be 
the final arbiters of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the conservancy and Soka had hoped to avoid the costly legal fight 
that lies ahead -- a fight that will cost the public millions of dollars 
regardless of which side wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative settlement agreement between the two, Soka would have sold 
to the conservancy much of the land it is seeking to condemn through eminent 
domain -- including the historic Gillette mansion and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, in turn, would have built a scaled-down campus of 2,500 students on the 
eastern part of the property. The deal would have taken effect only after the 
school's plans were approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with intense criticism from a coalition of homeowners, 
environmentalists and elected officials, the conservancy board rejected the 
settlement offer and vowed to press ahead with the case.

AREA FIRMS HOPE TO BENEFIT AS MCKEON WINS KEY POST; AEROSPACE: SANTA CLARITA 
CONGRESSMAN VOWS TO LOBBY FOR NEW PRODUCTION OF B-2 STEALTH BOMBER AFTER 
GAINING SEAT ON HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that could bolster the fortunes of the San Fernando Valley's ailing 
aerospace industry, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon won a seat Thursday on the 
powerful House National Security Committee and vowed to push for renewed 
production of the B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 The sought-after committee post will give the Santa Clarita Republican a say 
in a host of defense-related issues essential for Southern California, from the 
funding of weapons systems to the staffing of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's 25th Congressional district -- which stretches east from Chatsworth 
and covers Santa Clarita and part of the Antelope Valley -- includes Air Force 
Plant 42 in Palmdale and numerous aerospace contractors and subcontractors. 
Many of his constituents are employees at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the aerospace companies in our district, this is very important," 
said Bob Cochran, McKeon's chief of staff. "We are now going to be in the 
middle of discussions on the defense budget. All of Southern California has 
been hit hard by defense cutbacks, and now Buck can have a voice. He believes 
our military readiness has been handicapped." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, McKeon has worked with the incoming committee chairman, Rep. 
Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), to keep the subcontractor industrial base for the B-2 
intact. He plans to push during the 104th Congress for production of additional 
aircraft and has invited Spence and the entire committee to visit the Palmdale 
base next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This committee appointment is important for the defense of our country, but 
it's also important for our jobs," McKeon said in an interview. "I want to 
fight to get more B-2s." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Santa Clarita mayor will be one of 27 Republicans on the panel, 
which until recently was known as the Armed Services Committee. There will be 
23 Democratic committee members, including Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), 
who had been chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he went to Congress in 1992, McKeon, who co-owns a chain of 
Western clothing stores, has worked aggressively to win a slot on the defense 
panel. Instead, he was appointed to the Public Works and Transportation 
Committee, a post he will give up when the House convenes next month. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's first-year efforts did win him the freshman class presidency, which 
allowed him to carve out a niche among his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Republicans seized control of the House last month, expanding the 
number of GOP slots on all committees, McKeon poured on the pressure again with 
dozens of telephone calls to lawmakers. A key development came when 
California's Republican delegation endorsed McKeon for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working for two years to build relationships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything, however, has gone according to plan for McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 He endorsed Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) for Speaker and Rep. Richard Armey 
(R-Texas) for majority leader, but his luck ran out there. The House 
Republicans' No. 3 spot went to Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), and not Rep. Bob 
Walker (R-Penn.), whom McKeon had backed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still up in the air is whether McKeon will win a subcommittee chairmanship on 
the Education and Labor Committee.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; MAN PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY TO PAINTING GRAFFITI AT 200 SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An accused tagger pleaded not guilty Thursday to a rare felony vandalism 
charge filed against an adult for allegedly scrawling graffiti on 200 North 
Hollywood sites over a six-month period, according to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Anthony Rodriguez, 20, of North Hollywood, is accused of spraying or 
marking his moniker, James 129, on scores of walls, street signs, curbs, street 
lights and billboards between May 3 and Nov. 29, causing more than $12,000 in 
damage, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Mitchel Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's case is probably the first where prosecutors reached the felony 
level in an adult case by adding up the cost of erasing the hundreds of tags, 
said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ENCINO; WOMAN HELD FOR 
ALLEGEDLY STALKING BOBBY SHERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been more than 20 years since Bobby Sherman made the girls squeal to 
his "bubble gum rock."But one fan, it seems, has not let go, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Richards, 39, was in jail Thursday after Los Angeles police arrested her 
on suspicion of stalking Sherman. The woman -- who took a bus from her home in 
Manchester, Me. -- was taken into custody outside the gates of Sherman's Encino 
home late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards had been sending Sherman letters for a month, said Detective Jeff 
Dunn of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman is best remembered as the boyish performer who shot to stardom after 
appearing on the "Shindig" and "Here Come the Brides" series.

 Volunteers needed: HUNTINGTON BEACH Drivers Wanted to Transport Seniors 
Volunteer drivers are needed for a program that provides transportation to 
seniors. Since the elimination of OCTA's Dial-A-Ride program, senior citizens 
have been left to other means to get around town. There is an urgent need for 
volunteers who can drive seniors to medical appointments and do their shopping 
and banking. Volunteers will drive city vans that carry seven to nine 
passengers. Drivers are needed weekdays between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
Qualifications are a willingness to help seniors and a valid California 
driver's license. For details, call Arleen Stevens at (714) 960-2478 or stop by 
the Outreach Center, 1718 Orange Ave.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES AIRPORT; 
LAX IS LISTED AMONG 5 HEALTHIEST U.S. AIRPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles International Airport is listed in a study of airport smoking 
policies as one of the nation's five healthiest commercial airfields for 
travelers, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four airports are Minneapolis/St. Paul, Dallas/Ft.Worth, Miami and 
Seattle-Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport where travelers are most likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke is 
Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport, according to the survey of the 
nation's 25 busiest airports.  
</P>
<P>
 It was conducted by the Coalition on Smoking or Health, an organization made 
up of the American Lung Assn., American Heart Assn. and the American Cancer 
Society.  
</P>

 "Thousands of California travelers can breathe easier this year," said Dr. 
Spencer Koerner, chairman of the American Lung Assn. of California. "Not only 
will they find that nearly all domestic flights are smoke-free, but most 
airports are now smoke-free as well."  
</P>
<P>
 In a separate study, the American Lung Assn. of California found that all the 
major metropolitan airports in the state are smoke-free. Those airports are in 
San Diego, Orange County, Burbank, San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno, 
Ontario and Monterey.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HAHN URGES 
CITY NOT TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS TO FIGHT PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles City Council decides to join the court battles to overturn 
Proposition 187, it should seek free services from private attorneys rather 
than spend public funds to fight the measure, City Atty. James K. Hahn 
recommended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's recommendation came in a two-page letter to council members as they 
prepared to debate again today on what to do about the measure that calls for 
illegal immigrants to be barred from most public services. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 9, the day after voters overwhelmingly approved the measure, Hahn, at 
the council's request, filed court papers to join a federal lawsuit seeking to 
toss out the new law, a move he said was necessary to clarify the city's 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, as council members continued their heated debate over whether 
it was appropriate to fight the measure, they voted to soften the city's stance 
and asked Hahn to lay out options and the measure's potential impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer has scheduled a Monday 
hearing on the city's intervention request, Hahn told the council he needs 
further direction today. 
</P>
<P>
 As alternatives, the city could bring its own lawsuit or seek to make its 
views known through filing a "friend of the court" brief without joining the 
lawsuit, Hahn said. In any event, Hahn added, "my recommendation would be to 
avoid the use of public funds in any such endeavor by seeking pro bono 
assistance from the private legal community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other options for the council include seeking a state attorney general's 
opinion, although Hahn said that would not clear up questions about how a 
conflict between state and federal laws would affect the flow of federal funds 
to California. The city also could seek written guidance from the federal 
government or take a wait-and-see stance in the expectation that the court will 
continue to bar enforcement of Proposition 187 until the legal issues are 
sorted out, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn spokesman Ted Goldstein said the office would not discuss the letter 
until the council takes up the matter. JEAN MERL

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DUMMIES HELP TEACH A LESSON: TRAFFIC SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scene Thursday on Agoura Road in Agoura Hills was staged for people 
training to become law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a side benefit of the demonstration on what happens in collisions between 
motor vehicles and bicycles was that it also helped make students from area 
schools, who watched from a safe distance, aware of the dangers posed by 
traffic, said Joe Grasso, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 During one portion of the demonstration -- conducted by Texas A&M University 
-- a dummy weighing about 150 pounds was arranged to simulate a pedestrian 
crossing the street, he said. In that test, the car hit the dummy at about 40 
m.p.h. and knocked it about 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is done to help us realize that as human beings, we are very easily 
injured and killed by vehicles that have no soul," Grasso said. "We cannot beat 
machinery." 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the lesson, a dummy was placed on a bicycle that was then 
struck by a car, so that the officers in training could analyze what takes 
place in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were from various agencies, including the Los Angeles Police 
Department, California Highway Patrol and the Sheriff's Department, Grasso 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The class is designed to teach a type of police science that uses 
sophisticated techniques to reconstruct accidents. For example, Grasso said, 
officers are taught how to determine a vehicle's speed by measuring tire marks 
on pavement and from dents in vehicles. They also learn other techniques, such 
as how to inspect brake pads to determine when the driver hit the brakes, he 
said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; APARTMENTS OPEN FOR POOR, MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's first affordable apartment house for the mentally 
disabled and indigent opens today on a hilltop in Pacoima, giving 50 formerly 
homeless residents a permanent home -- and access to health and social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillview Village, a 50-unit, $5.6-million facility on 2.4 acres at 12408 Van 
Nuys Blvd., cost more than originally projected, but its managers say the price 
is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was funded through a combination of public and private loans. The 
city of Los Angeles contributed more than $3 million to the nonprofit Valley 
Housing Foundation, one of two partners in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials grumbled about additional costs incurred in the 
construction of the two-story building. But in October, the City Council voted 
to waive $409,000 in interest on one of two city loans for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of housing is absolutely essential if people with mental 
disabilities are going to learn how to function in society," said Dr. Eva 
McCraven, assistant director of Hillview Mental Health Center in Lake View 
Terrace, the other partner in the project.  
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is that this is permanent. Other housing for homeless mentally 
ill people has been available, but it's either been transitional in nature or 
tied closely to treatment services." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Hillview center will offer services to homeless people who are 
disabled but capable of independent living, including counseling, medication 
and other assistance. But tenants will not be forced into treatment programs, 
McCraven stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typical housing arrangements for this population just promote 
institutionalization and dependency," McCraven said. "They reinforce that the 
clients must have supervision, must have roommates, can have no choice about 
where they can go or when. It keeps people in the mode of mental illness. This 
apartment house is the beginning of something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments are small -- ranging from 280 square feet for a single with a 
bathroom and access to a community kitchen, to 550 square feet for a 
one-bedroom unit with its own kitchen. The rents will be low, ranging from 
about $266 to $350 per month.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no other permanent housing facilities for the homeless and mentally 
disabled in the Valley, and only three other facilities in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 But more may be on the way, according to health officials, who cite studies 
showing that permanent housing reduces patients' dependence on treatment in the 
long run. TIM MAY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LIBRARY 
RESTORATION WINS NATIONAL DESIGN AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The restoration and expansion of the Los Angeles Central Library has been 
given a national award for urban design from the American Institute of 
Architects, the organization announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, rebuilt after devastating fires, won special praise for the new 
Maguire Gardens park at its main entrance, where a parking lot used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The citation was shared by the library, architects Hardy, Holzman Pfeiffer 
Associates of Los Angeles, park designer Lawrence Halprin of San Francisco, and 
the KDG firm of Los Angeles, which served as associate architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Another national award from the institute went to architect Franklin Israel 
for his restoration of a Hollywood warehouse into a post-production studio for 
the Limelight Production house. Also on Thursday, the Los Angeles chapter of 
the institute gave its top annual honor to developer Ira Yellin, who is 
restoring the Grand Central Market and Million Dollar Theatre Building 
Downtown.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAL VERDE; HAD NO 
CHANCE TO FLEE ABDUCTOR, WOMAN TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Val Verde real estate agent, who said she was kidnaped June 29 while showing 
a house to a Michigan man, testified Thursday that she had no chance to flee 
while she and the defendant shopped for camping gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington, 27, said that most of the time she was with accused abductor 
Timothy Shue, her legs were tied with an elastic bandage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that while shopping at a Sears and a sporting goods store near the 
California-Arizona border, she was untied, but had to carry the gear they 
bought.  
</P>
<P>
 Shue's lawyer asked Harrington why she did not run or knock over a display to 
attract attention in either store, where customers and clerks could have aided 
her.  
</P>
<P>
 Shue, a convicted robber who authorities say is a serial rapist, is accused of 
kidnaping her at gunpoint from a vacant house in Val Verde. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, a motel maid in Gila Bend, Ariz., found Harrington tied in 
bedsheets. Shue, 38, was arrested that day in Ogden, Utah.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; COUPLE'S DEATHS APPARENTLY NATURAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Thursday said they believe an elderly couple, whose decaying corpses 
were found in their Panorama City home by investigators, died of natural 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Margaret Jacobson, 80, and her husband, Virgil, 79, were 
discovered when officers entered their Ranchito Avenue home after neighbors 
called police, saying they had not seen the couple in months. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were found on the floor in separate bedrooms, said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Stephen Fisk, who estimated that the Jacobsons had been dead 
for two or three weeks. He said Virgil Jacobson was blind and had diabetes, and 
may have been unable to get help. The house has no telephone and there were no 
signs of a break-in, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are awaiting an autopsy to determine how the couple died. NICHOLAS

of Pacoima's annual Christmas parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who had represented Los Angeles' 5th Council District, won his

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SYLMAR; COLLEGE HEAD TO LEAVE FOR FUND-RAISING POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles Community College District Chancellor Neil Yoneji made it official 
Thursday. Jack Fujimoto, president of Mission College since 1989, will be 
transferred Downtown to lead the district's hunt for elusive sources of grant 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-campus college district, the largest two-year college district in the 
country, was hit hard this year by state budget cutbacks and declining 
enrollment. Yoneji tapped Fujimoto for the fund-raising assignment, billed as a 
one-year position, because the 65-year-old administrator has a reputation for 
developing hard-to-find grants and retains strong ties to education officials 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto's replacement is William E. Norlund, vice president of academic 
affairs at Pierce College in Woodland Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto, Yoneji and Norlund were in meetings Thursday and did not return 
several phone messages. It is unclear exactly when Fujimoto will begin his new 
assignment, though officials said it is likely to happen sometime before the 
beginning of the new semester Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Norlund and Fujimoto hold doctorates in education and have backgrounds in 
science; Norlund teaches physics, while Fujimoto is trained in mathematics. 
Fujimoto also has a business degree from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Norlund's appointment as interim president was made with the consent of the 
Mission College faculty, who reviewed candidates for the job.  
</P>
<P>
 The news of Fujimoto's departure, however temporary, prompted different 
reactions among community and faculty members.  
</P>
<P>
 Some said they doubted his absence would affect the daily operation of the 
college, while others felt his departure would have a negative impact on 
long-term projects Fujimoto was supervising. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto presided over the transition and expansion of the college -- the 
youngest and smallest in the district -- from a collection of storefront 
buildings in and around San Fernando to its present location on a 22.5-acre 
campus in Sylmar. A 40-acre expansion is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto, who has ties ranging from major corporations to tiny community 
groups, obtained vital financing for construction of a much-touted $11-million 
library and learning resource center, a facility that educators said is likely 
to be a hallmark of Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 His success in bringing the library project to fruition is attributed to an 
ability to find funding sources even during financially lean periods.  
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders said Fujimoto's absence will be felt.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had the ability to weld different minority groups together," said Ed 
Kussman, a member of the college's advisory committee. "His leaving isn't a 
disaster, but he started a lot of good things. He's an ideas man." 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman said Fujimoto conceived a plan to train unemployed people to make 
school uniforms for elementary schools, some of which now require students to 
wear the uniforms. TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; REQUIRED SIGNATURES FOR RECALL SUBMITTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group trying to recall the entire Agoura Hills City Council has turned in 
the required number of signatures to set the recall process in motion, City 
Clerk Pat Manning said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which received the group's signed petitions at about noon Wednesday, 
immediately began counting the signatures to make sure there were at least 
2,045, the minimum number needed. Thursday afternoon, after the counting was 
done, Manning announced that the recall group had reached the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The petitions contain about 3,400 signatures, according to the recall group's 
leader, Barbara Murphy. She said she believes that as many as 90% will be shown 
to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 After the count at City Hall, the signatures were taken to the County 
Clerk/Registrar Recorder's office to be checked for validity, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy carried the petitions to the county 
office, Murphy said. The count is expected to be finished in about five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders, who say they fear that city officials will tamper with the 
petitions, kept a vigil at City Hall after they turned in the petitions.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the counting began, Murphy began complaining that city officials 
were discounting some names. Manning, who has never handled a recall, said 
Thursday she authorized the removal of names that were not printed as well as 
signed, believing that was how the county wanted it done. County officials have 
since informed her, Manning said, that no signatures are to be discounted. The 
discounted signatures will be included in the final count, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's group, which calls itself Citizens Against New Local Taxes, launched 
the recall drive last summer after the council unanimously approved a 4% tax on 
electricity, gas and telephone service to help close what the city says is a 
$1-million deficit. The recall group says the actual deficit is far less and 
that the city could have balanced the budget without the tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members say they had no choice and insist they have been frugal in 
spending taxpayers' money. They charge that the recall effort is funded by 
outside interests and managed by a paid professional consultant. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN DROPS BAN ON 3 ADULT MAGAZINES 
</P>

<P>
 In a victory for campus free-speech advocates, three adult magazines, 
including Playboy, will soon be back on racks at the Cal State Northridge 
bookstore, officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a college campus, we have a little different obligation than the corner 
store would have. The First Amendment comes into play," said Don Queen, head of 
the entity that runs the retail outlets on campus. But he added, "I didn't even 
think about the First Amendment originally." 
</P>
<P>
 A former store manager discontinued carrying Playboy, Playgirl and Penthouse 
last spring, Queen said, citing problems with theft and customers who left them 
strewn throughout the store. Queen said he was aware of the decision to drop 
the magazines last spring and considered it a routine business matter. He 
changed his mind after censorship concerns were raised last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is really wonderful. Nobody wanted to go through a great big 
hassle all over again," said CSUN librarian Virginia Elwood, one of two 
university workers who raised concerns over the issue and met with Queen last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elwood was active in a similar and highly publicized campus fight in 1984 to 
restore the same magazines that had been pulled from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists on campus late that year persuaded the bookstore's governing board 
to ban sexually explicit magazines, drawing nationwide attention. But the board 
shortly thereafter repealed the decision after a massive protest by students 
and faculty members citing free speech issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the decision to drop the magazines was based solely on problems 
they caused, not censorship, said Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Playboy, which has circulation of 3.4 million in the United 
States, applauded the decision. "Academic freedom has been under attack 
throughout the country. This is an important move in the right direction," said 
Terri Tomcisin, Playboy's director of corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest removal of the magazines was first reported Monday in the Matador 
Reporter, a CSUN student newspaper. JOHN CHANDLER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; BOBBY SHERMAN FAN ACCUSED OF STALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been more than 20 years since Bobby Sherman made the girls squeal to his 
bubble-gum rock. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least one fan, police say, Sherman has retained the old magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Richards, 39, was in jail Thursday after police arrested her on 
suspicion of stalking Sherman. The woman -- who took a bus from her home in 
Manchester, Me. -- was taken into custody outside the gates of Sherman's Encino 
home late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards had been sending Sherman letters for a month, asking to visit and 
telling him she had been a fan since she was a teen-ager, Los Angeles Police 
Detective Jeff Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, which were not threatening, went unanswered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much stock put in it," Dunn said. "It was nothing like 'I'm 
going to come out there and take care of your wife so we can be together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richards was undeterred by the lack of response, Dunn said. She traveled on a 
Greyhound bus to Los Angeles. When she arrived Wednesday, she made a beeline 
for her idol's Encino home, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived at the gated entrance at about 3 p.m. and rang the bell, Dunn 
said. Sherman watched her through a security camera and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, Richards had left, Dunn said. She returned at about 5:15 
p.m., and Sherman again called police, who took Richards into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards remains in the Van Nuys jail, awaiting arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, who did not return phone calls, is best remembered as the boyish 
performer who shot to stardom after appearing on the "Shindig" and "Here Come 
the Brides" television series.  
</P>
<P>
 His first single, "Little Woman," earned a gold record in 1969. Subsequent 
hits that included "Easy Come, Easy Go," "Julie, Do Ya Love Me" and "Cried Like 
a Baby" made him a favorite with teen-age and preteen girls. NICHOLAS RICCARDI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; PAYMENT SOUGHT OVER ILLEGAL CABLE TV GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local cable television company is requiring customers found with illegal 
cable boxes to pay $2,500 or face a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But customers of Chatsworth-based Cablevision Industries claim the company 
used improper tactics when it confiscated their electronic boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sweeps have been very successful," Robert Thoreson, the company's 
security manager, who has organized the crackdown on customers who can use the 
boxes to unscramble premium cable channels without paying for them. "We don't 
want to sue our customers; we would rather settle with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoreson said more than 400 black boxes were confiscated in the company's last 
four-month sweep, which included the San Fernando Valley and parts of Long 
Beach and Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods are targeted for the crackdown if high radiation leaks are 
measured in the area through electronic equipment, Thoreson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sweeps have been successful for the company, some customers 
caught up in them are angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Stolarz of West Hills said two cable employees bullied their way into 
her home Nov. 15 and confiscated her illegal black box. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they are doing it is very nasty and intimidating," Stolarz said. 
"They were really pushy and kept trying to walk around me at my front door." 
</P>
<P>
 Stolarz said her mother and 6-year-old son were startled when the cable 
workers threatened to have her arrested if she didn't surrender the box. She 
did, but said she is unsure whether she will pay the $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoreson denies that workers are overzealous and said the cable company is 
within its rights. A state law makes it a misdemeanor to illegally connect a 
cable box to unscramble signals. The crime is punishable by a $5,000 fine. "We 
are only asking for half of that," Thoreson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sig Tinglof, caught up in the same sweep as Stolarz, said he was harassed by 
cable workers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to the door and said they had to inspect the equipment," Tinglof 
said. "They were really rude and wouldn't go away and I wouldn't let them in 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinglof said the cable workers threatened to call police if he didn't give 
them the black box in his living room that Tinglof said was installed by his 
son's friend. The workers promised not to prosecute him if he surrendered it, 
which he eventually did. He maintained he did not know the box was in his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolarz, Tinglof and some of their neighbors met with an attorney Sunday and 
are still determining whether to take action. JEANNETTE REGALADO

MORE POLICE STATIONS WILL GET BANKING MACHINES; SAFETY: ANOTHER 13 ATMS WILL BE 
INSTALLED CITYWIDE IN EFFORT TO HELP PUBLIC AVOID DANGER WHEN WITHDRAWING CASH. 
NINE HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE UNDER PILOT PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to give more ATM users safe havens from robbers, the Los Angeles Police 
Credit Union will install banking machines in police stations across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 ATMs are already available at nine LAPD facilities under a pilot program; 
another 13 will be installed next year, said Kimberly Phillips, president and 
chief executive officer of the credit union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that the public will see it as a good community service and 
begin looking at police stations as a good place to start accessing cash," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program began when the City Council, at the urging of San Fernando 
Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, voted unanimously in late 1993 to install ATMs 
in several stations after a series of crimes against ATM users.  
</P>
<P>
 Use of the banking machines is regarded as dangerous in areas that are 
deserted at night. One crime that drew particular attention was the March, 
1993, slaying of Sherri Foreman, 29, a pregnant woman who died March 31 after 
she was stabbed near an ATM in Sherman Oaks by a would-be carjacker. Her 
13-week-old fetus did not survive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The police credit union, which had already installed ATMs in four LAPD 
stations for use by credit union members, was ultimately selected by the 
council to oversee the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the number of ATMs has been expanded to include machines in Parker 
Center headquarters Downtown, the Police Academy, a police substation in the 
Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills Shopping Center and the Van Nuys, Devonshire, 77th 
Street, Central and Harbor divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several banks that had been asked to submit proposals to install ATMs in 
police stations told city officials in 1993 that they were reluctant to 
participate because they feared that the cash machines would not be used 
frequently enough to pay for their installation and maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit union, however, had different goals: to serve its members in the 
Police Department and to become a safe place for the public to take care of 
banking needs, particularly at night, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most business at many police station ATMs has been done by police 
officers. "But I don't think a lot of people are aware" that the machine is 
available to the public, one Devonshire Division officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the case everywhere. An ATM installed several months ago at the 
77th Street station has been well received by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're surprised, it's a good location for them, and they feel safe," 
Officer John Jenal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said he hopes that installing the machines 
in stations across the city will reduce the number of ATM-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful that we could invite the community to take care of 
some of their personal business in an atmosphere of safety and comfort," 
Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy said he is depending on the news media, community-based policing 
programs and word-of-mouth to get the news out to residents that the ATMs will 
be available. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to join Bernson and Van Nuys Municipal Judge Michael S. Luros 
on Monday at the Devonshire Division to announce plans to expand the program 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Luros who pushed the idea to Bernson and police of placing ATMs in 
station lobbies after a rash of stabbings and shootings at ATM locations.

SEISMIC PANEL OKS REPORT ON NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE; SAFETY: DOCUMENT IS APPROVED 
MOSTLY IN CONCEPT, WITH MANY DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT BY STAFF. FINAL STUDY 
WON'T BE READY UNTIL NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Seismic Safety Commission on Thursday adopted its overdue report to 
Gov. Pete Wilson on lessons learned from the Northridge earthquake. But that 
adoption was mainly in concept, and much of the report's final wording remained 
to be determined.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the 17-member commission spent hours discussing issues on what future 
quake mitigation steps should be taken, it broadly revised a draft document and 
left much of the exact language to the staff. The final report will not be 
issued until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're adopting the document, subject to the editorial work we have to do," 
said Commission Chairman Paul Fratessa, a structural engineer from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had originally directed that the report be submitted Sept. 1. But a 
Wilson aide who attended part of the session, insurance adviser Marjorie Berte, 
said the governor's office is more interested in having a quality report than 
one produced on time. 
</P>
<P>
 From the discussion Thursday, the commission seems unwilling to make many 
forceful recommendations, although it agreed to call for giving the state 
Building Standards Commission more authority to revise and implement earthquake 
construction standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission went no further than encouraging local government to undertake 
quake retrofitting of single-family homes after one of its members, Los Angeles 
City Councilman Hal Bernson, said that to use stronger language would "open a 
can of worms" that would be "politically unpalatable." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members also avoided a hard-line on the matter of code revisions 
for new and existing buildings. They said local authorities should be given 
until 2000 to adopt retrofitting and additional hazard reduction plans and 
until 2020 to implement them. The commission's role is strictly advisory, and 
it has no enforcement powers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of steel-framed buildings, a number of which cracked during 
the Northridge quake, the commission decided that firm recommendations were 
premature, because, as Bernson said, it is not yet known what effective 
corrective steps can be taken to guard against damage from future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 One member who often pressed for stronger and more precise language was 
Caltech engineering professor Wilfred Iwan, a former chairman of the 
commission. Iwan said it was vital for the commission "to take the 
responsibility for building safety in California" and to develop a specified 
process that would achieve that end. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission meets next in Northridge on Jan. 12. Fratessa said no concepts 
will now be altered, but details may be changed.

MERCHANT FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN BEVERLY HILLS SHOP; CRIME: THE WOMAN'S SLAYING 
IS THE FOURTH MURDER IN THE CITY SINCE AUGUST. THE VICTIM WAS TO RECEIVE AN 
AWARD FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE NEXT FRIDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Police on Thursday were investigating the shooting death of a Beverly Hills 
clothing store owner, the fourth killing since August in a city where the 
homicide rate rarely tops two a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Morgan, 45, was shot and killed in her small Olympic Boulevard rental 
gown store Wednesday evening, not long after the second-floor shop's 6 p.m. 
closing time, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan had been active in the Beverly Hills Women's Network, a division of the 
Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, and was scheduled to receive the chamber's 
first Woman in Business Advocate of the Year award next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sherry encouraged people to better themselves," said Janet Rothstein, owner 
of a jewelry store near Morgan's shop and a member of the Women's Network. "She 
was upbeat, encouraging and had a positive spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's death is the fourth homicide in Beverly Hills in four months. Among 
the most recent was the Oct. 2 murder of a gay rights activist visiting the 
area from Chicago. Police said Jon Simmons had been shot in the head by an 
unknown assailant in an alleyway behind a row of Beverly Hills mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also are investigating the Sept. 6 murder and robbery of a Brinks guard 
in front of a Wilshire Boulevard bank and the Aug. 11 burning death of an 
alleged arsonist, a crime police are investigating as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 All the cases remain unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no patterns to these homicides," said Lt. Frank Salcido of the 
Beverly Hills Police Department. "We're concerned whenever we have a homicide, 
much less four in (four) months." 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered Morgan's body about 7:35 p.m. inside Starlit Soiree, the 
shop she co-owned with her husband in an Olympic Boulevard strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were responding to a call from Morgan's husband, Gordon, who 
told them that his wife had phoned to say she was leaving the shop at 6:30 p.m. 
but had not arrived at the couple's Westside home by 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When police went to investigate, they found Morgan dead, lying on the floor 
behind the store's counter. The store's lights were on, its glass front door 
was unlocked and the shop did not appear to be ransacked, Salcido said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mall retailers said police told them that Morgan had been shot once in the 
neck, but police would not confirm that information nor would they comment on 
the type of gun used in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's slaying stunned neighboring merchants in the two-story Beverly Hills 
Plaza mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really scary," said Michele Matthews, a salon employee at Tamara de 
Beauty. "I'm afraid to tell my husband. He's paranoid enough when I work late." 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants said they were puzzled why anyone would go to the trouble of 
robbing a rental gown store on the second floor of a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been muggings and cars broken into and a woman was robbed out in 
the parking lot once," one retailer said. "(But) we've always felt very secure 
up here on the second floor."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; LATINA STUDENTS BOOST DRIVE FOR NEEDY 
CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This Christmas, children in San Luis Rio Colorado will receive bandages, cans 
of soup, stuffed animals, clothes and other items from Granada Hills when 
Isabel Martinez returns to the small Mexican town of her birth just south of 
the Arizona border. 
</P>
<P>
 Her truck will be filled with items collected by Martinez's San Fernando 
Valley neighbors -- including a group of students from Granada Hills High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez initiated her own private donation drive for San Luis just two weeks 
ago after a visit to her hometown. Circumstances at an orphanage and elementary 
school in the Mexican border town made Martinez determined to provide the 
malnourished children at the two facilities with some necessities as well as 
holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that time of year when people feel they really need to do something for 
someone else," Martinez said. "I've received a lot of positive responses from 
people who heard about what I am doing. I appreciate their efforts very much." 
</P>
<P>
 To show that appreciation, Martinez has visited everyone who's donated items 
for the children so she could thank them personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most recent excursion of gratitude took Martinez on this week to Granada 
Hills High School. Upon learning that Martinez was assisting children in 
situations similar to those they'd experienced, a group of Latina students took 
up a collection to make sure Martinez went back to Mexico with her truck 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who belong to L.A. Latina, a campus organization working to help 
members overcome language and cultural barriers encountered at school, packed 
Martinez's truck with bags of food, clothing and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should help each other with what little they have because life only 
happens once," said Alejandra Huerta, 19, who called Martinez for a list of 
most necessary items. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes me feel good," Huerta said. "It's beautiful to see that children 
are going to eat another day."  
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza Castillo, 14, was one of the 19 L.A. Latina members who this week 
surveyed the items Martinez will be taking with her to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people would rather know where the things they give are going," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing that most of the 200 children at the government-funded orphanage 
sleep on the floor, Esperanza asked, "Why not give them beds?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait," Martinez replied. "Let me give them these things first." ANTONIO

 With enrollment growing again, Los Alamitos Unified School District officials 
plan to reopen one of the district's closed schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But to finance the reopening of Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, the 
district is selling the vacant Weaver Elementary School in Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say a second middle school is necessary because McAuliffe 
is getting overcrowded. Two middle schools will be necessary to accommodate an 
expected increase of about 230 students next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weaver school site is being sold for $8 million to a developer who wants 
to build homes on the land. Today 
</P>
<P>
 An old-fashioned Christmas show and ice-cream social will take place at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will include a performance of the family holiday drama "Fast Train 
to the Poorhouse ... Or Christmas Derailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend can also take part in a holiday sing-along. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice cream and popcorn will be served. 
</P>
<P>
 The program begins at 7 p.m. at the campus' Drama Lab Theatre. It runs through 
Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission for the program is $6.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OLIVE CREST CHILDREN'S HOMES SEEK DONATIONS

<P>
 Olive Crest is looking for a wide range of donations -- from appliances to 
Christmas toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization has 13 group homes in Orange County that try to 
create a family environment for physically and sexually abused children who 
have been taken from their parents by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Crest finds houses in neighborhoods that become homes for six children 
from preschoolers through age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Christmas is a time when our children are most painfully aware 
of what they do not have and what other children do have," said Darryl 
Anderson, chairman of the Olive Crest board of directors. "We strive to make 
them feel valued, loved and cared for, especially during this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the homes need constant upkeep and essential household goods need to 
be replaced, group home officials said, requests on their holiday wish list 
include furniture, major appliances, televisions, VCRs, vacuum cleaners, 
kitchen goods and other household items. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about Olive Crest programs or to make a donation, call 
Julie Seaborn at (714) 543-KIDS, Ext. 144. FRANK MESSINA

SUPER SCOOPER PLANES WIN OFFICIALS' PRAISE IN ROCKY DEBUT; FIREFIGHTING: 
GUSTING WINDS FORCE THE WATER-DUMPING AIRCRAFT TO FLY HIGHER THAN OPTIMUM 
ALTITUDE. EVEN SO, THEY ARE CALLED EFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The much-heralded Super Scooper firefighting planes ran into trouble trying to 
fight the Malibu blaze Thursday, their first major test against classic 
Southern California fire conditions of strong winds hurling flames over 
forbidding mountain slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fire officials said they were pleased with the performance of the 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 35 to 50 m.p.h. winds affected the dropping capabilities," said Los 
Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Steve Valenzuela. Because the winds and 
terrain made it difficult to fly close to the fire-ravaged slopes, the pilots 
"had to drop from a higher altitude, which ended up causing the water to turn 
into a finer mist before hitting the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenzuela said the two planes were nonetheless effective in helping to 
contain the fire by dropping water during the blaze's early moments and working 
with the department's seven water-dropping helicopters, which were able to fly 
lower and score more direct hits. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman said the planes were more effective than 
they appeared. From along Pacific Coast Highway he watched one of the planes 
make a drop -- and, at first, was startled to see the water appear to evaporate 
in the gusty winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as it dropped alongside and across PCH," Freeman said, "it was like being 
in a downpour of rain, which tells you that although the water dropped may 
appear to dissipate, it still has a significant cooling and wetting effect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In ideal conditions, the planes can drop water from 150 feet above the fire. 
But in Latigo Canyon's steep terrain, the planes were often forced to fly 150 
feet above ridge crests -- while the fire burned 200 feet or more down the 
hill. That meant that the water had to fall 350 to 400 feet before reaching the 
target, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran firefighter on the scene was unconvinced of the planes' 
capabilities. The Super Scooper, he said, obviously has to fly high enough to 
clear the crest of the mountains. On a windy day such as Thursday, that means 
the water can blow a quarter- to a half-mile away from the target. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Thursday night how many runs each of the Super Scoopers made, 
but Freeman said there were at least 12 drops -- each about four times the size 
of a helicopter load. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Super Scooper pilots were able to use the ocean for water 
pickups, Freeman said, the high winds forced them to make a slight detour two 
miles up the coast to Paradise Cove. On a calm day, the planes could have 
scooped water within sight of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department acquired the two Canadian-made aircraft in October 
on a three-month lease from the Quebec government.  
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual partnership, the county shared the cost of leasing one of the 
planes -- $719,000, including two crews and mechanics -- with the California 
insurance industry and the federal government. The other plane is being donated 
for three months by Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, parent company of Canadair, 
which manufactures the planes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each plane costs $515 an hour to fly. Buying a plane outright would cost $16.5 
million. The two are based at Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The high costs are among the reasons that critics blocked extensive testing of 
the planes here more than a decade ago. They had also argued that the planes 
cannot fly at night, have trouble in gusty winds and cannot refill from a 
choppy ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But last fall's two dozen wildfires and their $1-billion price tag spurred the 
county to become the first California jurisdiction to acquire the planes.

PANEL DISCUSSES THE FUTURE OF VENTURA BOULEVARD; PLANNERS: MUCH OF THE TALK 
FOCUSES ON WHETHER THE THOROUGHFARE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A REGIONAL OR A LOCAL 
STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Should Ventura Boulevard be a mini-freeway, or should it be a 
pedestrian-oriented shopping street? 
</P>
<P>
 That was the question Thursday for Los Angeles planning commissioners who 
discussed where they would get the money to pay for street widenings over the 
next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Marna Schnabel said the first issue to be addressed in the 
discussion of the boulevard's 20-year master plan is "clarity on what is 
Ventura Boulevard. It's a shopping district that has a major thoroughfare going 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission met Thursday at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club to 
discuss, among other topics, the elimination of "trip" fees -- assessments that 
boulevard developers have to pay based on the number of car trips that city 
officials estimate their developments would generate. The fees were to help pay 
for the costs of the intersection widenings called for by the Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission ended up putting off that issue until its Feb. 9 meeting. But 
talk of who should pay for the plan -- whether developers or the state or 
federal government -- spawned a discussion on whether Ventura Boulevard should 
be considered a regional or local street. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission asked planning staff employees to poll boulevard merchants and 
residents about their opinions on the issue at a workshop, during which city 
officials will also make available details on proposed changes in the master 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to lowering fees and reducing the budget for intersection 
widenings, the proposal provides for payment of refunds to developers who have 
already paid excessive trip fees. The workshop will be held Saturday, Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the commissioners, Schnabel seemed most receptive to regarding the 
boulevard as a major transportation artery, while Robert L. Scott seemed to 
have the most misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that it is an alternate route" to the Ventura Freeway, 
Schnabel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott responded, "The more we make it an alternate route, the more people will 
use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under changes proposed by the planning and transportation departments, trip 
fees would be replaced by fees that are about 50% lower, based on the square 
footage of new developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower fees are based on a $77-million working budget for the plan, which 
now has a $222-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission decided to put off a decision on the trip fees and hold the 
workshop at the request of community activists who said they need more time and 
information to evaluate the proposed plan changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board, 
presented the commission with letters signed by every homeowner association and 
chamber of commerce along the boulevard from Woodland Hills to Universal City 
-- except for Homeowners of Encino and the Studio City Residents Assn. -- 
which, according to Brain, opposed the idea of Ventura Boulevard as a regional 
thoroughfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, criticized the proposed 
budget reductions, saying too few intersections can be widened under the 
proposed budget of $19 million, down from $152 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is going to have to be generated in much bigger numbers than what we 
have here," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain said he was happy about the commission's decision to give him and other 
community activists more time to review the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many details that we have not been able to see," he said.

KEY WITNESS SAYS PANAH TOLD OF GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness against an alleged child rapist and killer 
testified at his trial Thursday that he told her the missing girl was dead 
about 12 hours before police found the victim's battered body in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauni Campbell said Hooman Ashkan Panah first indicated something was amiss 
when he telephoned her on Nov. 21, 1993, the day 8-year-old Nicole Parker 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that he needed my help, that he had done something really bad," 
testified Campbell, Panah's former girlfriend and co-worker at Mervyn's 
department store in Canoga Park. "He said he couldn't tell me, but what he had 
done was so big that I would find out about it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Panah showed up the next morning at Campbell's apartment in West Hills -- 
his wrists slashed in the first of two apparent suicide attempts -- Campbell 
asked him if the "really bad" thing he had done was related to Nicole's 
disappearance, which by then had prompted a frantic, highly publicized search. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah replied yes, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if the little girl was still alive, and he said no," Campbell 
said. "I asked him, did he know she was not alive or did he just assume it. . . 
? 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'She is not alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the information and worried about Panah, who had swallowed a 
handful of over-the-counter sleeping pills in her presence, Campbell called 
911.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on the information provided by Campbell, police searched Panah's 
apartment in Woodland Hills and found Nicole's body stuffed in a suitcase 
buried under clothes and other valises in Panah's closet. Authorities had 
checked the apartment, located next to a unit occupied by Nicole's father, at 
least twice previously without success. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, 23, is charged with murder, kidnaping, rape, sodomy and committing lewd 
acts with a child. If he is found guilty, he could be sentenced to death. He 
has pleaded not guilty to the charges and plans to use an insanity defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also allege that Panah was involved in a plot to kill Campbell 
after his arrest, but do not plan to charge him because he already faces a 
possible death penalty. They refused to reveal the nature of the threats or any 
evidence the district attorney's office may have implicating Panah. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahan also refused to comment extensively on the 
allegation, but said in court Wednesday that Panah was framed by a jailhouse 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 In his cross-examination of Campbell, Sheahan implied that she fabricated 
Panah's admission because she was jealous of his sexual relationships with 
other women.

HOUSE GUEST SOUGHT AFTER MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Thursday were looking for a man they said is a suspect in the shooting 
death of a Woodland Hills man who had put him up in his home for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Goga, who had been the victim's house guest for two or three months, is 
described as about 50, with brown hair and blue eyes, 5-foot-7 and about 170 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released, was found about 2 p.m. Wednesday in 
his house on De Valle Avenue by a friend who was concerned at his 
disappearance. The man told police he became concerned after not hearing from 
his friend, Detective Malena Heissel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He found the victim's body on the floor inside the home with several bullets 
in the torso, Heissel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the victim's gun collection, along with devices they believed to 
be fake explosives at the house, Heissel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gone from the house was Goga, along with the victim's yellow 1972 Volvo 
station wagon, license plate number 905FZH.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what the motive is, and no one's in custody," Heissel said. 
"We'd of course like to speak to Mr. Goga and find out what happened."

2 BODIES IDENTIFIED AS PAIR MISSING SINCE THANKSGIVING; NORTH HOLLYWOOD: POLICE 
CONFIRM THAT REMAINS FOUND NEAR VICTORVILLE ARE THOSE OF MEN WHO DISAPPEARED 
AFTER STOPPING AT ENCINO DELI TO COLLECT ON A DEBT. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles police confirmed Thursday that a pair of bodies discovered near 
Victorville this week belong to two North Hollywood men who disappeared 
Thanksgiving Day after stopping at Jerry's Famous Deli in Encino to collect on 
a debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends of Eliyahu (Eli) Asaraf, 32, and Prosper Revah, 39, 
suspected foul play following their disappearance and had combed the hills of 
the San Fernando Valley, posted flyers and even hired a private investigator in 
an effort to locate the men. 
</P>
<P>
 The search ended abruptly when police announced late Wednesday that the two 
men had been found dead in a desolate area of San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Scavengers discovered the bodies Tuesday evening at Palmdale Road and Baldy 
Mesa, near Victorville, said Dick Ebel, a deputy coroner with the San 
Bernardino County Coroner's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsies were scheduled for Thursday, but results were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Asaraf and Revah, who operated a wholesale clothing business together, had 
apparently gone to the Encino restaurant on Thanksgiving Day to collect a 
$2,000 debt owed by an unidentified business associate for clothing sold on 
consignment, police and family said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was set for about 6 p.m., but Asaraf phoned home and told his wife 
that the associate was going to be an hour late, said Cobi Asaraf, Eli Asaraf's 
older brother. Neither of the men was heard from after that, and repeated 
attempts to page Asaraf were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 The associate that the two men planned to meet said Asaraf and Revah never 
showed up for the appointment, said Cobi Asaraf. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clues to emerge since their disappearance are a withdrawal made from 
Eli Asaraf's bank account through an automated teller machine on Thanksgiving 
night and the discovery Nov. 30 of a rental car the men had been driving, at a 
Los Angeles International Airport parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Asaraf is survived by his wife and 11-month-old son. Revah is survived by 
his wife, two young daughters and a son, Cobi Asaraf said. He added that his 
brother immigrated to the United States in 1987 from Israel to join him and his 
mother in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last month, Cobi Asaraf said he was certain something bad had 
happened to his brother, whom he described as the type of man who would call 
home every 30 minutes to check on his wife and baby son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tough on the outside but really a little kid inside," he said. "He was 
a good man, he had a good heart and he was very sensitive."

MAN, 20, ACCUSED OF FELONY GRAFFITI SCRAWLS; CRIME: THE RARE PROSECUTION IS 
BASED ON VANDALISM AMOUNTING TO $12,000 AT 200 VALLEY SITES OVER SIX MONTHS. 
THE SUSPECT, WHO HAS PLEADED INNOCENT, FACES PRISON.

 An accused tagger pleaded not guilty Thursday to a rare felony vandalism 
charge filed against an adult for allegedly scrawling graffiti on 200 North 
Hollywood sites over a six-month period, according to the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Anthony Rodriguez, 20, of North Hollywood, is accused of spraying or 
marking the moniker "James 129" on scores of walls, street signs, curbs, street 
lights and billboards between May 3 and Nov. 29, causing more than $12,000 in 
damage, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Mitchel Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's case is the first in memory where prosecutors reached the felony 
level in an adult case by adding up the cost of erasing the hundreds of tags 
all over town, Gibbons said. A felony requires at least $5,000 in damage. To 
the frustration of police, vandalism by adults is commonly prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail. Over the past five years, 
only about a dozen adult taggers have been prosecuted for felony vandalism, 
said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Rodriguez could be sentenced to three years in state prison, 
said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims listed in the complaint against Rodriguez include the city of Los 
Angeles, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the state of California, 
Gannett Media, Town Ranch Realty, Rohan Glass Co. and Metropolitan Signs, among 
others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective Craig Rhudy, who heads the Community Tagger Task Force, hailed 
the prosecutor's decision to file the felony count. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that 10% of the 700 "active" taggers in the San Fernando Valley 
are believed to be adults. "This is a real step forward in the war against 
graffiti," Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging an adult tagger with a felony count of vandalism allows suspects to 
be sentenced to state prison and supervised probation, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhudy said his department began investigating Rodriguez after they served a 
search warrant last Friday at the North Hollywood residence of David George, 
21, a member of Rodriguez's tagging crew. Information gleaned from the search 
led them to Rodriguez, who turned himself in Tuesday.

 As many as five to 10 additional arrests of members of the same tagging crew 
are expected as a result of the investigation, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to strike fear in the heart of the 129 crew in North Hollywood," 
Rhudy said, referring to Rodriguez's tagging group.

 Police estimate that together Rodriguez and George are responsible for as much

 About 25 volunteers help police by locating, photographing and filing crime 
reports on graffiti discovered throughout the San Fernando Valley.

 Since the task force was formed in July, 1993, more than 11,000 
graffiti-related crime reports have been filed.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VALENCIA WATER CO. TO INCREASE RATES BY 30%; 
UTILITIES: MANY RESIDENTS ARE SURPRISED BY THE HIKE DUE NEXT YEAR, WHICH WILL 
PAY FOR QUAKE REPAIRS AND RISING OPERATING COSTS.

 Valencia Water Co. will raise rates by 30% in 1995 because of earthquake 
repairs and increased operating costs, a move that surprised many residents who 
said Thursday they had no idea the increase was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the increase is needed to repair items such as three tanks, 
with a total capacity of 2 million gallons, that ruptured in the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, said Bob Diprimio, managing director of the water 
agency. The rest of the rate hike, the second increase in 11 years, will cover 
operating costs pushed higher by inflation and new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, rates will increase 4% in 1996 and 1.6% in 1997 under the plan 
approved Wednesday by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The percentages seem large, but we're still one of the lowest-cost water 
companies in the Santa Clarita Valley," said Diprimio, whose agency serves 
15,000 homes and business in the valley's west portion. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly bill for an average residential customer who uses about 2,100 
cubic feet of water will increase from $20.24 to $26.82, according to the 
utilities commission. By comparison, the Newhall County Water District next 
year will charge $31.14 and the Santa Clarita Water Co. $23.01 for the same 
amount of water. 
</P>
<P>
 A 57-cent service charge and a surcharge of 3 cents per 100 cubic feet of 
water will also be implemented by Valencia Water Co. for 22 months to cover 
additional earthquake repair costs. The added charges will tack on $1.55 to an 
average monthly bill, said Kyle DeVine, a utilities commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 News of the increase was an unhappy surprise to many customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Norton, 47, said she already has enough unexpected bills because of the 
earthquake without having to worry about how her $45 water bill will be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting hit by so many expenses it's hard to take," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Water Co. sent letters to its customers notifying them of two public 
meetings in August to discuss the issue, but only one resident showed up, 
Diprimio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like I heard about it, but I didn't pay a lot of attention to it," 
Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they never received the letter, or at least do not remember it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of the house in August and my mail was going every which way," said 
a 50-year-old Valencia woman who was forced to move out of her house for 
several months because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Water Co. had asked the state for increases of 32% in 1995, 9.5% in 
1996 and 2.3% in 1997, said DeVine. She said she does not know why the 
commission denied the full increases requested. 
</P>
<P>
 With the smaller hikes, Diprimio said, some projects will have to be delayed 
or eliminated, such as construction of new pump stations and an administrative 
building to replace the trailers employees now use.

U.S. FIRMS EAGER FOR LATIN TRADE DEAL; SUMMIT: FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRMS AND ENERGY EQUIPMENT MAKERS SEE HUGE MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The agenda at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Miami may accent lofty 
themes, but U.S. business leaders reading between the lines see nothing but 
concrete opportunities coming out of any move toward hemispheric free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. financial services, telecommunications companies and energy equipment 
manufacturers see huge markets opening up in Latin American countries just now 
emerging from protectionist regimes and registering rapid economic gains. A 
Western Hemispheric free trade pact, the goal that each of the 34 nations is 
striving for, would only accelerate those gains. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the eager observers: AT&T, which stands ready to wire Latin America 
with fiber optic; Salomon Bros., which would like to prime the emerging 
economies' pumps with capital; Weyerhaeuser Co., which wants to sell timber 
products, and Santa Fe Pacific, whose port facilities in Los Angeles and San 
Diego would exploit the extra ship traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to see is the opening of markets generally throughout Latin 
America, the deregulation of telecommunication services and the opportunity for 
companies like AT&T to compete in those markets for both equipment and 
services," said Victor Pelson, chairman of AT&T's global operations team based 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the summit's goal statement specifically targets telecommunications, 
capital markets and energy -- -- prerequisites for the infrastructure needed to 
better link member countries. In Brazil, for example, there are just seven 
telephones for every 100 residents -- compared with 56 per 100 in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing such gaps demands high-cost, high-technology projects that are 
traditionally U.S. industry's bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economies of Latin America are in the take-off stage and there are some 
substantial projects in the planning boards. We're talking about billions of 
dollars of sales over next few years in telecom and natural gas pipelines 
alone," said Jeffrey J. Schott, senior fellow at Institute for International 
Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade with Latin America is gathering steam anyway. The United States 
turned a $2.8-billion trade surplus with the region over the year ended 
September, a surplus likely to grow rapidly over the next decade. Maintaining 
or improving that surplus with freer trade is a high priority with the U.S. 
trade deficit worldwide mushrooming to $108.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be some bumps along the road to free trade's level playing 
field. Far-reaching reforms of Latin American judicial systems and stock 
exchanges must be completed, for example, before U.S. investors are comfortable 
doing business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Chang, emerging markets research director at Salomon Bros., said $66 
billion in U.S. capital flowed into Latin American stocks and bonds this year 
as investors were attracted by higher bond interest rates and booming stock 
markets. But that number would go much higher if certain Latin countries 
eliminated barriers to foreign investment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several countries are in dire need of stock exchange reforms that set up 
uniform rules for clearance and settlement so as to "guarantee that buyers get 
their stock and that sellers get their money," said an official with the 
Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. "The courts have to be 
streamlined so if they have a dispute, it doesn't take five or six years to 
resolve it." 
</P>
<P>
 The leveling process will require significant U.S. concessions as well. 
Several Latin American countries complain about U.S. trade policy that protects 
domestic agricultural interests. They noted that the recently approved 
worldwide General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a set of rules that govern 
international trade, is less stringent about freeing up markets for agriculture 
than for industrial products. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, for example, wants the United States to stop subsidies for wheat 
farmers. Chile says it can't sell enough table grapes here. Colombia is mad 
about tariffs on its cut flowers, which once dominated the U.S. market. Brazil 
says it is prevented from exporting all the orange juice concentrate that it 
can produce. 
</P>
<P>
 And Caribbean countries want to regain the preferential treatment for textiles 
they lost with last year's passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
the trade pact among Canada, Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. subsidizes its wheat farmers and the Canada Wheat Board has an 
internal monopoly. So they can afford to go on dumping in other markets such as 
Brazil just like some Japanese electronics companies . . . in the U.S.," said 
an official at the Argentine Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower priced American wheat sold in Brazil has severely damaged Argentine 
farmers for whom Brazil is the largest export market, complained the Argentine 
spokesman, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo de Grieff, director of Colombia's trade bureau in Los Angeles, said 
the United States protects Hawaiian banana growers with strict quotas that 
effectively block Colombia's access to U.S. markets. That's a damaging blow at 
a time when the European common market is freezing out Colombian and Ecuadorean 
banana farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 But those issues are seen as relatively minor irritants in relation to the 
overall benefit of a hemispheric trade agreement. And the pressure is on 
President Clinton to lead the summit toward that goal this weekend, despite the 
disappointing November elections and his recent failure to obtain "fast track" 
negotiating authority from Congress to expand NAFTA to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, Latin countries expect the United States to push through the 
admission of Chile to NAFTA -- a demonstration that the United States is 
serious about free trade beyond the pact it signed last year with Canada and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's widespread Latin support of free trade "is a phenomenon of the 
failures of previous policies and the debt crisis that ensued" in the 1980s, 
said Schott of the Institute for International Economics. "Countries have 
realized that protectionism is a costly policy."

THAT FABLED BRITISH AUTO MAKER ROLLS WITH THE CHANGING TIMES; CARS: ROLLS-ROYCE 
LEARNS HOW TO KEEP ITS HANDMADE ELEGANCE WHILE ADAPTING TO THE HARSH REALITIES 
OF THE '90S. THERE'S EVEN A MOVE AFOOT -- EGAD! -- FOR A PARTNERSHIP.

 Each time Dennis Jones finishes handcrafting a radiator for the front of a 
Rolls-Royce, he initials it with a double-D that looks something like a Texas 
cattle brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Rolls-Royce is on the road, if the radiator requires repairs, it will 
return to Crewe and Jones will fix it. It's his radiator, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 He dismisses a suggestion that a machine could do his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be done by hand to get its original design, finish and shape," said 
Jones, who has signed more than 5,000 radiators over the past quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the craftsmanship that makes Rolls-Royce the epitome of luxury for the 
world's super-rich. Who else could afford to shell out $149,900 for a 
bottom-of-the-line Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn? Or $347,200 for a top-of-the-line 
limousine? 
</P>
<P>
 But while the 90-year-old Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. and its handmade cars 
are as quintessentially British as the queen and afternoon tea, its 
manufacturing traditions have undergone a radical shake-up in recent years. And 
in a second revolution of sorts, Rolls-Royce's parent, Vickers PLC, is seeking 
a partnership with another, as-yet unidentified auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 The global recession, which hit Rolls-Royce buyers hard, forced the changes. 
The company's payroll was halved. Costs and production time fell dramatically 
with help from Japanese-style manufacturing practices. Some parts that used to 
be made by Rolls-Royce are now bought from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rolls-Royce tradition is still apparent on every inch of its cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Their leather seats are made from 10 to 12 hides per vehicle. Workers 
carefully match the leather before it is dyed, then meticulously study each 
hide to decide where to cut each piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Trim for the carpeting is made from less-fine leather from around the cow's 
spine. But it must come from the same animals whose skin is used in the seats, 
to make an ideal match. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Rolls-Royce car owners can have their own individual touches. One 
American customer insisted on shipping over hides he chose himself. A Scottish 
customer used tartans between cowhide panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden interior panels are selected with care and cut precisely through the 
grain to make mirror images of patterns. Woods like bird's-eye maple, mahogany 
and walnut are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can choose whatever items of comfort and extravagance they desire, 
like a fine-cut glass set for a back seat bar, or tiny televisions that fit 
into the backs of the front seat headrests for passengers to watch in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 But such detail may not be enough. Auto analyst Nick Cunningham of the London 
brokerage Barclays de Zoete Wedd believes Rolls-Royce needs to modernize its 
line, which now is about 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to develop a new car," Cunningham said. "They need a new drive 
train. They need a new body and chassis, as well. Every year that passes, your 
vehicle gets older and it gets harder to sell to people." 
</P>
<P>
 That will require hundreds of millions of dollars, money the company expects 
from its prospective partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Rolls-Royce executives said no decision had been made 
about who the investor will be, playing down speculation by analysts in London 
that Mercedes-Benz will get the nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a partner for Rolls-Royce has stirred concerns in England that the 
company could be taken over, just as the last big British-owned mass producer 
of cars, Rover, was purchased by BMW of Germany earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rolls-Royce insists it will still be Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking collaboration, not equity," said Richard N. Charlesworth, the 
company's head of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever form the partnership takes, it will force the auto maker to adapt to 
the realities of the 1990s for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early part of the decade, Rolls-Royce had to contend with the worldwide 
economic bust. Although Rolls-Royce owners are often multimillionaires who tend 
to own more than one home and an average of five cars, it turned out they 
weren't recession-proof. 
</P>
<P>
 During the boom of the mid- and late 1980s, worldwide sales of Rolls-Royces 
and the company's Bentley line of cars soared from around 2,200 a year to a 
peak of 3,324 in 1990. But when the recession struck, sales plunged to 1,706 in 
1991 and 1,375 in 1992, handing the company losses estimated in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls-Royce executives took a hard look at their business. They revamped the 
entire manufacturing system by creating Japanese-style teams that work closely 
with each other rather than being directed by middle managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a traditional management business, we didn't encourage people to use as 
much initiative as we should have," said Charles Matthews, managing director of 
operations. "The managers managed and the workers worked. We've eliminated much 
management. A lot of the management ideas are attributed to the Japanese; the 
other view is it's common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new practice, each working team is viewed as both a "supplier" and a 
"customer" of the parts used to make a Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 A team that makes leather-crafted seats will be a customer of the finished 
leather but a supplier of the seats to whomever handles them next in the 
production line. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker used to spend up to three days making a front seat for a 
Rolls-Royce. If he was working on a black seat and the workers at the next 
stage of production needed a tan seat, they would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, seats are made in one day by three workers sharing the task. This way, 
they can be much more responsive to the needs of colleagues who install the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Rolls-Royce made 4,500 changes. "They might be small individually, but 
the incremental effect is absolutely huge," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks echo words of founder Henry Rolls that are posted throughout the 
factory: "Small things make perfection, but perfection is no small thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have allowed Rolls-Royce to cut the time of producing one car from 
65 days to 28 days. At any given time, 200 cars are in the production pipeline, 
down from 600 four years ago. This enables Rolls-Royce to save millions because 
expensive parts don't sit around for weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
 They've also lowered the company's break-even point from 2,800 cars a year to 
1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls-Royce might continue to find potential cuts, but after making big 
changes, this becomes increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably some nuts-and-bolts type stuff to say goodby to," Matthews 
said, adding this does not mean someday cheap leather seats could come in from 
someplace like Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine details that make a Rolls what it is will continue to be the work of 
craftsmen in Crewe, who are happy to have customers come along to watch their 
cars being built and to make suggestions.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: REGULATORS OK UNIONFED PLAN TO RAISE CAPITAL FOR S & L 
SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UnionFed Financial Corp., struggling for five years to pull itself out of the 
red, said federal regulators have approved its plan to raise at least $9 
million for its beleaguered savings and loan subsidiary by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed, based in Brea, has lost a total of $167.3 million since it restated 
its fiscal 1990 results.The company also said this week that it has retained 
the investment bank of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. to help it raise the 
needed cash or sell the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 A $26.5-million loss for the fiscal year that ended June 30 caused the 
company's Union Federal Savings Bank to fall below federal requirements for 
capital adequacy -- the amount of money investors have contributed to act as a 
final cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift is also trying to dispose of $54 million worth of troubled loans 
and other assets. Three years ago, it had $191 million in bad assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Federal has 14 branches in Orange and Los Angeles counties with a total 
of $835 million in deposits.

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS QUIETLY BUILDS A PAPER PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUSANNAH PATTON, DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newspapers aren't likely to spring to mind when people think of Fidelity 
Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe they should. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutual fund behemoth, which said last month that its newspaper division 
will buy 14 newspapers from San Antonio-based Harte-Hanks Communications Inc., 
is quietly establishing a small media empire in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Harte-Hanks purchase, which includes three daily newspapers, the 
financial services company has boosted its newspaper holdings to 78 weeklies 
and four dailies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harte-Hanks purchase sends the message that Fidelity is a serious 
player," said Mark Jurkowitz, executive editor of Boston magazine. "People were 
skeptical at first about Fidelity's intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Boston-based Fidelity says it is serious about expanding its newspaper 
business in eastern Massachusetts. The Harte-Hanks deal, expected to be 
completed by year end, will increase the combined circulation of Fidelity's 
newspapers to 766,000 in 106 communities. The Boston Globe, a unit of New York 
Times Co., reaches 506,545 households daily and 811,100 on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're becoming a major media force in eastern Massachusetts," said William R. 
Elfers, chairman and chief executive officer of Community Newspaper Co., 
Fidelity's publishing arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfers wouldn't comment specifically about Community Newspaper's plans, but 
the Harte-Hanks purchase has local observers wagering that the company might 
have its sights set on more expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, which also owns Worth magazine, said it doesn't release revenue or 
profit figures for its newspaper group. But in New England's relatively robust 
advertising market, a large group of community newspapers can do quite well, 
industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger the footprint, the more success a company will have capturing 
advertising," said John Morton, a media analyst with Lynch Jones & Ryan of 
Washington. The pattern Fidelity is setting in eastern Massachusetts is playing 
out across the country as suburban chains consolidate to compete with large 
dailies, he said.

TRUST FUND HAS THE MAKINGS OF TRULY GRAND IDEA; INVESTMENTS: MONEY MANAGER'S 
$10,000 GIFT TO HIS GRANDSON COULD PAY BIG DIVIDENDS, PROJECTED AS MUCH AS $10 
MILLION, WHEN THE TOT BECOMES A RETIREE.

<P>
 Paul Merriman is a Seattle money manager who shows all the signs of having too 
much money and too much time to think about what to do with it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he's also a creative thinker and a family man, he often comes up with 
investment ideas that are grandiose, employ every tax angle and arcane 
investment product and benefit his heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest "big and preposterous" (in his words) plan does all of the above 
and may hold some seeds of advice that the rest of us can use. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the plan: 
</P>
<P>
 When Merriman's grandson Aaron was born earlier this year, Merriman made a 
gift of $10,000 to an irrevocable trust for Aaron's benefit. The gift is not 
taxable to Aaron, whose parents are the money-managing trustees. They have 
directed the $10,000 to a variable annuity that lets the money build 
tax-deferred within the trust, and that lets them select mutual fund 
investments within the annuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust is set up so that Aaron can't touch the money until the year 2059, 
when he'll turn 65. At that point, Aaron will be able to receive 7% of the 
assets every year until he dies. Those payments, under current tax law, will be 
taxable as ordinary income to Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aaron dies, what's left in the trust will go to charitable organizations 
that are tax-exempt. By then, Merriman hopes, there will be a Merriman Family 
Foundation, staffed by (well-paid) junior Merrimans who direct the funds to the 
charities of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 And these are the numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 Merriman expects the trust to grow at an annual average rate of 11.2% a year, 
so that it holds some $10 million when Aaron turns 65. That's a little 
optimistic but may be made more possible by the long-term investment horizon of 
the trust. A 9% rate of return compounded over 65 years would leave about $3 
million in the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Merriman's figures, Aaron's 7% cut would give him $700,000 in the first 
year, a figure worth about $85,000 today given past inflation rates. Aaron's 
cut will increase every year as the trust grows, and after 20 years, there 
still be some $23 million left in the trust to turn over to charity, Merriman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whew! 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, a couple of bases Merriman didn't cover. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Aaron becomes disabled or has a pressing need for the money before he 
turns 65? What if tax laws change and the annuity build-up becomes taxable 
every year? What if Aaron dies before he collects a penny of the money? 
</P>
<P>
 Merriman shrugged his shoulders at all of it: 
</P>
<P>
 Tax laws always change; at least there's the chance that previously 
established annuities will be protected by future tax changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Having to wait until he's 65 will protect Aaron from being a non-productive 
"trust-fund kid." He'll have to make his own way in life before he meets his 
retirement bonus. And if he never collects a penny, that's $10 million or more 
to charity, and what's wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
 It's all more than most of us can fathom. Those who have grandchildren and can 
afford to help them may be thinking more about school clothes and college than 
their grandkids' retirement. But there are pieces of the Merriman master plan 
that anyone can benefit from. Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
 * You can start early and put money away for a long, long time. Take $3,000 
and stash it away for your grandchild's college or house down payment, and he 
can have $15,000 in 18 years or $28,000 in 25 years, at a 9% rate of return. Or 
a $70,000 bonus when he's 35. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can use an annuity to save tax-deferred for your own retirement. 
Merriman recommends those from Scudder, Vanguard and Schwab as low cost, 
well-run annuities. Do this only after you've used up other opportunities for 
tax-deferred retirement savings, like 401(k) plans, IRAs and Keoghs. Let the 
money build until you retire. Then, if you still want to help your 
grandchildren, you can take money out of your annuity without early withdrawal 
penalties and hand it over. 
</P>
<P>
 For college, there's an added bonus to this strategy: Money in your annuity 
will not hurt your grandchild's chance of getting financial aid; you can let 
him obtain as much as he can without your help and then kick in some money. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can set up trusts for as little as $10,000 to funnel money to children, 
grandchildren and charities to great tax advantages. You can set up charitable 
trusts that give the income to you (or your heirs) and the principal to 
charity. Or, you can do it the other way around and let the charity collect 
income for 20 or 50 years and then let your offspring benefit from the lump sum 
that's left. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can, if you want, do Merriman's whole plan. He's selling his trust 
documents for the $10 it costs him to photocopy and mail them. The package 
includes supporting documents and alternative language for those who want their 
grandchildren to get all the money when they turn 65.

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: COWBOY CLASS; CARING FOR HORSES AND PREPARING FOR 
COMPETITIONS IS HARD WORK. BUT TEENS FEEL INTENSELY DEDICATED TO THE ANIMALS 
AND LIFESTYLE THEY LOVE.

<P>
 Home on the range might seem like a novel idea in the land of homogenized 
tract housing, mega-malls and encroaching roadways.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure this is John Wayne territory, but for teens growing up here, "dude" 
belongs to the lexicon shaped by surfers -- the ever-present symbol of youth 
and cool even among the landlocked who bus to the coast every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of high schoolers living in South County, however, traditions of 
the West involve horses, not surfboards. And dudes -- who originally were the 
Eastern city slickers who vacationed at a real ranch -- are right up there with 
the urban cowboy wanna-bes who dress up in crisp duds to do the two-step on the 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to be a beach bum," says Nick Lujan, a senior at San Clemente 
High, a school known for its hard-core surfers. Stocky from years of playing 
football, Nick sports a white straw cowboy hat with a tiny pin of the U.S. flag 
tacked to the side and worn jeans, mirroring the image of the rugged men he 
admired in all those Westerns he watched growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When those line dancers in their nice new Wranglers get all those girls," he 
adds in a kind of easy, drawn-out tone, "it just bugs me because (the girls) 
think they're with a cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy? Nick, 17, like his horse-riding buddies, put their time, energy and 
dreams into keeping alive the tradition of the great American icon. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if Nick was born in Garden Grove and has always lived in O.C.? He's 
learned roping and steer dogging (that's sliding off a horse and wrestling a 
steer to the ground), and he relishes the "adrenaline rush from busting out on 
a horse fast" that doesn't compare with anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 "To be a cowboy, it's not just a name, a word," Nick says. "It's being able to 
work with animals, live off the land and make use of available natural 
resources. It's about respect for horses, adults, for a lot of things and 
passing what you know to another generation." 
</P>
<P>
 His dad grew up around horses, his grandfather has a ranch in Safford, Ariz., 
and someday he hopes to live on the Montana range. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick, who will seek a degree in agricultural business management in college, 
keeps a strawberry roan quarter horse named Estrella at the Ortega Equestrian 
Center in San Juan Capistrano. ("You never see a cowboy riding a llama," he 
jokes.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ortega center, like others in the vicinity, boards horses and gives 
lessons. But it also serves as a second home to dozens of youths who spend 
hours after school and on the weekends engaging in every aspect of equestrian 
life, including the not-so-glamorous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills sophomore Amy Tomlinson squishes a mixture of bran, vitamin 
supplements and water with both hands. She comes to the center almost every day 
to voluntarily care for two horses belonging to boarders -- brushing them, 
ensuring they're clean and healthy and exercising them. She even cleans their 
stables, more for the ritual than anything else, since the center staff takes 
care of such chores. 
</P>
<P>
 For this 15-year-old, the work beats playing with the Barbie action figure 
horse she had as a little girl. Fortunately, San Juan Capistrano, where she 
lives, is "a horse town" making it easier for her to spend time with these 
majestic animals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Horses are just real sweet. I love their overall beauty and companionship," 
says Amy, whose goal is to someday own a horse and be financially able to 
present it at shows around the country. She also wants to be a livestock 
veterinarian. She has a cockatiel and a cocker spaniel at home. 
</P>
<P>
 For years she has competed in Western Pleasure, a category that showcases the 
horse's appearance and grace, as well as the trainer's abilities. Amy's 
bedroom, filled with with all the ribbons, buckles and silver dishes she and 
her horses have won, is a testament to her achievements. But the time invested 
has been more than a matter of landing another silver buckle to wear.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not just waking up every morning and going to school. I know I have the 
ability of taking care of another living being." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Shelton, a junior at Dana Hills High, echoes those sentiments: "It's not 
just do well in school, go to the movies with your friends. This has taught me 
there's something more." She goes into a short discourse on learning about hard 
work, a term many adults don't believe exists in a teen's vocabulary.  
</P>
<P>
 In Kim's case, there's no disputing her meaning: She's turned a "cow horse" 
(one bred to work cattle) into a show horse, and she spends two hours daily 
exercising him. Another hour or two is spent with younger kids at the Ortega 
center, teaching them to ride or tutoring them in their schoolwork at an 
outdoor picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mom had always wanted to ride horses but never had the chance, so when her 
daughter turned 8 and was old enough and big enough to take lessons, Kim was 
placed on her first horse. Eight years later, Kim's parents escort her most 
weekends to competitions throughout the Southwest. Each win in the trail 
category has gotten her closer to the World Championship Horse Show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For others, like Seth "Shorty" Gorham, the ultimate is the Professional Rodeo 
Cowboy Assn. "It's every cowboy's dream, really," says Shorty, 16, who has 
outgrown the moniker but still insists on using it. A San Juan Capistrano High 
sophomore who in June moved south from El Centro to live with his older 
brother, Travis, 20, Shorty comes from a genuine horse family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have rodeo'd since before I was born. It's my life. It's all I 
ever do and want to do. My mom -- she was riding when she was nine months 
pregnant with me." He tells the story like some badge of honor and once again 
adjusts the baseball cap with the Veterinary Pharmaceuticals logo, his father's 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorty and his brother work and live at Rancho Mission Viejo in San Juan 
Capistrano, raising cattle and caring for the horses there. On weekends, 
they're off to Junior Rodeo Assn. competitions, where Shorty enters challenges 
of team roping and steer wrestling. Recently, he has started competing in 
technically daunting bronco riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take a week off," he says. "I can't. You gotta be one with the horse, 
a team. So the practice never ends." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a lonely life being a cowboy," he adds. He counts friends all over 
the rodeo circuit, whom he frequently sees on the weekend jaunts. Among local 
friends is Nick Lujan, whom he hangs out with at the Ortega center. Their 
friendship has inspired Nick to join the California High School Rodeo Assn. in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 As for girls, Shorty and Nick prefer ones who can rope and ride. "There's no 
other girls that are going to understand all the time you put into this," Nick 
says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The personal freedom that accompanies rider and horse appeals to Jeremiah 
Garrison, 15, a San Clemente High student enrolled in home study. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah and his family, who all reside in San Juan Capistrano, first got 
involved in a neighborhood equestrian center a decade ago when they lived in 
Huntington Beach. He and his older sister Heather, now 17, owned and prepped an 
English horse, Duchess, for the Western Pleasure category. Then two years ago, 
Jeremiah wanted more than show, so he started roping. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchess was sold and his sister lost interest, but Jeremiah continues to 
dedicate his time to the three horses his family boards: Chip, a quarter; his 
dad's quarter, Quince, and his mom's Pacifica, Chibasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his parents' urging to return to mainstream school, Jeremiah says he's 
never felt totally comfortable around his peers' close-minded attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer to be around horses and people into (horses). In sixth grade I used 
to get into a lot of fights because of what I was into. I'm sort of my own 
person. In school you can't wear a hat, any hat." Such restrictions bother him 
-- even if he doesn't want to wear a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ortega center, where he figures he spends most of the day, almost every 
day, Jeremiah does his homework outdoors, hangs out with the horses and other 
teen riders and finds solace among the mildly developed hills.  
</P>
<P>
 His parents, he says, "know that since I'm sort of like a cowboy, I'm doing 
something that's good for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The Duke would be proud.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nurse led me through a long, fluorescent-lit hall into an office, where I 
saw my mother in tears and my doctor looking solemnly down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a disease called cancer," my doctor told me. Being only 10 years 
old, I figured they would give me a prescription and maybe a shot. Little did I 
know that months of chemotherapy and radiation, along with years of recovery, 
tests and X-rays, lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks earlier, I had undergone surgery to remove a tumor from my 
tongue. Because the surgery was not intended to remove the cancer, I had to get 
radiation treatment for a month after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The radiation rooms always seemed dreary. The radiologists, in protective, 
layered clothing, led me down endless hallways to the lowest level of the 
hospital, where huge beeping and buzzing machines encircled me. 
</P>
<P>
 Because radiation rays also kill normal cells along with the cancer cells, I 
developed painful sores in my mouth that prevented me from eating. As a result, 
I had tremendous weight loss and developed malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides radiation, I received weekly and daily shots that resulted in severe 
vomiting, weakness, aching joints and hair loss. I would wake up in the 
morning, horrified, staring at my pillow, where hundreds of strands of my hair 
had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 I always knew cancer meant something bad, but I had no idea that it meant pain 
and struggle. Seeing other kids suffering strengthened my will to become 
healthy, and I promised myself it would not take my life. And when it didn't, I 
felt guilty that I still had a chance at living when others would not be given 
this gift. 
</P>
<P>
 After going through this, I realize that life is a precious gift. We should 
appreciate every little thing we are given, because we never know when it can 
all be taken away from us -- or we can be taken away from it.

 Has there ever been a moment in your life when one of the things that you held 
most dear was taken away from you?  
</P>
<P>
 Do you know what it feels like to have your life turned upside-down and 
inside-out all in the space of one heartbeat? Have you ever tried to glue 
together the pieces of your life after it has been torn apart? 
</P>
<P>
 I have, and, believe me, it is not something that I would wish on my worst 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three years of my life at Westminster High School were not my own; 
they were devoted to Coach Gary Dixon and his basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I went to high school, basketball was a game. Once I was in high 
school, basketball became my life -- I ate, drank, slept and dreamed 
basketball. All my friends were basketball players; my girlfriend was even a 
basketball player. It was a rare day when I didn't spend at least three hours 
practicing basketball. To say that basketball was important to me would be like 
saying food was important to me. I lived on it. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I remember my parents telling me that outside it was a nice, bright Wednesday 
morning. But I had no way of knowing for sure. My world was limited to my bed, 
the television and the various medical paraphernalia found in a hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember thinking that it was only Sunday that it had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been playing in a varsity basketball game at a summer weekend tournament 
when I was involved in a collision on the court.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the doctors performed emergency surgery to repair my kidney, which 
had been ruptured in the collision. The doctors assured me that the surgery had 
gone quite well; in two or three months I would be back to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I woke up Wednesday just as I had the day before, in the hospital, its 
unmistakable antiseptic smell threatening to smother me like an invisible, 
tightly wrapped blanket. I tried to think back on the events of the past few 
days, but I couldn't; the days were like years to me. Time is slowed almost to 
a halt in the confines of a hospital. The only thing I knew besides the awful 
smell was that there were tubes coming out of every conceivable part of my 
body. And someday, hopefully, the terrible pain would go away. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor arrived at my room a little later than usual that morning. When he 
came in, I knew something was not right. He asked to speak to my parents for a 
moment, out in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 They were gone only 10 minutes, but it felt like hours to me. The doctor 
finally came back into the room, but my parents did not. The doctor looked 
straight into my eyes and started speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The parts of the conversation that I caught were: " . . . a routine 
pathological report sent . . . we had no way of knowing . . . something very 
unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 I was about to ask him what he was getting at when the hammer fell: "Marc, you 
have cancer. Tomorrow you will have to go back into surgery so that we can 
remove your kidney." My kidney had ruptured during the collision because it had 
been weakened by the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this couldn't he happening to me. Cancer was old people slowly wasting 
away; cancer was someone who smoked or didn't take care of himself; cancer 
wasn't healthy 17-year-olds. But I knew it was true; cancer was in me. Like the 
tolling of a hideous-sounding bell, that word kept echoing through my brain: 
"cancer . . . cancer . . . cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 A flood of emotions poured forth. What was this going to do to my future? My 
doctor told me that varsity basketball was not going to be a part of it. He 
assured me that there were other things in life. He said it would be easier for 
me if I concentrated on other things that were important. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing else was important. At least, I didn't think so at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time my teammates came to visit me, all I could think of was how I would 
never be out on the court with them again. Then I realized something. My 
teammates didn't keep coming to see me because I was some guy that had run 
around on the court with them for three years. Coach Dixon didn't sit and watch 
sports with me because I had scored a lot of points for him. I hadn't. I had 
people in my life that cared for me. I had never really thought about it 
before, but when I did, the pain went away. 
</P>
<P>
 The frequency of my therapy, a 72-hour intravenous treatment to jack up my 
immune system, has been reduced to once a month. I'm on the mend, and a recent 
CAT scan showed no new tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 My doctor has just given me the OK to suit up for basketball again. I went to 
practice for the first time two weeks ago. It's hard because I don't have the 
strength or stamina. I don't know if I'll ever play in a game again, but I'm 
giving it a try for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding out that I had cancer was the worst and the best thing in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst because it ended my short-lived basketball career, and it 
made me realize that everyone dies, even healthy 17-year-olds. It was the best 
moment because I had never realized how many people I had in my life who love 
and care for me. And no matter what I wanted to do, they would never let me 
give up.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; MY TURN; THERE'S NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT 
UNIFORM APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

in Newport Beach, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, 
the Beacon.

<P>
 Why not wear uniforms to school, I say. To start with, just think how much 
money we'd save. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people spend at least $600 a year on clothes. If we got uniforms, they 
would cost about $200. Of course, we'd still have to spend about $500 on 
clothes to wear after school and on the weekends. With limited wardrobe choices 
for school, our uniforms would wear out quickly, and we'd have to buy some 
replacement items -- for an additional $100. That $800 is a great deal compared 
to the $600 we spend now. 
</P>
<P>
 And uniforms would eliminate gangs and cliques. I mean, no one chooses friends 
on their looks or attitude or interests or (gasp!) even their personality. 
</P>
<P>
 If we all dressed alike, we'd all be one, big, happy family. We couldn't start 
a purple hair-clip gang or a ponytail gang; too many other people already wear 
those items. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, we'd be more focused on learning. If we don't have to worry about 
judging everyone else's clothes, we could spend our energy on our books. Of 
course, we wouldn't ever look at anybody's hair or anything. And who cares that 
these uniforms would probably be uncomfortable -- it would wake us up and make 
us focus that much better. 
</P>
<P>
 And we'd be so much better behaved. If everyone dressed the same and thought 
the same and acted the same, we'd have no problems at school. Everyone would 
even agree on what kind of music to play at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would beat up anybody because there would be no disagreements. And, 
guess what? We'd never have to do schoolwork or actually learn anything -- 
there wouldn't be enough time in the school day. Our teachers would be too busy 
making sure our shoes were shined and our buttons straight. As a result, 
teachers would never notice a little smoking or drinking or a couple of playful 
gunfights. (They might notice if someone started bleeding -- the student would 
be given a referral for dirtying his uniform.) 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom discussions would be shortened, too, because opposing viewpoints 
would not exist. And when we grow up, we'd still all think the same. We won't 
have to have elections -- we'll all support the same measures and the same 
candidates. We won't even have political parties. We'll all be perfect little 
clones of the ideal citizen -- unthinking, unfeeling, uncaring. 
</P>
<P>
 See? Uniforms benefit us all.

COUNTY TO FIGHT SALE OF $9 BILLION IN COLLATERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATT; MATT LAIT, TAMAKI, ; JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County plotted a legal fight Thursday against Wall Street firms that 
have unloaded nearly $9 billion in bonds being held as collateral for loans to 
the county, as officials named a former state treasurer to advise the county on 
navigating its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the bond selloff touched off a new round of fears that the county's 
financial situation was more dire than suspected, and that losses in its 
investment pool -- which the county already has said was down $1.5 billion -- 
may have deepened. 
</P>
<P>
 If the securities sales are upheld in federal court, the impact could be 
devastating to the more than 180 cities, school districts and other agencies 
that have invested about $7.5 billion in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a lot of hysteria on Wall Street," said county Supervisor 
William G. Steiner. "We're taking actions to address that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after several days of seeming paralysis over the financial crisis that 
forced the county into Bankruptcy Court this week, local government leaders 
went on the offensive Thursday. The county: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorized its counsel to file a federal lawsuit against several brokerage 
firms that this week sold securities they held as collateral for loans to the 
county -- many of which were dumped on the financial markets Thursday. No suit 
was filed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * Named former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes as the county's financial 
adviser. Hayes served as Gov. Pete Wilson's finance director for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imposed a hiring and salary freeze on county workers and at least 
temporarily stopped paying county vendors. Many of those who are not being paid 
were furious over the latest developments. "If you are expecting a payment, 
checks are not being released today," county workers recited to vendors from a 
prepared script.  
</P>
<P>
 * Set up a separate, low-risk fund for all the property tax money that 
landowners must pay by Monday. Those billions of dollars are expected to keep 
the county and its investors afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sent Chief Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider to calm fears at a 
closed-door meeting of city managers and finance directors from across the 
county. Schneider was unable to say whether cities will get their money from 
the county's investment pool, which has plunged at least 20% in value since 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them it was too early to make a decision," Schneider said after the 
meeting, walking quickly toward his car. "We will involve them in the 
decision-making process. We are all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, The Times learned that the county's auditor warned top officials 
last year that then-Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron was making "risky 
and unusual transactions" in violation of safeguards designed to keep his 
investments safe. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county sought to halt the financial spiral, the governor made his first 
significant public comments about Orange County's bankruptcy. In Sacramento, 
Wilson said he is sympathetic to Orange County -- but does not expect the state 
to provide any monetary relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is eager to be helpful," Wilson said. "But we are not in a position 
where we can bail out bad judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 Without state help, county officials turned to Washington, D.C., on Thursday, 
asking U.S. transportation authorities to advance some of next year's federal 
highway funds for use right away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, attorneys filed class-action lawsuits Thursday on behalf of 
bondholders, alleging that the county falsely represented its investment 
strategies. Named as defendants were Citron, other county officials and Merrill 
Lynch, which holds $2 billion of the county's securities as collateral for 
loans that allowed Citron to boost his ill-considered bets in the financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corporations announced that it will investigate the 
relationship between Merrill Lynch and the county treasurer's office and review 
the events leading up to the county's bankruptcy filing for possible violations 
of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, which first visited the county 
treasurer's office in February to examine the portfolio, is trying to determine 
whether there were possible misrepresentations connected with the investment 
fund, according to sources familiar with the SEC inquiry. The Orange County 
district attorney's office is also reviewing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner, who advises the 
county grand jury, said that the panel contacted him this week, after the 
bankruptcy was filed, to "explore their options" in a possible investigation of 
the county's financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, school district superintendents and finance officials met in 
secret to plot strategy for the first time since the financial crisis began and 
were briefed by legal experts on bankruptcy and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was just one of a stream of closed-door sessions held this week by 
the host of government officials who have been grappling with the nation's 
largest municipal financial disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said they are exempt from the state's open government meetings 
law because the sessions are held to discuss pending litigation. But one 
attorney erupted at the County Board of Supervisors' now-daily session, chiding 
members for conducting business behind closed doors and urging all five to 
resign immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later, you're going to have to come out here and face the people 
and admit your lack of leadership in this matter," said Stephen Johnson, 48, as 
the board convened early Thursday only to immediately adjourn to another closed 
session. "You can't keep going back in that room and hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors had spent the day wrestling with the swift succession of 
brokerages that followed the lead of CS First Boston, which Tuesday sold into 
the market $2.6 billion in U.S. government agency bonds it held as collateral 
for loans to the county fund. The sale followed the county's failure to make 
$1.2 billion in loan payments that had come due. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, seven Wall Street firms this week have liquidated nearly $9 billion 
of the $12.5 billion in bonds the county had purchased on credit, hoping to 
boost its interest income. The sales of collateral came after the county failed 
to make payments due on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
 With each collateral sale, the brokerages are believed to have covered their 
loans -- but in the process they may have eaten deeply into the $7.5 billion 
that government agencies invested in the Orange County pool. That is because 
the bonds originally pledged as collateral on the loans have tumbled in value 
this year, meaning that the brokerages needed to sell more of them to cover 
their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials who last week said the pool's value had declined $1.5 billion 
since Jan. 1 refused Thursday to put a value on the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 First Boston's action prompted the county to seek federal and state bailouts 
before reluctantly settling Tuesday on filing for protection under Chapter 9 of 
the federal Bankruptcy Code. Such a filing is so rare that fewer than 10 
cities, villages or counties sought such protection between 1980 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also defaulted Thursday on a $110-million pension fund bond that 
came due. The bonds were sold by First Boston in September and included a 
special provision that allowed investors to demand their money back with only 
seven days notice. That demand came last Thursday, when the first signs of 
Orange County's impending financial failure were announced. County spokeswoman 
Sandra Sternberg said the effect of the default on county pension funds was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The collateral sales will provide a crucible for testing how Chapter 9 works. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the county and the Wall Street firms staked out contradictory 
positions on whether the brokerage houses were allowed to sell the securities 
they were holding as collateral on Orange County's loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerages declined to discuss their legal positions beyond saying that 
they believe they are within their rights in selling the collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's $375-an-hour bankruptcy attorney, also would not 
provide specifics, saying only that he believes many of the county's 
investments are sheltered under Chapter 9's provisions for an automatic stay of 
such sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Ray, chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s business bankruptcy committee, 
said Chapter 9 lacks a specific exemption from the stay for complex 
transactions -- known as reverse repurchase agreements -- which were prevalent 
in the county portfolio. But he said that may be an oversight, and that such 
transactions probably are allowed under Chapter 9. 
</P>
<P>
 In the municipal bond market, Wall Street traders said the prices of Orange 
County bonds improved sharply Thursday from Wednesday, when a few bidders were 
offering 50 to 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said bids on Orange County and related bonds were in the range of 80 
to 85 cents on the dollar, though they said few bond owners were selling at 
those prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some traders said San Diego County bonds dove in price Thursday as 
worries mounted about the health of that county's investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California municipal bond fund share prices, reflecting portfolios 
that include all types of California bonds, fell for a second day Thursday, but 
by minor amounts compared to Wednesday's sharp losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The elements of the county's repair plan were announced throughout the day 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, the former state treasurer, would oversee the restructuring of the 
investment portfolio for the next 90 days. The county also said that it had 
dismissed New York-based Capital Market Risk Advisors and hired Salomon Bros., 
a leading New York investment bank, as its new financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes will report directly to the board. At the briefing, he said he was 
"strongly urged by Gov. Wilson" to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fortunate to have a person of Tom Hayes' reputation, and a firm of 
Salomon Bros.' experience, to steer us through this current financial situation 
and help set the course for the county's return to financial stability," Board 
of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said this is the worst crisis he has seen during two decades in public 
service, adding that Thursday's actions by the Wall Street banks to cash in 
collateral would make "it more difficult to maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do the best we can with what's left and try to preserve as 
much capital as we can," he said. "I would have preferred that they had not 
done that. But they have done that, and now it's a case for the courts to 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes confirmed that at least two investment banks had made collateral calls 
Thursday, but neither he nor any other county official would disclose how much 
the county fund has lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the degree that there is a loss, there's going to be financial pain," 
Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's ongoing cash flow -- including payroll and disbursements to pay 
vendors for service -- will go through the treasurer's office. Hayes said he 
will handle only oversight and restructuring of the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it is solvable inside of a year," Hayes said of the largest 
municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. By the end of his 90-day term, he added, 
"hopefully, we'll have our arms around it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was little comfort to small vendors such as Sandy Schroeder, who 
learned Thursday that the county would not be paying them anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They owe us $4,010.13!" said Schroeder, co-owner of Datron Peripherals, a 
three-person company in Fountain Valley that supplies computer accessories to 
John Wayne Airport and the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm not going to do anymore business with them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, the League of United Latin American Citizens wrote to U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, asking her to convene a federal grand jury for a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no effective local means to analyze practices of our own county 
money-changers," said the letter, which was signed by the group's state 
director of urban affairs, Art Montez. "We have been signaling our grave 
concern about the bent political and economic power structure in Orange County 
for years."

COUNTY WAS TOLD IN '93 OF TREASURER'S RISKY STRATEGIES; CRISIS: AUDIT ALSO SAID 
CITRON AVOIDED OVERSIGHT OF HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS. THREE SUPERVISORS, 
EX-OFFICIAL DON'T RECALL SEEING REPORT. 
</P>

<P>
 More than a year before Orange County's bankruptcy debacle, the county's 
auditor warned supervisors and the district attorney that Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron was running his office without adequate controls and 
violated government codes to maximize returns with public money.  
</P>
<P>
 Obtained Thursday by The Times, the internal audit said Citron was making 
"risky and unusual transactions" behind the backs of the investment committee 
charged with advising him on the operations of the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool's losses prompted Orange County this week to file for bankruptcy 
protection in the biggest municipal finance debacle in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- which covered the treasurer's operations in 1991 but was only 
sent to the Board of Supervisors and Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi in August of 
last year -- warned that the county might be liable for some of Citron's 
financial maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the troubles highlighted in the audit were not the ones that 
precipitated the county's financial collapse this week, they were early 
warnings that Citron engaged in high-risk investments, avoided oversight of his 
financial dealings, and was not above bending the law to improve earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The county auditors said Citron made questionable transactions totaling more 
than $50 million "at the request of the (Wall Street) broker, Merrill Lynch, to 
help the brokermeet financial statement ratios required by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached for comment Thursday, Citron said he did not remember the audit. 
However, he emphatically denied that any transactions were made for the benefit 
of a brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," he said. Merrill Lynch officials could not be reached for 
comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of five county supervisors contacted Thursday about the audit said they 
could not remember ever receiving it, nor were they aware of the criticisms 
contained in it. The other supervisors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit said Citron -- contrary to legal requirements -- invested in 
below-investment-grade notes and in troubled banks, one of which went bankrupt 
the year of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's Aug. 23, 1993, response to the audit offered a rare glimpse into how 
the maverick treasurer -- until recently respected nationwide for his 
cutting-edge investment strategies -- viewed his role and the nature of his 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the Board of Supervisors, Citron brushed aside suggestions 
that his office institute a chain of command that would provide some oversight 
and accountability for the investments that he was making. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he managed his "fiduciary responsibilities" based on "his own 
personality and abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the current management style, although not the norm for county 
government, is the best one for the treasurer-tax collector," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not dispute bending government codes to fit his investment needs, but 
noted that investing is "an inexact art." What may be "risky" strategy for 
some, he said, was "prudent" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe none of the transactions to be risky or unusual," Citron said. "We 
are not as conservative in our investment strategies as some of our 
contemporaries and because of that some transactions that are usual for us may 
in fact be unusual for others." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview Thursday, Citron said he also did not recall his written 
response to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit was conducted by the office of Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis 
sometime in 1992. The office discussed the findings with Citron in July, 1993, 
and transmitted the report to other county officials the next month, after 
Citron made his response. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis attributed the delays to staffing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to lack of staffing in the office, we weren't able to complete the audit 
and issue it," Lewis said Thursday. Staff was "moved off of those jobs, and you 
have to put new staff on it, and you're operating five auditors short." 
</P>
<P>
 John Conley, a top assistant to Capizzi, said he was not sure that the 
district attorney ever received the report. "Even at this point, we're not sure 
there have been any criminal violations" in connection with the investment 
pool's operations, he said, noting that some violations of the government code 
call for civil, rather than criminal, remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 A shocked Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was more emphatic about never seeing the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "My god! Was it addressed to the Board of Supervisors?" Stanton asked. "We 
didn't have it, we don't have it, we have never seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't throw things like this away," Stanton said. "The simple fact of the 
matter is that if it was distributed like that, why didn't somebody say, 'Hey, 
did you see that?' I'm just baffled. It was not in the office, and didn't come 
to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he could not understand why the auditor delayed circulating the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got damaging information about the treasurer, why would you wait 
nearly two years before releasing it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said he did not remember receiving the report nor 
had he heard of any trouble with the fund until "several weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder also said that she does not recall ever seeing 
the audit report. When told of the auditor's findings she said: "What? You're 
kidding. I'm sitting here with my mouth open. I'm absolutely shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, said that she was upset that the report, which was conducted in 
December, 1991, was not released until August, 1993. Wieder said she did not 
accept Lewis' explanation that his office was understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the weakest excuse I've ever heard," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said he had only heard rumors 
about the audit. "I haven't seen it," he said late Thursday. "I'm sure I will 
see it sometime soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' office was in the process of drafting a follow-up report gauging 
Citron's progress on the 1993 recommendations when the county filed for 
bankruptcy, said John Nakane, chief of internal audits. He said the report will 
be completed and should be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to comment Thursday on the contents of the 1993 report, but 
said his department performed several internal audits of Citron's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stop the bleeding now," he said. "What happened in the past 
will come out a little later down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakane, who oversaw the audit, said Thursday he doubts that more regular 
audits could have prevented the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job wasn't to review the portfolio per se. We looked at internal 
controls," he said. "Bob invested the money. I don't think our work could have 
averted (the losses)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakane said that while the audit is "critical of certain things that (Citron) 
did," it did not reflect extreme concern at the time on the part of the auditor 
controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaye Mirabelli, president of the state Municipal Treasurers Assn. and 
treasurer of the city of Ventura, said the criticisms contained in the audit 
"aren't things that I've ever found in our audit. . . . I don't remember 
anything like that, especially in regards to the language." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal audit was the second to be conducted in the past decade. A 1986 
audit also criticized Citron's autocratic investment system, which, it noted, 
was "designed and carried out only by the department head" -- Citron himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 report repeated the criticism, saying Citron "made all day-to-day 
investment decisions and also executed the transactions without anyone else 
involved to provide segregation of duties or oversight." Until this year, the 
investment fund -- which holds funds from more than 180 cities, school 
districts and agencies, in addition to the county's own funds -- sharply 
outperformed similar pools operated for local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal investment committee was formed to provide "input on investment 
strategy and types of investments" being considered. But when Citron "deviated 
from guidelines established by government code or the investment committee, he 
did so without consulting anyone in the treasurer's office or on the 
committee," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was found that Citron had violated government codes in making 
investments, he told auditors that "the instances were conscious decisions made 
to maximize returns," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit, Citron violated government codes by: 
</P>
<P>
 * Holding $125 million in medium-term notes rated BB-/BB when law requires 
that such notes be rated A or better. BB- bonds are considered predominantly 
speculative, according to the Standard & Poor's rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Invested $80 million in Baa1-rated medium-term notes issued by a Dutch 
corporation, when law only allows investment in such notes if rated A or better 
and issued by a U.S. corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-invested surplus money -- as much as 44.6% -- in medium-term notes, 
when law allows that only 30% of surplus money be invested that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-invested surplus money in negotiable certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit report, Citron invested $75 million in a negotiable 
certificate of deposit from Columbia Savings & Loan, which went bankrupt in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While not in violation of law, the report said that investment could have 
resulted in significant losses of public funds, and it chided Citron for not 
explaining it to the internal investment committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabelli said the rating of medium-term notes can change over time and may be 
different at the time of an audit than when the notes were purchased. But she 
said she would never purchase notes rated lower than A, because it is "not in 
compliance with our investment policy or government codes." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the report's more incendiary findings, auditors said they had 
discovered that several transactions were made solely to benefit Merrill Lynch, 
a favored brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $50 million that changed hands between June and July of 1991 so 
the giant Wall Street firm could meet required SEC financial statement ratios, 
the report refers to a December, 1991, letter to Citron that detailed similar 
transactions in December, 1990, and January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter recommended that Citron ask the county counsel to investigate 
"possible liability . . . in which such transactions could result." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor recommended that Citron "decentralize" investing and establish a 
chain of command "that helps to promote adequate review of decisions." It also 
urged that Citron run his "risky" or "unusual" transactions by the investment 
committee and adhere to government regulations in his investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said Thursday his office was sufficiently concerned about potential 
problems with the county's now-bankrupt investment pool that officials also 
twice made "special requests" that outside auditors take a closer look at the 
portfolio.  
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he made the "special request" of KPMG Peat Marwick last year and 
again this year. This year's external audit -- which had been due to be 
released late this month -- may not be completed because of the county crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't contract with them to look at a detailed analysis of the portfolio. 
On the other hand, because there had been concerns, you just say, 'Look at this 
particular area.' Then they spend a couple of extra hours on it," he said. "For 
the last two audits, that has been a special request," Lewis said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; LEGAL EXPERTS FORESEE EPIC BATTLE WITH WALL STREET; FINANCE: 
LOSSES FROM SALE OF COLLATERAL COULD BE DEVASTATING. BROKERAGES INSIST THEY 
WERE WITHIN RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wall Street's rush to cash in $9 billion worth of collateral on loans to 
tapped-out Orange County has set up an unprecedented battle between one of the 
nation's most affluent counties and some of the most powerful brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say the clash over the sales -- and the county's bankruptcy 
filing itself -- make for a legal tangle that may take years to unwind. Adding 
to the difficulty is the lack of legal precedent, since there has never been a 
municipal bankruptcy this large or complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be without a doubt an epic case in the history of insolvencies," 
declared Hugh Ray, a Houston lawyer who chairs the American Bar Assn.'s 
business bankruptcy committee. "There are kids running around in Orange County 
in junior high today who will be joining this case once they get through law 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street is worried that it will be painted as a villain because of the 
collateral sales. But the brokerages maintain that they are within their legal 
rights and that, far from kicking the county when it's down, they did their 
best to forestall the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, nobody's a bad guy here," one brokerage official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In three days, with surprising ease, seven big brokerages unloaded nearly $9 
billion worth of U.S. government agency bonds that the county had pledged as 
collateral under the complex financial transactions -- known as reverse 
repurchase agreements -- it was using for short-term borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only holdout in the selling spree is Merrill Lynch, which holds $2 billion 
of Orange County collateral and repeated Thursday that it has no intention of 
selling. Merrill Lynch, whose central role as a financier to the county's 
investment fund is coming under close scrutiny, may be trying to salvage its 
public position by giving the county some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The total worth of the fund reached about $20 billion at its zenith: $7.5 
billion in money from 180 municipalities and $12.5 billion in borrowings from 
Wall Street brokerages.  
</P>
<P>
 As has become dismally clear in the last week, former Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron was using the loans to buy other bonds -- including risky and 
devilishly complex derivatives -- in an effort to boost returns on the county's 
investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive strategy blew up as interest rates turned against the county, 
producing losses -- on paper -- that the county put at $1.5 billion as of last 
week. But that figure now appears suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 Traders and other Wall Street sources say that the brokerages have been 
pressing for and receiving more collateral in recent months as interest rates 
rose and the bonds declined in value. As more collateral was turned over, it 
effectively eroded the $7.5 billion in principal invested by the 
municipalities. That erosion turned into real losses when the collateral was 
sold, but the county Thursday refused to provide a new estimate of total 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fund's position deteriorated, "we tried to get (county finance 
officials) to deal with the issue," said an official of a major brokerage who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. "We worked with them and worked with them, and 
one day, they didn't return our phone calls. Next thing you know, they filed 
for bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's filing Tuesday night under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
was precipitated by CS First Boston's sale earlier that day of $2.6 billion of 
the county's collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 According to traders and brokerage officials, the other brokerages that sold 
collateral Wednesday and Thursday, and the amounts involved, are as follows: 
Morgan Stanley, $1.6 billion; Kidder Peabody, $1 billion; Prudential 
Securities, $900 million to $1 billion; Nomura Securities, $900 million; Smith 
Barney, $800 million, and PaineWebber, $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 contains an "automatic stay" that forbids creditors from enforcing 
their claims against a municipality under bankruptcy protection. The county 
believes that provision should have put a freeze on the collateral and 
prevented the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Thursday authorized its lawyers to sue brokerage houses that it 
believes violated the stay, but experts say Wall Street has some legal weight 
on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, after several government securities trading firms 
defaulted on repurchase agreements and went bankrupt, the Federal Reserve 
joined the securities industry in pressing Congress to make sure that the 
collateral involved in such transactions would not get frozen in bankruptcies. 
The rationale was that "repos" are part of the grease that keeps the financial 
markets running and they need to be kept risk-free or brokerages will shy away 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, the Houston attorney, says that Chapter 9 contains language that appears 
to exempt repurchase agreements from the stay. And Congress in 1984 
emphatically exempted repos from the automatic stay in Chapter 11, which deals 
with corporate bankruptcies. Why didn't Congress include that more specific 
exemption in Chapter 9? 
</P>
<P>
 It was an oversight, Ray said, which probably occurred because "nobody ever 
contemplated that a municipality would be involved in the banking and brokerage 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Which raises another question: Will the Orange County investment fund -- which 
filed under Chapter 9 separately from the county itself -- be able to qualify 
as a municipality? Ray doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Katz, a Santa Monica attorney and former chief judge of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California, said: "The magnitude 
of the Orange County case is just incredible." Previous Chapter 9 filings have 
generally involved small towns, water districts and other special-purpose 
municipalities that ran into hard times or got hit with huge liability 
judgments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, there are few precedents for some of the issues raised in the 
Orange County case. "Any time the law is unsettled, the judge has more 
flexibility to fashion his own remedies," Katz added. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerages Thursday generally declined to discuss their legal positions 
other than to reiterate that they think the sales were exempt from the stay. 
</P>
<P>
 As brokerages put the billions of dollars in collateral bonds on the market 
Thursday, traders said the securities were sold with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the glut of bonds sold in the two- to five-year maturity range, 
the brokerages offered enticing yields on many of the securities to assure that 
there would be takers, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the bonds, U.S. government agency securities, were sold at yields that 
were 0.15 to 0.20 percentage points higher than they would have been early in 
the week, said portfolio managers who looked at the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kennedy, manager of the SteinRoe Government Income bond fund in 
Chicago, said he bought some of the collateral bonds as brokerages put them on 
the market. The securities he bought mature in 3 1/2 years and yield 8.2% 
annualized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're (brokerages) sort of pricing them on a worst-case basis" to assure 
that the securities are sold, Kennedy said. While good for the market, he said, 
"That's not good for the county," which effectively loses as the securities are 
marked down further in price to boost their yields. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) How Wall Street Took Control 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an explanation of the process by which major Wall Street brokerages 
lent money to Orange County's investment fund, and how those firms this week 
have called in those loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage firm Z lends the county $1 billion in cash, and takes $1 billion in 
government securities owned by the county as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates rise and the value of the bonds declines in the market, the 
brokerage demands that the county put up additional bonds to guarantee the 
loan. This is a "collateral call." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, in the wake of the county's bankruptcy and its failure to make 
regular loan payments, the brokerage exercises its right to seize the 
government securities it holds as collateral, and sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the securities held are worth the full $1 billion amount of the loan when 
sold, the brokerage doesn't experience a loss. If the securities are worth less 
than $1 billion when sold, the brokerage must accept the loss -- and become a 
general creditor of the county fund to recover the rest owed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county, the collateral calls by brokerages in recent months mean that 
the county's fund has been drawn down by an as yet undisclosed amount from the 
$7.5 billion the original investors put in -- resulting in a loss to those 
investors. Wall Street's Exposure

CLINTON OFFERS TROOPS FOR BOSNIA PULLOUT; BALKANS: UP TO 20,000 U.S. SOLDIERS 
COULD ASSIST IF PEACEKEEPERS EVACUATE. PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO CONSULT CONGRESS 
BEFORE DEPLOYING FORCES TO NATION FOR FIRST TIME. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton formally offered Thursday to send up to 20,000 U.S. ground 
troops to help evacuate the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina if 
the allies decide to withdraw in the face of increased harassment and 
hostage-taking by nationalist Serbian forces there. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the United States would probably supply between 40% 
and 50% of an allied evacuation force of up to 45,000 troops. The U.S. military 
is also likely to provide the bulk of the air- and sea-lift for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission would mark the first time the United States has sent ground troops 
to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials emphasized that the President's decision involved only a 
commitment "in principle," and they said the Administration would insist on 
approving any evacuation plan in advance and consulting with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation would be conducted by the 16-country North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and almost certainly would be under the command of an American 
general or admiral. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said the United States would contribute "a substantial 
part" of the total NATO force -- which he said could involve up to nine 
brigades, complete with tanks and heavy weapons. But he said no firm decisions 
had been made on how many troops may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some of those familiar with the operation said an estimate of between 
15,000 and 20,000 U.S. troops would be "a good working number" for such a 
venture. While some would come from U.S. bases in Europe, most would be from 
bases within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials stressed that the allies have not yet decided to 
withdraw any peacekeeping troops, NATO strategists are in the early stages of 
drafting military plans for the evacuation. They are working on an array of 
contingency proposals, from a simple loading operation involving fewer troops 
to a full-scale extraction under heavy fire. Allied defense ministers will meet 
to review the plans next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton's announcement was designed to reassure France, Britain 
and other U.S. allies that the United States will help evacuate their troops, 
despite the recent controversy here over the use of American forces in 
peacekeeping-related missions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials delivered a similar message to the allies privately last week 
but apparently failed to quell some doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy-makers hope that "clearing up any ambiguity" publicly will help heal 
the rift in NATO and persuade some member countries to leave their troops there 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Republicans appeared ready to accept the notion of U.S. 
participation in such an evacuation, but they served notice that they would 
insist that Clinton seek formal authorization from Congress before actually 
committing U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) also noted pointedly that 
withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers would clear the way for lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims and carrying out more aggressive NATO air 
strikes, which GOP senators have endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had advocated both policies over the months, but was unable 
to put them into effect because Europeans feared their peacekeeping troops 
would then become targets of stepped-up retaliation by the Serbian 
nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a senior U.S. official hinted Thursday that the Administration may 
resume pressing the allies to lift the embargo and to intensify NATO air 
strikes against the Serbian nationalists if the U.N. peacekeeping troops are 
forced to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), outgoing chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was disturbed that Clinton had made 
the troop offer. Pell said he is opposed to any use of U.S. ground troops in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from the United States' NATO allies was muted. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain welcomed Clinton's offer but emphasized that a pullout of U.N. 
peacekeeping forces still was not imminent. French officials did not comment on 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said his country's 
peacekeeping troops will remain in Bosnia at least until their current U.N. 
mandate expires in March, despite the increasing harassment they are suffering 
at the hands of nationalist Serbs. He rejected calls to withdraw them more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now about 24,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, mostly French, 
British, Jordanian and Pakistani. Outside analysts have estimated that 
evacuating the peacekeepers and several thousand U.N. civilian personnel would 
take between 20,000 and 45,000 NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also said the evacuation could take anywhere from several weeks to 
several months, depending on how vigorously Serbian nationalist -- and possibly 
even Bosnian Muslim -- forces try to impede the withdrawal. The allies have 
8,000 vehicles in Bosnia and many tons of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Pentagon official said preliminary discussions with both factions had 
indicated that neither side would try to harass or block an evacuation effort 
if the U.N. force decides to withdraw, but he conceded that that could change 
once an operation got under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for possible evacuation are expected to be a major topic next week, when 
NATO defense ministers, including U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, meet 
in Brussels to discuss the situation in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Perry and British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind will 
host a breakfast Wednesday for defense ministers of countries that have troops 
on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia to review the NATO plans and sound them out on 
such an operation. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the ministers are also expected to discuss what policies should be 
pursued after any withdrawal, which presumably will include the questions of 
whether to lift the arms embargo against the Muslims and possibly to step up 
military action against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will . . . certainly be discussing this with a view toward finding a 
common position," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration has pledged before that it will not send ground 
troops to Bosnia for ordinary peacekeeping duty, it has consistently said it 
will deploy American forces both to help enforce any firm peace accord or to 
evacuate U.N. troops in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication how the Serbian nationalists in Bosnia would 
react to the President's announcement. Analysts said the rebels' reaction is 
likely to be heavily influenced by what role they expect the United States to 
play next. 
</P>
<P>
 If they fear that the evacuation of U.N. troops will lead to a lifting of the 
arms embargo, they might attack U.S. forces with a vengeance. Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic has repeatedly boasted that American troops would be 
sent home in body bags if they intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deliberate humiliation of U.N. troops in recent weeks suggests that 
the Serbs have calculated that they could conquer what is left of Bosnia once 
the U.N. forces are out and before the Muslim-backed government could obtain 
enough arms to launch a successful counteroffensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation effort could also be impeded by Bosnian Muslims, particularly 
if they fear they would be overrun by the Serbs. At the same time, if the 
Muslims believe the arms embargo will be lifted, they may help the United 
Nations.

GINGRICH BACKS DENIAL OF MEDICARE TO WEALTHY; ENTITLEMENTS: HE ALSO SAYS 
CONGRESS MUST EVENTUALLY 'LOOK AT' WAYS TO KEEP SOCIAL SECURITY FROM GOING 
BROKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging the need to curb the growth of entitlement programs, incoming 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Thursday that wealthy retirees should 
buy their own health insurance and that Congress eventually must "look at" 
long-term and perhaps painful ways to keep Social Security solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying Medicare to retirees with annual incomes of more than $100,000 would 
save the government about $6 billion in five years, Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a breakfast interview with reporters, he also expressed regret over 
having suggested that as many as one in four White House staffers had used 
drugs before joining the Clinton Administration and over having called 
President and Mrs. Clinton one-time members of the "counterculture." 
</P>
<P>
 The outspoken Georgia Republican said he stands by his remarks, but added that 
he should have kept them to himself. "If I had to say it over again, I probably 
wouldn't say it," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't delight in controversy. I like achievement," he added, saying that 
his remarks were routine bumps that one faces during any job change. "I'm 
trying to learn a new job," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he not made those remarks, Gingrich acknowledged, "the country might well 
have been better off for it." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments about Social Security and Medicare, the tax-financed health 
insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, are significant because 
Republican leaders in recent years have flatly declared Social Security 
untouchable and past efforts to restrain Medicare spending have proved 
politically lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's remarks come as a bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform and 
Tax Reform is completing a report for Clinton next week -- thus ensuring the 
issue even greater visibility in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget experts say Congress will never eliminate the federal deficit unless it 
curbs spending on the big entitlement programs that provide guaranteed 
government benefits to millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich prefaced his suggestion that Congress cannot avoid taking up the 
Social Security funding issue by saying that the retirement program must remain 
undisturbed for the foreseeable future, calling the solvency question "a 
problem . . . somewhere around 25 to 30 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he added, "the problem of children dying in dumpsters is 
this evening. The problem of schools that fail to educate is this afternoon. 
The problem of rethinking the cost of Medicaid is this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Before tackling Social Security, Gingrich argued, Washington must "earn the 
trust of the American people" by solving more pressing social and economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then, he said, the public must be fully engaged during a search for 
remedies. Among those already mentioned by the entitlement commission staff are 
raising taxes and elevating the age for Social Security eligibility to 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked a lot about the need to have dialogue on the budget where the 
American people get to learn all the data, in general terms, and the American 
people get to participate in the decisions," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of things that you have to look at over the long 
run," he said. "But I would also assert that in the short run . . . you have to 
take Social Security off the table and deal with everything else. And when you 
finish dealing with everything else, and you've done it right, you will have 
earned the trust of the American people to look at Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Social Security is in surplus now, projections are that it will run 
out of cash in the year 2029. Similarly, Medicare's hospital trust fund will go 
broke in 2001 under current spending rates. Gingrich did not say how soon 
Congress should act on the Medicare shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform commission, chaired by Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and John C. 
Danforth (R-Mo.), is to deliver a report to Clinton by Thursday on controlling 
entitlement programs, which account for 47% of the budget but threaten to 
consume nearly all federal spending by the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues Thursday, Gingrich sounded both conciliatory and combative, 
particularly in discussing the prospects of working with a Democratic President 
and a Senate that, while dominated by Republicans, has rules that would enable 
Democrats to derail GOP initiatives -- much as the Republicans did this year 
while in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the GOP intention to grant Clinton the line-item veto as "a sign of 
reaching beyond normal partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no (public) tolerance for confrontation which is purely partisan or 
purely personality," he added. "I don't think we should ever pick a fight with 
the President of the United States if it's avoidable. And I don't think we 
should ever shrink from a fight if it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Senate, Gingrich said that he does not believe Democrats will 
resort to parliamentary tactics to stymie the GOP agenda. That, he said, would 
be "fairly irrational" behavior given the drubbing the Democrats took at the 
polls last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people are tired of gridlock . . . tired of a decentralized, 
diffused system that can't make any decision and where every small baron has 
enough influence that they can say no but nobody has enough influence to say 
yes," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what they don't want is a bunch of very well-meaning and sincere 
people who can't even call a huddle." 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS GOT GIFTS FROM BOND FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Orange County's financial floor began to crumble this week, the CS First 
Boston investment house quickly abandoned the county, seizing $2 billion in 
bond collateral and prompting officials to declare bankruptcy just hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship was not always so acrimonious: For years, First Boston, 
Merrill Lynch and a few other Wall Street powerhouses doled out thousands of 
dollars each year in dinners, trips, honorariums and contributions to Orange 
County's political elite, cementing their status as friends of the people who 
control billions of dollars in government funds, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulova clocks, Lakers tickets, Christmas salmon, sterling silver belt buckles 
-- all have been given to Orange County elected officials and staff by the 
underwriters, advisers and corporate executives who vie for a piece of the 
county's lucrative bond business. 
</P>
<P>
 These are small-ticket items in a world where an underwriter's commission on a 
lucrative bond issue can soar into six figures, but politicians have savored 
them nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The largess was legal under rules that governed gift-giving to county 
officials until 1993, when a virtual ban was enacted after the 
conflict-of-interest conviction of former Supervisor Don R. Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the records show that former Treasurer Robert L. Citron continued to 
accept gifts even after the ban went into effect in June, 1993, reporting them 
on gift disclosure forms that he and other elected officials are required to 
complete each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last half of 1993, Citron accepted meals, a picture frame, a magazine 
subscription, Christmas gifts and other items worth more than $400 from 14 
firms after the gift ban went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said in an interview that he accepted more gifts from these same groups 
in 1994, but officials have not yet filed disclosure statements for that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he believed that he could accept the gifts because they came from 
investment firms active in the county's retirement fund -- which is outside its 
main investment portfolio -- and that he sought counsel on the issue from the 
county's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 County lawyers refused Thursday to discuss the propriety of the gifts to 
Citron. The items listed on his disclosure form do not appear to fall under any 
of the 14 exemptions to the county gift ban ordinance. The county counsel's 
guidelines prohibit the acceptance of gifts from anyone "doing business with 
the county. . . . It doesn't matter whether or not it's your agency." 
</P>
<P>
 The close ties between county government and the bond world are illustrated by 
the gift lists filed by Citron and acting Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe, who took 
over the job last week after Citron resigned under pressure. Each of the more 
than three dozen gifts they reported over the past three years -- favors that 
included tickets to sports events, flower vases and dinners -- came from 
bankers and investment advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further highlighting those links, a few county administrators have moved into 
private sector jobs with investment firms that did business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county struggles to right itself from the worst financial disaster in 
its history, some critics are beginning to question whether officials entrusted 
with billions of dollars of public funds had become too cozy with the firms 
that profited from the county's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the municipal bond world is a very small one where they all know 
each other," said Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., an 
anti-tax activist group. "The fact that they are all friends who talk to each 
other all the time and there's not a lot of oversight could have contributed to 
Orange County's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of oversight is likely to play a key part in a federal investigation 
into the Orange County financial debacle. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission is probing whether securities disclosure laws were violated in the 
sale of a $600-million note issued by the county this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the investigation may look at whether the investment fund had 
already begun to unravel then, and if so, why that fact was not disclosed to 
investors by county officials and participants in the bond sales, sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that the financial adviser, together with the county and the 
underwriter, is responsible for disclosure in the bond statements," said 
Kathleen Connell, a municipal bond underwriter and newly elected state 
controller. "It is clear that the responsibility for disclosure lies with these 
three parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch, the note underwriter, shows up repeatedly on lists of gifts and 
campaign contributions to Orange County officials. A Times computer review of 
campaign statements shows that the Wall Street giant and its employees had 
contributed more than $15,000 to Orange County supervisorial candidates from 
1986 through 1992, making it the single largest contributor to county campaigns 
from the financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's political presence is even stronger in Los Angeles, where it has 
donated more than $155,000 to city and county candidates over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of the Teamsters on Thursday asked the SEC to 
investigate whether Merrill Lynch violated federal securities law by 
contributing at least $3,000 to Citron's 1994 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents about 1,000 county employees, charged that the 
contributions violate SEC regulations banning securities firms and their 
employees from seeking underwriting contracts after contributing $250 or more 
to elected officials who can affect decisions related to those contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid charges of influence peddling, the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission earlier this year imposed a tough new policy that generally 
prohibits municipal bond dealers from doing business for two years with a 
government if they have contributed to the campaign of any local officeholder 
or candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman James Wiggins denied any violations of SEC 
regulations. The three California employees who donated the money were not 
involved with the underwriting contracts, which were handled out of New York 
City, Wiggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials, under siege over this week's bankruptcy filing, said 
Thursday that they were reluctant to discuss the issue of gifts and donations 
from Wall Street. Several others active in local government said they do not 
believe that contributions or gifts can effectively win a contract for a bond 
firm, but they can help gain access to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment community has always been a strong source of gifts and 
contributions for public officials who are willing to send business their way," 
said Dana Reed, a political finance lawyer who served until last year on the 
Orange County Transportation Agency -- the single biggest investor in Orange 
County's ill-fated bond fund. 
</P>
<P>
 When the OCTA or other government agencies decide who should underwrite a road 
construction bond, many of the key factors -- such as price and experience -- 
are largely similar among the competing firms, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what's the difference?" he asked. "It basically comes down to who you feel 
most comfortable with. And people that you play golf and eat lunch with, you're 
by definition more comfortable with than those people you've never met. . . . 
That's the way the system is." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County politicians have had ample opportunity to become comfortable 
with the bond-writing world, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to sporting events are a favorite gift from Wall Street firms, along 
with tickets to the theater and black-tie balls, the records show. Designer 
pens are popular too. Shearson Lehman gave out kaleidoscopes a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the connections may even go beyond what is apparent on giftdisclosure 
forms that politicians are required to file with the state under penalty of 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Supervisor Roth, reported that he had received a $2,500 honorarium from 
First Boston in 1987 for a "speech" in New York, but officials later told The 
Times that Roth had in fact never given a speech and that the money was 
designed to cover his expenses for a top-flight hotel, meals and Broadway 
tickets. At the time, First Boston was trying to win the job of underwriting a 
jail finance measure, backed by Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the community of government and private sector bond specialists, "you end 
up with an intricate web of close associations," said Dennis Walters, former 
Los Angeles bureau chief of the Bond Buyer trade newspaper. "That's a function 
of people doing their job, and it's not abusive as long as an arm's-length 
relationship is observed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after government officials leave public service, the connections 
sometimes continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least four instances in recent years, top administrators have left 
Orange County to join investment firms that did business with the county. In 
some cases, the officials returned to represent the firms before the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the revolving door only heightens the appearance of a 
government that is too close to the business people it must work with. 
</P>
<P>
 But former county budget director Ronald S. Rubino, one of those who made the 
switch, said problems result only when ethical boundaries are breached. After 
leaving the county earlier this year, Rubino briefly joined a Santa Monica firm 
that has done bond work for Orange County and did finance work on some county 
contracts. But he said he never met with former colleagues to lobby for new 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another former county budget director, Sara Walker, left the county to become 
an Orange County representative for the Wall Street firm of Lehman Brothers. 
Walker declined to discuss the move Thursday.

JURY SELECTION IN SIMPSON TRIAL ENDS AFTER 11 WEEKS; COURTS: BOTH SIDES ACCEPT 
RACIALLY MIXED GROUP OF ALTERNATES. JUDGE CAN NOW FOCUS ON LEGAL, EVIDENCE 
ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lengthy string of setbacks, sidetracks and postponements came to an end in 
the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday as both sides accepted a racially mixed 
panel of alternate jurors, concluding a grueling jury selection process that 
has dragged on since late September. 
</P>
<P>
 The final round of jury selection in the Simpson case unfolded in a tense, 
quiet courtroom with the two sides taking turns exercising peremptory 
challenges -- those used to remove a panelist without stating the reason. When 
the process concluded, the nine-woman, three-man alternate panel included seven 
blacks, four whites and one Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be pressed into service if any of the 12 regular jurors are removed, 
a possibility that already has surfaced amid allegations of improper behavior 
by one or more of the Simpson jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson smiled broadly Thursday when the selection process ended. His two 
principal attorneys, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Robert L. Shapiro, strode 
together to the lectern and Shapiro announced: "On behalf of O.J. Simpson, we 
accept the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the Simpson case has been under way since Sept. 26, when the 
first panelists filled out an exhaustive questionnaire probing their feelings 
about the case and searching for any biases that might make them unfit to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 With jurors and alternates now in place, the judge and attorneys can at last 
begin focusing on legal issues and evidence in the case. On Monday, they will 
take up a defense effort to block the introduction of any evidence of marital 
discord between Simpson and his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The slashed and stabbed bodies of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were 
discovered June 13, shortly after midnight. Simpson has been charged with those 
murders; he has pleaded not guilty and has vigorously proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The painstaking questioning that jury candidates have undergone reflects the 
high stakes that both sides place on finding an impartial panel to weigh the 
evidence against the former football superstar. More than 100 candidates were 
dismissed during the selection process, and at least one of those selected for 
the alternate panel has expressed deep reservations about being chosen for the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctant alternate juror has repeatedly asked to be let go, saying that 
she had served on a previous jury and found the experience trying. She 
displayed no emotion as the panel was sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her colleagues on the panel seemed more enthusiastic about the 
prospect of serving, and all survived detailed questioning intended to weed out 
those who could not be impartial. The group includes a legal secretary, a 
receptionist, a real estate appraiser and a county worker, among others. Most 
of the alternates completed high school but did not graduate from college. Only 
one panelist reported no knowledge of the freeway pursuit that culminated in 
Simpson's arrest June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were not selected during Thursday's final round were excused after 
being effusively thanked by Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am personally grateful to have had the opportunity to meet each and every 
one of you," said Ito, who has guided the jury selection process for nearly 11 
weeks, halting it occasionally to deal with the unexpected developments that 
have come to characterize the Simpson case. "You got to participate in 
something that was important and significant." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the excused alternate jurors left, he flashed a thumbs-up sign at 
Simpson, who did not appear to notice. That man, a 58-year-old labor relations 
specialist from Pico-Union, had earlier told the attorneys that he thought he 
would make a good juror because of his experience in labor issues. He also 
described himself as the victim of domestic violence -- one of three male jury 
candidates who related experiences involving women striking their spouses. 
Simpson has made similar assertions in describing his relationship with Nicole 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The painstaking process of selecting a jury came at the end of about two hours 
of strategic maneuvering by both sides Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the jury candidates watched silently, Simpson huddled with his lawyers, 
debating the composition of the panel each time that it was their turn to 
exercise a challenge or accept the group of alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution went first, excusing a 43-year-old black woman from 
South-Central. At first, it appeared that the process could end quickly; 
Simpson's lawyers announced that they would accept the panel as it stood. But 
after prosecutors challenged two more panelists, Simpson's team joined the 
exchange. At the session's end, prosecutors had challenged six blacks and one 
Latino. Simpson's lawyers excused three Latinos, two whites, one Asian American 
and one black. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's composition has been closely watched in a case in which racial 
issues lurk just beneath the surface. Simpson, a black man, is charged with the 
murders of two whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Peremptory challenges may not be used to remove prospective jurors because of 
their race or sex, but Ito did not find that the challenges used by either side 
were being employed in a discriminatory manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 alternate jurors will take their places alongside 12 regular jurors, 
but the composition of the two panels could begin shifting even before a word 
of evidence is presented in the case. Responding to the allegations of improper 
behavior leveled against at least one of the regular jurors, Ito has convened a 
series of closed-door fact-finding sessions to determine whether anyone should 
be removed from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ito nor the attorneys would say what allegations are being 
investigated, and the opposing lawyers could not even agree on what to call the 
hearings. Defense lawyers, who are thrilled with the composition of the Simpson 
jury, downplayed the seriousness of the allegations, saying they were merely 
hearsay and speculation; Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark accused her 
counterparts of misstating the thrust of the hearings and said the allegations, 
if true, probably involved misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clark said transcripts of the hearings would support her description, 
Ito turned down a request by Kelli L. Sager, a lawyer representing news 
organizations, to have those transcripts released. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he would consider releasing the transcripts once he has completed his 
inquiry into issues surrounding the two jurors, but he would not release 
anything until then. It is not clear whom Ito intends to question to get to the 
bottom of the matter, but Arnelle Simpson, O.J. Simpson's daughter, was in 
court Thursday, and a source close to the case said she was on hand to testify 
if asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are scheduled to return to court today, when they will begin to 
tackle a host of legal issues that have backed up while jury selection was 
under way. One item on today's agenda is a defense motion to force Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Christopher Darden off the government team. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers have argued that Darden should not be allowed to prosecute 
Simpson, in part because he was the lead government attorney probing the 
actions of Simpson's friend Al Cowlings, who was arrested June 17 on suspicion 
of aiding a fugitive. Simpson's lawyers charged that a grand jury investigation 
into Cowlings actually was a ruse to develop evidence against Simpson and have 
sought to keep prosecutors from using any evidence gathered in the Cowlings 
investigation against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the documents unsealed Thursday by Ito was a ruling by another Superior 
Court judge who concluded that the grand jury was not being misused and a 
statement by the grand jury forewoman explaining some of the issues that the 
panel investigated. That statement makes clear that grand jurors were 
interested in Cowlings' role not only on the day of the pursuit but also during 
the previous afternoon, when he helped dupe reporters into believing that 
Simpson was at home in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the funeral, Cowlings and Simpson exchanged clothing," the statement 
said. "Cowlings practiced walking like Simpson. Cowlings covered his head with 
his jacket, entered Simpson's limousine and returned to Simpson's residence in 
Brentwood. This ruse caused the media and the police to believe that Simpson 
had returned to his Brentwood home." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Simpson, aided by an off-duty LAPD sergeant, slipped away to the 
Encino home of friend Robert Kardashian. The next day, after Simpson failed to 
turn himself in to the police on schedule, he and Cowlings fled from that 
house, leaving moments before police arrived to take Simpson into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 After they were spotted on Interstate 5 in Orange County, the two men headed 
back to Simpson's home in Brentwood with a phalanx of police cars trailing 
slowly behind them. Simpson then surrendered as a nationwide television 
audience watched.

CLINTON IS NEAR TO PROPOSING TAX CUT, AIDES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only days remaining before final decisions on his federal budget plan, 
President Clinton is leaning strongly toward a modest middle-class tax cut and 
is also contemplating major cutbacks and restructurings in federal departments, 
Administration officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of high-level meetings in recent days, Clinton is expected to 
propose a tax cut next week that would most benefit middle-income wage earners, 
yet not worsen the federal budget deficit, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Administration officials have most often talked about a 
reduction that would expand the personal tax deduction or provide a tax credit 
for families with children, at a cost of about $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The only open question, they have said, is whether they could find a way to 
finance such a cut. That obstacle has apparently now been overcome, although 
full details about that element of the budget plan were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 In their effort to keep up with Republican promises to shrink the bureaucracy, 
the Administration has been scrutinizing a series of cuts in federal agencies 
and has considered completely shutting down the Department of Energy and the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 In early budget meetings, the President "told the staff that he wanted very 
bold proposals that would bring very substantial changes," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the officials eventually backed away from eliminating HUD after 
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros offered a counterproposal that he said 
could save money without abolishing the agency outright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department, another agency that has been accused of wasteful 
practices, was also spared, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No proposal for eliminating a department reached the President," one official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan proposed eliminating the Energy Department when 
he first came to office in 1981. But the plan was abandoned after the 
Congressional Budget Office expressed skepticism that the move would save much 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration also has asked other agencies to prove that they 
fulfilled their mission and to show that the continued existence of many parts 
of their agencies was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's "reinventing government" program calls for the 
elimination of 272,000 federal jobs. So far, about 75,000 have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton officials are expected to complete their budget decisions before 
Christmas for a fiscal 1996 budget that will be sent to Congress in February. 
Some details of the spending plan may be included in an address that Clinton is 
expected to give next week to further explain what course he intends to 
navigate in the aftermath of last month's Republican election victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Republicans who will soon control Congress are likely to vastly 
rewrite the proposal, the 1996 budget may well be the least important of the 
three Clinton has offered. But it retains at least symbolic importance as an 
indicator of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending plan will clearly provide further evidence of a White House move 
to the political center in the weeks since the widespread Democratic losses in 
the Nov. 8 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a middle-class tax cut would allow Clinton to claim that he had 
fulfilled a celebrated promise from the early days of his 1992 campaign. It 
would be far smaller than the $500-a-child tax credit that is called for in the 
Republicans' "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration has adamantly maintained that its proposal must be 
"deficit-neutral." That feature is dear to the President, and perhaps even 
dearer to his chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, who was formerly the director of 
the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Top White House officials have held a swirl of meetings since the 
congressional elections to reset their course for the next two years. While 
some decisions have yet to be made, it is clear that the Administration intends 
to hew to the principle of fiscal discipline, officials say.

EXPERTS PUSH LOW-TECH CARE FOR BACK PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major departure from traditional practice, federal health officials said 
Thursday that the expensive tests and therapies typically used to diagnose and 
treat lower back pain are largely useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they recommended over-the-counter pain medications, chiropractic and 
low-stress exercise, such as swimming or walking. 
</P>
<P>
 For most patients, symptoms will disappear on their own within a month, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acute lower back problems -- pain or discomfort in the lower back or pain and 
numbness that moves down the leg (sciatica) -- is a sometimes-debilitating 
condition suffered at some point by almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after the common cold, it is the leading reason that people see their 
primary-care physicians, according to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Back pain can occur at any point on the spine for no apparent reason, but it 
most commonly crops up in the lower back region because that area bears the 
majority of the body's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower back pain can severely restrict an individual's activities, including 
the ability to work -- sometimes for weeks. In 1990, more than $20 billion in 
direct medical costs was spent on the condition, mostly for diagnostic tests. 
The total annual cost -- including lost productivity -- is estimated at $50 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines were compiled by a panel of medical experts who reviewed 
nearly 4,000 studies. The group was convened by the federal Agency for Health 
Care Policy and Research, which released the recommendations that are expected 
to be regarded as the standard of care. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel did not address chronic lower back problems, which are the subject 
of ongoing studies. But it stressed that people with long-term problems 
represent fewer than 5% of those afflicted with lower back pain. This group may 
or may not include people with disk problems, depending on the extent or 
severity of their symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines will provide "new hope to those who are confused about the 
myriad of approaches to acute low back problems," said Dr. Stanley J. Bigos, 
chairman of the panel and a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University 
of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said the early use of tests such as X-rays, computed tomography and 
magnetic resonance imaging should be discouraged unless symptoms indicate more 
serious underlying conditions, such as fractures, tumors, infections or spinal 
nerve root problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the usual therapies -- extended bed rest, muscle relaxants and surgery 
-- can be unnecessary and, in some cases, harmful, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resting in bed for more than four days "can weaken muscles and bones and delay 
recovery," the panel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the first three months of symptoms, surgery is only recommended for 
those with evidence of serious spinal problems or those with certain leg 
symptoms that result from nerve conditions, dislocations or fractures, the 
panel said. Surgery appears to benefit only about one out of 100 individuals 
with acute low back pain, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the group said the use of acetaminophen and non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs was safe and effective, as was walking, swimming or 
biking -- activities that help maintain and build a patient's tolerance to 
physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiropractic, which uses spinal manipulation to ease pain, was also found to 
be helpful, especially within the first four weeks of the onset of pain, the 
panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were a significant validation to the century-old 
discipline of chiropractic, as well as a rebuff to surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, chiropractic was the object of criticism and scorn from the 
medical Establishment, despite growing consumer support. In recent years, 
however, it has begun to enjoy increasing credibility within mainstream 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that spinal manipulation is a drug-free, non-surgical, low-cost form of 
relief, Dr. Lowry Morton, chairman of the board of the American Chiropractic 
Assn., said he hoped the guidelines would encourage managed-care health plans 
and health maintenance organizations to include chiropractic within their 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spinal manipulation is effective; it gets low back pain patients on their 
feet and back to work faster than any other form of care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also recommended ways to prevent back pain. These include engaging 
in regular exercise; wearing comfortable, low-heeled shoes; using work surfaces 
at a comfortable height and chairs with good lower back support; and the use of 
lumbar corsets by people whose jobs require frequent lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when lifting, individuals should avoid twisting, bending and reaching, 
and keep objects close to the body, the panel said. 
</P>

VIOLATORS MAY HAVE A LOOPHOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among its many provisions to discourage illegal immigration, Proposition 187 
included what its sponsors have billed as tough new sanctions against the 
manufacture and use of fraudulent citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as the first person charged under the initiative was ordered to stand 
trial Thursday, law enforcement officials say the ballot measure's wording 
leaves it doubtful whether many lawbreakers will receive stiffer penalties than 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 calls for a sentence of five years in state prison or a fine 
of $75,000 for manufacturing, distributing or selling false documents. But 
because crimes punishable by fines can normally be treated as either felonies 
or misdemeanors, the authors of Proposition 187 appear to have given judges and 
prosecutors the leeway to provide misdemeanor sentences -- which carry a 
maximum one-year county jail term -- as well as five-year sentences, according 
to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear (the initiative's sponsors) wanted this to be a straight felony, 
but when they put in a fine, they really complicated (things)," said Los 
Angeles County Assistant Dist. Atty. Frank Sundstedt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases filed last week under the fraudulent documents section -- the 
only key provision of Proposition 187 not now blocked from taking effect by 
state and federal judges -- the district attorney's office charged three 
Huntington Park-area men with felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a three-hour preliminary hearing Thursday afternoon, the first of 
the Proposition 187 defendants, Jose Hernandez Sanchez, 24, was ordered to 
stand trial by a South Gate Municipal Court judge on felony charges of 
manufacturing fake citizenship documents and additional charges of forgery and 
possessing cocaine for sale. Two alleged accomplices, who were also arrested at 
a motel room where authorities found several sheets of unfinished fake Social 
Security cards, were held over for trial on non-Proposition 187 forgery 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's office will continue to file all future Proposition 187 cases 
as felonies, according to office policy guidelines issued in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in many cases, defendants will probably receive a few months in jail, 
Sundstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be foolish to say we'd urge the court in all circumstances to impose 
five years in prison without analyzing the previous criminal history of the 
defendant and the facts of the case," Sundstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many first-time offenders in Los Angeles charged with nonviolent crimes 
receive sentences of about six months in County Jail and face three additional 
years in state prison if they violate the terms of their probation, county 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Proposition 187 became law, manufacturers of fake citizenship documents 
faced up to three years in prison under the state's forgery statute. But when 
charged with multiple counts for each fake document, they faced maximum 
sentences of more than six years in prison. Proposition 187, on the other hand, 
calls for punishment of five years in state prison no matter how many documents 
are printed or sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point that Proposition 187 does not directly address is the possession 
of fake citizenship documents, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, 
who opposed the initiative during the election campaign, in part because he 
believed it was poorly written. The sheriff said that, based on the measure's 
wording, "you must use that document" to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 campaign head Ron Prince, who takes credit for writing the 
sections on fraudulent documents, disagrees with the interpretations by Los 
Angeles law enforcement officials. Prince said the initiative clearly states 
that those manufacturing false documents are "guilty of a felony." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way anyone could possibly construe that as being unclear," Prince 
said. "If anyone in law enforcement needs a clarification of the word felony , 
perhaps we should reconsider the way in which our law enforcement personnel are 
trained." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince also contends that illegal immigrants carrying fake identifications are 
subject to prosecution -- despite the fact the word possession was not included 
in the ballot measure. "I am sorry," he said. "But if they are in possession of 
a fraudulent green card, they've committed a felony in the state of California, 
and we expect the law will be enforced."

PROP. 187 FOES URGE BOYCOTT OF NABISCO, DISNEY; PROTEST: LATINO GROUPS ARE 
URGING CONSUMERS TO SHUN THE FIRMS BECAUSE OF THEIR DONATIONS TO GOV. WILSON 
AND OTHERS WHO SUPPORTED THE INITIATIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Activists who unsuccessfully fought Proposition 187 at the ballot box unveiled 
formal boycott plans Thursday against two U.S. corporate icons -- the purveyors 
of Mickey Mouse and Oreos -- in an effort to capitalize on the economic clout 
of Latino consumers and others opposed to the immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycott organizers, who are hoping to win support throughout the United States 
and Latin America, are targeting Walt Disney Co. and RJR Nabisco because of 
major donations by corporate officers to the reelection campaign of Gov. Pete 
Wilson and other pro-187 Republican candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to sensitize companies like Disneyland that make earnings from 
immigrants," said Fabian Nunez of La Alianza in Pomona, speaking to reporters 
outside the main entrance to the Anaheim tourist mecca. "These corporations 
need to be sensitive to the people that make them wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco in New York, said the 
conglomerate did not take a position on Proposition 187. Boycott 
representatives have not contacted RJR Nabisco, said Makovich, who declined 
further comment. Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the company also 
remained neutral on Proposition 187 and that its gubernatorial campaign 
contributions, which also included donations to Democratic challenger Kathleen 
Brown, "were based entirely on business and tourism concerns as you would 
expect with the Disney Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 won by an almost 3-2 margin at the polls, where exit 
interviews showed Latinos made up only 8% of the voters although they account 
for 27% of the state's population. Latino activists Thursday termed boycotts an 
alternative method to demonstrate their growing clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the electoral power that our numbers would suggest, but it's 
important to show the community that we do have economic power -- the community 
does have a voice," said Evangeline Ordaz, a professor of Chicano studies at 
Cal State Northridge. She was among those announcing the RJR Nabisco boycott at 
a separate news conference outside a Latino supermarket in the largely 
immigrant Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Sponsoring the action against the tobacco and food conglomerate is the 
California Latino Civil Rights Network, an activist group that helped organize 
a large anti-Proposition 187 march in Los Angeles last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney boycott is being led by Coordinadora '96, a coalition of leaders of 
smallish grass-roots immigration rights groups including One-Stop Immigration 
of Los Angeles and La Alianza. The group said its boycott will also concentrate 
on Chevron -- another substantial contributor to Wilson's campaign -- and on 
national convention business slated for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's actions are the latest in a series of Latino-led boycotts -- some 
seemingly spontaneous, others, like Thursday's moves, planned in advance -- 
against donors to Wilson, who made his support for Proposition 187 a 
centerpiece of his reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers made it clear that additional companies would be targeted because 
of their financial support for Wilson and other Republicans. The GOP helped 
bankroll the pro-187 campaign and Wilson ran a series of tough, pro-187 TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the Republican Party is trying to scapegoat the Latino and immigrant 
community for their own political gain, and that's immoral," said Mario 
Salgado, executive director of the Civil Rights Network. "People are being hurt 
by it, and these companies need to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson has termed the boycotts counterproductive. "Boycotts help no one 
and many of these Latino activists who are calling for boycotts are hurting 
their fellow Latinos and recent immigrants who work in entry-level service 
sector and manufacturing jobs," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Gov. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A demonstration to kick off the boycott of Disneyland and Disney films and 
other merchandise is planned outside the main gate of the Magic Kingdom on 
Saturday morning by boycott leaders, who helped organize the massive October 
protest against Proposition 187 in Downtown Los Angeles. The boycott will 
continue at least until 1996, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking for from Disneyland is sensitivity to our community," said 
Nunez, an American flag unfurled behind him, "and a commitment from this 
corporation that they are committed to advancing the interests of this 
immigrant community."  
</P>
<P>
 Nunez said he believes a boycott can have "a substantial impact" on Disney, 
even though he has no expectation of bringing the company to its knees. "The 
image of Disneyland will have to be re-evaluated by many people who come to the 
theme park," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 For decades, he noted, the portrayal of ethnic groups in Disney cartoons has 
raised questions, most recently criticism of Arab characters in "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in the same week that Orange County unexpectedly declared bankruptcy, 
Nunez conceded, some might take a boycott of the county's ultimate icon as 
rubbing salt in a wound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there may be a backlash, but we're willing to face the consequences 
of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the boycott against RJR Nabisco -- whose expansive line ranges from 
Camel cigarettes to Oreo, Fig Newton and Chips Ahoy! cookies to A-1 steak sauce 
and Ortega brand Mexican food products -- announced their action in the parking 
lot of Liborio's Market, which caters to a largely Latino immigrant clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the word through community groups, churches and other organizations, 
boycott strategists plan to reach shoppers throughout the United States and 
Latin America -- where Nabisco sales are also high. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are alternatives to all these products," said Roberto Lovato of the 
Civil Rights Network as he stood in front of a table arrayed with Nabisco 
products, including Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Certs and Lifesavers 
candies. "But there are no alternatives to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers wore red armbands asking, in Spanish and English, "Who's next?" -- 
an allusion to what some activists call the scapegoating of immigrants in the 
post-Proposition 187 era. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycott planners are seeking an apology from RJR Nabisco and a pledge that the 
corporation will not back candidates who use immigration as a "divisive" issue, 
said Salgado.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; AN END RUN AROUND OBSCURITY; IN BLOOMINGTON, THE FOOTBALL 
TEAM'S TRIUMPH HAS GIVEN A MUCH-NEEDED BOOST TO COMMUNITY PRIDE.

<P>
 Until the local football team hit the field and ran into the national record 
books, there had not been a lot to cheer about in this obscure farming 
community in industrial-strength San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Straddling Interstate 10 and a railroad switching yard 50 miles east of Los 
Angeles, the town has fallen between the cracks, an unincorporated community 
struggling for identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring cities of Colton, Fontana and Rialto were gobbling up land through 
annexations. The only bank in town closed, and the Teamsters took it over as a 
union hall. Bloomington's largest employers -- a cement yard, a cookie bakery 
and a candy factory -- moved away too. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers still raise their cows and goats on half-acre lots, but salvage 
yards, used furniture stores and massage parlors now scar the Midwestern 
texture of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Chamber of Commerce president, after talking about the need to clean 
up junk lots and tumbleweeds and graffiti, apologized later for sounding so 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a ragtag collection of football players at the high school who 
this season conquered end zones like an unstoppable army, Bloomington is 
finally getting some respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Bruins of Bloomington High could muster only a 1-9 record. But 
with a new coach this year, the squad -- so small that half of its members play 
both offense and defense -- won its first game, 86 to 0. And the second game, 
84 to 0. And the next, 62 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The team blew away the opposition game after game, racking up a season average 
of 64 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week -- while beating Laguna Hills High School in a CIF semifinal 
game that was its closest contest yet, 34-21 -- Bloomington blew away a 
19-year-old national record. The Bruins posted the highest number of points -- 
832 -- ever scored by a prep football team in a single season. The alumni at 
Big Sandy High School, the previous record-holder, can now only cry in their 
Texas long-necks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight the Bruins travel to La Mirada High School for the CIF Division 8 
championship and, win or lose, they will probably add more frosting to their 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 And so these days, it is not just roosters that are crowing in Bloomington, 
population 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's pretty fired up about the team," said barber Louie Villagran. "I 
hear the Lions Club is gonna have a dinner to honor them. A lot of people 
didn't even know there's a Bloomington. But now, that's changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, typewriter repairman Charlie Dodd -- who, apropos the local time 
warp, prefers working on archaic manuals rather than those newfangled "electro 
mechanical" ones -- echoes the town's new upbeat attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "When's the last time we've been in the news? For anything good, it's probably 
been years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At MGM Burgers, owner George Economy said he can't keep up with the demand for 
his restaurant's T-shirts. They're more popular than ever, he said, because, 
finally, people do not mind wearing a shirt that says "Bloomington" on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pronounced shift in attitudes is at the high school itself. Assistant 
Principal Roger Kowalski -- who graduated from Bloomington 30 years ago -- 
talks of new campus self-esteem among the 1,450 students, showing off a 
bulletin board crammed with local and national press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Abril, the football squad's team mother, said: "A lot of kids on campus 
are now wanting to do better in everything they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Football coach Don Markham says he is getting "attaboys" from teachers because 
the success on the field is spilling into the classrooms. "The students aren't 
as rowdy this year," he said. "They've got pride. And the teachers are telling 
me, 'You've made my job this year so easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 School board trustee Maria Lopez-Carson said: "The football team has shown all 
the kids that dedication to achieve means success can be obtained." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Markham the local hero? "The entire football team are heroes," 
Lopez-Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the team's celebrity, no one expects any wholesale changes in 
Bloomington's small town ambience, a place where the 4-H Club, equestrian 
competitions and Little League games seem to draw more youngsters than do 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington was founded as a farming community before the turn of the century, 
and most of its modest housing stock was built just after World War II. To this 
day, horses are ridden down neighborhood streets and residents sell vegetables, 
rabbit fryers and quail from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several decades ago, Bloomington was the largest and best-known community 
along this stretch of Interstate 10 between Ontario and San Bernardino. But as 
other communities incorporated and urbanized, Bloomington jealously maintained 
its roots as a home for independent people who eschewed rules and regulations 
and adopted a live-and-let-live attitude. Some residents guardedly use the term 
redneck to describe the town's earlier personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are proud, and want to be left alone," said Ron Losee, chairman 
of the Municipal Advisory Committee, an advisory panel to the County Board of 
Supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 "But as a result, and as other cities take land from us, we've lost our 
identity," he said. "People who lived here would say they were from Rialto or 
Fontana. If you said you were from Bloomington, people would ask, 'Indiana?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, the football team is turning that around for us."

NARROW RULING IS EXPECTED ON HOMELESS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court appeared reluctant Thursday to rule on the 
constitutional issues raised by a Santa Ana ordinance on the homeless, 
prompting predictions that cities will be allowed to resume their campaigns to 
control those who camp or sleep on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless, discouraged by the oral arguments before the 
conservative-led court, surmised that the justices might uphold the 
anti-camping law on narrow legal grounds and refuse to settle larger 
constitutional questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities around the state have been passing laws aimed at removing the homeless 
while awaiting a determination by the high court on whether such ordinances are 
constitutionally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is likely that the (California Supreme Court) decision won't 
ultimately resolve whether a city can make it a crime to use a blanket or a 
sleeping bag" on public property, Harry Simon, an attorney with the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County, said after arguing before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the justices did not state their views on the Orange County case, 
their questions indicated that the high court believes a state Court of Appeal 
in Santa Ana may have gone too far in declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides of the issue said the state high court appeared to 
believe it is bound to decide only whether the wording of the law was 
unconstitutionally vague and broad, not whether its impact would be cruel and 
unusual punishment for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Several justices indicated that there was not enough factual evidence 
presented to the trial court to warrant a finding on the larger constitutional 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court, which will rule on the case within the next few months, 
could send it back to Orange County Superior Court for a full hearing on the 
impact of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's 1992 ordinance prohibits people from using blankets or sleeping 
bags to sleep on public property. Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. 
Smith upheld it in April, 1993, but the Court of Appeal struck it down last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The city passed a second ordinance in the meantime to clear the homeless from 
the Civic Center area only, but has enforced neither law pending a ruling by 
the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. E. Thomas Dunn Jr., defending the law 
before the court, complained of peering out of his Civic Center office in Santa 
Ana and beholding a "shantytown" of lean-tos and campfires and people 
defecating and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think you were in the middle of a sewer plant," Dunn later told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that people who truly have no alternative to the streets would have a 
legitimate legal defense in court against the ordinance and would be spared 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, he said, is aimed at those who choose to sleep on public 
property rather than go to a shelter or other accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the homeless scoffed at his assertions, contending that 
those who were cited under the ordinance before it was blocked had nowhere else 
to go. Orange County has about 975 beds in shelters for the homeless and an 
estimated 12,000 to 15,000 homeless people, according to the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's concern about whether it technically could decide the larger 
constitutional issues raised by the homeless advocates came "totally out of 
left field," Simon said, because the city of Santa Ana had never raised such 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides of the issue predicted that a ruling in favor of the 
ordinance would encourage more cities to pass laws limiting homeless people's 
access to public property.

 What's good for Quetzalcoatl evidently goes for the Three Wise Men too. San 
Jose, having just mopped its brow from all the screaming and yelling over the 
city's decision to place a half-million-dollar statue of the Aztec god in the 
park to honor multiculturalism, has decided to let a Nativity scene return to 
the same park, where it's been for some 20 Noels past. 
</P>
<P>
 Christians who had demonstrated and gone to court to keep Quetzalcoatl out 
went back to the Plaza de Cesar Chavez to keep the creche in , staging their 
own living Nativity scene. People phoned. People protested. The city relented. 
</P>
<P>
 That ceremony was held only after a federal judge ruled that the work was a 
cultural, not a religious, symbol.

 Bye Bye Birdie: For that price, it might as well have been made out of gold.

<P>
 The Maltese Falcon, one of two movie prop birds in the eponymous film noir 
classic, sold at auction for $398,500 this week . . . thus giving the figurine 
to a swanky Manhattan jeweler, and giving the bird to San Francisco, which very 
much wanted to keep the falcon in the city where the book is set. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt for the gold and jeweled falcon, "the stuff that dreams are made of," 
if you believe Dashiell Hammett's detective Sam Spade, was the centerpiece of 
the book and the film, but San Francisco played a big supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
 The fictional dick ate dinner at a real S.F. restaurant, John's Grill, whose 
Maltese Falcon room has but a copy of the avian in question. (The other 
authentic prop is in the hands of a Beverly Hills man). Restaurant owner John 
Konstin flew to New York to bid on the real falcon but dropped out at $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-auction estimates had priced the bird in the $30,000 to $50,000 range, but 
it flew above even the $244,500 for Victor Fleming's Oscar for directing "Gone 
With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 This bird bears the authentic slash marks that actor Sidney Greenstreet made 
in a fit of fat pique when he found that the falcon wasn't gold and jeweled -- 
in short, the Ford falcon, not the Rolls-Royce.

 I know it's only guacamole, but I like it: In California's answer to the 
elaborate annual French ceremonials surrounding Beaujolais nouveau , the first 
Hass avocado of the season was plucked from a tree on a 132-acre grove in Vista 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hass avocados -- the uninitiated sometimes call them "alligator pears" -- 
account for most of the avocados in San Diego County, and San Diego County 
accounts for about half of the nation's crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The first plucking came two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
announced that its quarters in nearby Fallbrook is among 31 ag field offices 
set to close in California, from Siskiyou County to El Centro -- the farming 
version of base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since avocados were discovered in Mexico around 291 B.C., we have learned that 
they are a lousy color for major appliances, an ill-advised diet food (two 
tablespoons hold 10% of a day's allowance of fat), but a handsome ornament to 
tortilla chips.

 Killer angels: The last of the year's quarter-century anniversaries is the one 
you might least want to remember. Altamont, the ruinously free concert at a 
racetrack near Livermore, became the evil twin of Woodstock, notorious for more 
than 850 exceedingly bad acid trips and riotous conflicts between fans and the 
Hells Angels, misguidedly hired as security in exchange for free beer. Four 
concert-goers died, one stabbed by an Angel who was acquitted after pleading 
self-defense.

 Ex libris: The sad tale of the libraries of Merced County just gets sadder,

<P>
 Over the last year, its 19 libraries have opened, closed, opened, scraped by, 
cut hours and set out the begging bowl for donations. Now a statewide survey 
puts Merced's library last among 155 state libraries in per capita library 
spending -- $2.84. Irwindale tops the list at $179.53. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the Merced libraries are open again, in some fashion, some 
staffed by volunteers and on fiscal life supports from local donations, says 
the county's principal administrative analyst, Beverly Morse. "I think there is 
no interest on the part of board (of supervisors) members to close down, but 
how soon we're going to go back to where we were, I don't know."

LEADERS ARE STILL EARNING PEACE PRIZE; MIDEAST: ARAFAT, RABIN AND PERES TO 
ACCEPT NOBEL AWARD THIS WEEKEND. BUT THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR ACCORD 
INTACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The three men who travel to Oslo today to accept the Nobel Peace Prize were 
scrambling Thursday to salvage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that 
earned them the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from a hastily arranged meeting Thursday morning, Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres, who are to share the prize with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, each made statements designed to reassure the other's constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said the Oslo accord, the peace framework that Israel and the PLO signed 
in September, 1993, would be altered only "by mutual agreement" and not 
unilaterally, as some Israeli officials hinted last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and other officials have said it may be impossible for Israel to keep 
its commitment to pull Israeli troops out of West Bank Palestinian towns and 
villages before holding Palestinian elections in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have expressed doubt that the Palestinian self-governing 
authority will be able to protect the more than 100,000 Israeli settlers living 
in the West Bank once Israeli troops redeploy out of Palestinian population 
centers. They point to the authority's inability to prevent attacks on Israeli 
soldiers and civilians in Gaza, which it governs, and to its reluctance to 
crack down on Islamic militant groups in Gaza, as evidence that it will be 
unable to provide security in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly addressing that Israeli concern, Arafat said after his session with 
Peres that the Palestinians will take Israel's security needs into 
consideration as the two sides continue to negotiate.  
</P>
<P>
 Arafat then rushed to Jabaliya refugee camp to mark the seventh anniversary of 
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli military rule in the West Bank and 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 As the keynote speaker at a low-key rally organized by Fatah, the PLO faction 
he founded, he promised the cheering crowd that he will remember those who died 
fighting the intifada and not abandon their dream of establishing an 
independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The promise is still the promise, the commitment is still the commitment," he 
said. "Our journey is not a walk down the park, but a long hard road that we 
must travel together until we reach Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres returned to Tel Aviv, to a special Cabinet meeting called to decide the 
government's position on continuing negotiations with the Palestinians. Dovish 
Cabinet ministers said they were disappointed that the government's conclusion, 
after a series of three special sessions on the negotiations with the 
Palestinians, was simply to continue implementing the Oslo accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The government made no mention of uprooting some of the more isolated 
settlements in Gaza and the West Bank as a way to ease Israel's security 
dilemma. Several of the more dovish Cabinet members have been urging that 
settlements in the West Bank be concentrated into a few large blocs that the 
army could more easily defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, Rabin and Arafat are expected to hold more talks in Oslo before 
receiving their joint award Saturday. Rabin is said to be trying to sell Arafat 
on a compromise that would allow Israel to limit the redeployment of its troops 
in return for Israeli concessions on the type of elections the Palestinians 
want to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians have been pushing for elections that would form a legislative 
council of 100 members. Israel wants a smaller executive council and says it 
does not want any Palestinians from East Jerusalem to run in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma for Arafat is that he is trying to entice the largest Islamic 
opposition movement, Hamas, into participating in the elections. Hamas is 
almost certain to boycott any vote unless Israel makes substantial 
redeployments from most of the West Bank.

FORMER PREMIER TO LEAD JAPAN'S NEWEST PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese politics was once again turned on its head Thursday as a former 
ruling party prime minister was elected to lead Japan's newest and biggest-ever 
opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiki Kaifu, who led the nation and served as president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) from August, 1989, until October, 1991, was elected over 
two rivals to the leadership of the New Frontier Party, a combination of eight 
opposition groups that lost power in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaifu's selection, together with the unopposed choice of Ichiro Ozawa as 
secretary general of the new party, put the same two men at the helm of 
Frontier as had steered the LDP when Kaifu was in power. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's election, Kaifu, 63, won 131 votes among the 214 Frontier 
members of both houses of Parliament, defeating former Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, who polled 52, and Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the middle-of-the-road 
Democratic Socialist Party, who received 31 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 180 Frontier members of the lower house voting, guaranteeing that 
the party would have at least that many seats in the chamber that chooses the 
prime minister. The LDP, whose 38-year unilateral rule of Japan ended in 
August, 1993, now controls 200 seats in the 511-member lower house and is the 
biggest part of the governing coalition under Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ozawa, who favors an activist role for Japan abroad and a smaller 
government with less control over the economy at home, who ended the LDP's 
almost four decades of unilateral power by defecting from the party 18 months 
ago. Then Kaifu bolted the LDP in June to run as Ozawa's candidate for prime 
minister when the LDP backed Murayama. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like turning the clock backward," the newspaper Asahi said in an 
editorial. The selection of Kaifu and Ozawa "lacks freshness," it complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Some TV commentators criticized the new party, which will hold an inaugural 
convention Saturday, as simply "a second LDP," with no distinctive policy of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, condemned the combination as "a 
resurrection of the old LDP essence," as if to imply that his own party had 
assumed a new character after forging its coalition with the Socialists -- an 
alliance that was the biggest upset of political traditions here. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaifu returned the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at the LDP-Socialist coalition, I see only support for the status 
quo," Kaifu said. "We need decisive reforms, decisive policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over in the wake of a stocks-for-favors scandal, Kaifu, with a clean 
image, was a popular but ineffective prime minister.

MEXICO; SAVVY NEW TOP LAWMAN DOESN'T FIT THE MOLD; ANTONIO LOZANO, NAMED 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, IS QUIET AND STUDIOUS. AS AN OPPOSITION-PARTY CABINET MEMBER, 
HE BREAKS A 65-YEAR TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, there's little in Antonio Lozano's personality that would 
qualify him to be Mexico's answer to flamboyant crime-buster Eliot Ness: Lozano 
is bland. He's quiet. He's studious. He has insisted, so far, that he will 
conduct no interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's punctual, efficient and responsible," opposition leader Carlos Castillo 
Peraza said of the man now charged with ridding Mexico of its notoriously 
corrupt judges and police, breaking the nexus here of drug dealers and 
politicians and solving this year's two political assassinations that rocked 
the country to its core. 
</P>
<P>
 But look again at the man who already broke 65 years of Mexican tradition last 
week when President Ernesto Zedillo appointed him Mexico's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 At 41, Mexico's new top law enforcement official -- the first member of an 
opposition party to serve in the Cabinet since the first Institutional 
Revolutionary Party president took office in 1929 -- is considered one of the 
nation's brightest young criminal lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano knows politics and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 He served four years in the Chamber of Deputies after he was elected from 
Mexico City in 1988. That same year, he co-hosted a radio show called "Armed 
With the Law" with his trusted law partner and National Action Party (PAN) 
colleague, Hiram Escudero, whom Lozano appointed deputy attorney general 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of his Cabinet colleagues, Lozano is neither rich nor privileged. 
He attended public schools. His law degree is from the Autonomous National 
University of Mexico, one of the world's largest, least expensive schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But like Chicago's legend, who went after Al Capone and established a new rule 
of law in the 1920s, Lozano pulls no punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there is a new lawman in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an institution mired in a profound credibility crisis," Lozano 
declared of his powerful office the day he inherited it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, he made it clear that nothing will be sacred in his 
quest to create a new base line of justice in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Lozano said, he and a crack investigative team -- which he is 
still assembling -- will not stop until they solve the two major crimes that 
have undermined Mexico's criminal-justice system for months: 
</P>
<P>
 * The March assassination of ruling-party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 * The September murder of the party's secretary general, Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu, on the streets of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Colosio case, which most Mexicans believe was part of a broader 
conspiracy hatched by drug gangs and corrupt politicians, Lozano told 
legislators Wednesday that he will broaden the investigation far beyond the 
single-gunman theory established thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he said, he has new leads that indicate gunman Mario Aburto Martinez, 
sentenced to 42 years in prison in October, did not act alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ruiz Massieu case is even more explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 The former chief investigator in that case, Ruiz Massieu's brother, left 
behind sealed boxes when he resigned in disgust last month. The boxes, he said, 
contain proof implicating the ruling party's new president and one of Lozano's 
fellow Cabinet members in a conspiracy to cover up the Ruiz Massieu murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who know Lozano best -- among them, leaders of the National Action 
Party who proposed him to Zedillo after the party's flamboyant presidential 
candidate, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, turned down the post -- few doubt his 
ability to tackle, perhaps even topple, the most corrupt forces in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonio is a very serene person and one who doesn't lose his head," said 
Castillo, using Lozano's widely known nickname, in an interview this week with 
Mexico's prestigious weekly magazine Proceso. 
</P>
<P>
 An amateur boxer in his youth who fought his way from lower-middle-class roots 
to the top of the nation's largest and oldest opposition party, Lozano 
impressed party leaders like Castillo with hard work and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very human in his manner, straight and very honest," said fellow PAN 
lawyer Juan de Dios Castro. "And because of that I once told him: 'You don't 
have any enemies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As if conceding that his future may be different, Lozano found himself saying 
during a farewell toast at party headquarters, "And with the help of God. . . . 
I hope to succeed."

GOVERNOR TAKES OATH PEACEFULLY IN CHIAPAS; RIVAL DOES TOO; MEXICO: BOTH PROMISE 
REFORM IN TROUBLED SOUTHERN STATE. COUNTRY WAITS TO SEE IF ZAPATISTA REBELS 
WILL END TRUCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men took the oath of office Thursday to be governor of the deeply divided 
southern state of Chiapas, both promising a new constitution and electoral 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Robledo Rincon, the ruling party candidate and official winner of the 
Aug. 21 election, was inaugurated during a special legislative session at the 
modernistic City Theater with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation of Amado Avendano, who charges that the election was stolen 
from him by vote fraud, took place an hour later at the main plaza several 
blocks away, where 3,000 protesters gathered in front of the Statehouse to 
witness a Mayan ceremony of incense and chanting in the unrelenting sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Both events were peaceful. Demonstrators who had marched from all over the 
state to protest Robledo's inauguration did not attempt to confront the tight 
security surrounding the theater. Police guarding the Statehouse watched the 
plaza ceremony indifferently and protesters did not disturb the police 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 However, tensions remained high as Mexicans waited to find out whether the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army will carry out its threat to break its 
uneasy truce with the government once Robledo takes office. The rebels, who 
briefly took control of four county seats last New Year's Day, have said that 
Avendano will be recognized as governor in any territory they control. 
</P>
<P>
 The inauguration day was the first measure of how Zedillo's week-old 
administration would respond to both the rebels and to nonviolent protests. His 
campaign was based largely on the promise of stability after a convulsive year 
that began with the Zapatista uprising in this impoverished state and continued 
with two major political assassinations and a rash of kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My presence in Chiapas is for peace," Zedillo said in a speech. "I come to 
Chiapas to assume the demands of those who live in conditions of misery that 
undermine the lives and dignity of thousands of men and women, especially in 
Indian communities."  
</P>
<P>
 He repeated orders to the Mexican armed forces to continue the cease-fire in 
effect since mid-January and he called for negotiation and dialogue, without 
mentioning the Zapatistas by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of both sides to prevent violence, animosities were still 
obvious.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Robledo attempted to follow Zedillo's example of conciliation 
with other parties by offering key state Cabinet posts to members of the 
opposition. When leftist Eraclio Zepeda accepted the position of Interior 
minister, Avendano called it "regrettable." The crowd around him was harsher, 
yelling, "Traitor!"  
</P>
<P>
 Avendano, a crusading newspaper publisher who was the candidate of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, made clear that his parallel government will be 
a peaceful protest that will not include taking over any government buildings. 
In other states, opposition parties have forced the governors' resignation by 
blockading government buildings, preventing the conduct of state business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lack the minimum infrastructure to be able to function, because the 
government has appropriated the goods and real estate that belong to us, the 
people," Avendano said as supporters chanted, "The people voted, Amado won." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a lot of work for us to recover peacefully that to which we have 
a right," he said. "We are going to make democracy with our own hands."  
</P>
<P>
 He proposed a constitutional convention with representatives from each county 
in the state and an electoral reform law. 
</P>
<P>
 During his inauguration speech, Robledo renewed his offer to resign if that 
would persuade the Zapatistas to lay down their arms.  
</P>
<P>
 He offered a 12-point government program that includes a new constitution with 
electoral reform, to be written by the state legislature. He also proposed an 
Indian rights law and the creation of plebiscites and referendums, which so far 
do not exist in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The new governor also came down strongly in favor of law and order, a growing 
demand in a state that many citizens say has become ungovernable. Since the 
uprising, increasing numbers of peasant groups have invaded plantations, 
demanding that the government confiscate the land and turn it over to them, a 
process known in Mexico as "redistribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides judicial reform, Robledo offered a new agrarian law "to redistribute 
that (land) which can be redistributed, make productive what has been 
redistributed and to respect that which cannot be redistributed." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized development as the key to solving the state's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs of a long history of inequality, which we have paid in 1994, have 
been very high," he said. 
</P>

160 U.S. TROOPS HURT BY RIOTING REFUGEES; PANAMA: MORE THAN 1,000 FRUSTRATED 
CUBANS BREAK OUT OF CAMPS; MOST RETURN SOON AFTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 160 U.S. soldiers suffered mostly minor injuries in two days of riots by 
rock-throwing Cuban refugees who are increasingly frustrated by their detention 
in Panama camps, Pentagon officials said here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers, most of whom suffered cuts and bruises, were hurt Wednesday 
night and Thursday when more than 1,000 refugees broke out of three 
chain-link-enclosed campsites and commandeered military vehicles in an attempt 
to flee the area near the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday evening, authorities said, most of the refugees had returned to 
the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 17 of the injured soldiers required hospital care, the most serious being 
treatment for a fractured breastbone. Among the Cubans, three were injured 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military officials said that, ironically, the disturbances began just 
hours before it was announced that some of the refugees would be granted asylum 
in Spain and that others would be given temporary asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious demonstration," Brig. Gen. James Wilson, commander of 
the U.S. refugee operation in Panama, told reporters there early Thursday. "The 
seriousness of this clearly indicates the frustration these people have with 
the uncertainty over their future." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he ordered increased security at the camps, and U.S. officials are 
checking the refugees to see how quickly some of them can qualify for asylum 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests mark the most serious disturbances at the Panama camps since the 
United States transferred nearly 9,000 Cuban refugees there in the summer. Most 
of them had been picked up at sea from flimsy boats or makeshift rafts.  
</P>
<P>
 Noting the new transfers to Spain and the United States, the general added: 
"We hope they will provide the other refugees with a sense of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Army Maj. Rick Scott, a Pentagon spokesman, said the disturbances began about 
4 p.m. Wednesday when 100 Cubans shook their chain-link fence, threw rocks and 
bottles and broke through the main gate before U.S. military police were able 
to stop them 50 feet outside the camp perimeter and move them back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reports indicate that about 40 U.S. military personnel and one Cuban received 
minor injuries," Scott said. "The most serious of which were a broken finger 
and a broken cheekbone." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday night, he said, 200 Cubans at another camp broke down a gate, 
commandeered a military Humvee and used it to knock down some of the chain-link 
fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial assessment last night was that they were demonstrating to show 
frustration with the uncertainty of their future," Scott said. "There did not 
seem to be any intent to leave and stay gone. They simply wanted their concerns 
voiced." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 9:30 a.m. Thursday, a third disturbance erupted that left 120 U.S. 
military personnel injured, again with cuts and bruises, when about 1,000 
refugees broke out of a third camp and attempted to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in Panama said the refugees soon began returning peacefully to 
the camp when they realized there was nowhere to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them hung out and a large number of them moved down the road, but 
eventually they decided to turn around and come back," Air Force 1st Lt. John 
Thomas said in a telephone interview from Panama. "Everything is getting back 
to normal now." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another military official in Panama, who asked not to be identified: 
"What they were thinking and where they were going to go, who knows? There's no 
place nearby they can go." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the U.S. military built the camps with just chain-link fencing, 
and no barbed wire or razor wire, because the refugees are not prisoners.

DESPITE PROTESTS, TURKISH COURT JAILS KURDISH LEADERS 
</P>

 A Turkish court sentenced eight elected ethnic Kurdish leaders to between 3 
1/2 and 15 years in prison Thursday, ignoring concerns expressed in the United 
States and the West that they were being jailed merely for expressing their 
views on Kurdish rights.  
</P>
<P>
 The military-dominated state security court in the capital, Ankara, accepted 
secret wiretaps and speeches to find six of the defendants guilty of working 
for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.Two 
others were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail for making separatist statements. 
They were the only two to be released pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Clinton 
Administration is "deeply concerned" about the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "These heavy sentences are shocking, incomprehensible. These sentences will 
not help Turkey's image abroad or its integration with Europe," one Western 
ambassador in Ankara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the trial will probably not divert European Union governments 
from concluding negotiations on a 1996 customs union with Turkey. But the 
European Parliament has already suspended ties with Turkey over the issue.

300 CHILDREN BELIEVED KILLED IN CHINA MOVIE THEATER FIRE; ASIA: 1,000 STUDENTS 
WERE WATCHING CULTURAL PROGRAM. BLAZE WOULD BE SECOND MAJOR FIRE DISASTER IN A 
MONTH IF UNOFFICIAL DEATH TOLL IS ACCURATE.

<P>
 Fire swept through a movie theater in the remote Xinjiang region where more 
than 1,000 schoolchildren were attending a cultural program, the official 
Guangming Daily newspaper reported today.  
</P>
<P>
 A local official in Karamay, an oil city in northwest China, said as many as 
300 children died in the blaze at the Friendship Hall cinema in that city, 
Reuters news agency reported. However, no official statement on the death toll 
had been released by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guangming Daily reported that the fire was under investigation and that 
Xinjiang officials were organizing a relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 A local broadcast official quoted by Reuters said the blaze erupted in the 
middle of a performance at the theater after an explosion believed to have been 
sparked by an electrical fault. 
</P>
<P>
 If accounts of the death toll are accurate, the fire would be the second major 
fire catastrophe in China in less than a month. On Nov. 27, in Liaoning 
province north of Beijing, 233 people, mostly students, were killed in a blaze 
at a large dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of overcrowded public halls, inadequate firefighting equipment and 
often dangerous heating systems, fire remains a major cause of death in China. 
In the first nine months of this year, for example, officials reported that 
1,300 people were killed in 27,236 fires.  
</P>
<P>
 Karamay is an oil boom town in the Junggar Basin 180 miles northwest of Urumqi 
in extreme northwest China, 100 miles from the border with Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the discovery of oil there in 1956 it was a sparsely inhabited oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992, Karamay's population was listed at 200,000. A 1992 article by the 
official New China News Agency said the city has more than 100 primary and 
middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 If the death count is confirmed, the Karamay blaze would be the most deadly in 
China since a 1979 movie theater fire, also in the Xinjiang region, that killed 
about 600 people.

LEADERS CLASH ON U.S. ROLE IN BOSNIA; POLITICS: DOLE, GINGRICH PUSH FOR GREATER 
INTERVENTION. IN BOW TO ALLIES, CLINTON FAVORS NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Recent calls from Republican congressional leaders Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich 
for an escalation of American intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina point toward a 
contentious new round of legislative and political struggles over U.S. 
involvement in Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and Gingrich, in recently blasting President Clinton for inaction and 
urging the United States to support the Bosnian Muslims with air strikes and 
arms shipments, have set the stage for bruising legislative conflicts with an 
Administration that is now pushing for a negotiated settlement to the fighting. 
But the two leaders may also be precipitating a collision with members of their 
own party who are skeptical of greater U.S. involvement in the conflict on 
either military or political grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a very full plate of a legislative agenda, which are the 
commitments we made to the American people -- and Bosnia wasn't one of those," 
said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading opponent of greater American 
military involvement in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a huge amount of support in Republican ranks for having 
a crusade on Bosnia," said one well-connected GOP strategist, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp attacks from Dole and Gingrich, the incoming Senate majority leader 
and House Speaker respectively, are bringing full circle the long and tortured 
domestic debate over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 As a presidential candidate in 1992, Clinton sounded much as Dole and Gingrich 
do today. He frequently accused President George Bush of not doing enough to 
support the Bosnian government and called for air strikes to limit or reverse 
the battlefield gains of the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In office, Clinton has repeatedly declared his support for greater use of 
force against the Bosnian Serb rebels but has been unable to persuade the 
Europeans to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 The low point came in the spring of 1993, when the Administration proposed the 
so-called "lift and strike" option -- under which the United Nations would lift 
the embargo against shipment of arms to the Bosnian government and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization would undertake widespread air strikes on military 
facilities of the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was forced to back down after the major NATO countries brusquely 
rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a frustrating series of similar confrontations that produced only 
minimal military action, the Administration moved toward the European position 
in November. After the allies rejected an Administration call for air strikes 
against Serbian forces advancing on the besieged government-held area around 
the town of Bihac, the Administration indicated that it would drop requests for 
further air strikes and instead emphasize negotiations to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 That abrupt turn in policy created the opening for the new Republican thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, on the ABC-TV program "This Week With David Brinkley," Dole laid 
out a three-step alternative to the Administration plan. The Kansas senator 
called for the removal of U.N. peacekeeping forces from Bosnia; for the United 
States unilaterally to break the international arms embargo against the Bosnian 
Muslims, and for a NATO campaign of "robust bombing" against Bosnian Serb 
military targets intended "to bring them to the negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing the same morning on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
endorsed Dole's agenda, but appeared to go even further in urging air strikes 
against the Bosnian Serbs and perhaps Serbia itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said the United States should warn the Serbs that "if you launch a 
general offensive, we would reserve the right to use air power against every 
position you have, against every command and control center, against every 
position, everywhere. We would reserve the right to take you apart, and we'd do 
it in three to five days . . . and we're telling you to just back off and 
accept an armed truce." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other Administration officials have 
denounced those proposals as a prescription for expanding the war. But many 
observers see broad similarities between Dole's approach -- if not Gingrich's 
broader discussion of bombing -- and the Administration's own ill-fated "lift 
and strike" initiative. In criticizing Dole and Gingrich, the Administration 
has sounded some of the same cautious notes about the risks of escalating the 
conflict that Bush raised against candidate Clinton in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the ironies," said Richard Haass, a senior associate at the 
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an aide on the National Security 
Council under Bush. "Now you have Republicans arguing for 'lift and strike' and 
you have Clinton -- after the campaign where he outflanked Bush early on and 
talked tough at the outset of his presidency -- coming around to a fairly 
extreme version of the Bush position." 
</P>
<P>
 In some important respects, however, the Republican leaders' plans go beyond 
even Clinton's earlier approach. While Clinton sought multilateral approval for 
lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian government, Dole and Gingrich want 
the United States to breach it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole has indicated that he intends to move quickly next year on legislation 
instructing Clinton to break the arms embargo. The Administration staunchly 
resists that proposal, arguing that shipping arms to Bosnia without U.N. 
approval would undermine compliance with other international embargoes that 
United States supports, such as the sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 But support for lifting the arms embargo has steadily grown across the 
political spectrum, and even Administration officials consider it virtually 
inevitable that Congress will approve such legislation next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue may be whether the votes exist to override a veto if Clinton 
chooses to exercise one, which White House aides say he would be inclined to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even less certain is the capacity of Dole and Gingrich to generate much 
pressure behind their calls for wider air strikes. Even Dole allies concede 
that Congress can't compel Clinton -- much less NATO -- to bomb more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 With most legislators focused on other concerns, Republican congressional 
aides say, opinion has not hardened in GOP ranks about the Dole-Gingrich push 
for wider military action in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But several sources said that GOP legislators and strategists alike will be 
cautious about investing too much political capital in demanding greater 
involvement in a war still distant to most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want the agenda next year to be, 'The Republicans change Congress,' " one 
GOP pollster said. "You don't want the story for the first two months to be, 
'The Republicans go into Bosnia.' "

U.N. TROOPS IN BOSNIA: RELIEF AND MORE GRIEF; BALKANS: SERBIAN REBELS ALLOW 
SUPPLIES TO REACH BANGLADESHIS. THEN THEY FIRE A MISSILE INTO BIHAC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the one-step-forward, two-back pattern of the U.N. mission here, officials 
secured the release of 20 Canadian captives Thursday and piloted supplies 
through to embattled Bihac while Bosnian Serb rebels attacked with missiles and 
continued to hold hundreds of other peacekeepers hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after a 14-truck convoy of food and fuel for 1,200 ill-supplied 
Bangladeshi troops was let through Croatian Serb roadblocks, Bosnian Serb 
fighters fired a surface-to-air missile into a civilian area near the main U.N. 
base in the Bihac pocket, mission spokesman Paul Risley reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Risley said the missile damage will be examined at first light today. While 
hailing the convoy's arrival as a minor breakthrough, he condemned the SA-2 
missile attack as "a weapon of terror." 
</P>
<P>
 "An SA-2 fired toward a ground target is an extremely unstable, imprecise 
missile packed with high explosives," Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs earlier in the day released 20 Canadian troops held for more 
than two weeks at a jail in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilijas, but nearly 300 other 
U.N. troops remained in detention, Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five other Canadians confined to their observation posts near the town 
of Visoko were allowed to rotate out, but their newly arrived replacements are 
still virtual prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic took hundreds of U.N. 
troops hostage after North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes in late 
November as insurance that their forces would not be hit again. Some of the 
captive peacekeepers have been starved, mistreated and used as human shields. 
</P>
<P>
 The small letups in a campaign of harassment of the U.N. Protection Force that 
is increasing the likelihood of its withdrawal underscored the nationalist 
rebels' dominant position. Repeatedly, they have demonstrated that the 
humanitarian and peacekeeping actions operate at their whim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supplies bound for the Bangladeshis were allowed through, 
Croatian Serbs detained an accompanying U.N. aid convoy in the town of Glina, 
just inside the Serb-held Krajina zone, Risley said. The aid was bound for the 
Bihac region's mostly Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission has been informed by the No. 2 in command of the Bosnian Serb 
army, Gen. Milan Gvero, that U.N. troops will remain captive and humanitarian 
works will be blocked until NATO warplanes abandon Bosnian skies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serb military authorities are quite adamant that they are not 
going to give us the necessary safety and security guarantees for resumption of 
the humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo airport," said the mission's chief 
spokesman, Michael Williams. "They have said they are unwilling to do so while 
they are still under threat of NATO air power." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams acknowledged the increasing appearance of rebel missile batteries 
around potential air strike targets had forced a reduction in NATO overflights, 
as the pilots have no authorization from the U.N. mission to destroy the 
antiaircraft missiles threatening them. 
</P>
<P>
 The air defense systems, which Western diplomats and NATO officials believe 
were provided by Serbs in the rump Yugoslavia, now provide cover over at least 
40% of Bosnian territory, Williams said.

 The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that North Korea 
has frozen its nuclear program as agreed and is cooperating fully with the 
agency. In an address to the IAEA board of governors in Vienna, Hans Blix said 
a technical team that visited North Korea last month found that "facilities 
subject to the freeze were not in operation and that construction work had 
stopped." He said a "few remaining areas require further technical 
consideration and discussion."

CLINTON SIGNS TRADE BILL, REBUTS CLAIMS HIS POLICIES HARM WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton signed legislation Thursday authorizing U.S. participation 
in a tariff-slashing world trade agreement, which passed Congress by lopsided 
margins in a rare lame-duck session. 
</P>
<P>
 At the signing ceremony in the Organization of American States headquarters, 
Clinton defended his trade policy against critics who say it will pit U.S. 
workers against low-wage employees abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must never run away from the world," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of the trade accord with 123 nations said the World Trade Organization it 
establishes represents an unprecedented infringement on American sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also charged that the pact, by lowering U.S. barriers to trade, 
would make American workers more vulnerable to competition from low-wage 
workers in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Bill! You're selling out!" shouted a man with a megaphone outside the 
OAS building as Clinton climbed out of his limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was joined by about a dozen fellow protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 With flags from dozens of countries draped from a marble wall above his head, 
Clinton told 400 free-trade supporters in the cavernous main hall, "Yes, it is 
true that one of the reasons for stagnant wages in the United States is intense 
competition in our own markets and in other markets from people who work for 
wages our folks couldn't live on." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "That would happen if there is never another trade agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, Clinton said, American workers will benefit from his efforts 
to open markets under the world trade agreement, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group. 
</P>
<P>
 "America cannot and will not succeed . . . until we have more folks buying 
what we sell," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say the answer is to try to hunker down within our borders. That is 
clearly not an option. No country can escape the global economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22,000-page agreement cuts global tariffs by 38% and knocks down other 
barriers to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton's signature, almost 40 countries have now approved the agreement 
and another 40 are expected to do so before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Trade Organization will police trade disputes once the accord takes 
effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In signing the trade accord, Clinton was flanked by members of his economic 
team, departing House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and incoming Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who forced concessions from the White House 
in return for his support for the new world trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bipartisan victories are the best victories," Vice President Al Gore said.

FOR MIAMI, SUMMIT IS A CHANCE TO SHOW ITS STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With leaders of 33 foreign countries planning to be present, the Summit of the 
Americas promises to be a huge international event. But on the eve of the 
historic weekend conference hosted by President Clinton, the stakes for Miami 
may loom even larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, big show, a celebration for Miami and a chance for the city to 
clean up its image," said Eduardo A. Gamarra, acting director of the Latin 
American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University. "What Miami 
can do is demonstrate its political maturity, transcend exile politics and show 
that the city can indeed be the site of one of these international meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 In a metropolitan area routinely ablaze with impassioned Cuban exile politics, 
and just this week ranked again by the FBI as No. 1 in the nation in violent 
crime, summit planners are praying that all international incidents are 
confined to the official meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, the world will know. More than 4,500 journalists are expected to be on 
hand to record and analyze every word and gesture of the presidents and prime 
ministers, as well as those uttered by scores of top diplomats and U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of media attention, even the Super Bowl -- which, incidentally, takes 
place here Jan. 29 -- pales. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami was picked as the summit site after intensive lobbying from, among 
others, Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and Miami lawyer Hugh Rodham, the 
President's brother-in-law and an unsuccessful Senate candidate. The also-rans: 
Los Angeles and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestige of hosting the first such summit in 27 years -- and the first in 
the United States -- could not only burnish Miami's image as the commercial 
gateway to Latin America, but provide a positive jolt to South Florida's 
sagging tourist economy. Dade County's poshest hotels, finest caterers and 
biggest limousine services have been booked solid for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Security will be intense. Besides local police, more than 1,000 U.S. Secret 
Service agents, along with up to 4,000 other law enforcement officers from the 
FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and even Florida National Guard troops, will be 
mobilized. Included in those ranks will be rooftop sharpshooters, SWAT teams 
and frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the Pope a few years ago (Pope John Paul II, in 1987), and the 
hurricane (Andrew, 1992), but this is without doubt the largest security effort 
ever," said Pat Brickman, a spokesman for Metro-Dade's 2,900-member police 
force, which switched to 12-hour shifts Thursday before Clinton's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of hosting the summit are enormous. Dade County officials say police 
overtime alone could top $2.5 million. The city of Miami expects to spend 
$800,000 on police overtime and supplies. Miami, Coral Gables and the county 
already have spent $15 million to plant 20,000 trees and repave 240 miles of 
roadway over which the prime ministers and presidents will be chauffeured from 
one gala to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 34 national leaders will go home with a bagful of gifts, including 
nine Swatch watches, a sterling silver paperweight, an art deco ceramic pot, a 
leather-bound journal from Tiffany and a $400 crystal globe in a Brazilian wood 
presentation box. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Beach has budgeted $130,000 just to throw a welcome party Thursday for 
the working journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there will be several political demonstrations. The largest 
promises to be what is billed as a "silent march" of Cuban exiles Saturday 
through the streets of Little Havana to the Orange Bowl, where up to 100,000 
people will listen to anti-Castro speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Art, music and entertainment are on the agenda too. A galaxy of stars, 
including Tito Puente, Liza Minnelli and Rita Marley are to perform Saturday in 
a Kennedy Center Gala of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Miami skyscrapers have been spotlighted with a rainbow of colors, 
while the homeless encampments under nearby freeways have been bulldozed. The 
occupants have either gone into shelters or scattered.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EMPTY POCKETS; FINANCE: BONDS HAVE BEEN A MAJOR 
FUNDING SOURCE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AGENCIES THAT USED THEM FOR PROJECTS WILL HAVE 
TO SEEK OTHER METHODS NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a junkie suddenly without a fix, Orange County government agencies long 
dependent on borrowed funds -- in the form of regular bond issues -- are being 
forced to quit cold turkey as the county's plunging credit ratings have made it 
all but impossible to issue new paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's bankruptcy filing, and the subsequent downgrading of bond 
ratings, threaten the very core of municipal finance in Orange County -- the 
financing method of choice for public projects from new communications 
equipment to schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond issues have soared since 1978, when the landmark Proposition 13 tax 
initiative severely curtailed government's ability to raise property taxes. 
County municipalities and public agencies have gone to the public 544 times 
since 1980, issuing $21.3 billion worth of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was the busiest, with 121 issues totaling $4.9 billion, according to 
Securities Data Co.  
</P>
<P>
 The current uncertainty has forced officials to reconsider how to finance a 
proposed $94-million upgrade of the county's antiquated emergency 
telecommunications system, said Bert Scott, director of Orange County's General 
Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonds were an option, but they're clearly not an option anymore," he said. 
"The most likely option now is for the vendor, Motorola, to finance it 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, meanwhile, 
were trying to determine what will happen to a planned $1.4-billion bond issue 
next spring. The borrowing is needed to finance a 23-mile toll road through the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bond ratings are separate from the county's rating," agency spokeswoman 
Lisa Telles said. "So we don't know how it's going to affect our bond sale at 
this time. We're working on assessing that." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, neither the federal nor the state government has shown an inclination 
to guarantee Orange County bonds, a step that could restore county agencies' 
ability to turn to the bond market for financing. The federal government 
guaranteed New York City's bonds in the 1970s, but only after congressional 
action. Gov. Pete Wilson said Thursday he does not expect the state to provide 
any money to help the county get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Standard & Poor's downgraded the rating on $1.58 billion in 
county bonds, dropping some from a solid AA- to CCC, a level below investment 
grade and an indication of high risk and uncertainty. Most investors won't 
touch CCC bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service rated $26 million of commercial 
paper issued by some Orange County sanitation districts as "not prime," 
indicating that notes that matured on that day were not paid, said Nicole 
Johnson, an assistant vice president. (The districts did not default, however, 
because Lehman Bros. agreed to pick up the loan.) 
</P>
<P>
 For a new issue, dropping the credit rating just from AA to BBB can 
significantly increase the cost of borrowing (expressed in the interest paid on 
a bond), boosting it as much as one or two percentage points a year. On a bond 
issue of $100 million, that amounts to $1 million to $2 million extra in annual 
interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not counting insurance or other costs that agencies may have to 
pony up if their credit ratings fall below the level typically accepted by 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 If an agency is rated below BBB, it typically will not proceed with an issue, 
bond market analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the ability to borrow, Orange County government has few alternatives 
for raising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Most operating funds come from property and sales taxes, but because of state 
laws -- including Proposition 13 -- the county cannot raise either.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County could increase business license and hotel occupancy taxes in 
unincorporated areas. But even those types of taxes may require voter approval, 
said Steve Mayer, a San Francisco lawyer who specializes in advising local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities, schools and special districts also depend on a share of property and 
sales taxes for their operations, but these entities have a little more leeway 
in raising taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fullerton, for example, last year imposed a 2% utility tax to 
cover a $3-million shortfall in its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe cities in the county will also look at imposing fees -- for 
everything from getting copies of records to using city parks. But those 
generally require a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a political cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Catlin lost his job as Fullerton's mayor largely because of the new 
utility tax. "When we put a 25-cent charge for copying . . . one guy came at me 
with a vengeance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, officials of special districts figure they would have difficulty 
justifying rate increases for water, sanitation and other services, when 
service would not be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, several Orange County municipalities say, lower bond ratings will 
have little effect on their plans. Indeed, many agencies said they had no plans 
to float new bonds in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a typical year we wouldn't borrow," said Yorba Linda Assistant City 
Manager David Gruchow. The city "only issues debt when (there are) favorable 
market conditions or (there is a) real need to do a large project that we don't 
have cash for." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Fountain Valley, which last issued redevelopment bonds in 1985, has 
no intention of floating a new issue. "There is ample money left from bonds 
sold years ago to take care of whatever projects are needed or anticipated, and 
we don't anticipate doing any additional borrowing," said Fountain Valley City 
Manager Raymond H. Kromer. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Mayor George Brown sounded a hopeful note. "Frankly, I don't think 
that (low) rating will stay very long," he said. "I think it will recover 
rather rapidly. Muni bonds are a good investment." 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take time for Orange County credit ratings to rise back to their 
previous high levels. "We don't like to flip-flop on our ratings, so it's not 
done lightly," said Moody's Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say it never happens. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Washington Public Power Supply System defaulted on $2.25 billion in 
bonds in 1983 -- the biggest municipal bond failure at the time -- credit 
ratings plunged. But subsequent bond issues earned much better credit ratings. 
By 1990, the agency was selling as many bonds as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, the system's bonds were rated AA by Moody's.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ANALYSTS SAY THE BASIC ECONOMY IS STILL STRONG; 
REPORT: EXPECTED CREATION OF JOBS NEXT YEAR COULD DECREASE BY UP TO 5,000, 
ANNUAL SURVEY FINDS, MUCH OF IT RELATED TO PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The $1.5-billion investment loss that drove Orange County into bankruptcy 
could cost the county several thousand future jobs and slow economic growth 
through the end of the decade, economists at Chapman University said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county will probably not fall back into recession, the declining 
value of its investment portfolio could erase 4,000 to 5,000 of the 21,000 new 
jobs that had earlier been forecast for 1995, according to projections unveiled 
at the annual presentation of the Orange County Economic Forecast, compiled by 
Chapman's Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 1999, the county's financial crisis could reduce the number of created 
jobs by 25,000, said Esmael Adibi, the economist who heads the research unit 
and performs Chapman's long-range forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the job loss would be related to public works projects now on hold, 
including toll roads, a new sports stadium and new public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The total impact of the county's bankruptcy filing is harder to predict, the 
economists said, but a modest ripple effect is virtually assured. That could 
include a decrease of $100 million in annual taxable sales -- about 0.3% of the 
total -- and a $540-million decline in the gross county product, the measure of 
all goods and services produced. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the financial crisis, the economists said, the gross county 
product for 1995 is now projected at $81.8 billion, off nearly 1% from earlier 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a dampening, but not a death blow," Chapman economist and 
President James Doti told a crowd of more than 1,000 business and political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the height of a financial panic in Orange County right now with 
fear, anger and confusion making it difficult to see," Doti added. "But our 
analysis shows the county has a strong fundamental economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The usually circumspect Doti chastised Robert L. Citron for "a move of 
desperation" during the summer when the former county treasurer tried to recoup 
losses by moving even further into high-risk securities. The former treasurer, 
Doti said, was "hoping irrationally to recover" from his disastrous investment 
strategies "by doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the county, after revealing huge losses in risky investments by 
Citron's office, became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's investments went sour because he bet that interest rates would fall, 
which would have boosted the value of the bonds he bought. Doti said he could 
not understand the former treasurer's strategy. "By March of this year," he 
said, "there were no forecasters predicting that interest rates would drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Chapman's forecast for 1995 calls for declining long-term interest 
rates. Doti said bonds such as those on which Citron lost money this year could 
increase in value by 16% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Economic Research has been tracking Orange County's annual 
economy since 1981 and is heralded by other forecasters for its high degree of 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's 1995 forecast prepared a week before the county's financial 
crisis broke had predicted an increase of 21,000 jobs on government and private 
payrolls for the year -- the first overall job growth since 1990 -- and an 
increase of 105,000 jobs by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loss from the investment fund is only $1.5 billion, Doti said, there 
would be an increase of 17,000 jobs in 1995 and 84,000 jobs by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The losses are bad," Doti said, "but it would be much more devastating to the 
county's economy if there was a tax increase to try to make up for the losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Chapman forecasters see the county on the road to recovery, they 
predicted that a mild national recession will occur in 1996. But underlying 
strengths, including healthy foreign trade and high-technology research 
sectors, as well as a rapidly recovering construction industry, will "put the 
county back in its accustomed role" of leading the nation out of recessions, 
Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, Orange County, along with the rest of California, has 
had a much weaker economy than much of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, the economists said they do not expect the county's 
bankruptcy to depress individual earnings. The median family income is expected 
to rise 2% to $55,507 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do they expect the construction industry's long-awaited rebound to stall. 
Doti said he expects the value of new construction projects, mostly home 
building, to rise 17% next year to $2.6 billion. Because most of the 
construction projected is in residential properties, the economists say, that 
will soften the blow to the industry from decreased spending for public works 
after the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman forecast does call for Orange County's average home price to fall 
next year, though. The forecast is for an average decrease of 2.6%, the fifth 
consecutive annual decline. But from 1996 through 1999, Adibi said, homeowners 
and home buyers can expect residential property values to increase, topping out 
with a gain of 7.6% for 1999.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Orange County Outlook 
</P>
<P>
 Economists at Chapman University predicted Thursday that Orange County's 
economy will continue growing at a slow but steady pace in 1995 despite the 
county's bankruptcy filing. Chapman compiles employment indicators that seek to 
predict job levels. Year-to-year percentage change in employment projected 
through 1999: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman employment Indicator (1999): 4.21% 
</P>
<P>
 Employment % change (1999): 2.80% 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Values 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for resold homes are expected to undergo a fifth consecutive year of 
depreciation and not turn positive until 1997. Percentage change from previous 
year: 
</P>
<P>
 1999: 7.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Job Creation 
</P>
<P>
 The increase of about 21,000 new jobs forecast for 1995 will be reduced by 
4,000 to 5,000, the economists say, and further job growth will be reduced 
through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 1995: 21.2 
</P>
<P>
 Taxable sales 
</P>
<P>
 Taxable sales are expected to continue their upward trend, increasing 3.1% 
next year after being adjusted for inflation. Annual percentage change after 
inflation adjustment: 
</P>
<P>
 1995: 3.1% 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; WILSON SAYS COUNTY SHOULD NOT EXPECT STATE BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said Thursday that he is sympathetic to Orange County's 
plight but does not expect the state to provide any money to help the county 
get back on its fiscal feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is eager to be helpful," Wilson said. "But we are not in a position 
where we can bail out bad judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, speaking to reporters in San Diego, said the state has virtually no 
role to play in the crisis because local governments in California have the 
power to manage their own finances and the responsibility to do so wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legally, the counties, the local governments in California have great 
autonomy, and very clearly they have had great flexibility on how to invest 
their local funds," Wilson said, according to a transcript provided by his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it seems clear that whatever their good intentions, at least in several 
cases they have invested in a very risky fashion. The state . . . has no legal 
responsibility to counties or to cities, no oversight at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's advice for the county: bring in a person to manage what remains of 
its investment fund who can "restore some confidence" and begin to work out the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson apparently played a role in the county's appointment of Thomas W. 
Hayes, the former state treasurer and the governor's first finance director, to 
help manage the fund. Wilson said he was confident the county could recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "They obviously are a government, as are other investors in that fund," Wilson 
said. "They continue to receive revenue from taxes, from fees, and that will 
continue to be the case. They have to devise a plan that will allow them to pay 
off creditors and do so (in a way) that is fair to those who continue to rely 
upon them for daily services." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said there "may well be a need" for legislation to prevent this 
kind of debacle from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the Legislature will want to look at that, and I encourage them to 
do so," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's position on Orange County is consistent with how he stood the last 
time a major government agency in California went belly up. In 1991, when the 
Richmond Unified School District in the San Francisco Bay Area spent itself 
into bankruptcy and sought an emergency loan from the state, Wilson rejected 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a court ordered the state to aid the school district, Wilson 
resisted. Ultimately, he was forced to go along. But he warned that the 
$19-million loan would encourage other districts to spend beyond their means 
with the assurance that the state would bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, the governor believes the state should not act as a banker 
to local and county authorities, nor is it in a fiscal position to do so," said 
Sean Walsh, the governor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County case, Wilson has been closely monitoring the situation 
through aides and in telephone conversations with county officials. Earlier 
this week he considered dispatching a team of financial experts to the county 
but so far has not done so.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THE MECHANICS OF A BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it that bond owners lose money as market interest rates rise? Think of 
a seesaw, with a bond's price on one end and its yield on the other. The two 
ends always move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take the example of a U.S. Treasury 30-year bond issued in 1993. An investor 
who bought it new paid $1,000 for a security that will pay 6.25% interest, or 
$62.50, annually for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That may have seemed like a decent enough return at the time. But since then, 
market interest rates have zoomed. Today, investors are demanding a yield of 
8.1% on new 30-year T-bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the older T-bond still are earning 6.25%, and if he hold the bond 
to maturity he'll get his full $1,000 back, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if he tries to sell the bond now, buyers naturally will demand that the 
yield match the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that, the bond's price is marked down. Instead of $1,000, the 
market price of the bond today is about $793, a 21% decline from what the 
original investors paid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Divide annual interest earnings of $62.50 by $793 and you get a 'current" 
yield of about 7.9% for a new buyer. And by factoring in the added return 
expected by reinvesting the bond's annual interest earnings, the true 
yield-called "yield to maturity'-works out to about 8.1%, thereby matching the 
market.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if market yields begin to decline again? As the seesaw analogy 
implies, the bond's price will rise accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $1,000 
</P>
<P>
 Yield: 6.25%  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $793 
</P>
<P>
 Yield: 8.1%

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; MEETINGS OF SUPERVISORS IN SECRET DRAW FIRE; 
ACCOUNTABILITY: OTHER GOVERNMENT BODIES FOLLOW SUIT IN CRISIS. THE LAW IS 
UNCLEAR; SOME SAY ACTIONS HEIGHTEN PUBLIC'S FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting well before dawn Monday, the County Board of Supervisors set a new 
record for meeting secretly in a single day: 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Tuesday, after Orange County sought bankruptcy protection and the 
financial crisis made national headlines, the supervisors huddled again for 
nearly five hours -- behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Again on Wednesday and Thursday -- in the midst of what has become the worst 
financial debacle in the county's history -- the supervisors, city managers and 
city attorneys, school trustees and the massive Transportation Corridor 
Agencies board members all held separate meetings to ponder the crisis. Once 
again, all over the county, the public was excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Thursday, a frustrated Stephen Johnson of Tustin could take it no 
longer. Johnson, 48, a lawyer, leaped to his feet and shouted at the 
supervisors, his words ringing throughout the tense Hall of Administration 
boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hide behind your lawyers forever!" Johnson screamed at the board 
members, who ignored his pleas. "Sooner or later you're going to have to come 
out here and face the people and admit your lack of leadership in this matter!" 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth Frank, who attended closed-door meetings 
Wednesday and Thursday, said that as bothersome as these sessions may be to the 
public, this is the only way business can be conducted sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are basically staff meetings, which give us a chance to be briefed by 
the county," Frank said. "There is really no requirement for city managers to 
invite newspapers and the public to our meetings. . . . I guess we could just 
meet in the Coliseum and invite the whole county." 
</P>
<P>
 But meetings attended by elected officials, such as supervisors and school 
district trustees, are a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, according to California's Ralph M. Brown Act, adopted in 1953, a 
governing body such as a board of supervisors or city council must meet 
publicly except under four specific circumstances: To discuss personnel issues, 
pending litigation, labor negotiations or real estate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the act is clouded by many exceptions, said Matt Ross, a spokesman for the 
state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code is virtually impossible to interpret and every situation is 
different," Ross said. "There are no hard and fast rules and there isn't a 
quick and easy guide to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's five supervisors have been advised by their attorneys not to 
talk about potential litigation that might arise from the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the crisis, board members have consistently made themselves 
available to reporters after the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This board has been very, very committed to the fact that we stay within the 
regulations," said board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, adding that there has been 
no attempt to bypass the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said that any actions taken in closed session -- but not details of the 
discussions -- are promptly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been very difficult for all of us," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., said the supervisors 
are probably meeting behind closed doors for good reason, "because they don't 
want people to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 "However, it's having the opposite effect. It's leading to fear because people 
don't know what's going on," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Holton, executive director of California Common Cause, said the 
supervisors' meetings should be open so people can watch how dramatic decisions 
are being made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meeting in secrecy isolates elected officials and gives the impression that 
they are making decisions solely to benefit themselves," Holton said. "In the 
end, it behooves them to be accountable. . . . After all, they are dealing with 
Orange County's financial future." 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers, a longtime adversary of county 
officials over fiscal matters and founder of Citizens Against Unfair Taxation, 
called the secrecy typical Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens go down to that boardroom and we are treated like dumbbells," 
said Rogers, who has crusaded for eight years against such things as Measure M, 
which raised local sales taxes 1/2 cent for transportation projects. "These 
guys are like a private club. There are the ins, and then there are the rest of 
us -- the outs."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; IRREVERENT FOREIGN PRESS TAKES AIM AT HOME OF THE 
'CALIFORNIA DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM RUTTEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Of all places, opulent and enterprising Orange County -- the garden sprawl to 
the south of Los Angeles where the California Dream has been delivered in 
abundance to 2.3 million residents -- is the last to expect talk of a 
municipality defaulting on its debt."  
</P>
<P>
 So muses London's Economist in the first paragraph of a lengthy explanatory 
piece in its forthcoming issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The British news weekly, almost as well known for its irreverence as for its 
knowledgeable reporting, could not resist the temptation of heading its story 
"Citron presse" -- French for lemonade and a play on the name of former Orange 
County Treasurer Robert L. Citron, architect of the county's discredited 
investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economist was arch. But overall, foreign and domestic reaction to Orange 
County's investment debacle was muted Thursday -- constrained not only by the 
story's complexity, but also perhaps by a sense that the region's financial 
folly is as singular as its geographic virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Thursday edition, Britain's authoritative Financial Times focused on 
the bankruptcy's potential impact on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "In time, the outraged taxpayers of Orange County will want their revenge," 
wrote the FT's Tony Jackson. "It may extend not merely to the officials who 
lost $1.5 billion of their money, but also to the Wall Street firms which 
profited by helping them." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's wealth and conservative politics provided a jumping-off point 
for most of the coverage in the British press. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Times of London headlined its front page story: "Investment 
fund crash bankrupts home of the rich." The left-leaning Guardian's headline 
was "Derivatives crash busts U.S. county." 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent ran its story under the heading, "Scandal rocks Nixon 
heartland." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the headline, "Also in Money Paradise You Can Go Bankrupt," Germany's 
popular Bild tabloid wrote: "Orange County is one of the richest areas of the 
globe. Wide, fruitful landscapes, soft hills. The farmers drive air-conditioned 
400 PS tractors over their farmland and at night they switch to 600-Benz 
limousines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plantations to the horizon. In between hundreds of high-tech . . . 
enterprises, there is Disneyland, California -- millions of visitors every 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now the Orangeland is finished. Mr. Citron (which in German also means lemon) 
has bargained everything away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of cities and companies in the U.S. are in a similar situation. The 
stock exchange shakes: Who is next? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday it was published: Even the U.S. capital Washington is nearly 
bankrupt. The garbage collectors don't work, and fire brigades don't work 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich America? Poor country!" 
</P>
<P>
 In France, coverage was sparse, though the left-leaning Parisian daily, 
Liberation, also homed in on the unregulated and speculative nature of Orange 
County's investments.  
</P>
<P>
 "This misadventure launches anew the question of control of sophisticated 
financial products," the paper wrote. "The discomfiture of Orange County helped 
make a little clearer the insistent problems tied to the famous secondary 
markets. . . . The player in the secondary markets can really find himself 
totally naked." 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, readers of the Globe and Mail, the national newspaper, were 
informed Thursday on the financial page that "Orange County, home of 
Disneyland, bedrock Republicans and some of the richest people in North 
America, was reeling yesterday in the aftermath of an unprecedented filing for 
bankruptcy protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, consumed with a dramatic presidential transition of power and a crisis 
in its southernmost state of Chiapas, gave Orange County's financial situation 
little more than a few-second mention on the evening news and a single brief in 
the morning newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic reaction to Orange County's dilemma generally was confined to 
municipal officials eager to point out that "it can't happen here" and 
professional money managers equally eager to downplay the crisis' impact on the 
broader financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (bond) buyers and traders that I talk with are saying this is an isolated 
situation," said Kenneth Woods, president of Asset Preservation Advisors Inc. 
of Atlanta, who manages $100 million in fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Allen, director of financial and administrative services for Broward 
County, Fla., saw the bankruptcy as a warning to fellow financial officials. 
"All public officers should be looking at their own houses," he said. "I am not 
surprised about another jurisdiction being burned with derivatives. It was 
bound to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "We know exactly the hole they dug for themselves," said Calvin Smith, a 
financial specialist for Multnomah County in Portland, Ore. "They were fat and 
happy for years. But nothing goes one way forever." 
</P>
<P>
 This story was reported by Times staff writers Mark Fineman in Mexico City, 
Scott Kraft in Paris, Marjorie Miller in Bonn, Craig Turner in Toronto and 
William Tuohy in London, with researchers John Beckham in Chicago, Doug Conner 
in Seattle, Lianne Hart in Houston, Cecilia Rasmussen in Los Angeles, Ann Rovin 
in Denver, Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna M. Virtue in Miami.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR PROJECTS IN PROGRESS; PUBLIC 
WORKS: FROM A POLICE COMPLEX IN SANTA ANA TO A NEW TOLL HIGHWAY, THE BANKRUPTCY 
FILING HAS RAISED FEARS ABOUT CONTINUED FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Valle is helping to build a jail and police administration complex. He 
just hopes he'll get a chance to finish his work. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the future of the $107-million facility, financed by the 
biggest bond sale ever offered by the city for a single project, is now in 
question after the county's bankruptcy petition to ward of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of concerned now," said the 30-year-old Lakewood construction 
laborer. "It was the topic of discussion at lunch" at the facility, which is 
about 20% completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle is not alone in his worry that county funds may dry up. Workers 
throughout Orange County whose projects are tied to county funding expressed 
similar uneasiness about their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard anything yet and I'm kind of surprised," said one 
construction worker at the Santa Ana site who refused to give his name. "Under 
these circumstances, anybody would be concerned about their livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is building three major toll 
roads in Orange County, officials also expressed nervousness over the 
bankruptcy fallout. Officials offered a nervous prognosis: Their projects 
appear to be safe in the short term, but a cloud of uncertainty and fear hovers 
over the long-term picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the moment, there's no sense of alarm," said agency spokeswoman Lisa 
Telles. "But we are extremely busy. We're trying to figure out how this is 
going to impact our projects, and more importantly, can we meet our payments? 
In the short term, we can. For the moment, we're not concerned with meeting 
payrolls, accounts payable or stopping any construction." 
</P>
<P>
 But as for the long term, "At this point, we just don't know if we have 
long-term problems," Telles said. "Our numerous bondholders and investors have 
the same questions the press has, and at the moment, we don't have answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said the agency issued $1.1 billion in bonds for the San Joaquin 
Transportation Corridor in March, 1993, and $78 million for the 
Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor. "But I don't know how many 
bondholders we have for either one," Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint powers authority of the Transportation Corridor Agencies -- which 
receives one-third of its funding from the county -- has launched one of the 
most ambitious transportation projects in the history of Southern California, 
and any hitch now, Telles said, could have a devastating impact. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mission Viejo, the county's fiscal mess will at the minimum cause delays in 
a $2.5-million library project, which depends on special tax revenues collected 
by the county. The Board of Supervisors was slated to approve turning over 
library tax receipts Dec. 13 in order to move the project ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's financial disaster has placed those plans on hold, said 
county Librarian John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one example of the tremendous complications bankruptcy has 
caused," said Adams, who added that county administrators haven't contacted him 
about the Mission Viejo situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers distanced from the swirl of media coverage around Orange County's 
debacle doubted the trouble would cost them their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard all kinds of rumors. We've heard they were going to shut things 
down because there's no funding," said Jack Kobel, an ironworker from Anaheim 
who works on the Santa Ana facility. "But I'm not paying any attention to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, workers at the Crown Valley Parkway overpass construction site of 
the San Joaquin Hills Corridor tollway seemed unconcerned about how the 
county's fiscal crisis would affect the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kidding and joking around about it yesterday," said engineer Hank 
Sostrom, who works for a contractor building the toll road. "This is a real big 
piece of work and there's a lot of work left. I can't see anybody stopping us."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; VOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Orange County residents reacted with frustration and anger at the 
county's financial crisis. Here is a sampling of comments received from readers 
invited to telephone the newspaper's TimesLine number with their comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose I am ultimately responsible for this financial crisis because I 
voted for Robert Citron knowing the riskiness of his investments had been 
questioned, but I thought that was just Republicans being sour grapes. If I had 
realized that he was investing in derivatives, that would have been a trigger 
for me because I have been concerned about the danger of derivative investing. 
I wish I had understood more about what was happening and perhaps I might have 
voted differently. But I think we, in the electorate, are ultimately 
responsible. I think the supervisors are doing the only thing they could in 
filing for bankruptcy to prevent a run on the bank at this point."

 "This bankruptcy shows just how desperate public officials are to spend even 
more taxpayer funds. For example, four Orange County school districts borrowed 
millions at low rates to gamble on even higher rates and more money for their 
self-serving projects. This shows just how desperately we need another even 
more restrictive Proposition 13 to keep public officials from bankrupting us."

 "I am very concerned about the impact on our services and our quality of life. 
A lot of things are going to suffer. I am very concerned about the impact on 
our education. This demonstrates to me once again that our elected politicians 
are basically politicians full of rhetoric and yet do not have the abilities to 
run and manage money for the citizenship as a business. It is unconscionable to 
me that this amount of money has been invested and allowed to be lost without 
any kind of oversight or any kind of audit trail. I think the citizenship of 
the county of Orange should be very upset and I think that it almost borders on 
malfeasance."

 "Definitely, there is a lack of investment philosophy for this O.C. portfolio. 
This philosophy would tell you what to invest in or not to invest in, or how 
much to leverage or not leverage at all. I can't understand how leveraging is 
allowed for this kind of portfolio, because Orange County is not in the 
business of making money, but to provide services. In order to provide service 
you have maintain solvency. There must be some sort of checking or control 
system. How could the discretion of investing funds fall on such a few 
individuals' shoulders, such as Mr. Citron? Do they have some sort of committee 
that would actively oversee his demeanor? Or just a bunch of rubber stamps?"

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THE 'NUMBERS CRUNCHER'; PEOPLE: FORMER STATE 
TREASURER THOMAS W. HAYES IS KNOWN FOR CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND 
EXPERTISE IN GOVERNMENT FINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the man picked Thursday to help lead 
Orange County out of its financial bind, is regarded as an accomplished money 
manager with a deep knowledge of government financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 As state treasurer for two years, Hayes, 48, was responsible for the 
management of California's $20-billion investment portfolio and earned $3.2 
billion in profits on the investments during his tenure as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed state treasurer by former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to 
replace the late Jesse M. Unruh in 1989, Hayes then ran for the office and lost 
to Kathleen Brown the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known for his conservative investment practices, and during his 
unsuccessful campaign for treasurer in 1990 Hayes was criticized by Brown for 
earning less on the state's investment fund than Orange County was earning on 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
 A mild, soft-spoken man, Hayes was not registered with any political party 
until he was appointed by Deukmejian and registered as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown defeated him in the 1990 election, Hayes was appointed state 
finance director by Gov. Pete Wilson. As finance director, he served as 
California's chief fiscal adviser and was responsible for preparing 
California's $60-billion state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the ins and outs of state government," Wilson said of Hayes when he 
appointed him. "He is well respected by legislators and administrators from 
both sides of the political aisle. I cannot think of anyone better equipped to 
steer us through the budgetary shoals ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes served as chairman or a member of 60 authorities, boards and commissions 
dealing with virtually every aspect of state government, including the Public 
Employees Retirement Board and the State Teachers Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned as state finance director in July, 1993, to become managing 
director of Metropolitan West Securities Inc., a Los Angeles-based brokerage 
firm, a post he currently holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan specializes in advising and trading for major pension funds, 
investment funds, private corporations and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a politician," said Donna Lucas, who served as Hayes' campaign 
manager and director of public affairs. "He is a financial manager, and one of 
the most highly regarded financial experts in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas added that both as state treasurer and while he was running for the 
office, Hayes "continually said counties and cities should require individuals 
who serve in the role of treasurers to have solid financial backgrounds and 
investment expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 During the state treasurer's campaign, Brown described Hayes as a "numbers 
cruncher" inexperienced as a public policy leader. She also accused Hayes of 
not moving quickly enough to sell the bonds the voters had approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes defended his record by saying he sold bonds as soon as the law allowed. 
He said bonds are sold as state and public agencies use the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes was Deukmejian's second choice to be state treasurer after his first 
nominee, now Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, was rejected by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats feared that Lungren, a former GOP congressman, would pose a 
potent political threat for governor or another statewide office somewhere down 
the line, a threat not seen in Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes was the state's auditor general for 10 years before his confirmation as 
state treasurer. During this time, he signed more than 600 reports sent to the 
Legislature that recommended $400 million in savings to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes has received two national awards for his achievements in financial 
management. He has an MBA from San Jose State University. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Mary, have two daughters, Christy, 23, and Shannon, 21.

BROWN SAYS STATE MAY LEGALIZE VIDEO GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Continued budget woes could prompt California legislators to legalize the use 
of video poker and slot machines in some form next year, Assemblyman Willie 
Brown told gaming industry executives and analysts Thursday at the American 
Gaming Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think gaming activities will be expanded to boost general funds, which 
we so desperately need," said Brown, the longtime Assembly Speaker who is in a 
bitter battle to retain that job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm clearly optimistic that, in 1995, we will be able to authorize something 
involving gambling," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a Democrat, predicted that existing California racetracks will be 
allowed to have video poker and slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of gaming in California is an emotionally charged issue, with 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson opposed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Las Vegas should not worry about the spread of gambling in Southern 
California. "With 32 million people, I don't think you will change their habits 
much," he said. "People have been coming to Caesars for 20 years."

DEMOCRATIC WHIP CALLS FOR ETHICS PROBE OF GINGRICH; POLITICS: AN OUTSIDE 
COUNSEL IS SOUGHT TO FIND OUT IF THE INCOMING SPEAKER'S COLLEGE COURSE IS TRULY 
EDUCATIONAL OR A THINLY VEILED PROPAGANDA EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The second-ranking Democrat in the House called Thursday for the appointment 
of an outside counsel to investigate whether incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) has violated House ethics rules and federal tax codes with his network 
of political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations, already under review by the House Ethics Committee, suggest 
that the Republican leader used monies and organizations that were designated 
as nonpartisan to recruit, fund and train Republican candidates and party 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the multitude of unanswered questions, ethical allegations and serious 
conflicts of interest faced by the incoming Speaker of the House, I believe 
that it is imperative that we have an independent, nonpartisan . . . outside 
counsel to carry forward this investigation," said Rep. David E. Bonior 
(D-Mich.), the incoming House minority whip. "If Mr. Gingrich has nothing to 
hide, he will have nothing to fear from this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior's proposal was immediately denounced as "ill-considered" by Gingrich's 
office. "The matter is currently pending before the ethics committee of the 
103rd Congress," said Gingrich press spokesman Tony Blankley, "and I fully 
expect that committee to favorably complete its deliberations," before the new 
Congress convenes on Jan. 4 and its jurisdiction ends. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the complaint is whether Gingrich's college course, Renewing 
American Civilization, is an educational course or a thinly veiled propaganda 
arm of Gingrich's political recruitment empire that was improperly financed. 
The course was paid for with the help of private contributions that were 
tax-deductible. If the course was political recruitment, according to law, the 
private citizens who helped finance the class should not have received the tax 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also questions about whether some of Gingrich's tax-exempt political 
groups were or were not involved in organizing the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior's attack, which was fairly muted in its rhetoric, comes at a moment of 
euphoria for Gingrich, a chief architect of the Republican landslide in last 
month's election. Only a day earlier, the Gingrich-led Republican conference 
formally approved a series of popular reforms of congressional rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonior said that an independent counsel is necessary for a variety of 
reasons, including the fact that Gingrich has declined to recuse himself from 
possibly appointing the Republican members of the House ethics panel for the 
next Congress, at a time when a complaint against him is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior also argued that there is a longstanding precedent to use outside 
counsels -- who do not have some of the same broad investigative powers as 
special prosecutors or independent counsels -- to handle such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The House ethics panel appointed outside counsels in investigating then-House 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) in connection with sales of a book he had written 
and gifts he had received from a Texas businessman, as well as the Abscam case, 
which was an FBI sting of legislators willing to take bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior made his formal request in a letter to the ethics committee, which has 
an equal number of Democratic and Republican members, asking it to convene next 
week to consider his demand.  
</P>
<P>
 After Bonior's press conference, Richard J. Phelan, the attorney who served as 
outside counsel investigating Wright, delivered a letter to the ethics 
committee concurring that one is needed in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not pass on the legitimacy of the complaint against Congressman 
Gingrich," his letter said. "Without a special counsel, his position is 
untenable -- he will be perceived either as an ethical hypocrite or as 
out-of-touch with traditional standards of integrity as the leadership he 
replaced and so often referred to as 'corrupt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference, Bonior referred to several documents that are part of 
the complaint that he said raise questions as to whether the private citizens 
who helped finance Gingrich's course should have received tax exemptions for 
their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those documents is a letter written to a potential investor in the 
class by an aide to Gingrich that said: "The goal of this project is simple: to 
train, by April, 1996, 200,000 plus citizens into a model for replacing the 
welfare state and reforming our government." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior also released a letter that apparently accompanied a $25,000 
contribution from Richard Berman of the Employment Policies Institute in 
Washington. A handwritten note at the bottom said: "Newt -- thanks again for 
the help on today's committee hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior called the statement "most disturbing" and said it "makes you wonder 
exactly what kind of influence or favors this $25,000 check bought." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow contributed to this story.

4 MORE CHARGES ADDED IN FUSILLADE ON WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors added four more charges Thursday to their previous 
11-count indictment against Francisco Martin Duran, who is accused of spraying 
the White House with rifle fire on Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The new charges, alleging that Duran used a semiautomatic weapon in four 
instances of trying to impede federal officers who arrested him, add a total of 
40 years to the maximum possible punishment that the 26-year-old Coloradan 
could receive if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they included the additional weapons charges after lawyers 
determined they would strengthen previous charges of impeding and assaulting 
Secret Service officers who rushed to seize Duran on a sidewalk after tourists 
momentarily subdued the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who pleaded not guilty Thursday to the broadened indictment, already is 
facing a charge of attempting to assassinate President Clinton, who was inside 
the White House at the time of the shooting. That count alone carries a maximum 
punishment of life imprisonment. Duran's trial has been set for March 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal sources said Thursday that they are considering the 
possibility that the assailant may have mistaken a gray-haired visitor who was 
inside the White House fence for the President when he opened fire. The 
visitor, Dennis Basso, a 40-year-old furrier from New York who had just 
completed a tour, was not injured. The assailant fired more than 25 rounds at 
the front of the Executive Mansion.

LUNCH OPENS BRIEFING FOR D.C. NEOPHYTES; CONGRESS: THREE-DAY ORIENTATION 
FEATURES CONSERVATIVE SUPERSTARS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO STIRRED THE VOTERS TO A 
REVOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "A revolution," Mao Tse-tung once observed, "is not a dinner party." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, when freshly minted Republican congressmen convened for an intensive 
political study session under the watchful eyes of party cadres, they started 
with lunch. Between courses, the new recruits collected reading lists, hailed 
their beloved chairman, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), and threw 
a few bombs at that distant incubator of counterrevolution, Harvard University 
-- which traditionally has conducted freshman orientations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think," said Vin Weber, Republican activist and co-chairman of Empower 
America, the Republican group that helped shape the freshman curriculum, "if 
you were at Harvard, you could be listening to Michael Dukakis." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Harvard's orientations, which featured plodding government professors 
droning on about arms control and urban policy, the three-day orientation that 
began Thursday features not only conservative political superstars such as 
likely presidential candidate Jack Kemp, but those who helped stir the voters 
to revolution. The climax will be speeches by radio talk show host Rush 
Limbaugh and by William J. Bennett, the conservative philosopher and former 
education secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift from Harvard Yard to a Baltimore hotel 40 miles from the Capitol 
dome is more than a simple change of venue. In the oft-used phrase of 
Republican leaders Thursday, it is a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, which is perceived by many 
Republicans as a bastion of the kind of "counterculture" values denounced by 
Gingrich, this year canceled its orientation session for freshman lawmakers. 
Its explanation: lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new day in America," Kemp said when asked to explain the sudden 
demise of the Harvard program. "People want something new. They didn't want the 
typical Harvard School of Government notion of what reform is." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Heritage Foundation, which teamed up this year with Empower 
America, had no such problem. A total of 69 newly elected senators and 
representatives, all but one of them Republicans, accepted their invitation to 
what appears to be combination study hall and pep rally. Six of the seven 
Democratic freshmen declined to attend. The lone Democrat was Chaka Fattah of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the three days, they'll hear about "real welfare reform" from Charles 
Murray, co-author of the controversial book "The Bell Curve," which argues that 
there are genetic differences between races that determine intelligence. 
They'll listen to the leader of the Christian Coalition outline the "concerns 
of the pro-family voter," and hear from other panels about the requirements for 
"building an enduring conservative majority" and for "making congressional 
reform work." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, nuclear scientist Edward Teller, known as the father of the 
hydrogen bomb and a driving force behind the Ronald Reagan Administration's 
"Star Wars" initiative, called for a renewed effort to build missile defenses. 
Teller, Kemp said, "is here to shine the beacon of the peace-through-strength 
movement across America." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, hailed the new 
members as "fellow revolutionaries." He urged the new troops to consider 
Heritage, which lies two blocks from the Capitol, "the armory, the weapons 
factory in your battle for the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp told the assembled freshmen that they were "part of the revolution" and 
reminded them that Republicans "are still the party of liberation." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was ample evidence that a cult of personality -- the boon and bane 
of revolutionaries throughout history -- is developing around Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers looking for applause lines needed only utter Gingrich's name, and the 
response was thunderous. "He's an inspiration to us, a true leader," said 
Rep.-elect Andrea Seastrand (R-San Luis Obispo). 
</P>
<P>
 As they gathered in this port city Thursday, several Republican freshmen wore 
lapel pins identifying them as "majority makers." They traded gossip, including 
promised committee assignments and who, if anyone, would dare run against 
Oklahoma football star J. C. Watts, now a congressman, for freshman class 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, blinking into the glare of cameras, got their first taste of 
Washington's hungry congressional press corps. 
</P>
<P>
 After schmoozing with Watts and Oklahoma Rep. Steve Largent, a former Seattle 
Seahawks star-turned Republican freshman, Kemp joked that House Republicans 
should start a football caucus. Only one problem, Kemp conceded: Republicans 
have scrapped all funding for caucuses, ranging from the Congressional Black 
Caucus to the caucus on women's issues. Kemp played for the Buffalo Bills 
before entering politics.

OFFICIALS DECLINE TO CHARGE FBI SHARPSHOOTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has decided not to bring criminal charges against the 
FBI sharpshooter who shot and killed the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver 
during a 1992 standoff in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Deval Patrick, head of the department's civil rights division, decided that 
there was no evidence that FBI agents willfully used excessive force, a law 
enforcement source said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The siege began Aug. 21, 1992, when U.S. marshals went to Weaver's mountain 
cabin to arrest him on a weapons charge. A marshal and Weaver's son were killed 
in a shootout, and Weaver, his wife, Vicki, and others remained holed up in the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI hostage-rescue team encircled the Weaver cabin the next day. An FBI 
sniper, Lon Horiuchi, wounded Weaver when he and another man emerged from the 
cabin. The sniper fired again as the two retreated, but the bullet struck and 
killed Vicki Weaver, who was standing unarmed in the doorway.FEDERAL BUREAU OF

$120,000 FLIGHT OF GENERAL, PET CAT, PROBED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ashy, new leader of the U.S. Space Command, traveled 
on an Air Force C-141 transport jet from Italy to Colorado at an estimated cost 
of at least $120,000, taking along one aide and the Ashy family cat. He could 
have taken a commercial flight the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 After a complaint from Capitol Hill, Defense Department Acting Inspector 
General Derek J. Vander Schaaf has agreed this week to investigate the 
propriety of the Sept. 9 flight on a 200-passenger plane specially equipped 
with a luxury cabin and carrying a steward on its crew of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashy, who followed Pentagon regulations by paying an $85 fare for the cat, 
declined to comment. A spokesman at the Space Command in Colorado Springs said 
Ashy and his aide considered taking a commercial flight Sept. 10, but worried 
the schedule wouldn't give him enough time to take a training course in 
Colorado the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials said no regulations were broken.

WHITE HOUSE PLANS BIPARTISAN SUMMIT TO CREATE STRATEGY FOR WELFARE REFORM; 
POLICY: CONFERENCE WILL INCLUDE GOVERNORS, LAWMAKERS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. THE 
MOVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE FROM THE GOP. 
</P>

<P>
 Seeking to seize the initiative from Republicans on welfare reform, the White 
House announced Thursday that it will convene a high-profile national 
conference next month to create a strategy on the politically popular issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House hopes that a welfare conference will allow President Clinton 
to wrest control of the issue from incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
and other Republicans, who have dominated the debate since the elections last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the White House announced its plan, however, leading Republican 
lawmakers met quietly with influential GOP governors in an attempt to seal the 
fate of a welfare overhaul even before Congress convenes on Jan. 4. The 
Republicans believe that they may be able to preempt the President by reaching 
a swift consensus among GOP members of Congress and governors. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House initiative reflects Clinton's fear that unless he moves 
swiftly and forcefully, GOP lawmakers will grasp the agenda as soon as Congress 
convenes. The White House had even considered moving the State of the Union 
Address to early January, but then decided to go with a traditional date later 
that month. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-level tug-of-war over welfare shows that both parties understand how 
troubled the system is and how appealing it would be to voters if they could 
claim to have made major reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the welfare summit has the support of a bipartisan group of 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have asked their elected officials to put aside politics as usual 
and begin earnest work to solve our nation's problems -- and welfare reform is 
at the very top of our agenda," the President said as he was leaving for the 
three-day Summit of the Americas in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors, lawmakers and local officials from both parties will be invited to 
the conference, which will be held behind closed doors at the White House and 
chaired by Clinton, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials believe that Republican governors and lawmakers will 
feel pressured to take part, lest they be accused of partisan obstructionism. 
One official expressed confidence that even Gingrich and incoming Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they would want to attend something this important," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said news of the welfare conference would 
suspend debate on the issue and prevent various groups from solidifying their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does put the President back into the mix in a major way. He then becomes 
the dominate player in all this," said Matsui, a veteran lawmaker whose voice 
on welfare reform was very influential before Republicans took over the House.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton already has leverage because of his veto power, Matsui stressed, but 
by holding the conference he gains an early, influential role in the crafting 
of legislation, instead of responding to decisions that have already been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties have been talking about changing welfare programs in order to 
force recipients to take financial responsibility for their families and to 
discourage people from having children they cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 But the welfare reform plan laid out in the Republicans' "contract with 
America" bears little resemblance to the carrot-and-stick approach that Clinton 
and his allies envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the White House and the GOP plans would limit Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children to two years. But that's where the similarities stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the President's proposal, the government would become the employer of 
last resort, guaranteeing subsidized jobs for those who could not find them in 
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican version offers no such security. It gives states the option of 
extending cash benefits in exchange for work, but only for three additional 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP plan would also deny benefits to teen-age mothers and their children 
and to families where legal paternity is not established for the children. It 
also mentions orphanages as an option for children whose parents cannot afford 
to raise them and would make legal immigrants ineligible for scores of benefits 
they now receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican governors favor yet another solution. They want the federal 
government to give them the flexibility to craft welfare reform strategies to 
their states' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservative micro-management is only slightly better than liberal 
micro-management," Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said in an 
interview. "There's a presumption in Washington that one size fits all. It 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said the President's initiative shows that he is 
adjusting to the new reality in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new day. Clearly, we have to find new ways to work together with 
Republicans," said Bruce Reed, a White House adviser on domestic issues. "It 
time for everyone to roll up their sleeves and work." 
</P>
<P>
 That was just what Republican governors and lawmakers were doing in Washington 
on Wednesday night and Thursday, according to sources close to the governors 
and congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leaders criticized Clinton for failing to act sooner on his 
campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it" and for his inability to 
solidify Democrats behind one plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to avoid that and have a uniform approach from the Republican 
governors and members of the House and Senate," said Rep. David Camp (R-Mich.), 
who attended a private meeting Thursday with Republican senators, 
representatives and governors. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, the Republicans agreed in principle that states should 
have much more authority over their welfare programs and that reforms should 
save, not cost, money. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp said the participants vowed to review all of the more than 300 programs 
they loosely defined as the government welfare apparatus. They also agreed to 
consider consolidating some programs and converting funding for others into 
"block grant" payments to states, with state officials empowered to design 
their own aid programs free of many existing federal restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to the officials planned to continue meeting during the next several 
weeks, and Camp said his subcommittee would probably launch hearings on the 
issue soon after Congress convenes, even before any draft is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President did not seize the initiative on this issue upon being sworn 
into office," said Camp, who will sit on the Ways and Means subcommittee that 
will draft welfare reform legislation. "It was a major part of his campaign. 
But then he got into office and didn't do anything about it. I think he's 
trying to play catch-up now. He's way behind the curve."

TRUMAN TO DISPLACE A-BOMB ON STAMP

 Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. announced Thursday that a planned 
commemorative stamp marking the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be replaced by one featuring President Harry S. 
Truman announcing the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure of the original stamp's design Nov. 17 had set off protests in 
Japan that quickly reached Washington. Former President George Bush, visiting 
in Japan on Thursday, became the latest dignitary to call for removing the 
stamp from a set of 10 World War II commemoratives planned for release in 
August, a postal official said.

BOY, 11, WHO CUT THROAT OF WOMAN, 83, GETS PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old boy who cut the throat of an elderly neighbor after beating her 
with her cane won't be locked away, a judge decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juvenile Court judge rejected a request from prosecutors to send the 
youngster to a secure facility and sentenced him instead to five years' 
probation in his parents' custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was 10 when he broke into the apartment of 83-year-old Anna Gilvis. 
She surprised the intruder, struck him with her cane and locked herself in the 
bathroom, but he forced the door open, beat her and cut her throat with a 
10-inch kitchen knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stated that he hated her; he denies any other motive," said James Maurer, 
deputy chief of detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stuart F. Lubin ordered the boy to undergo therapy. The child's name was 
not released because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy lived next door to Gilvis and had been interviewed by detectives as a 
potential witness shortly after the slaying Oct. 5, 1993. Nearly 11 months 
later, when other leads failed to materialize, he was questioned again and 
confessed, Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's clearly a danger," Assistant State's Atty. Eileen O'Neill said after the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's attorney, Stephen Broussard, said he may appeal the conviction. 
Broussard argued before the sentencing that the boy had no prior arrest record.

AUDITOR WARNED O.C. IN '93; BOARD, D.A. WERE TOLD CITRON VIOLATED CODES; 
CRISIS: THE INTERNAL AUDIT ALSO SAID THE TREASURER RAN HIS OFFICE WITHOUT 
ADEQUATE CONTROLS. THREE SUPERVISORS AND AN EX-OFFICIAL SAY THEY DON'T RECALL 
SEEING THE REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than a year before Orange County's bankruptcy debacle, the county's 
auditor warned supervisors and the district attorney that Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron was running his office without adequate controls and 
violated government codes to maximize returns with public money.  
</P>
<P>
 Obtained Thursday by The Times, the internal audit said Citron was making 
"risky and unusual transactions" behind the backs of the investment committee 
charged with advising him on the operations of the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool's losses prompted Orange County this week to file for bankruptcy 
protection in the biggest municipal finance debacle in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- which covered the treasurer's operations in 1991 but was only 
sent to the Board of Supervisors and Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi in August 
of last year -- warned that the county might be liable for some of Citron's 
financial maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the troubles highlighted in the audit were not the ones that 
precipitated the county's financial collapse this week, they were early 
warnings that Citron engaged in high-risk investments, avoided oversight of his 
financial dealings, and was not above bending the law to improve earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The county auditors said Citron made questionable transactions totaling more 
than $50 million "at the request of the (Wall Street) broker, Merrill Lynch, to 
help the broker meet financial statement ratios required by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached for comment Thursday, Citron said he did not remember the audit. 
However, he emphatically denied that any transactions were made for the benefit 
of a brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," he said. Merrill Lynch officials could not be reached for 
comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of five county supervisors contacted Thursday about the audit said they 
could not remember ever receiving it, nor were they aware of the criticisms 
contained in it. The other supervisors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit said Citron -- contrary to legal requirements -- invested in 
below-investment-grade notes and in troubled banks, one of which went bankrupt 
the year of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's Aug. 23, 1993, response to the audit offered a rare glimpse into how 
the maverick treasurer -- until recently respected nationwide for his 
cutting-edge investment strategies -- viewed his role and the nature of his 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the Board of Supervisors, Citron brushed aside suggestions 
that his office institute a chain of command that would provide some oversight 
and accountability for the investments that he was making. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he managed his "fiduciary responsibilities" based on "his own 
personality and abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the current management style, although not the norm for county 
government, is the best one for the treasurer-tax collector," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not dispute bending government codes to fit his investment needs, but 
noted that investing is "an inexact art." What may be "risky" strategy for 
some, he said, was "prudent" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe none of the transactions to be risky or unusual," Citron said. "We 
are not as conservative in our investment strategies as some of our 
contemporaries and because of that some transactions that are usual for us may 
in fact be unusual for others." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview Thursday, Citron said he also did not recall his written 
response to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit was conducted by the office of Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis 
sometime in 1992. The office discussed the findings with Citron in July, 1993, 
and transmitted the report to other county officials the next month, after 
Citron made his response. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis attributed the delays to staffing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to lack of staffing in the office, we weren't able to complete the audit 
and issue it," Lewis said Thursday. Staff was "moved off of those jobs, and you 
have to put new staff on it, and you're operating five auditors short." 
</P>
<P>
 John Conley, a top assistant to Capizzi, said he was not sure that the 
district attorney ever received the report. "Even at this point, we're not sure 
there have been any criminal violations" in connection with the investment 
pool's operations, he said, noting that some violations of the government code 
call for civil, rather than criminal, remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 A shocked Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was more emphatic about never seeing the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "My god! Was it addressed to the Board of Supervisors?" Stanton asked. "We 
didn't have it, we don't have it, we have never seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't throw things like this away," Stanton said. "The simple fact of the 
matter is that if it was distributed like that, why didn't somebody say, 'Hey, 
did you see that?' I'm just baffled. It was not in the office, and didn't come 
to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he could not understand why the auditor delayed circulating the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got damaging information about the treasurer, why would you wait 
nearly two years before releasing it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said he did not remember receiving the report nor 
had he heard of any trouble with the fund until "several weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder also said that she does not recall ever seeing 
the audit report. When told of the auditor's findings she said: "What? You're 
kidding. I'm sitting here with my mouth open. I'm absolutely shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, said that she was upset that the report, which was conducted in 
December, 1991, was not released until August, 1993. Wieder said she did not 
accept Lewis' explanation that his office was understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the weakest excuse I've ever heard," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said he had only heard rumors 
about the audit. "I haven't seen it," he said late Thursday. "I'm sure I will 
see it sometime soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' office was in the process of drafting a follow-up report gauging 
Citron's progress on the 1993 recommendations when the county filed for 
bankruptcy, said John Nakane, chief of internal audits. He said the report will 
be completed and should be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to comment Thursday on the contents of the 1993 report, but 
said his department performed several internal audits of Citron's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stop the bleeding now," he said. "What happened in the past 
will come out a little later down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakane, who oversaw the audit, said Thursday he doubts that more regular 
audits could have prevented the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job wasn't to review the portfolio per se. We looked at internal 
controls," he said. "Bob invested the money. I don't think our work could have 
averted (the losses)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakane said that while the audit is "critical of certain things that (Citron) 
did," it did not reflect extreme concern at the time on the part of the auditor 
controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaye Mirabelli, president of the state Municipal Treasurers Assn. and 
treasurer of the city of Ventura, said the criticisms contained in the audit 
"aren't things that I've ever found in our audit. . . . I don't remember 
anything like that, especially in regards to the language." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal audit was the second to be conducted in the past decade. A 1986 
audit also criticized Citron's autocratic investment system, which, it noted, 
was "designed and carried out only by the department head" -- Citron himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 report repeated the criticism, saying Citron "made all day-to-day 
investment decisions and also executed the transactions without anyone else 
involved to provide segregation of duties or oversight." Until this year, the 
investment fund -- which holds funds from more than 180 cities, school 
districts and agencies, in addition to the county's own funds -- sharply 
outperformed similar pools operated for local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal investment committee was formed to provide "input on investment 
strategy and types of investments" being considered. But when Citron "deviated 
from guidelines established by government code or the investment committee, he 
did so without consulting anyone in the treasurer's office or on the 
committee," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was found that Citron had violated government codes in making 
investments, he told auditors that "the instances were conscious decisions made 
to maximize returns," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit, Citron violated government codes by: 
</P>
<P>
 * Holding $125 million in medium-term notes rated BB-/BB when law requires 
that such notes be rated A or better. BB- bonds are considered predominantly 
speculative, according to the Standard & Poor's rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Invested $80 million in Baa1-rated medium-term notes issued by a Dutch 
corporation, when law only allows investment in such notes if rated A or better 
and issued by a U.S. corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-invested surplus money -- as much as 44.6% -- in medium-term notes, 
when law allows that only 30% of surplus money be invested that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-invested surplus money in negotiable certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit report, Citron invested $75 million in a negotiable 
certificate of deposit from Columbia Savings & Loan, which went bankrupt in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While not in violation of law, the report said that investment could have 
resulted in significant losses of public funds, and it chided Citron for not 
explaining it to the internal investment committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabelli said the rating of medium-term notes can change over time and may be 
different at the time of an audit than when the notes were purchased. But she 
said she would never purchase notes rated lower than A, because it is "not in 
compliance with our investment policy or government codes." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the report's more incendiary findings, auditors said they had 
discovered that several transactions were made solely to benefit Merrill Lynch, 
a favored brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $50 million that changed hands between June and July of 1991 so 
the giant Wall Street firm could meet required SEC financial statement ratios, 
the report refers to a December, 1991, letter to Citron that detailed similar 
transactions in December, 1990, and January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter recommended that Citron ask the county counsel to investigate 
"possible liability . . . in which such transactions could result." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor recommended that Citron "decentralize" investing and establish a 
chain of command "that helps to promote adequate review of decisions." It also 
urged that Citron run his "risky" or "unusual" transactions by the investment 
committee and adhere to government regulations in his investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said Thursday his office was sufficiently concerned about potential 
problems with the county's now-bankrupt investment pool that officials also 
twice made "special requests" that outside auditors take a closer look at the 
portfolio.  
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he made the "special request" of KPMG Peat Marwick last year and 
again this year. This year's external audit -- which had been due to be 
released late this month -- may not be completed because of the county crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't contract with them to look at a detailed analysis of the portfolio. 
On the other hand, because there had been concerns, you just say, 'Look at this 
particular area.' Then they spend a couple of extra hours on it," he said. "For 
the last two audits, that has been a special request," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Matt Lait, Eric Lichtblau and Jodi Wilgoren contributed to 
this story. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Auditor's Warning 
</P>
<P>
 In an audit dated August 1993, Orange County Auditor-Controller Steven E. 
Lewis questioned practices of former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
County supervisors say they don't recall the audit. Lewis' findings included: 
</P>
<P>
 * A management style that "reflected inattentiveness to complying with" county 
policies and procedures 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of low-rated notes from a Netherlands corporation when the law 
requires investments only in U.S. firms rated A or better 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of $125-million in Chrysler Corp. notes rated BBB, below the A 
rating 
</P>
<P>
 * Breach of state limits on investing in medium-term notes for 10 of 12 months 
audited 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of more negotiable certificates of deposit than state allows for 3 
of 12 months audited

ECONOMISTS SAY LOSS MAY INCLUDE 5,000 NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 The $1.5-billion investment loss that drove Orange County into bankruptcy 
could cost the county several thousand future jobs and slow economic growth 
through the end of the decade, economists at Chapman University said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county will probably not fall back into recession, the declining 
value of its investment portfolio could erase 4,000 to 5,000 of the 21,000 new 
jobs that had earlier been forecast for 1995, according to projections unveiled 
at the annual presentation of the Orange County Economic Forecast, compiled by 
Chapman's Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 1999, the county's financial crisis could reduce the number of created 
jobs by 25,000, said Esmael Adibi, the economist who heads the research unit 
and performs Chapman's long-range forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the job loss would be related to public works projects now on hold, 
including toll roads, a new Anaheim sports stadium and new public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The total impact of the county's bankruptcy filing is harder to predict, the 
economists said, but a modest ripple effect is virtually assured. That could 
include a decrease of $100 million in annual taxable sales -- about 0.3% of the 
total -- and a $540-million decline in the gross county product, the measure of 
all goods and services produced. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the financial crisis, the economists said, the gross county 
product for 1995 is now projected at $81.8 billion, off nearly 1% from earlier 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a dampening, but not a death blow," Chapman economist and 
President James Doti told a crowd of more than 1,000 business and political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the height of a financial panic in Orange County right now with 
fear, anger and confusion making it difficult to see," Doti added. "But our 
analysis shows the county has a strong fundamental economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The usually circumspect Doti chastised Robert L. Citron for "a move of 
desperation" during the summer when the recently resigned county treasurer 
tried to recoup losses by moving even further into high-risk securities. The 
then-treasurer, Doti said, was "hoping irrationally to recover" from his 
disastrous investment strategies "by doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the county, after revealing huge losses in risky investments by 
Citron's office, became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's investments went sour because he bet that interest rates would fall, 
which would have boosted the value of the bonds he bought. Doti said he could 
not understand the former treasurer's strategy. "By March of this year," he 
said, "there were no forecasters predicting that interest rates would drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Chapman's forecast for 1995 calls for declining long-term interest 
rates. Doti said bonds such as those on which Citron lost money this year could 
increase in value by 16% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Economic Research has been tracking Orange County's annual 
economy since 1981 and is heralded by other forecasters for its high degree of 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's 1995 forecast prepared a week before the county's financial 
crisis broke had predicted an increase of 21,000 jobs on government and private 
payrolls for the year -- the first overall job growth since 1990 -- and an 
increase of 105,000 jobs by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loss from the investment fund is held to $1.5 billion, Doti said, there 
would be an increase of 17,000 jobs in 1995 and 84,000 jobs by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The losses are bad," Doti said, "but it would be much more devastating to the 
county's economy if there was a tax increase to try to make up for the losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Chapman forecasters see the county on the road to recovery, they 
predicted that a mild national recession will occur in 1996. But underlying 
strengths, including healthy foreign trade and high-technology research 
sectors, as well as a rapidly recovering construction industry, will "put the 
county back in its accustomed role" of leading the nation out of recessions, 
Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, Orange County, along with the rest of California, has 
had a much weaker economy than much of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, the economists said they do not expect the county's 
bankruptcy to depress individual earnings. The median family income is expected 
to rise 2% to $55,507 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do they expect the construction industry's long-awaited rebound to stall. 
Doti said he expects the value of new construction projects, mostly home 
building, to rise 17% next year to $2.6 billion. Because most of the 
construction projected is in residential properties, the economists say, that 
will soften the blow to the industry from decreased spending for public works 
after the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman forecast does call for Orange County's average home price to fall 
next year, though. The forecast is for an average decrease of 2.6%, the fifth 
consecutive annual decline. But from 1996 through 1999, Adibi said, homeowners 
and home buyers can expect residential property values to increase, topping out 
with a gain of 7.6% for 1999.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Orange County Outlook 
</P>
<P>
 Economists at Chapman University predicted Thursday that Orange County's 
economy will continue growing at a slow but steady pace in 1995 despite the 
county's bankruptcy filing. Chapman compiles employment indicators that seek to 
predict job levels. Year-to-year percentage change in employment projected 
through 1999: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman employment Indicator (1999): 4.21% 
</P>
<P>
 Employment % change (1999): 2.80% 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Values 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for resold homes are expected to undergo a fifth consecutive year of 
depreciation and not turn positive until 1997. Percentage change from previous 
year: 
</P>
<P>
 1999: 7.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Job Creation 
</P>
<P>
 The increase of about 21,000 new jobs forecast for 1995 will be reduced by 
4,000 to 5,000, the economists say, and further job growth will be reduced 
through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 1995: 21.2 
</P>
<P>
 Taxable sales 
</P>
<P>
 Taxable sales are expected to continue their upward trend, increasing 3.1% 
next year after being adjusted for inflation. Annual percentage change after 
inflation adjustment: 
</P>
<P>
 1995: 3.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: All data for 1994 and beyond are projections.

MORE POLICE STATIONS TO INSTALL ATMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to give more ATM users safe havens from robbers, the Los Angeles Police 
Credit Union will install banking machines in police stations across the city, 
including several more in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 ATMs have already been available in nine LAPD stations under a pilot program. 
In a citywide expansion, another 13 automated teller machines are scheduled for 
installation next year, said Kimberly Phillips, president and chief executive 
officer of the credit union.  
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill, West Valley and North Hollywood police stations are among those 
due to receive ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that the public will see it as a good community service and 
begin looking at police stations as a good place to start accessing cash," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program began when the Los Angeles City Council -- at the urging of 
Councilman Hal Bernson of the northwest San Fernando Valley -- voted 
unanimously in November, 1993, to install ATMs in several stations after a 
series of crimes against those using the machines, especially the March, 1993, 
slaying of a pregnant woman at a Sherman Oaks ATM. The banking machines are 
often located in areas that are deserted at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The police credit union, which had already installed ATMs in four LAPD 
stations for use by credit union members prior to the council's vote, was 
ultimately selected by the council to oversee the pilot program, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the number of ATMs has been expanded to include machines in the 
Downtown police headquarters, the new and old police academies, a police 
substation in the Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills Shopping Center, and the Van Nuys, 
Devonshire, 77th Street, Central and Harbor division stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Several banks that had been asked to submit proposals to install ATMs in 
police stations told city officials in 1993 that they were reluctant to 
participate because they feared that the cash machines would not be used 
frequently enough to pay for their installation and maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit union, however, had different goals, which were to serve its 
members in the Police Department and to become a safe refuge for the public to 
take care of banking needs, particularly during evening hours, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the credit union loses about 15 cents on each transaction made at any 
of the nine ATMs, Phillips said. The machines must generate an average of 100 
transactions a day to justify their cost, banking executives told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently used ATM is located at police headquarters at Parker 
Center, where during the past three years 66,000 transactions have been made by 
credit union members, and 15,000 by others -- an average of only 60 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 An ATM installed about the same time in the Van Nuys Station has recorded 
28,000 member and 5,000 non-member transactions. More recently, an ATM 
installed three months ago in the Devonshire Division lobby, which is open to 
the public, has been used by 604 members and 144 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly police officers who use it," said one Devonshire desk officer. 
"But I don't think a lot of people are aware" that the machine is available to 
the public, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the case everywhere. An ATM installed several months ago at the 
77th Street Station has been well received by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're surprised. It's a good location for them and they feel safe," Officer 
John Jenal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said he hopes that installing the machines 
in stations across the city will reduce the number of ATM-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful that we could invite the community to take care of 
some of their personal business in an atmosphere of safety and comfort," 
Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy said he is depending on the news media, community-based policing 
programs and word of mouth to get the news out to residents that the ATM 
machines will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy is expected to join Bernson and Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Michael 
S. Luros on Monday at the Devonshire Division to announce plans to expand the 
program citywide.

MALIBU FIRE SINGES NERVES, LITTLE ELSE; EMERGENCY: FOUR MINOR INJURIES, NO 
DAMAGE REPORTED. THE BLAZE IS A CHILLING REMINDER OF LAST YEAR'S DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one was evacuated. Property damage was nil. And the most serious injury was 
to a woman whose Ford Explorer hit a battalion chief's Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malibu nonetheless got a sobering dose of deja vu Thursday as brush fires 
danced once again through canyons still scarred by last year's devastating 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 As gusting winds up to 50 m.p.h. sent tumbleweeds flying and knocked over 
metal trash cans, the first big fire of the season hit Latigo Canyon at 1:22 
p.m., officials said. The blaze, which blackened 62 acres of chaparral before 
it was extinguished, caused only four injuries -- all minor -- and no damage to 
the area's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for many in the rich but rugged area, it served as a chilling reminder 
of last year, when brush fires blackened 17,000 acres and destroyed 323 homes. 
Despite the addition this year of a new firefighting weapon -- two Super 
Scooper water-dropping planes leased from a Canadian company -- the flames 
immediately sparked a red alert as residents rushed to water their roofs and 
pack their cars, and television news helicopters went to live reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, an exact repeat," builder Pat Taylor, who was helping 
reconstruct a Las Flores Canyon building destroyed last year, said when his 
girlfriend warned him that the flames had crept to within a mile of his Corral 
Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 "(She) called me on the phone (at the job site)," Taylor said, "and it was 
like, here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu has never been a stranger to brush fires; some residents, in fact, were 
expecting this one. Humidity had hovered around 10% all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Adamson, whose family owns the Malibu Beach RV Park, said many families 
in his compound had hooked up their trailers early in the day and were ready to 
pull out at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through a lot of these over the years and we know how to prepare 
for them," he said, "but you never can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Inspector Gary Sutter said firefighters were summoned initially to 
a small blaze at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. Within 15 
minutes, the flames had covered 30 acres, he said, and the conflagration 
steadily grew as the high winds kept the Super Scoopers from flying low enough 
to accurately aim their water drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter said that although more than 50 homes are scattered throughout the 
area, no houses were damaged as the flames hopped from spot to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, smoke from the fire forced the closure for most of the afternoon of 
several local thoroughfares, including a section of the Pacific Coast Highway 
between Kanan and Malibu roads. And there were four injuries reported -- one 
from smoke inhalation, two more to firefighters and the fourth from a traffic 
accident that resulted from the massive traffic jams created by roadblocks in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said Sara Burdell, 69, of Malibu was taken to St. John's 
Hospital for treatment of minor injuries after she tried to make a U-turn to 
cut out of a traffic jam at the Pacific Coast Highway roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 As she swerved, officials said, she pulled into the path of an oncoming GMC 
Suburban truck driven by Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Dan Scott. 
Scott, who was uninjured, was heading down PCH in the center divider when the 
crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an unidentified 53-year-old transient was treated for smoke 
inhalation. Officials said a backfire set to halt the fire's advance ignited 
some magazines and books that the man had stored in trash cans near his 
encampment at Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the burning papers blew across the highway, setting fire at one 
point to palm trees in front of luxury oceanfront condominiums at Tivoli Cove. 
That hot spot, however, was quickly contained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was an especially difficult one for the more than 300 firefighters 
dispatched to the scene, as the winds hampered the aerial assault from seven 
water-dropping helicopters and the two Super Scoopers. Access to fire lines was 
also impeded by the rough terrain, Sutter said. Two firefighters suffered minor 
injuries -- one from a cactus, the other to his eye. Sutter said winds died 
down late in the afternoon, and by 5 p.m. the fire was mostly contained. 
Officials expected the flames to be extinguished by dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said that the cause of the fire was under investigation, but 
that they were focusing at least initially on a downed power line. Vegetation 
was also a factor, Sutter said, noting that the fire Thursday "was in an area 
that didn't burn last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the dry Santa Ana 
winds were expected to continue into the weekend. Wind advisories were also 
posted Thursday on several transmountain and desert highways, including 
Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass and in San Diego County and U.S. 395 in San 
Bernardino and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisories cautioned against travel in high-profile vehicles such as 
campers and trailers, and motorists were warned that windblown clouds of dust 
and sand were reducing visibility to a few yards in some desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the Santa Ana condition was being generated by the circulation 
around a large high-pressure system centered over southern Idaho. He said the 
sporadic, gusting winds will keep pummeling Southern California until the 
system finally begins moving out to the east, probably Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair to partly cloudy skies are expected here Sunday and Monday, with mostly 
sunny skies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 71 degrees, 
following an overnight low of 48. Relative humidity ranged from a relatively 
dry high of 49% to a low of 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total precipitation for the rainfall season -- which began July 1 -- is 0.8 of 
an inch, compared to a normal total for the date of 3.43 inches. Brack said it 
does not look as though any more rain will fall until late next week at the 
earliest.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SOME WELCOME FOR THE NEW SUPERVISORS; POLITICS: 
COUNTY PLUNGES INTO ABYSS JUST BEFORE BERGESON AND SILVA JOIN BOARD. IT'S NOT 
QUITE WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marian Bergeson looked forward to leaving a distinguished career in the state 
Senate to return home as an Orange County supervisor, believing "local 
government is where the action will be." Little did she know the prophecy in 
those words. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I also complained of Orange County as being in a media vacuum," 
the 69-year-old veteran of local and state politics, who was elected to the 
Board of Supervisors just last month, said wryly Thursday. "Now, I'd be oh so 
happy if O.J. (Simpson) would reacquire his rightful place on the front pages 
of the nation's newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson has been stunned by the international attention. When she wasn't 
looking at a stack of East Coast dailies that had Orange County's woes splashed 
across Page One, or listening to news of the crisis over the BBC, she was 
trying to figure out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 She and former Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva will officially join 
the board on Jan. 5, encountering a much different mission and mood than either 
had ever imagined. It will be as much a job of national image repair, Bergeson 
said, as it will trying to figure out how to recover from, of all things, 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has been caught totally off guard," she said. "The news was shocking 
. . . just shocking. I've always enjoyed challenges, but this is one that's 
really grabbed me by the throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, 50, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, spent 28 years as an 
Orange County schoolteacher, and his expertise should come in handy. His 
subject was economics. 
</P>
<P>
 He won election after an expensive and bitter campaign against Democratic 
Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who opened one typically stormy 
debate by presenting Silva with a plaque for being the "worst politician in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year member of state government, with six years in the state Assembly and 
now a decade in the Senate, Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said she perceived her 
role of supervisor-elect as being able to do "everything I could" with contacts 
and expertise in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged playing a role, for instance, in Orange County appointing a 
new treasurer-tax collector, "a real hotshot" -- former state Treasurer Thomas 
W. Hayes -- to replace the man being blamed for the calamity, Robert L. Citron, 
who resigned on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bergeson and Silva agree, as do the current supervisors, that Orange 
County's biggest sin was not having oversight of the activities of one man in 
whom unparalleled trust and confidence had been placed. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's supporters say much of his job will be proving his detractors wrong 
and showing that he can be valuable in repairing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bergeson, when she announced her intention to leave state politics 
earlier this year and return home to Newport Beach as county supervisor, 
political leaders in both Orange County and Sacramento mourned her departure. 
But on Thursday, some of the same people were saying her homecoming could not 
have been better timed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The positive things she has going for her aren't going to be entirely lost up 
here," said Dennis Carpenter, a powerful Sacramento lobbyist whose clients 
include the county of Orange and the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
which has $1.1 billion invested in the county's ill-fated portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Bergeson played a critical role in watching after the county's 
transportation interests in Sacramento, her supporters say such talents will 
now be invaluable, since so many millions of dollars from local transportation 
agencies are tied up in the troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman dubbed "Marian the Librarian" when she first arrived in Sacramento 
was named in a 1992 Capitol Journal survey as the second most effective 
Republican in the Senate, right behind GOP leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), and 
fourth in the entire Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her adversaries have heaped praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Bergeson is as responsible a legislator as we have in our state," then 
-- state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), longtime Senate Democratic leader, 
said earlier this year. "Orange County's gain of a supervisor will be Orange 
County's loss in the Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on her experience in Sacramento and mindful of the current crisis, 
Bergeson has found herself thinking of Butte, a rural, relatively poor county 
in Northern California that grappled with insolvency a few years ago, stopping 
just short of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my background and experience, I'm in the right place at the right time," 
she said. "I never thought I'd be involved with something like this on a 
personal level, but it is a situation that will be corrected. We'll see our way 
through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's greatest fear is that the Federal Reserve Board and Chairman Alan 
Greenspan will once again raise interest rates after six increases this year, 
including a .75% hike on Nov. 15. It was unexpectedly rising interest rates 
that devalued the county's investment portfolio. Another increase of even a 
half-point could plunge the county into recession, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent supervisors can't be blamed for what happened, Bergeson said, noting 
of Citron: "Because of the huge amounts of money he was making, he was lauded 
by national organizations for his 'phenomenal success in investment policy.' 
Everyone wanted to be a part of the game. That's why 180 different agencies 
wanted to come into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all looking at great returns. One year, there was a 16% increase 
(on their investment), but it was all predicated on low interest rates. As soon 
as high interest rates came in, it was all out of whack. Believe me, this was 
news to everyone. It came like a bolt out of the blue."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITY, SCHOOL, TRANSIT OFFICIALS MAP STRATEGY; 
REACTION: SCHNEIDER TALKS TO CITY MANAGERS. SCHOOLS GET STATE ADVICE. TOLLWAY 
AGENCIES SAY WORK TO GO ON.

 As Orange County's financial crisis deepened Thursday, city managers, school 
administrators and transit agency officials huddled in closed-door sessions 
across the county, struggling to determine what implications it may hold for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 city managers and finance officers gathered at Irvine City Hall for a 
two-hour meeting that included a question-and-answer session with County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, who spent an hour with the city representatives, "was very candid," 
Orange City Manager David F. Dixon said later. "To be very frank, I had a lot 
of empathy for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said they emerged from the meeting supportive of the county 
and its weary leadership, but anxious for more information about the likely 
effects of the crisis on their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are doing the best they can," Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth 
said. "It's a very complex thing and there is a lot of uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr., president of the Orange County City 
Managers Assn., said after the meeting that none of the cities were considering 
filing bankruptcy, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
 But the administrators also complained of difficulty in keeping up with the 
quick pace of events and frustration with their inability to get answers from 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to . . . keep informed and that is part of the value of this 
meeting," said Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder, who added that cities 
must play an active role in resolving the issue. "We can't afford to just wait 
and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators also formed an advisory committee of city managers from 
each of the county's supervisorial districts. Brady will chair the group, which 
will include Ruth, Santa Ana's David N. Ream, Huntington Beach's Michael T. 
Uberuaga, Fullerton's James L. Armstrong and Laguna Niguel's Tim Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which will act on behalf of all of the managers, is scheduled 
to meet for the first time today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will talk about where we go next and will consider if we want to hire 
legal counsel," Brady said. "We want to formulate a game plan on how to keep 
the cities involved and up to date." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said many in the group have mixed feelings about the county and its 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we feel let down, concerned that we weren't at least told about this 
sooner so we may have taken individual acts as cities to protect our monies 
we've invested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the managers met in Irvine, about 100 county school superintendents, 
district financial officers, school board members and attorneys met at the 
Orange County Department of Education headquarters in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute meeting included a conference call with state Secretary of Child 
Development and Education Maureen DiMarco, who urged school officials to find a 
way to keep their incoming tax revenue out of the county pool, according to 
Capistrano Unified School District Supt. James A. Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said DiMarco suggested that school districts try to divert their 
revenue to the San Diego or Los Angeles County treasuries, or even to deposit 
the money in banks of their own choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, for one, was comforted by the session. "Yesterday my comfort level 
was a 1. Today it's a 3," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said school districts received assurances that they will be able 
to make today's payroll for classified employees. They were also promised that 
they will be able to make the payroll for teachers in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The school districts also decided to join together to share the costs of legal 
counsel. It is too early to say whether the County Department of Education 
itself will file for bankruptcy or sue the county, said Ronald D. Wenkart, the 
department's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials said they are frustrated with the situation because it might 
tarnish the reputations of the school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the school districts have been in excellent financial condition," said 
William Habermehl, assistant superintendent of the Department of Education. 
"Because of its impact on schools, to many people it looks like schools have 
been mismanaged. This happened to us, not because of us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was announced at the meeting that the county is establishing a separate 
fund for school district revenues, said Ron Walter, superintendent of Garden 
Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several districts took steps Thursday to demand that their incoming tax 
revenues be kept separate from the failed county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Thursday night meeting, trustees of the Fullerton Joint Union High School 
District unanimously adopted a resolution to stop their tax contributions from 
going into the county fund, with the La Habra City School District Board of 
Education taking the same action a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit and toll road agency officials also met Thursday to assess the 
widening repercussions of the county's financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Transportation Corridor Agencies met for nearly an hour in 
closed session and said later that Orange County's major toll roads will be 
completed, although $324 million earmarked for their construction is frozen in 
the bankrupt county's money-losing investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a commitment . . . to completing these projects. This is one more 
hurdle we will overcome," said Scott Diehl, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern 
Transportation Corridor Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the corridor agencies' two boards of directors, in charge of 
developing the San Joaquin, Foothill and Eastern corridors, authorized their 
chief executive, William C. Woollett, to take any action necessary, including 
hiring consultants, to offset any negative effects of the bankruptcy's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies' board members also agreed that at their next public hearing, on 
Jan. 12, they will review the track record of their financial team, including 
their investment bankers.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Richardson, a board member who recommended the action, said 
afterward that he expects the investment bankers to do whatever they can to 
help and not to further undermine the agencies' financial position. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't work with us now, they won't be working with us in the future," 
Richardson warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those most interested in knowing what effect the county bankruptcy may 
have on the fate of the highway projects are the environmentalists who have 
been fighting the projects in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am truly loving this," said a gleeful Patrick Mitchell, a representative of 
Earth First, a group opposing construction of the Eastern Corridor. "We have 
been saying the whole time the projects are a bad deal and now there is 
economic evidence to suggest that might be true." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who attended the Transportation Corridor Agencies public hearing, 
said he believes construction of the Eastern Corridor will be delayed because 
money for its construction has yet to be raised in the bond market. He 
predicted that the county bankruptcy will sour the market for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Phillips, executive director of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, which last 
week lost an appellate court case challenging the adequacy of the environmental 
studies paving the way for construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway, said 
he also hoped the bankruptcy would add to the delay of that project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woollett said construction on the San Joaquin Hills tollway, which cuts 
through environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon, will begin "the instant" a 
federal appeals court lifts an injunction on the project. The court last week 
ruled against the environmentalists' legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Woollett said he had advised board members that the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies would have no trouble continuing to pay the salaries of their 
44-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Woollett acknowledged, however, that a bond offering planned this spring to 
raise construction funds for the Eastern toll road might have to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, the Orange County Transportation Authority, which operates the 
county's bus system, said it is making efforts to ensure that revenue remains 
available for debt service, bus operations and payments to construction 
contractors and other vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials said they have asked Orange County to release state 
transportation funds deposited in the county treasury and to ensure prompt 
receipt of the authority's portion of county property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority has asked the county to establish a trust fund for deposit of 
its future state revenue, which would be separate from the county treasury and 
thus not affected by the county's bankruptcy action.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THE LITTLE CREDITORS ARE FEELING A BIG PAIN; 
IMPACT: SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS DISMAYED AT COUNTY HALTING PAYMENT OF BILLS. MANY 
OPERATE ON TIGHT MARGINS AND NEED THE CASH TO PASS ON TO VENDORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sandy Schroeder learned Thursday that Orange County would halt payment of 
its outstanding debts, her heart sank. 
</P>
<P>
 "They owe us $4,010.13!" Schroeder said, checking the books of the small 
Fountain Valley business she co-owns, Datron Peripherals, a three-person 
company that supplies computer accessories to John Wayne Airport and the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. "I didn't realize it was that much." 
</P>
<P>
 She sighed heavily and didn't speak for several moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to pay anybody? That's what they said?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was exactly what county officials were saying Thursday -- but they said 
little else. Clerks answering the phones in the county auditor's office were 
instructed to read a short, blunt statement to anyone inquiring about due 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are expecting a payment, checks are not being released today," the 
clerks recited. "Our office is consulting with counsel on the impact of the 
bankruptcy filing. We don't know what the answer will be, but we hope to resume 
issuing checks within a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 The news did not sit well with any business owner listed in the 386-page U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court document cataloguing the county's many creditors. But while 
large companies could perhaps absorb the shock, small-business owners, who 
often live payment to payment, were chafed in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, what a time for something like that to happen," Schroeder said. 
"Business in general is tough enough in the first place, without having to 
worry about them. " 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said she now cannot pay her own vendors, which may ruin her credit 
with them, which may make it more difficult to buy more supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of this was speculation. One thing about her future was sure: 
"Obviously, I'm not going to do any more business with them," she said of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for Larry Marx, co-owner of the Marx Brothers Fire Extinguisher Co., 
a Los Angeles-based company that is owed $4,700 for equipment sold to the 
Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say that Marx's faith in the county has been doused. From now on, 
he said, he will ask for cash on the barrelhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours before the county's announcement Thursday, Marx had been 
calculating the county's hefty account with his firm. He had delivered $1,900 
worth of extinguishers to the county a few hours before the bankruptcy filing 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that we'll get our money," he said, not sounding as if the 
feeling was a strong one. "It's just going to take a long time to get it, and 
we don't like that, because of the economy right now. It's terrible that one 
organization can mess it up for so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 The mess was creating a mega-emergency for Sharon Tipple and Jane McCloud, two 
registered nurses who own a struggling business called Tip of the Cloud, which 
landed a county order only days ago for 310 first-aid manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is major for us," Tipple said, frantic. "I don't know what we're going 
to do. . . . They owe us $1,849.77. They just bought our biggest order that 
we've ever shipped." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tipple and McCloud landed the account last week, they thought they'd 
finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real feeling of safety when you do business with the county," 
McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is that, right now, every penny we make we try to put into 
advertising, so people know more about the project," Tipple added. "This is 
going to put a big glitch in our marketing plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said: "When you're this small, as we are -- there's my partner and I 
and we have one salesperson -- even a thousand dollars to us is a lot of money. 
And when you operate on small margins, like we have to in this kind of market 
and this economy, it puts a tremendous strain on us. We count on that money 
coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Van Dyke had counted so heavily on the government money that he was 
contemplating layoffs Thursday night. He didn't know precisely how much the 
county owed his fax business, Imaging Plus of Irvine, but if it was $5,000, as 
he suspected, he would let one employee go. If it was $10,000, he would be 
forced to let two employees go. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among small-business owners who won't feel an immediate pinch from the 
county's freeze on payments, there was white-hot anger at the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody doesn't pay me $200, it irritates me no end, I want to go out and 
wring their neck," said Mike O'Grady, owner of K'West Printing in Orange, which 
does work for the county Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's debt with O'Grady is closer to $1,500, he said, which makes 
it 7 1/2 times as irritating. Plus, he fumed, the payment will eventually 
consist of his own tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the check is in the mail?" said Richard Black, owner of Black's Furniture 
in downtown Orange, to which the Sheriff's Department is indebted to the tune 
of $1,807.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Black could only laugh wryly. After weeks of dunning the county for his money, 
he'd been told that the county cut his check this week. Then he heard that the 
county is freezing all payments. 
</P>
<P>
 So Black made some calls Thursday and found that, indeed, his relatively 
little check was one of the last to be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one day shy of getting cut and mailed and sent out, and now it's on 
hold," he said. "For a business like ours, it's something that's going to 
eventually work its way down to somebody else that's going to have to be 
delayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Black said, he knew Orange County's bankruptcy filing 
would rear up and bite him, but he couldn't figure out how. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You know, there's something that I'm not remembering here, and I 
know somehow this thing's going to affect me personally.' "

WHAT AUDITOR SAID, HOW CITRON REPLIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following is excerpted from the county auditor's Aug. 5, 1993, report on 
then-Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's operation:  
</P>
<P>
 The weaknesses we found seemed to result from the control environment in that 
management's style and methods for running day-to-day operations reflected 
inattentiveness to complying with these policies and procedures. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The department head made all day-to-day investment decisions and also executed 
the transactions without anyone else involved to provide segregation of duties 
or oversight. An internal investment committee made up of the department head, 
the assistant department head, and the chief of divisional operations was 
created to provide input on investment strategy and types of investments that 
should be considered. This committee functioned in an advisory capacity only. 
When the department head deviated from investment guidelines established by 
Government Code or the investment committee, he did so without consulting 
anyone in the Treasurer's Office or on the committee. . . . We were advised 
that most of these actions were taken to increase yield. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Government Code Sections (GCS) 53601, 53635, 53637, 53638, and 53651 mandate 
guidelines for investments and depositories that the Treasurer can use for the 
County's monies. . . . Our testing revealed some violations of the GCS. We were 
told that the instances were conscious decisions made to maximize returns. . . 
. In addition . . . the Treasurer invested $75 million in a negotiable 
certificate of deposit from Columbia Savings & Loan and $7.5 million in a time 
deposit from Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan. . . . The Treasurer lost no 
money with either institution, but we found that Fidelity was rated by Thompson 
Bank Watch as D/E and that Columbia went bankrupt in 1991. Because of the 
fiduciary responsibility that the Treasurer has for the County's monies, it 
should only invest with institutions maintaining high ratings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . We also found that $25 million of medium-term notes were sold on June 
28, 1991, and that similar amounts and types of notes were purchased on July 2, 
1991. We were told that the department head entered into these transactions at 
the request of the broker, Merrill Lynch, to help the broker meet financial 
statement ratios required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We 
reported a similar finding to the Treasurer in a letter dated December 23, 
1991, concerning transactions with Merrill Lynch in late December 1990 and 
early January 1991. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . As this is an unusual transaction, the decisions to enter into it should 
be made by the investment committee, and the reason for it should be 
documented. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We also recommend that risky or unusual transactions be prudently entered into 
with documented decisions made by the investment committee and with advice from 
County Counsel. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasurer documented policies and procedures as an ongoing task with a low 
priority. . . . We found errors in the preparation of financial analyses and 
reconciliations that were attributable to either the lack of written procedures 
or the incompleteness of procedures that were documented. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is excerpted from Robert L. Citron's response to the 
accountant's report, dated August, 1993:  
</P>
<P>
 We do not agree that management philosophy or style should be changed at this 
time. The methods by which a department head managed his fiduciary 
responsibilities is determined by his own personality and abilities as well as 
his evaluation of the personalities and abilities of his subordinate managers 
and staff. . . . We believe the current management style, although not the norm 
for County government, is the best one for the Treasurer-Tax Collector. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We always attempt to comply with government code requirements for investments. 
It is important to note that the determination of available cash for investment 
is an inexact art; sometimes we have overestimated our projections of month and 
cash balances, and that has resulted in our holding more than legally allowed 
levels of certain securities. We continue to attempt to improve this system. 
</P>
<P>
 The words "risky," "unusual," and "prudent" as applied in the audit 
recommendation are difficult for us to objectively evaluate. Those are 
subjective terms that are subject to a wide range of opinion. . . . We are not 
as conservative in our investment strategies as some of our contemporaries, and 
because of that, some transactions that are usual for us may in fact be unusual 
for others. We also engage in many complex investments, some which are too 
complex for smaller government entities to utilize. That would not mean those 
investments are risky.

GUSTS BLAMED FOR HOUSE FIRE, POWER OUTAGES; WEATHER: 'TYPICAL SANTA ANA 
CONDITIONS' KNOCK DOWN ABOUT 50 POWER LINES IN ORANGE COUNTY. THE WINDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. 
</P>

 Blustery winds downed dozens of power lines Thursday and ignited a fire that 
destroyed most of a three-bedroom home in Orange Park Acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which started about 9:49 a.m. at the 10500 block of Orange Park 
Boulevard, occurred after heavy winds knocked down a eucalyptus tree. That in 
turn toppled a power line, setting fire to a nearby palm tree. Embers from the 
burning tree then blew on the wood-shingled roof of the two-story home and 
caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the morning, winds had toppled another eucalyptus tree outside the 
same house, in an unincorporated area in the hills near Orange. Southern 
California Edison workers were outside the home checking the power line when 
the winds toppled the second tree and brought the line down. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no dollar estimate on damage, but homeowner Judy Linnan said her 
house is worth about $600,000. Linnan, a psychologist who practices in 
Placentia, had eight pets at the house: two llamas, two potbellied pigs, two 
dogs and two cats. All of the pets were found safe, except for one missing cat. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was inside the home at the time of the fire, and the 50 firefighters 
who responded to the scene were able to limit most of the damage to that one 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we put that fire out, our strike teams went down the block putting out 
small roof fires," started by flying embers from the original blaze, said Capt. 
Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department. "If we hadn't done that, we 
probably would have lost at least half a dozen homes. We're definitely not out 
of fire season, and with the winds like this, it could create very hazardous 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Linnan, who raced home after a neighbor called to tell her about the fire, 
said she was grateful to the firefighters for keeping the fire from damaging 
the houses of her neighbors. Erika Morris, who lives across the street from 
Linnan's house, also rushed home after a neighbor's call. She collected many of 
her belongings, fearing that the Santa Ana winds would spread the fire quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised the whole neighborhood didn't burn down the way the winds were 
blowing this morning," she said. "The firefighters did an excellent job because 
when I got here, the (other) house was totally engulfed in flames and 
firefighters were on my roof hosing it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said homeowners with 
wood-shingled roofs should take extra precautions during gusty conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a fireplace and a wood-shingled roof, you should have a spark 
arrester on your roof, which is like a screen door for chimneys," she said. 
"And if you have trees near or on a power line, you should call Edison if you 
believe it's a fire hazard." Crews will check for potential fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's blustery winds, which were strongest near the canyon areas, are 
expected to continue today and possibly through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winds are gusting higher than expected throughout Southern California," 
said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData. "These are typical Santa 
Ana conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The strong wind conditions also downed about 50 power lines throughout the 
county, leaving thousands of residents without electricity for up to several 
hours, said Criss Brown of the Southern California Edison's regional Orange 
County office. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison workers began responding to calls about downed power lines at 6 a.m., 
and worked throughout the day. About 4,000 customers were briefly without 
power, and 5,800 more experienced extended power outages in Santa Ana and the 
Orange area, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said there were three main trouble spots involving blackouts: at Chapman 
Avenue and Calle Grande in Orange, where 100 customers were affected for 
several hours; for 900 customers in the area near the fire, and for 100 
customers in Tustin.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's all because of the gusty winds," Brown said. "The winds are slapping our 
lines together and trees are knocking them down." 
</P>

SIBLING REVELRY; PARENTS OF TRIPLETS, QUADRUPLETS TRADE TALES AT REUNION 
</P>

 Francine and David Gibbons had planned to have two children spaced three years 
apart. Instead, they had three kids spaced two minutes apart. So much for 
family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Waggener knows just how they felt. When she was three months' pregnant a 
decade ago, the doctor told her she was having twins. A month later, he upped 
the ante to triplets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hysterical," she recalled while attending the 12th annual triplets 
reunion at St. Joseph Hospital. "I was crying so hard I had to call my husband 
to come drive me home." 
</P>
<P>
 Waggener and Gibbons are from two of 11 families that have been meeting each 
year since 1982 to trade war stories and take comfort that they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph leads the county in births, delivering an average of 500 babies per 
month. The hospital has brought about 35 sets of triplets and quadruplets into 
Orange since 1934, according to spokeswoman Valerie Orleans. And to hospital 
staff, all those kids seemed perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your children are all so well-behaved -- at least while they're here at this 
party," said Ragnar Amlie, a neonatologist who joined St. Joseph in 1979 and 
delivered most of the children running from the tables to the Santa Clause 
sitting in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Amlie, a neonatal specialist, hadn't planned on being a triplets expert any 
more than the parents conceived of having them. 
</P>
<P>
 He came on staff to specialize in premature births. Then the triplets and 
quadruplets started coming in, and with the popularity of fertility drugs, 
there is no end in sight. Now he says he loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time we see children when they are newborns, and then we see them 
once or twice after that -- then they disappear," he said. "It's always great 
to see the children growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun for the moms, too, but there are major drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, multiple-birth mothers tend to lose out on the bonding that comes 
with single-birth infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Thomas didn't have a chance to learn what normal bonding was like until 
she had her fourth child, Chelsea, now 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge difference with one child," she said, smiling when she recalled 
the nights she had time to just sit and hold her baby. A big change from when 
her triplets were born four years ago. "With her I really got to hold her and 
nurse her," she said of Chelsea. "With (the triplets), I rarely got to hold 
them or feed them a bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, feeding multiple siblings consists of propping bottles on a pile of 
blankets, spacing the babies around and letting them have at it, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waggener discovered the same method early on. And she had the additional chore 
of telling her three identical boys apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would paint their big toes when they were babies," she said. "One purple, 
one pink and one blank." 
</P>
<P>
 She can tell them apart now but worries as the other parents do about 
nurturing their individuality and eventually sending them all to college at the 
same time. "I've already told them they are going to have to help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And her advice for the new parents at the party? "You manage," she said. "You 
just manage."

NARROW RULING ANTICIPATED ON HOMELESS LAW; JURISPRUDENCE: STATE SUPREME COURT 
APPEARS RELUCTANT TO DECIDE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY SANTA ANA ORDINANCE 
AGAINST SLEEPING ON THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The California Supreme Court appeared reluctant Thursday to rule on the 
constitutional issues raised by a Santa Ana ordinance on the homeless, 
prompting predictions that cities will be allowed to resume their campaigns to 
control those who camp or sleep on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless, discouraged by the oral arguments before the 
conservative-led court, surmised that the justices might uphold the 
anti-camping law on narrow legal grounds and refuse to settle larger 
constitutional questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities around the state have been passing laws aimed at removing the homeless 
while awaiting a determination by the high court on whether such ordinances are 
constitutionally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is likely that the (California Supreme Court) decision won't 
ultimately resolve whether a city can make it a crime to use a blanket or a 
sleeping bag" on public property, Harry Simon, an attorney with the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County, said after arguing before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the justices did not state their views on the Orange County case, 
their questions indicated that the high court believes a state Court of Appeal 
in Santa Ana might have gone too far in declaring the ordinance 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides of the issue said the state high court appeared to 
believe it is bound to decide only whether the wording of the law was 
unconstitutionally vague and broad, not whether its impact would be cruel and 
unusual punishment for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Several justices indicated that there was not enough factual evidence 
presented to the trial court to warrant a finding on the larger constitutional 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court, which will rule on the case within the next few months, 
could send it back to Orange County Superior Court for a full hearing on the 
impact of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's 1992 ordinance prohibits people from using blankets or sleeping 
bags to sleep on public property. Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. 
Smith upheld it in April, 1993, but the Court of Appeal struck it down last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The city passed a second ordinance in the meantime to clear the homeless from 
the Civic Center area only, but has enforced neither law pending a ruling by 
the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. E. Thomas Dunn Jr., defending the law 
before the court, complained of peering out of his Civic Center office in Santa 
Ana and beholding a "shantytown" of lean-tos and campfires and people 
defecating and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think you were in the middle of a sewer plant," Dunn later told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that people who truly have no alternative to the streets would have a 
legitimate legal defense in court against the ordinance and would be spared 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, he said, is aimed at those who choose to sleep on public 
property rather than go to a shelter or other accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the homeless scoffed at his assertions, contending that 
those who were cited under the ordinance before it was blocked had nowhere else 
to go. Orange County has about 975 beds in shelters for the homeless and an 
estimated 12,000 to 15,000 homeless people, according to the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's concern about whether it technically could decide the larger 
constitutional issues raised by the homeless advocates came "totally out of 
left field," Simon said, because the city of Santa Ana had never raised such 
objections.

FOES OF PROP. 187 URGE BOYCOTT OF NABISCO, DISNEY; PROTEST: GROUPS POINT TO 
COMPANIES' HEAVY CONTRIBUTION TO REELECTION OF GOV. WILSON AND OTHERS WHO 
SUPPORTED INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Activists who unsuccessfully fought Proposition 187 at the ballot box unveiled 
formal boycott plans Thursday against two U.S. corporate icons -- the purveyors 
of Mickey Mouse and Oreos -- in an effort to capitalize on the economic clout 
of Latino consumers and others opposed to the immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycott organizers, who are hoping to win support throughout the United States 
and Latin America, are targeting Walt Disney Co. and RJR Nabisco because of 
major donations by corporate officers to the reelection campaign of Gov. Pete 
Wilson and other pro-187 Republican candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to sensitize companies like Disneyland that make earnings from 
immigrants," said Fabian Nunez of La Alianza in Pomona, speaking to reporters 
outside the main entrance to the Anaheim tourist mecca. "These corporations 
need to be sensitive to the people that make them wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco in New York, said the 
conglomerate did not take a position on Proposition 187. Boycott 
representatives have not contacted RJR Nabisco, said Makovich, who declined 
further comment. Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the company also 
remained neutral on Proposition 187 and that its gubernatorial campaign 
contributions, which also included donations to Democratic challenger Kathleen 
Brown, "were based entirely on business and tourism concerns as you would 
expect with the Disney Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 won by an almost 3-2 margin at the polls, where exit 
interviews showed Latinos made up only 8% of the voters although they account 
for 27% of the state's population. Latino activists Thursday termed boycotts an 
alternative method to demonstrate their growing clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the electoral power that our numbers would suggest, but it's 
important to show the community that we do have economic power -- the community 
does have a voice," said Evangeline Ordaz, a professor of Chicano studies at 
Cal State Northridge. She was among those announcing the RJR Nabisco boycott at 
a separate news conference outside a Latino supermarket in the largely 
immigrant Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Sponsoring the action against the tobacco and food conglomerate is the 
California Latino Civil Rights Network, an activist group that helped organize 
a large anti-Proposition 187 march in Los Angeles last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney boycott is being led by Coordinadora '96, a coalition of leaders of 
smallish grass-roots immigration rights groups including One-Stop Immigration 
of Los Angeles and La Alianza. The group said its boycott will also concentrate 
on Chevron -- another substantial contributor to Wilson's campaign -- and on 
national convention business slated for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's actions are the latest in a series of Latino-led boycotts -- some 
seemingly spontaneous, others, like Thursday's moves, planned in advance -- 
against donors to Wilson, who made his support for Proposition 187 a 
centerpiece of his reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers made it clear that additional companies would be targeted because 
of their financial support for Wilson and other Republicans. The GOP helped 
bankroll the pro-187 campaign and Wilson ran a series of tough, pro-187 TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the Republican Party is trying to scapegoat the Latino and immigrant 
community for their own political gain, and that's immoral," said Mario 
Salgado, executive director of the Civil Rights Network. "People are being hurt 
by it, and these companies need to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has termed the boycotts counterproductive. "Boycotts help no one, and 
many of these Latino activists who are calling for boycotts are hurting their 
fellow Latinos and recent immigrants who work in entry-level service sector and 
manufacturing jobs," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the governor.  
</P>
<P>
 A demonstration to kick off the boycott of Disneyland, Disney films and other 
merchandise is planned outside the main gate of the Magic Kingdom on Saturday 
morning by boycott leaders, who helped organize the massive October protest 
against Proposition 187 in downtown Los Angeles. The boycott will continue at 
least until 1996, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking for from Disneyland is sensitivity to our community," said 
Nunez, an American flag unfurled behind him, "and a commitment from this 
corporation that they are committed to advancing the interests of this 
immigrant community."  
</P>
<P>
 Nunez said he believes a boycott can have "a substantial impact" on Disney, 
even though he has no expectation of bringing the company to its knees. "The 
image of Disneyland will have to be re-evaluated by many people who come to the 
theme park," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 For decades, he noted, the portrayal of ethnic groups in Disney cartoons has 
raised questions, most recently criticism of Arab characters in "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in the same week that Orange County declared bankruptcy, Nunez 
conceded, some might take a boycott of the county's ultimate icon as rubbing 
salt in a wound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there may be a backlash, but we're willing to face the consequences 
of that," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the boycott against RJR Nabisco -- whose expansive line ranges from 
Camel cigarettes to Oreo, Fig Newton and Chips Ahoy! cookies to A-1 steak sauce 
and Ortega brand Mexican food products -- announced their action in the parking 
lot of Liborio's Market, which caters to a largely Latino immigrant clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the word through community groups, churches and other organizations, 
boycott strategists plan to reach shoppers throughout the United States and 
Latin America -- where Nabisco sales also are high. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are alternatives to all these products," said Roberto Lovato of the 
Civil Rights Network as he stood in front of a table arrayed with Nabisco 
products, including Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Certs and Lifesavers 
candies. "But there are no alternatives to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers wore red armbands asking, in Spanish and English, "Who's next?" -- 
an allusion to what some activists call the scapegoating of immigrants in the 
post-Proposition 187 era. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycott planners are seeking an apology from RJR Nabisco and a pledge that the 
corporation will not back candidates who use immigration as a "divisive" issue, 
Salgado said.

<P>
 Santa and his elves will not be drawing hazard pay Saturday when pet lovers 
line up to have their animals' picture taken with St. Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santa has occasionally been nipped or soiled by frightened animals, 
organizers of the pet portrait session say that most visitors are well 
behaved.The event raises money for an animal welfare organization called ARF, 
the Animal Relief Foundation of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all of the pets that come in are well-trained by responsible owners," 
said Mary Obenberger, a spokeswoman for the ARF. "Santa doesn't usually have a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Photos will be taken from 2 to 5 p.m. at Petco, 415 Avenida Pico. For those 
who cannot make this weekend's event, there will be another Santa pet photo 
session Dec. 18 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 ARF charges $5.99 for the picture; the fee is donated to the all-volunteer, 
nonprofit organization. "All the money is used for animal welfare, for things 
such as veterinarian care and any money needed to help rescue an animal," 
Obenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group rescues strays and puts them up in the houses of volunteers until 
adoptive homes can be found. More than 2,800 people in the South County area 
belong to ARF. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is seeking to buy a facility to house the strays and holds several 
fund-raisers during the year to support the program. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 The City Council this week chose third-year Councilman Mark Goodman to serve 
as the city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old transportation analyst was elected in a 4-0 vote, with 
Councilman Eddie Rose abstaining.Rose had nominated Mayor Janet Godfrey to 
serve a second mayoral term, but she declined the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas W. Wilson was elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's meeting also contained an emotional farewell to Councilman James F. 
Krembas, a council member since the city's incorporation. Citing a need for a 
break from politics, Krembas did not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 With his usual mix of gratitude and optimism, Krembas, 58, thanked the 
community members who worked alongside him in the city incorporation effort and 
exhorted the council to listen to all city residents when making important 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna Niguel is not things. It's people," a teary-eyed Krembas said. "We 
don't have an amusement park or a mission. But we do have loyal and dedicated 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Krembas had been on the board of directors of the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District since 1987. He was also one of the founders of the Laguna 
Niguel Chamber of Commerce, serving as its president in 1983-1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates, who was also an inaugural City Council member 
and who was recently reelected with 30% of the vote, said she will miss 
Krembas' sense of humor and giving spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy night to see a colleague go out and share his gifts with 
others," Bates said. "But it's also a moment of sadness."LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOOTHILL RANCH; ENTERTAINMENT CENTER FOR TEENS PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to tap the market of young folks who say there are few places for 
teen-agers to have supervised fun in South County, a statewide firm has 
unveiled plans for a large-scale entertainment park here. 
</P>
<P>
 The park will be on a six-acre site in the Foothill Ranch Towne Centre and 
will feature high-tech rides, miniature golf and several other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been looking for an ideal expansion site in south Orange County," said 
Gerald B. Johnson, general partner of Camelot Park Family Entertainment 
Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foothill Ranch was the perfect choice . . . because it's a high-growth 
residential and business area." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment center will be called the Palace Park of Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an arcade filled with high-tech games, the park will have three 
18-hole miniature golf courses, a Grand Prix-type miniature race course, a 
bumper boat pond, batting cages and a theme castle. 
</P>
<P>
 The arcade will be inside the castle and will feature virtual-reality games 
and a laser tag arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Camelot Park officials hope to open the park by early summer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment firm will join several other major tenants in the 163-acre 
shopping complex being developed by the Foothill Ranch Co., including Wal-Mart, 
Target, Mervyn's and HomeBase. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, which also built the surrounding Foothill Ranch community, said 
the shopping center is the largest of its kind in the country. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COPS SHOW THEIR SANTA SIDE AT MAMMOTH TOY 
GIVEAWAY

 Smiling and clutching a colorful toy helicopter still in its wrapping, Joey 
Ceja, 10, praised the police officers and other volunteers who threw a massive 
holiday party for community children Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good of them to give toys to people.I want to tell them, 'Thanks 
for the toys,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey was one of about 5,000 people -- mostly children -- who attended the 
fourth annual "Christmas Celebration," sponsored by the Police Department's 
Westend Division. During the three-hour party, children received dolls, teddy 
bears and other toys and also visited Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the party started at the Lucky Shopping Center on McFadden Avenue, 
hundreds of children and their families had lined up. 
</P>
<P>
 While they waited, choral group and bands from local high schools performed 
renditions of "Deck the Halls," "Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and other 
holiday favorites. Clowns and magicians wandered about. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Bill Tegeler, who commands the Westend Division, said that the yearly 
party offers the department a way to give back to the community, especially 
because so many of the children who receive presents come from low-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of them, this is the only Christmas they get. It's fun just to see 
the kids' eyes light up when they see Santa Claus," he said.JON NALICKSANTA ANA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; REPORT ISSUED ON SCOUTS' GAY BIAS

<P>
 A task force formed to lobby the Boy Scouts of America to change its policy of 
banning gays from joining Police Explorer programs told the City Council this 
week that a change in the organization's policy is more likely to be prompted 
by pending court cases than by lobbying from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was formed six months ago by the previous council, which was 
concerned because the city has a popular and well-established Explorer group 
but also has a law prohibiting discrimination based upon sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts of America is considered the parent organization of the Police 
Explorer program and provides insurance for the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, which is composed of parents, youths, representatives from 
gay-rights groups and the general public, has met 11 times. Chairwoman Theresa 
O'Hare reported back to the city for the first time Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hare said the group wrote to 100 cities with non-discrimination ordinances, 
outlining Laguna Beach's dilemma and seeking ideas. Of the 33 municipalities 
that responded, 11 expressed interest in joining the effort to lobby the 
scouting group to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Hare told the council the task force believes change will come from 
pending court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really think it's just a matter of time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Gibbs, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America's Orange County Council, 
said Thursday that he is not aware of any pending change in the scouting 
organization's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is also studying the possibility of Laguna Beach splitting from 
the Boy Scouts and forming its own cadet program. 
</P>
<P>
 Should it do so, however, Laguna Beach scouts would not be able to participate 
in Boy Scout training sessions, camp-outs, work activities or social events. In 
addition, the Boy Scouts of America would no longer pay for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hare said the group will continue to "vigorously explore" possibilities and 
monitor ongoing court cases. It will report back to the City Council again Feb.

<P>
 Photographs of Orange County youths who were killed in 1993 are being sought 
to be featured in a documentary film being produced in an effort to curb youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of South County volunteers began working on the half-hour film project 
last year as a result of incidents in which several Orange County teen-agers 
were slain.It is entitled "Lost Future" and is designed for 13- to 18-year-old 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lost Future" will present the life of a teen-ager who died last year after 
being speared in the head with a paint roller rod. The documentary will be 
hosted by two teen-agers who will show home videos, pictures and letters of the 
dead teen-ager and discuss ideas about reducing youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The film will conclude with the photographs of the youths who were killed, 
producer Phil Martin said. He said he hopes to receive photographs of all 65 
youths who were killed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos should be mailed to Martin at Crown Cable Television, 2215 Mission 
Road, Alhambra, Calif. 91802, by Jan. 15, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary is expected to be ready to air on local cable channels by 
mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said some school districts have expressed interest in using the film as 
an educational video in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end result we're looking for is that kids discuss the problems and 
solutions for youth violence," he said.MIMI KO

 Resident Stan Cohen admits that he likes watching cop shows and is proud that 
his son is a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen said he is not following in his son's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the reason he became involved in the Police Department's Retired 
Senior Volunteer Program is to serve his community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen was among 23 people who graduated this week from the eight-week training 
class. They were the department's second graduating class, in which 70 
residents applied to participate. The first graduating class of 23 volunteers 
began serving in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now have an opportunity to give back to my community. It's some way I can 
repay what they've done for me," said Cohen, 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg presented the graduates with their badges 
during a Tuesday morning ceremony at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said the volunteers -- who are at least 55 years old and come from 
varied backgrounds and diverse careers -- do work that "frees up police 
officers to do the job they are trained to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said the volunteers also provide "another set of eyes and ears out 
on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 They patrol in marked cars, issue parking citations and help with 
administrative work inside the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 They also check on homes of residents who go on vacation and notify residents 
who leave garage doors open of the risk of being burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have placed 4,755 notices at homes where garage doors were open and 
have taken down 8,535 signs placed illegally around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Starling Thomas, program coordinator, said that the first 23 volunteers 
have given more than 8,800 hours to the department and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are doing for this city and department is above and beyond our 
expectations," Thomas said. DEBRA CANO

 The Anaheim Union High School District Board of Trustees appointed L.E. (Slim) 
Terrell this week to fill the seat vacated by Lou Lopez, who resigned last 
month to become an Anaheim City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell was the fourth-highest vote-getter in the Nov. 8 election for three 
board seats.But there was some debate over whether the board should appoint him 
immediately or consider others. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Robert Stewart called for Terrell's appointment and said "the 
electorate has spoken. He was the No. 4 vote-getter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Joanne L. Stanton said the board should consider all who were 
interested in the seat, the district's usual policy when filling a vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's a democratic process to give those in the community an 
opportunity" to be considered, Stanton said. "We can get a sense of where they 
are coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 3 to 1, with Stanton opposing, to appoint Terrell. He will be 
sworn in at the next scheduled meeting on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Monday's meeting, Trustees R.A. (Molly) McGee and Harald G. Martin 
were sworn in for four-year terms. McGee was elected president of the board, 
Stewart was elected clerk, and Martin was elected assistant clerk. DANIELLE A.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; YOUNG CYCLISTS CAN GET $10 HELMET DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to get bicyclists younger than 18 to wear helmets, the Police 
Department and two local bicycle shops are offering $10 discount coupons for 
the headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 Police passed out the coupons at schools throughout the city to encourage 
parents to buy the helmets for their children.Beginning Jan. 1, police said, 
they will cite any youngster riding a bicycle without a helmet. The citation 
will carry a fine that has yet to be set by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a helmet is $20, and the shops offering the $10 discounts 
are JAX Bicycle Center, 2520 E. Chapman Ave., and Mulrooney's Fullerton 
Bicycle, 424 E. Commonwealth Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires bicycle riders or passengers younger than 18 to wear 
helmets approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The law took effect 
last Jan. 1 but local police have not issued tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved helmets have a stickers with "DOT," "ANSI" or "SNELL" written on 
them, authorities said. For more information about the bicycle helmet law, call 
the Police Department at (714) 738-3153.MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board agreed Tuesday night to wait until January to decide whether 
to appoint a new superintendent from candidates within the district or launch 
an outside search. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness of one Irvine Unified School District trustee forced the board to 
cancel interviews with two Irvine deputy superintendents, both candidates for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has scheduled a special meeting for Monday to discuss the 
replacement of former Supt. David E. Brown, who left in October to head the 
Napa Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown joined the school district in 1988, replacing founding Irvine Unified 
Supt. A. Stanley Corey. Deputy Supt. Susan Long and Paul Reed are candidates 
for the district's top job. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has meetings scheduled for Jan. 3 and 17, but trustees have 
not decided at which meeting a decision will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The special meeting Monday will begin at 5:30 p.m. with a public discussion of 
the possible effects of the county's investment losses on the school district.

ABORTION CLINIC OWNER CALLED 'WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING'; COURTS: PROSECUTOR 
SAYS MURDER DEFENDANT SHOWED HER TRUE NATURE BY TRYING TO CONCEAL BODY AFTER A 
BOTCHED PROCEDURE. DEFENSE SAYS SHE TRIED TO SAVE PATIENT'S LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor Thursday likened an abortion clinic owner accused of murdering a 
patient during an illegal abortion to a "wolf in sheep's clothing," contending 
she took advantage of frightened young women who had nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King told jurors that Alicia Hanna -- who is not a 
doctor -- exhibited a calm, soothing demeanor to her troubled patients, holding 
herself out as a medical worker who could perform safe, legal abortions in her 
Santa Ana clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanna's true identity emerged Jan. 19, 1993, King told Orange County 
Superior Court jurors during his closing argument in her trial on charges of 
second-degree murder, attempting an abortion on Angela Nieto Sanchez and 
performing illegal abortions on two other patients. That's when Sanchez, a 
27-year-old mother of four, became violently ill and died shortly after Hanna 
administered drugs to Sanchez in preparation for an abortion, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna testified that she had tried to save the patient but lacked the proper 
emergency equipment -- such as a working oxygen canister. She did not alert 911 
for fear of being caught, she said. She later tried to hide Sanchez's body in 
the trunk of a car and planned to dump the corpse in Mexico, according to trial 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came down to Alicia Hanna's hide or the victim's hide, the victim was 
going to lose," King argued. "There was a conscious decision made by Alicia 
Hanna, and that conscious decision was: 'I'm not going to get caught.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen Biskar acknowledged that Hanna had erred by 
practicing medicine without a license but said Hanna is charged with too 
serious a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was wrong in practicing medicine without a license, but that's 
involuntary manslaughter, not murder," Biskar said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the prosecution had not proved its burden beyond a reasonable 
doubt and that one of the key prosecution witnesses -- Hanna's former assistant 
-- is a liar whose testimony against her former boss cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna tried her best to save her patient's life, Biskar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did what she could," Biskar said. "A person who is a murderer doesn't 
want to save the life of their victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions remain about what killed Sanchez, Biskar contended, noting that 
prosecutors are unable to identify a substance Sanchez was allegedly injected 
with before her death. Hanna testified that Sanchez appeared to be on drugs 
when she arrived for the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna also admitted lying at least eight times to police and Sanchez's family 
members about the death, giving them a variety of stories. But Biskar said 
Hanna had "found the Lord" and made a commitment to tell the truth about the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor asked the jury to recall the "mental pain" Hanna inflicted on 
Sanchez's young son and daughter, who arrived at the clinic with their mother. 
After the death, Hanna told the children that their mother had left the clinic, 
and the pair waited outside for most of the day until an uncle picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives then embarked on a search for Sanchez and later returned to the 
clinic in the hope that she had returned. But Sanchez's 14-year-old daughter 
testified at trial that she stumbled upon Hanna trying to hoist her mother's 
lifeless body into a car trunk.

BONE MARROW DONORS SOUGHT FOR 2 VIETNAMESE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit organization will seek bone marrow donors this weekend for two 
Vietnamese children who are suffering from a rare and sometimes fatal blood 
disease, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, a Los Angeles group specializing in finding 
donors for people with blood marrow diseases, will attempt to find matches for 
Andrew Nguyen, 2, of Riverside and John Adam Le, 4, of Westminster from 5 p.m. 
to 9 p.m. on Saturday and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday at St. Barbara's 
Catholic Church, 730 S. Euclid St., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a match is more likely among people of the same ethnic background, the 
group is asking Asians between the ages of 18 and 55 for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding the right person means my son might have a chance of living a normal 
life," said Amy Nguyen, mother of Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew was diagnosed with aplastic anemia eight months ago after she noticed 
that he bruised easily and was very pale, Nguyen said. John's parents could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease affects six people per million annually, said Dr. Clarke Anderson, 
who treats patients with aplastic anemia at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease weakens the bone marrow to the point it can no longer produce 
adequate numbers of red and white blood cells and platelets, which help plug up 
openings in blood vessels during injuries, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the platelets, you keep on bleeding," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a bone marrow donor is difficult, Anderson said. The chances of 
finding a match is almost the same as winning the Lotto, he said. But it does 
happen, and organizers say they have succeeded in several cases within the past 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the parents of children suffering from the disease, Nguyen said, life can 
be a constant balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen quit working after Andrew was diagnosed with the disease because the 
child needed to be watched all the time, she said. For protection from 
injuries, Nguyen said Andrew wears a bicycling helmet during waking hours. 
Running and jumping are considered risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always scared that he'll fall. That could cause internal bleeding, which 
in his case might be fatal," Nguyen said. "He can't be out of my sight."

BODY OF WOMAN FOUND IN VEHICLE LEFT AT IRVINE HOSPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was found shot to death Thursday in a vehicle abandoned at the 
emergency room entrance of the Irvine Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital security guard discovered the victim, who appeared to be in her 
40s, under a pile of blankets and clothes in the passenger seat of a Toyota 
Landcruiser about 11:30 a.m., Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato said.She had been 
shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police a man in his 30s drove the vehicle to the back of the 
hospital, opened the door and walked away with the engine running, Allevato 
said. The man was last seen leaving the parking lot and heading toward Alton 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 An hourlong search using a police helicopter and bloodhounds failed to locate 
the man, authorities said. Police found footprints that ended at Alton Parkway 
and Laguna Canyon Road, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We trailed the suspect as far as we could," he said. "We think he may have 
hitchhiked." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators described the suspect as a bespectacled white man, about six 
feet tall with brown hair. He was wearing a brown shirt and gray pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was registered to an address in Huntington Beach, where 
investigators believe the victim lived. Her identification was withheld pending 
notification of family members. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse who spotted the vehicle blocking the entrance told a security guard to 
move it because she didn't see "anyone going in or coming out," said Anne 
Warde, hospital marketing specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard "drove it to a parking lot, then found the body while searching for 
some kind of an identification," Warde said. "He had been driving with the dead 
body right beside him and didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information should call Irvine police at (714) 724-7011 or (714) 
724-7174.

EX-CON SUSPECT IN POLICE SHOOTING, CARJACKING REPORTED UNDER ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Thursday night captured an ex-convict who police said fired at 
them hours earlier when they tried to stop him for a parole violation, then 
hijacked a car at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Vincent Hernandez, 29, of Santa Ana was to be booked into Orange 
County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer, carjacking 
and the parole violation, said Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was tracked down by investigators at a friend's house in Garden 
Grove after a daylong search, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 2 a.m. when Garden Grove police tried to stop 
Hernandez on an arrest warrant, Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez fired shots at police as he dumped his car near the Beach Boulevard 
entrance to the Garden Grove Freeway, then stole a car from a couple at 
gunpoint and fled, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies spotted the stolen car in Stanton, but Hernandez refused to 
stop, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the car and ran from deputies at an apartment complex on Knott Avenue 
in Anaheim, firing twice as he clambered over a fence. Deputies fired about 
four shots in return, but Hernandez got away, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 A search using helicopters and dogs failed to find Hernandez, but 
investigators later got a tip that he was staying at the home of some friends, 
Martini said.

POLICE CHIEF WON'T ENFORCE PROP. 187 UNTIL COURTS RULE; LAWS: GARDEN GROVE'S 
STANLEY L. KNEE TELLS PANEL THAT IMMIGRANTS' TRUST IS NEEDED TO HELP FIGHT 
CRIME.

 Saying everybody deserves police protection, including illegal immigrants, 
Garden Grove Police Chief Stanley L. Knee told the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission here Thursday that his department will not enforce 
Proposition 187 until the courts rule on its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee said the controversial ballot initiative approved by voters presents a 
dilemma to law enforcement agencies that have worked hard to win the trust of 
immigrant communities. In Garden Grove, officers have worked to establish an 
outreach program in the Latino community, Knee said, crediting the program with 
helping to lower the city's crime rate by 15% this year. Emphasizing that every 
citizen deserves police protection, Knee said: "This is something that nags at 
my heart. When I say everybody, I mean even everybody who is here under 
questionable legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow local law enforcement agencies to become part of the immigration 
solution," he said, "we will break the circle that has come together to fight 
crime. We need everybody in the community to trust the police." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that unless the courts uphold Proposition 187, his department would 
not enforce the provision requiring law enforcement agencies to report 
criminals who are illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee also stressed that even if the measure is upheld, Proposition 187 does 
not require police to report crime victims or witnesses who are illegal 
immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person witnesses a crime, he should feel comfortable coming to the 
police," Knee said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that if people "perceive the police as an arm of the INS, 
they're going to turn their back on law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Knee spoke at a commission meeting that was billed as a dialogue between 
proponents and opponents of Proposition 187. However, the meeting attracted not 
one supporter of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee and representatives from other public agencies addressed the panel to 
explain how they are implementing the proposition, which was approved by 
California voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Knee, the other representatives said their agencies would not enforce 
provisions until all legal challenges to the measure are heard. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all of the other speakers from the community attacked Proposition 187 
as divisive or racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Kent said he treats mostly elderly and poor Latino patients at the 
Edward Roybal Health Center in Los Angeles. Proposition 187 denies most medical 
care and education to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Proponents of 187) do not have a right to tell me I must deny treatment to 
any of my patients," Kent said. "I will not participate in a process to deny 
health care and education to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramiro Rubio, who said he is an immigrant, offered an impassioned plea for 
tolerance in the wake of 187, and accused proponents of turning on immigrants 
in order "to find the final solution to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "The message (of 187) is that we're intolerant," Rubio said. "But I am a 
member of this society too. I know I'm valuable to this society."

 Toppled Toilet Draws Lawsuit: A woman who fell from a handicapped-accessible 
toilet at a McDonald's outlet in New York state is suing the restaurant's 
former owner for $600,000. Michelle Verdicchio and her husband, Louis, filed 
the suit this week in Saratoga County Court against Donald John Connelly, who 
owned the restaurant in Clifton Park, N.Y., about 15 miles north of 
Albany.According to the suit, Michelle Verdicchio was seated on the commode in 
June, 1993, when the toilet suddenly shifted and tipped to its side, causing 
her to lose her balance. Verdicchio, whose age was not disclosed, was thrown 
against the wall and suffered injuries to her right arm, shoulder, chest and 
breast, and she suffered emotional distress, the lawsuit said. It was not clear 
whether Verdicchio was using the stall because of a disability.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: COLD, HARD FACTS ABOUT AIRING DEATH FOOTAGE ON 
TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, a judge gets the message. Citizens should have the opportunity to 
witness with their own eyes the outcome of laws and policies they endorse. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that would be one result from what an Ohio jurist is advocating. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuyahoga County Judge Anthony O. Calabrese Jr. wants to impose television on 
the death penalty. Not all death penalties in his state, just the one he 
ordered last month for a man convicted of fatally shooting two people in the 
head as they sat in the front seat of a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabrese apparently surprised no one when he accepted a jury's recommendation 
and imposed the death penalty on Tyson Dixon (which could be either by the 
electric chair or lethal injection). The surprise came when the judge proposed 
that the execution be televised, and that it be accessible to other media as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case is under appeal, there's no guarantee that Dixon's scheduled Feb. 
24 execution will happen. Despite scores of prisoners being sent to death row, 
none has been executed in Ohio since the state reinstated the death penalty in 
1981. Even if Dixon is executed, though, there's no evidence that television 
would readily accept the judge's invitation and throw the camera switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Donahue, who recently lost a court battle to televise an execution in 
North Carolina, says he would send a camera to Dixon's Ohio execution but 
couldn't promise that stations buying his syndicated talk show would air the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from Cleveland, Calabrese emphasized that his aim is 
not to shock anyone. He said he has no idea whether televising an execution 
would deter murder or whether it would serve either death penalty advocates or 
opponents of capital punishment.  
</P>
<P>
 Calling the double homicide "one of the most vicious, brutal, outlandish 
crimes" he'd encountered in his years practicing law, Calabrese said his only 
agenda was to demonstrate to the public, through television, that the criminal 
justice system is not soft on vicious criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing someone die in the chair just might do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in our community do not believe that people are punished for their 
acts," Calabrese said, adding that if he were producing such a telecast, he'd 
precede the execution with footage of the crime scene and accounts of the 
victims' deaths and the impact on their families. "Everybody ought to see this. 
It's the people's business." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet local stations may not be persuaded that it's their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they threw the doors open, I'm not sure we'd be there," Paul Stueber, news 
director at ABC affiliate WEWS-TV, said from Cleveland. "I operate under the 
Fritz theory. He is my 4-yea-old nephew. I don't want anything on my newscast 
that I would be embarrassed to explain to Fritz. The problem with television is 
that it just spills right out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabrese says public response is running 80% to 90% in favor of his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If enough people feel that way," said Stueber, "rent a movie theater downtown 
and show it on closed circuit. I'm worried about forcing it down someone's 
throat or appealing to baser nature." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are some news executives who believe that appealing to baser 
natures is a commandment of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the stations that would piously recoil at televising an execution, how many 
ran that 1993 Telemundo tabloid footage of a man gunning down his former wife 
in a Florida cemetery? Six Los Angeles stations did, and so did NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 How many showed the Super Bowl of suicides in 1987 -- footage of a 
Pennsylvania state official pushing the barrel of a .357 Magnum into his mouth 
and pulling the trigger at a press conference he called to orchestrate his own 
obituary? A bunch of stations in Pennsylvania and Ohio did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was news director at Scranton, then, and we took about four seconds to 
decide we weren't going to put that on the air," said Stueber. He added, 
however, that he believes the Cleveland station he now works for did air the 
suicide footage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, how many stations routinely show security camera footage of people 
getting blown away during robberies? Or have shown documentary footage of John 
F. Kennedy's head exploding like a melon? 
</P>
<P>
 And how many continue to play Russian roulette by giving live coverage to 
police chases, whose potentially bloody outcomes cannot be predicted? Where was 
young Fritz on the day last June that television -- every major network and 
just about every station everywhere -- had chopper cameras monitor fugitive 
O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco ride as it was pursued by a fleet of police cars? No 
one knew whether a shootout was in the works when the car pulled into the 
driveway of Simpson's home in front of all those live cameras. If there had 
been, you can believe that TV would have captured it, and to hell with Fritz! 
</P>
<P>
 The execution-telecast debate is not new. San Francisco public-TV station 
KQED, for example, sought in vain to televise the 1992 California execution of 
murderer Robert Alton Harris for use in a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Aired in the proper context, the very grisliness of the Harris execution might 
have been instructive to a society overwhelmingly in favor of capital 
punishment -- a society increasingly in denial, whether by mentally severing 
the slaughterhouse from the meat on the plate or by separating the execution 
headline from the gruesome scene inside the execution chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Death on camera has a tradition, from the televised assassination of Lee 
Harvey Oswald in 1963 to shocking pictures of a young Viet Cong suspect being 
shot in the head at point-blank range by South Vietnam Police Chief Nguyen Loan 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And death footage can have a beneficial impact, as it did recently when Alaska 
suspended its controversial wolf-control program after an Anchorage TV station 
showed pictures of a state official shooting a snared wolf five times in the 
head before it died, and footage of another wolf chewing off part of its leg in 
a futile attempt to escape from a trap. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera is an unimpeachable witness that lifts the veil of abstraction. 
Just as its presence is essential when local, state and federal government 
bodies convene to conduct the people's business, so, too, is its presence 
necessary when an executioner carries out the people's business, if not to 
effect a change in policy, then certainly to affirm that policy for its 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who insist that televising an execution would be barbaric, meanwhile, 
Judge Calabrese replies about convicted slayer Dixon: "Pumping three bullets 
into the heads of his victims was barbaric, too."

APPRECIATION; JOBIM WAS MORE THAN THE KING OF BOSSA NOVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra once said of Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Brazilian composer often 
described as the godfather of bossa nova, "Tom must compose. Without him, we 
have nothing to sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim, who died Thursday in a New York hospital at the age of 67, had a 
three-decades-long relationship with Sinatra, including albums in the '60s and 
'70s and the current recording "Duets II." 
</P>
<P>
 "My music experiences with him," added Sinatra, upon hearing of Jobim's death, 
"were as rewarding and creative as the hours and hours we spent talking and 
musing through the night. The world has lost one of its most talented and 
innovative musicians, and I have lost a wonderful friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Affectionately known as "Tom," Jobim created a body of music that extended 
well beyond his association with bossa nova. Rare for a South American 
composer, he influenced American jazz and pop at least as much as anyone else 
in the second half of the 20th Century. His passing has a special impact upon 
artists in the jazz and mainstream pop communities, and, unfortunately, has 
terminated several promising projects, including an upcoming recording with 
tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jobim's historical position is secure. "Chega de saudade" (known in 
English as "No More Blues"), written with poet/lyricist Vinicius de Moraes, is 
generally considered -- via the 1958 Brazilian recording by Joao Gilberto -- to 
be the first recorded bossa nova song. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '60s, Stan Getz's recording of "Desafinado" and his duet with 
Astrud Gilberto on "The Girl From Ipanema" hit the top of the U.S. jazz and pop 
charts, triggering a romance with Brazilian rhythms, harmony and melody that 
continues to embrace American music. (Seekers of karmic connections will be 
fascinated by the fact that Jobim and Getz were born on the same day, in the 
same year, at the same hour.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Gilberto, Jobim was not an especially charismatic performer, although 
the sound of his warm, plaintive voice often resulted in undeniably charming, 
utterly unique renderings of his own tunes. His last appearance in Los Angeles, 
at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1992, was characteristically laid-back 
and somewhat loosely organized. But, as jazz critic Leonard Feather reported, 
the appeal of Jobim's readings from his splendid catalogue of songs was 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 His works -- to mention only a few (in addition to those noted above) 
"Triste," "Corcovado," "Wave," "Dindi" and "Samba de una nota so" ("One-Note 
Samba") -- have become international standards, remarkably so, given their 
musical sophistication. (There may be no better testimony to their excellence 
than their capacity to survive the butchering touch of dozens of cocktail 
lounge performers.) These are wonderfully abundant songs, overflowing with 
complex harmonies and often intricate melodies encapsulated in rhythms that 
create an enormously powerful sense of mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desafinado," for example, which means off-key in Portuguese, uses unexpected 
leaps of an augmented fourth on the ends of some phrases -- not exactly a 
common melodic interval in most popular songs. Here and elsewhere -- "Chovendo 
na roseira" ("Raining in the Rose Garden"), a 6/8 tune with oddly disjunct 
phrases and sudden harmonic changes is another striking example -- Jobim 
reveals skills that reach well beyond simple songwriting and into the arena of 
minicompositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he composed many songs with De Moraes and others, one of his most 
impressive combinations of words and music, "Aguas de Marco" ("Waters of 
March") was a solo effort. First recorded in 1972, and only now beginning to be 
heard in performances by other artists, it is a deceptively playful series of 
melodic and verbal images dealing with no less than the meaning of life. A duet 
recording with Jobim and the late Elis Regina, a superb Brazilian singer, is 
available on the Verve CD "Antonio Carlos Jobim e Convidados." The sheer joy 
implicit in this spirited reading of a work described by Feather as one of the 
best songs ever written perfectly defines Jobim's singular mix of creative 
complexity and musical spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 In their excellent book, "The Brazilian Sound," authors Chris McGowan and 
Ricardo Pessanha describe Jobim's music as a ". . . body of work that rivals, 
in sophistication and originality, the music of 20th Century composers such as 
George Gershwin and Jobim's idol, (Brazilian classical composer) Heitor 
Villa-Lobos." High praise, indeed, but praise that is fully justified by the 
best testimony of all, the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobim's passing comes at a time when he was still an active and vital creative 
force. Sadly, there will be no more new songs, but his rich and generous 
musical legacy will live on. And Jobim's life and work can perhaps best be 
remembered in his own lyrics from "Aguas de Marco": "It's the promise of life, 
it's the joy in your heart."

BOLSHOI BALLET INTERRUPTS 'GISELLE' TO AIR GRIEVANCES; DANCE: THE TROUPE 
STRIKES OVER PAY AND THE 'CIVIL WAR' BETWEEN MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE PROPOSED 
CONTRACT SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Giselle's desperately graceful death was postponed for 20 minutes Thursday as 
the Bolshoi Ballet stopped the show to protest pay and management conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 As house lights dimmed in the red-and-gold hall and the orchestra did not 
play, opera singer Yevgeny T. Raikov informed the hushed, bejeweled audience 
that Bolshoi performers had decided to protest after the Russian government 
ignored their second no-confidence vote in theater director Vladimir M. 
Kokonin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We apologize to you, dear spectators," Raikov said, as titters vibrated 
through the beloved theater, now in its 219th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, the cast of "Giselle" waited 20 anxious minutes to see whether 
director Kokonin would make good on his threats to cancel the performance of 
the tragic French ballet, if the prestigious Bolshoi cast dared make public 
their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the government to pay attention to what is going on inside the walls 
of the Bolshoi Theater," explained a tuxedoed Gennady Butov from the orchestra, 
while fellow musicians sat in silence. "It's the first strike in 219 years. 
There has never been such a thing, and we hope the government and the president 
will listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent renovation has spiffed up the white-columned neo-classical facade of 
the Bolshoi, founded in 1776. But inside, the theater is reeling from financial 
troubles, the hemorrhage of its talent abroad and the worst internal political 
schism in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers say they earn from $80 to $200 per month and survive on what they 
can earn during tours abroad. There is no longer a Soviet state to hand out 
privileges or apartments to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are top performers who for 15 years and more have been living in 
appalling conditions in the theater hostel," said strike committee head Raikov, 
a People's Artist of the Soviet Union and a 33-year Bolshoi veteran.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bolshoi is the Bolshoi, and not all Russians are sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatiana S. Dudina, a former ballet dancer who is now a doorkeeper at the 
Bolshoi, called the striking performers "ingrates." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their life is a bed of roses," she asserted. "They have everything -- cars, 
good furniture, good flats. They go abroad. They come back with clothes and 
pockets full of money. And it's still not enough for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself get 90,000 rubles ($27 a month) and I am satisfied with this because 
I love the Bolshoi Theater," said the now-elderly ballerina, whose 
granddaughter is studying in the Bolshoi's famous ballet school.  
</P>
<P>
 Ballet patron Tatiana Solomentseva, whose husband had bought pricey ballet 
tickets for her 50th birthday, said of the performers: "They should resolve 
their problems some other way. Everybody is paid badly these days, and I don't 
think they're paid any worse than our scholars or scientists." 
</P>
<P>
 Raikov said the performers understand that their fans pay dearly for tickets 
and so they decided only to delay, not to cancel the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's strike was, perhaps, less about money and more the result of a 
bitter war raging between Kokonin and Artistic Director Yuri N. Grigorovich 
(who is currently touring the U.S. with a company that bears his name, composed 
of young dancers trained at the Bolshoi).  
</P>
<P>
 Kokonin persuaded President Boris N. Yeltsin to order the Bolshoi to introduce 
a contract system for employees; Grigorovich violently opposes this. "With 
this, a real civil war in the Bolshoi began," said theater critic Anatoly S. 
Agamirov, who supports the contract proposal.

 Moral to the Story: Celebrating the joy of giving are two very modestly 
animated, but sweet 25-minute offerings about friendship. In "Madeline and the 
Toy Factory," the latest chapter in the continuing saga about the little French 
schoolgirl, based on Ludwig Bemelmans' books and narrated by Christopher 
Plummer, Madeline pretends to be a doll and makes a lonely child happy. In "The 
Poky Little Puppy's First Christmas," narrated by Donald Sutherland, the 
playful pup discovers the meaning of Christmas when he helps a homeless little 
skunk named Herman.

 Before He's a Hound: If a real canine is on your gift list, don't miss 
"Puppies!," a charmingly filmed, informative look at several popular breeds, 
from Chihuahuas to Irish wolfhounds, with tips on temperament and care 
requirements -- which dogs do best with little children, how much room they

 Expert Opinion: If finding good home videos for kids is a challenge, the 
Coalition for Quality Children's Video, a not-for-profit organization made up 
of respected industry professionals, educators, caregivers and others, has just 
issued its first video guidebook. "Kids First Directory" is a softcover glossy 
listing about 300 recommended videos for infants through teen-agers, with 
descriptions, information on where to find them and video viewing tips for 
parents. Among the nationally chosen screening jury are children's librarians, 
early childhood education specialists and other professionals, and kids 
themselves -- about 2,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidebook is available for a $25 membership in the organization; a simple 
listing of recommended titles is free. Write the coalition at 535 Cordova Road, 
Suite 456, Santa Fe, N.M., 87501, or call (505) 989-8076.

COMEDY NOTES; HOLIDAY FESTIVAL TO MAKE RATHER MERRY

 The good folks at the Improv are taking a leading role in efforts to help the 
Brea Marketplace offer something above and beyond your run-of-the-mill mall 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the TGI Friday's restaurant, the city and others, Improv artistic 
director Michael Ari Wulffhart has helped forge the mall's first Holiday 
Festival, to take place Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up comics Pablo Francisco and Todd Glass, the Passing Zone comedy 
juggling duo and the a cappella Alley Cats will be featured along with 
strolling stilt walkers, magicians and balloon artists, dancers and members of 
the Brea Olinda High School Marching Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to create an arts identity," Wulffhart said this week. "We went to 
see Studio City's street festival, but it only had headliners. We went back to 
the Marketplace to put in a proposal for a street festival with national and 
local acts and then went through the audition process. All the acts have been 
asked to gear themselves to the holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
 The performances will be spread over four main and six supplementary stages 
throughout the mall. Merchants will have schedules of who's playing where and 
when. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, Wulffhart said, similar festivals will take 
place throughout the year, linked to various holidays. The Brea Marketplace is 
at East Birch Street and State College Boulevard. Information: (714) 283-2245.

 The Security Risk improvisational troupe puts its reputation for quickness on 
the line at 7 p.m. Monday at the Camino Real Playhouse in San Juan Capistrano. 
The Irvine-based ensemble, which includes director Ron Ruhman, Susan Dinkel, 
Jerry Mabbott and Debby Cali, bills itself as 100% pure ad-lib. The playhouse 
is right off the Ortega Highway, at 31776 El Camino Real, across from the back 
entrance to the Swallows Inn. Information: (714) 502-1541.

 Mutual fund holdings -- A chart in Thursday's editions listed certain mutual 
funds' holdings of the debt of all Orange County cities and agencies, not just 
bonds of the county itself.Very little -- if any -- of the non-county debt is 
affected by Orange County's filing for bankruptcy protection. Generally, such 
debt is insured or backed in some other way. The figures are as much as 10 
months old, so the funds' holdings may have changed. The USAA Tax-Exempt 
Short-Term Fund, for example, no longer holds any such debt.
