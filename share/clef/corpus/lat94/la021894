ART REVIEW; A BICOASTAL FLASHBACK; 'OUT WEST AND BACK EAST,' AT THE SANTA 
MONICA MUSEUM, IS A COLLECTION OF OBSCURE ARTISTS WHOSE WORK MOSTLY ADDRESSES 
CONCERNS THAT WERE ASCENDANT IN THE 1960S.

 In her short, wickedly funny videotape "Kiss My Royal Irish," Cheryl Donegan, 
clad in a bikini and boots, sits in a small puddle of green paint. She stands, 
then prints her posterior twice, in the pattern of a four-leaf clover, on a 
sheet of white paper. 
</P>
<P>
 This she tacks on the wall, then sets to work on another one. Slowly, Donegan 
creates a display of performance paintings of a wholly different order. 
</P>
<P>
 The order from which they are wholly different is that of Yves Klein's famous 
performance paintings of 1960. As a similar printing tool, he employed nude 
women slathered with a paint he had proprietarily dubbed International Klein 
Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 What Klein was to the gesturally expressive action painters of the 1950s, 
Donegan is to Klein: a parodist, debunker and usurper, making witty fun of an 
older generation while upending (quite literally, in the case of Donegan's 
"butt prints") many of its now deeply cherished pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donegan is one among 15 artists in "Out West and Back East: New Work From Los 
Angeles and New York," which is on view at the Santa Monica Museum of Art 
through March 6. If a theme emerges from this otherwise theme-less but 
enjoyable grouping of artists who, according to the museum's director Thomas 
Rhodes, might best be characterized as sharing "a strong sense of individual 
vision," it is in fact the degree to which the artistic issues and upheavals of 
the watershed 1960s create a context for their work of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with many people in other disciplines these days, artists are rethinking 
the tumultuous '60s and their aftermath. Most -- though by no means all -- of 
the artists in the show were born during that decade. Performance, Minimal, 
Conceptual and Pop art are the artistic ground zero they share, and they are 
busily reconsidering the legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Matthew Antezzo makes realist, black-and-white drawings and 
paintings that depict works of Minimal and Conceptual art, as documented in 
contemporaneous periodicals. Antezzo's renderings are oddly disconcerting, 
especially as their Photorealist strategy represents the conservative end of 
the period's adventurous spectrum: What Minimal and Conceptual artists tore 
asunder, Antezzo now slyly uses to represent their work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a videotape accompanied by a rickety chair that has been sawed apart and 
then ineptly reassembled, and whose fabrication is recorded by the videotape 
itself, Phyllis Baldino takes on artist and theorist Robert Morris' famous 
sculpture "Box With the Sound of Its Own Making." Baldino wears a tight, 
flowered minidress for her assembling job, which pointedly acts to restrict her 
freedom of movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldino's TV chair, which relies on the quintessential 1960s medium of video, 
throws out a question mark that calls to mind Matisse's famous dictum: For him, 
art was like a comfortable arm chair into which a weary businessman might sink 
at the end of the day. For her, it's a collapsing nest for a gallery-going 
couch-potato. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are Pop art and Op art extrapolations, such as Jason McKechnie's 
psychedelic abstractions that ooze out of the painting's rectangle and smear 
across the wall. Lisa Yuskavage's lurid pictures of nymphets merge Hallmark 
greetings with Andrew Wyeth's Helga, in a withering style that could be called 
Feminist Pop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop piece (after LOVE, after AIDS)" is John Souza's reworking of the famous 
Robert Indiana logo "LOVE," which was later reworked by the Conceptual 
collaborative General Idea into a devastating icon of the 1980s. "LIAR," 
Souza's literary epigram for today, is blunt, accusatory and bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 Souza also was given the task of installing Adam Ross' beautiful abstract 
paintings, which he has done in a manner that is as much about the unconscious 
habits of gallery and museum-goers as it is about abstract art. For instance, 
some labels thank the sign-maker and proof-reader who helped with the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other labels, placed adjacent to a row of abstract paintings on paper, 
identify the names of elementary school children. Did children make the 
abstract paintings, or did Ross? Is this an affirmation that "My 5-year-old 
could do that"? Or is it a subversion of the audience, which is accustomed to 
connecting wall labels to the closest works of art at hand, and willing to 
believe whatever the museum gives him to read? 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything in the show addresses concerns that were ascendant in the 
1960s, such as questioning the place of abstraction in artistic discourse. 
Daniel Wiener's odd, suspended sculpture of sewn fabric, wire and gloppy 
plaster, which seems to creep spiderlike along the floor, or Christian 
Schumann's wonderful, collage-style paintings, in which the field becomes a 
site for a seemingly random accumulation of unrelated, individually compelling 
pictures and abstract markings, connect only indirectly to earlier art. 
</P>
<P>
 So do Catherine Opie's startling portrait photographs in highly saturated 
color, which show elaborately pierced and tattooed people, sometimes of 
indeterminate gender. It may be that body art of the '60s and '70s could be 
claimed as an Opie ancestor. However, political fistfights since the 1980s are 
more to the point: Her pictures are compelling documents of men and women who 
permanently mark, scar and ornament themselves in extreme defiance of any 
suggestion that someone else has the right to control their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with "Bad Girls West" currently at UCLA, the work of Opie, Donegan, Baldino 
and several others indicates the degree to which feminism has now become 
central to artistic dialogue. In this way too the dominant ethos of the show is 
its pointed rethinking of the watershed represented by the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle further evidence is offered in the exclusive focus on artists working 
in New York and Los Angeles. Generally, you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish 
between representatives of the two cities just from looking at the work. 
(Notably, four of the eight New Yorkers went to art school in California.) 
That's another cataclysmic shift traceable to the '60s: The dialogue has 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a down side to "Out West and Back East," it's the museum's 
unwillingness to organize this group show around an idea more specific than 
simply being a bicoastal presentation of artists who have not developed, in the 
words of a handout accompanying the show, "significant museum exposure or 
commercial success." (More pressing artistic issues might come forward tonight, 
when a panel discussion featuring several of the artists convenes for a free 
public discussion at the museum at 7:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, given the present condition of American art museums, which are 
increasingly reliant on the sales power of name-brand art and artists for their 
shows, the relative "obscurity" of these artists, several of whom are eminently 
worth watching, might be enough. Perhaps the Santa Monica Museum has come up 
with a pressing issue in spite of itself.

 Is a Kiss Still a Kiss?: The much-debated "Roseanne" episode that centers 
around a kiss between two female characters will air March 1, but how the kiss 
will be depicted is another story. Carsey-Werner, the producers of the show, 
and ABC are still in discussions about the controversial smack between Roseanne 
Conner (Roseanne Arnold) and friend Sharon (Mariel Hemingway) in a gay bar. ABC 
said that the episode will air with "a parental discretion warning." In a 
description of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" episode, ABC said, "Roseanne feels 
pretty smug and cool -- until overwhelmed by a surprisingly affectionate 
encounter." Executive producers Roseanne and Tom Arnold have complained that 
ABC has balked at airing the kiss between the two women.

 'Homicide' Shows Signs of Life: NBC took the first step to bring Barry 
Levinson's acclaimed "Homicide: Life on the Street" back to the airwaves next 
fall. The network has ordered scripts and picked up options on primary cast 
members -- with the exception of Jon Polito -- for the gritty crime drama with 
a checkered ratings history. But Reeves Entertainment, the production company 
that produced "Homicide," is no longer in existence. So NBC still must strike a 
deal with the company that assumed Reeves' assets, as well as Reeves' parent 
company. "We are hopeful that these discussions will be successful and that 
'Homicide' will be a part of NBC's fall schedule," NBC said in a statement.

 Bruce, Crummey at KFI: Tammy Bruce, president of the National Organization for 
Women's L.A. chapter, will host a general issues show on KFI-AM radio (640) 
Saturdays and Sundays from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Bruce believes that she is the only 
openly gay woman to host a mainstream talk show. She had been filling in at the 
station since August. . . . Also at KFI, talk-show host Joe Crummey, who 
underwent surgery to remove a benign brain tumor Jan. 31, returns to the 
airwaves this Saturday and Sunday for his regular 3-5 p.m. shift. "I just want 
to let everybody know that I survived and I'm OK," Crummey said. PEOPLE WATCH

 Taylor to Have Hip Replaced: Actress Elizabeth Taylor, struggling with painful 
arthritis, is scheduled to undergo hip replacement surgery next month. Taylor, 
61, suffers from osteoarthritis, a condition in which the cartilage in the hip 
wears out and the bones grind together. The surgery is expected to require that 
Taylor be hospitalized from five to seven days, followed by a recovery period 
of eight weeks on crutches or a walker before she can progress to a cane. 
Complete recovery could take a year or two.

 Midler Testifies; Raye Hospitalized: Bette Midler told a Los Angeles Superior 
Court jury that she saw only one draft of comedian Martha Raye's life story 
before making the movie "For the Boys," and that the film was based more on her 
own life than it was on Raye's. Midler's testimony came Wednesday in the trial 
over Raye's lawsuit, which accuses Midler, her All Girls Productions company 
and 20th Century Fox of basing "For the Boys" on a screen treatment that Raye 
co-wrote and offered to Midler for $1 million. Meanwhile, Raye missed 
Wednesday's proceedings because she was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center for pneumonia. No release date was scheduled. Raye, 77, has suffered a 
series of health setbacks in recent years. MOVIES

 Oscar Watch: This year's Oscars are getting a new look. On Thursday, producer 
Gilbert Cates unveiled a model of the set, which has been given a bolder, more 
contemporary look. Production designer Roy Christopher, who has received Emmy 
nominations for his seven past Oscar presentations, designed the stage for the 
March 21 event, which takes place at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. His set is highlighted by an elegant asymmetrical floor design that 
features five lighted 16- to 20-foot-tall cones containing Oscar statuettes.

The festival, which runs through March 13, features nine world premieres and 
six U.S. premieres, plus special events including "A Salute to Buddy Rogers." 
Among the additional world premieres are ". . . and the earth did not swallow 
him," based on the late Chicano writer Tomas Rivera's prize-winning novel; 
"Chuppa: The Wedding Canopy," about a couple who are finally married in the 
Jewish tradition 50 years after surviving the Holocaust, and "Trading Mom," 
starring Sissy Spacek and Maureen Stapleton. QUICK TAKES

 The Canadian sketch comedy troupe the Kids in the Hall have signed a deal with 
Paramount Pictures for its first major movie, to be produced by Lorne Michaels 
of "Saturday Night Live" fame. The five-man troupe's fifth and final season of 
late-night TV begins in March on CBS and Comedy Central. . . . The Samuel 
Goldwyn Co. has acquired worldwide rights to "What Happened Was . . .," the 
directorial debut from actor Tom Noonan. The film was the only double winner at 
the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, capturing both the Grand Jury Prize and the 
Waldo Salt Screenwriting award. Goldwyn plans a fall 1994 release. SHAUNA SNOW

CHILDREN'S THEATER; LEWIS' TALE OPENS UP A HEROIC QUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Narnia, fauns and centaurs roam, a witch is defeated and a majestic lion 
helps four children fulfill their heroic destiny . . . You can't beat C.S. 
Lewis' "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," with its epic themes of death 
and redemption and good vs. evil, for a tale well told.  
</P>
<P>
 Theatreworks/USA's hourlong musical version of the classic, now touring 
Southland venues -- it plays Saturday at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara 
and Feb. 27 at the Norris Theatre in Palos Verdes -- is far from epic, but even 
this bare-bones, economy-sized show manages to convey some of the inspirational 
magic that has captivated young readers for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Condensed to a scant one hour by playwright Jules Tasca and given a sparse 
setting -- James D. Sandefur's set consists of a large wardrobe flanked by 
painted banners that are changed as the action shifts -- this World War II-era 
adventure only skims the highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan (Alison Franck), Peter (Andrew Pudvah), Lucy (Pamela Maclean) and Edmond 
(Mike Stutz), sent to stay at a country estate to escape the bombing of London, 
discover a doorway to a different world at the back of an old wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmond is bewitched by the wicked White Witch (a rather shrill Franck) who has 
given Narnia a perpetual winter (without Christmas). The other children are led 
to the great Aslan (Tim Gadzinski), a regal lion who tells them of the Narnian 
prophecy that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve (four human children) 
will defeat the Witch and become the kings and queens of Narnia. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mini-musical, directed by John Henry Davis, didn't dig deeper at this 
point, the show would be nothing but a superficial good time, punctuated by a 
crisp, high caliber score by composer Thomas Tierney and lyricist Ted Drachman. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the audience is given children as heroes in the struggle against evil 
and is challenged to identify with each child's discovery of unsuspected 
resources of courage and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 The "bloody conflict" -- John Edmond Morgan choreographed the swordplay and 
fight scenes -- and Aslan's sacrificial death (and his resurrection) are not 
gory or overly dramatized, but they aren't sugarcoated either.  
</P>
<P>
 The five adult actors change roles by changing headgear crafted to represent 
various animals and other characters, although it was difficult to make out 
details at a recent performance while seated toward the back of the large La 
Mirada Theatre. Caryn Neman is credited with the costume design. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE WORLD ON ONE LARGE PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving to Pangaea, the restaurant replacing Matrixx at the Hotel Nikko, we 
find ourselves speculating about the mysterious name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like panacea ," says one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds like medical terminology to me," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could be mistaken," another friend puts in. "But wasn't Pangaea the world 
before it blew all apart?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That sounds so beautiful," the first friend says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangaea does not look significantly different from Matrixx: swank, private, 
gleaming. I remembered the split-level layout, amorphous laminated glass 
sculptures, purple tulip-shaped globes clasping halogen bulbs. The clientele is 
largely hotel folk, business folk, a few young hip couples and Sting -- the 
wrestler, not the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more art than before: tall, elongated figures that seem to be made 
out of painted peat moss, some with hemp ropes extruding from their navels. But 
the tables are luxuriously large, the chairs commodious. On the center of each 
table, glittering under the light, a large amethyst geode sits like a small 
sample of the Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we get to take these home?" one of my friends wistfully asks our smart, 
efficient waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Too many people have taken them," says the waitress. "We're low on 
geodes." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make a trip to the geode store," says my friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep going to the center of the Earth," sniffs the waitress. "It's 
hot down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Our menus have cardboard covers with the front cut out to reveal a vague 
gray-green swirl with the word Pangaea written in ancient lettering. And right 
there, on the third page, all in lower-case letters, we read, "before there was 
europe, the americas and asia, there was pangaea . . . when all was one." 
</P>
<P>
 Pangaea's concept, then, is to reunite the continents on each plate of food. 
In doing so, the kitchen isn't entirely unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Pangaea's kitchen, under chef William Dertouzos, is more successful 
than many others that have tried such a pan-continental approach (Itameshi Ya, 
Ciao Chow Express and Melrose Place come to mind), and certainly more so than 
Matrixx, an earlier experiment in multicultural cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangaea's small, wide-ranging menu emphasizes seafood and Japanese 
specialties. An auxiliary sushi menu is also available.  
</P>
<P>
 Sushi is generously cut, attractively arranged; maguro (tuna) and yellowtail 
are cool and smooth as cream. Otherwise, my favorite appetizer is the crisp, 
deliciously seasoned Asian squid, which comes on a bed of wilted bitter greens 
and sauteed baby bok choy. Ahi poki , a kind of raw tuna tartare, is served on 
fried won-tons with chuka , a novel gelatinous stem, the gummy of green 
vegetables. Seared scallops are disappointing, more like blackened scallops, 
and gratuitously over-spiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Presentation here is often splendid, sometimes silly. Most splendid are the 
Japanese specialties, served in lovely ceramic bowls and lacquered boxes. 
Kinoko udon is a clear, nourishing broth with wild mushrooms, slightly 
overcooked udon and a thin, perfectly round disc of plain omelet. Sauteed, 
gloriously rich freshwater eel is served on rice in a pretty box on a tray 
along with slices of cantaloupe, some wonderful fresh salty pickles and an 
acorn-shaped covered cup of miso soup in which floats a soft-boiled quail egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees, called large plates on the menu, tend to be beautiful, enormous and 
muddled. There is a big, juicy rack of lamb artfully arched over a too-rich, 
intensely flavored, mysteriously dark mixture called "Oriental ratatouille," 
with fat slabs of rich quiche-like sweet potato-daikon cake stuck in the 
display at angles: too much mooshed onto one plate. Seared salmon is lightly, 
expertly cooked, but its bed of butter-drenched soba noodles is a mistake.  
</P>
<P>
 I remembered the rotisserie chicken plate from Matrixx: The meat is slightly 
overcooked, as ever, but the herbed spaetzle are chewy and flavorful and far 
more satisfying than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Seared pineapple is both temperature- and chile-hot: in a word, weird. The 
silliest presentation belongs to the firecracker dessert: Fruit and custard are 
rolled in a "broken" tube of undercooked filo dough with "BANG!" stenciled in 
cocoa over the break. 
</P>
<P>
 The big bang? 
</P>
<P>
 * Pangaea at the Hotel Nikko, 465 S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles. (310) 
246-2100. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Major credit cards.

MUSIC REVIEW; PIANIST LEO SMIT AT LACMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A polymath as well as a virtuoso, pianist/composer Leo Smit was for a long 
time ubiquitous on the Southern California musical scene. Then, more than three 
decades ago, the American musician moved East, and his visits here, though 
regular, have not been frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smit, who turned 73 last month, returned again this week for a sampler piano 
recital he dubbed "A Crazy Quilt of American Piano Music." A sound-mosaic it 
was, with both the fascination and drawbacks of that genre; it also proved a 
pleasant, often nostalgic, retrospective of pianistic styles of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen composers -- more than half of whom were friends or associates of 
Leo Smit -- contributed to this agenda, performed in Leo S. Bing Theater at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more engrossing pieces: Gottschalk's slick and slithering "Ossian"; 
Artie Matthews' (1888-1958) "Pastime Rag," No. 4; William Schuman's 
"Three-Score Set" (1943); Dorrance Stalvey's "Jazz: ca. '53" (1981), and Pete 
Johnson's pure-jazz, "Zero Hour" (c. 1940). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all the pieces -- some less than two minutes in length, none longer 
than 12 -- added to the historical picture. More important, they were arranged 
for contrast in length, texture and expressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 If the listener found no surprises in works by Ives, Ruggles, Farwell or 
Leonard Bernstein, he could revel in pungent revelations from Copland's 
undisputed masterpiece, the Piano Variations, and from composers Nils Vigeland, 
Stalvey and Foss -- whose recent Variations on Bernstein's "New York, New 
York," turn the familiar song into an unfamiliar but irresistible Habanera. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, Smit presided at the grand piano -- and at a studio upright and a 
toy piano, each used appropriately for particular pieces -- with characteristic 
technical mastery and a sense of unslaked musical curiosity. For some people, 
those 88 keys can be a fountain of youth.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'INEVITABLE GRACE': STARS BURIED IN CLUMSY THRILLER

 There's no sense of inevitability and little grace to the inept, amateurish 
psychological thriller "Inevitable Grace" (Monica 4-Plex, Sunset 5). Like 
countless films by novices, it's so overwhelmingly inspired by other movies 
that there's not a whiff of real life anywhere in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Knights, who is pretty but has little discernible acting ability, 
makes her screen debut in a role that would tax the abilities of Meryl Streep. 
She's a young psychiatrist doing her residency in a mental institution run by a 
brittle, officious type (Tippi Hedren). 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that the fears expressed by a new patient (Jennifer Nicholson) 
about her husband (Maxwell Caulfield) may be based in reality. She decides to 
investigate, only to get inextricably entangled in this sexually ambivalent 
couple, with Caulfield finally endangering her sanity. None of this is 
presented by writer-director Alex Canawati with any degree of credibility, 
originality or involvement; unfortunately, "Inevitable Grace" is not only 
tedious but also long-winded. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such dreary circumstances, several individuals manage to come through 
like pros. Hedren remains crisp and focused, and Caulfield manages to sustain 
an insinuating, enigmatic presence by not taking reams of silly dialogue too 
seriously. Nicholson, the daughter of Jack Nicholson, also in her film debut, 
displays poise, but her comparatively small part makes it hard to appraise her 
abilities. (Nicholson's mother, Sandra Knight, appears briefly as Caulfield's 
mother.)  
</P>
<P>
 The talented Taylor Negron has little chance to shine as Knight's prissy, 
busybody landlord. Samantha Eggar has a brisk cameo as a nightclub proprietor. 
No one else has any opportunity to register effectively. On the technical side, 
cinematographer Christian Sebaldt deserves credit for his painstaking film 
noir- ish play of light and shadow.

ART GALLERIES; A SPECTACULAR BROWN COLORS THE MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no getting around the fact that John Miller's sculptures and reliefs 
are colored a startlingly credible excrement brown -- and textured accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 At Richard Telles Fine Art, roiling mounds, lumps and heaps of the stuff (or 
rather, a fine facsimile thereof) are studded with buried treasure: toy guns, 
golf balls, miniature golden bells, tiny cavemen, plastic letters. This is the 
detritus of childhood, the gifts the child wants to receive (if only to 
summarily discard them), and those the child chooses to give (her only power, 
according to Freud, being the ability to produce or withhold feces). 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has long played with the notion that infantile delight in excrement 
translates into adult cathexis in art-making. Though his work uses this 
equation in order to provoke a variety of questions about consumerist excess, 
besmirched innocence and environmental catastrophe -- the spectacular nature of 
the material often overwhelms the best-laid plans. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Miller maintains control, while coyly begging the question of 
whether or not artistic control is itself a symptom of anal-retentive behavior. 
The six sculptural units clustered here become a narrative with the title 
"Topology for a Museum." It's an economical move, which makes obvious the fact 
that a museum is little more than a heavily romanticized disposal site for 
cultural waste products. 
</P>
<P>
 In this scatalogically over-determined context, Miller's small, color 
photographs are far too oblique. Like an aesthetically sophisticated take on 
"Where's Waldo?" (itself about as anal-retentive a game as one can imagine), 
the images make demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of demanding we find something or someone, they ask us to articulate 
an absence or to pinpoint an aberration, an inconsistency or a failure. But the 
images of Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise Cemetery, soon to be relocated; 
of a monument to Lenin, for which only the base remains, and of a park littered 
with the discarded needles of junkies are not up to the task assigned them. 
</P>

<P>
 Failed Symbolization: Eleanor Callahan, wife of photographer Harry Callahan, 
is not your typical muse. Unlike Charis Weston, whose idealized body served her 
husband, photographer Edward Weston, as any number of ready-made, sculptural 
forms, Eleanor's body is recalcitrant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a well-known series of images dating from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, 
on view at Jan Kesner Gallery, Callahan goes to great lengths to conceal 
Eleanor's face, presumably in order to present her as a generalized icon of 
femininity. Nude, she reclines in the grass, flaunts her breasts and pregnant 
belly, and raises her arms over her head, a shapely black silhouette against an 
unmodulated, white field. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the broken contours, dimpled flesh and irregular curves of Eleanor's 
body all conspire against Callahan's plan. Eleanor is not reducible to a 
symbol, except perhaps as a veiled symbol of resistance to any attempt at 
symbolization. 
</P>
<P>
 One might compare these images to Picasso's paintings of his wives and 
mistresses, now at the L.A. County Museum of Art. Picasso is able to grind his 
women down into personifications of Menace, Fertility and Melancholy. Callahan 
is not, and his work is all the more riveting for this failing. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a retrospective, the exhibition frames the Eleanor photographs 
within the larger context of Callahan's work. Callahan's experiments with 
manipulated multiple exposures -- a shot of Eleanor in her living room, cropped 
into an egg-like oval that floats over a wintry landscape; intersecting rows of 
office building windows, which suggest a rigidly geometric composition gone 
haywire -- are interesting historically, but less so aesthetically. 
</P>
<P>
 More compelling are Callahan's attempts to achieve a pure form of linear 
expression, such as an electric wire or the infinitely narrow space between a 
woman's buttocks, which fill an entire frame. These images transcend technical 
wizardry in order to examine the structures of compression, both formal and 
philosophical.

 A Wordy Exhibition: In an elegantly conceived installation at Shoshana Wayne 
Gallery, Eva Schlegel toys with the oft-uttered and entirely lamentable 
banality that art is a universal language. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlegel works backward, beginning not with art but with language, which she 
swiftly denudes of all content, reducing it to pure form, pure image. This she 
does by silkscreening a number of texts, each one blurred to the point of 
illegibility, onto large sheets of glass. These lean against one another and 
against the gallery wall, much in the manner of Joseph Kosuth's work, though 
Schlegel's props are a bit more diffident about their status as theoretical 
propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is recognizable are the formal structures of various literary genres: 
a letter, with its heading and staccato salutation; the densely packed 
paragraphs that characterize a theoretical text; the stop-and-start rhythms of 
an interview; the irregular patterns of poetry. Yet the needs for distraction, 
information and revelation those genres are designed to fulfill have been 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlegel knows that we are never content to let things rest at form, accepting 
retinal pleasure as an end unto itself. We crave meaning, so much so that we 
are willing to fabricate it in its perceived absence. 
</P>
<P>
 What Schlegel gives us is a mirror-like picture of frustrated desire. Both the 
starting and the end point of art, his very lack of closure makes art 
infinitely seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the truism that it can be everything to everyone, Schlegel offers 
instead this much more radical proposition: Art can be anything to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., Santa Monica, (310) 451-3733, through 
Feb. 26. Closed Sundays and Mondays.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: DISNEY BETS ON ANOTHER MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Movies that go directly to video without first playing in theaters or on 
television have a terrible image: low-budget, violent, soft-core porn flicks 
that wouldn't do any business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is entering the market, which is bound to boost the prestige of 
direct-to-video efforts. The company's first project is a whopper: the sequel 
to its smash-hit animated cartoon feature "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Return of Jafar," which will run 66 minutes, is due May 20. Though she 
wouldn't specify the price, Ann Daley, president of Buena Vista Home Video -- 
which releases Disney tapes -- said it would be cheaper than "Aladdin," which 
probably translates to $20-$22. 
</P>
<P>
 The sequel will continue the adventures of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, with 
all the characters from the original and five new songs. The voices of the main 
characters will be the same too, with one notable -- and predictable -- 
exception: Robin Williams won't be the voice of the genie. Dan Castellaneta, 
the voice of Homer Simpson, will do the genie's lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Disney taking the direct-to-video route with the "Aladdin" 
sequel is that it's the quickest way to capitalize on interest in the original. 
Disney has shipped more than 22 million cassettes of "Aladdin" to date but 
plans to stop on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making a (theatrical) sequel would obviously take years," Daley said. "With 
direct-to-video, we can give the fans a sequel right away, while interest in 
'Aladdin' is very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that means the sequel won't have the lavish budget of the original. 
"A direct-to-video movie is made with a different process, since it's not meant 
to be projected onto a big theater screen," Daley explained. "That process 
doesn't cost as much." She wouldn't reveal specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Aladdin" sequel isn't a one-shot deal, Daley said. "None have been 
scheduled yet, but I'd like to see us release another direct-to-video animated 
film next year," she said. She noted that possible projects range from 
originals to other tie-ins with Disney animated classics. Videobits: 
</P>
<P>
 To capitalize on its seven Oscar nominations, Warner moved up the release date 
on "The Fugitive," from March 22 to March 10 -- priced at $25. Though it will 
sell well, at big discounts, rental outlets will benefit too. It'll be the only 
best picture nominee on the rental market before the March 21 ceremonies, so it 
should zoom to the top of the rental chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia TriStar is releasing best-picture nominee "The Remains of the Day" on 
May 4. The movie features best actor and actress contenders Anthony Hopkins and 
Emma Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders are saying that another best picture nominee, LIVE's "The 
Piano," starring best actress nominee Holly Hunter, is due in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders are also saying that FoxVideo's "Mrs. Doubtfire," the comedy starring 
Robin Williams, is coming out in late April, probably at a $20 price. 
</P>
<P>
 Stooges Alert: On Wednesday, Columbia TriStar put out eight new-to-video 
"Three Stooges" tapes, some featuring Curly Howard, one of the greatest 
slapstick comics ever. What's New on Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Man Without a Face" (Warner). An offbeat Mel Gibson movie, which he also 
directed. Basically a sentimental, uplifting buddy movie, with Gibson playing 
an ex-teacher turned embittered recluse after being scarred in an auto 
accident. He tutors a needy 12-year-old (Nick Stahl) who's trying to get into 
military school. There's never any doubt how it will turn out but it does hold 
your interest, thanks to Gibson's directorial skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indochine" (Columbia TriStar). The only reason to see this drama -- and it's 
a good reason -- is to marvel at the performance of Catherine Deneuve, who was 
up for a best actress Oscar last year, playing a rubber plantation owner in 
Vietnam. Woven into all the colonialistic politics in this epic, which spans 30 
years, is a soap opera about a mother (Deneuve) and daughter vying for the same 
man.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Garden" (Warner, $25). We really didn't need another film of 
Frances Hodgson Burnette's classic children's story. But director Agnieszka 
Holland has created a visual stunner that may be a bit too dark and arty for 
some tastes. Still, Kate Maberly is terrific as the cynical young orphan, stuck 
on an English estate, who blossoms when she discovers a magic garden. Kids 
growing up lonely or isolated relate strongly to this tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Program" (Touchstone). This is the movie famed for the 
lying-in-the-middle-of-the-road stunt that was copycatted, with grim results, 
by some impressionable fans. That sequence has been cut, leaving an 
occasionally gritty drama about the college football team at an Eastern 
University, with James Caan as the beleaguered coach. To its credit, it doesn't 
sidestep vital issues like steroid use -- but it doesn't sidestep cliches 
either. Still, it's a welcome tonic to those suffering through football 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Night" (Warner). Set in early 1960s Long Island, this is about a secret 
affair between a prim Catholic teen-ager (Juliette Lewis) and her 
wrong-side-of-the-tracks beau (C. Thomas Howell). The story is told from the 
point of view of the lovers' young go-between (Eliza Dushku). Sensitive, 
insightful, well-acted but so slow-moving that it's a chore to sit through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romper Stomper" (Academy). Geoffrey Wright's chilling examination of the 
neo-Nazi skinheads in Australia who are battling the Vietnamese. There's just 
one problem with this riveting movie -- it unintentionally glamorizes the 
hatemongers, possibly making them appealing to impressionable viewers. Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 "For Love or Money," "Son of the Pink Panther," "Dazed and Confused," 
"Son-in-Law," "Needful Things," "Strictly Ballroom" and "Boxing Helena" 
(Wednesday); "Demolition Man," "Much Ado About Nothing," "The Good Son" and 
"Striking Distance" (March 2); "The Fox and the Hound" (March 4); "Manhattan 
Murder Mystery," "Judgment Night," "King of the Hill" and "So I Married an Axe 
Murderer" (March 9); "The Fugitive" (March 10); "Undercover Blues," 
"Gettysburg" and "Bopha!" (March 16); "What's Love Got to Do With It" and 
"Fatal Instinct" (March 23); "The Joy Luck Club" and "Father Hood" (March 30); 
"The Age of Innocence," "Fearless" and "A Bronx Tale" (April 6); "Malice" 
(April 13); "Another Stakeout" (April 20).

 All the returns won't be in until next week, but some retailers are reporting 
that "Sleepless in Seattle" did anything but sleepy business during Valentine's 
Day weekend. The romantic comedy remains locked in second place, middleman in 
that same old 1-2-3 configuration seen for weeks: With "The Firm" on top and 
"Dave" in third.The oddball "Kalifornia," featuring Brad Pitt and Juliette 
Lewis, did poorly at the box office but its positive reviews are helping it 
attract a sizable rental audience. It jumped from No. 36 to No. 16--impressive 
for a film that hardly anybody saw in theaters. "Last Action Hero," the Arnold 
Schwarzenegger box-office bomb, had a strong second week, leaping from No. 13 
to No. 5. There's enough curiosity about it to lure renters during its first 
few weeks in release, but some retailers fear that bad word of mouth will 
ultimately sink it. 03,34,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1. "The Firm"

re-creating their old "Saturday Night Live" characters, is doing fairly healthy 
business, jumping from No. 18 to No. 11 in its second week on the chart. Still, 
it's not doing quite as well as some retailers expected. This comedy didn't 
meet expectations during its theatrical run either. But don't count "Coneheads" 
out just yet. Its rental-market performance could pick up in the next few 
weeks.

POP ALBUM CHART; AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS SPUR SALES

 As usual, exposure on the televised American Music Awards--the most popular of 
the pop music trophy fests--translates into significant record sales. Many saw 
Toni Braxton on the show for the first time and obviously liked what they saw. 
Her debut album, leaped from No. 7 all the way to the top of the chart. Whitney 
Houston, the big winner on the show for the "Bodyguard" soundtrack album, was a 
big winner in record stores too. It's hard to imagine that any fan of her music 
doesn't have the album (more than 10 million have been sold) but, sure enough, 
sales jumped. The album climbed from No. 24 to No. 11. Kenny G's win also 
triggered a run on his "Breathless" album, which has already sold more than 6 
million. It jumped from No. 41 to No. 26. Noteworthy debuts: Richard Marx's 
"Paid Vacation" (No. 41) and Zhane's (pronounced Jah-Nay) at No. 45. Celine 
Dion's "The Power of Love" is still the power on the pop singles chart, holding 
on to its No. 1 position. This hit continues to drive her album up the chart. 
"The Colour of My Love" made the Top 10--at No. 10. 04,52,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 
Weeks Last Weeks on the Week Ago Chart 1. "Toni Braxton," Toni Braxton 7 10 31

entering at No. 12 with "The Cross of Changes." Producer Michael Cretu has 
assembled another spacey, no-holds-barred mixture of elements such as techno 
beats, Gregorian chants and Middle Eastern vocals. The first album was 
dismissed as a one-shot novelty hit but the follow-up's fast start indicates 
that Enigma may be around for a while.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'MOVIN' ON UP' CHRONICLES THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Movin' On Up," the latest compilation from Capitol Records' the Right Stuff 
label, offers a captivating look at the '60s civil rights movement as 
chronicled by some of the most respected artists of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, produced by David Nathan, of chiefly soul music includes such 
landmark hits as the Impressions' "Keep on Pushing," Stevie Wonder's version of 
Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind," James Brown's "Say It Loud (I'm Black & I'm 
Proud"), Sly & the Family Stone's "Stand!" and the Staple Singers' "Respect 
Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the album's most memorable moments are in selections that weren't 
national hits -- including Nina Simone's "Mississippi God----," a 1963 live 
recording that expresses the singer-songwriter's anger and heartache after four 
young girls were killed in a Birmingham church bombing, and Otis Redding's 
moving interpretation of Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come." 
</P>
<P>
 The most surprising selection, in terms of context, is Aretha Franklin's 
"Think," a 1968 hit that seems more a reflection of a troubled relationship 
than social commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Franklin and her then-husband Ted White, the song includes the 
lines, "You'd better think / Think about what you're tryin' to do to me," 
followed by the chorus, "Freedom, freedom, freedom / You gotta give me my 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Nathan suggests in the liner notes that the song -- recorded the day in 
1968 that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered -- can be seen as a cry 
for racial equality. Franklin was a supporter of the civil rights leader, who 
had attended a celebration honoring the singer in Detroit just months before. 
</P>
<P>
 As he also points out, the issues documented in "Movin' On Up" haven't 
disappeared -- which "may indeed make some of the music contained in this 
collection as appropriate now as it was when it was first recorded." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Bins: Conway Twitty's "Rockin' Conway: The MGM Years" (Mercury). 
There's just 24 minutes of music here, and most of the arrangements are stiff, 
but the late country star's vocals on some of these late-'50s rock-oriented 
tracks are surprisingly vigorous. Includes Twitty's 1958 hit, the power ballad 
"It's Only Make Believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Knopfler's "Screenplaying" (Warner Bros.). Here's a "greatest hits" 
package consisting not of Knopfler's material with Dire Straits, but the 
highlights from his four soundtrack collections: "Cal," "Last Exit to 
Brooklyn," "The Princess Bride" and "Local Hero." All four soundtracks are also 
available from Warner Bros. on separate CDs.

TV REVIEW; ELECTRIFYING DOUGLASS' LAST GREAT SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Something happens in the chemistry of American politics during crises: Great 
orators rise to the occasion and deliver a statement crystallizing the issues. 
What Patrick Henry did during the Revolutionary crisis and Abraham Lincoln did 
during the Civil War crisis, Frederick Douglass did during the Southern 
lynching crisis of the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech, titled "The Lesson of the Hour" and delivered 100 years ago (to 
the month) at Washington's Metropolitan A.M.E. church, addressed nothing less 
than the prospect of the total breakdown in U.S. civil order. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a subject fitting of Douglass' stature as the country's most powerful 
orator and the vocal conscience of abolition, and it also fits actor Fred 
Morsell, whose re-creation of Douglass' speech, "Presenting Mr. Frederick 
Douglass," airs tonight on "Bill Moyers' Journal" (9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 
28; 8:30 p.m. on KPBS-TV Channel 15; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24). 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the speech is a profound bitterness, for after seeing his cause win 
the Civil War, Douglass had to respond to a growing orgy of lynching and 
illegal persecution of blacks by white Southerners following the withdrawal of 
U.S. troops from the former Confederacy. "The cause lost in war," he noted of 
the vengeful lynchers, "is won in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of the works in the overdone solo historical performance genre 
(Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain, for instance, or James Whitmore's Will Rogers), 
Morsell presents his Douglass at the very podium where the author-activist 
galvanized his likely receptive audience. Morsell's is receptive too, and can 
be seen transfixed in a way they probably wouldn't be in a theatrical 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a podium, a speaker and a church congregation comprises its own 
theater, which Douglass understood very well. Since Douglass died (the 
following year, in 1895) before his oratory could be recorded, Morsell is freed 
to interpret the elegant prose; but like Shakespeare's language, Douglass' 
precise, imagistic writing tells the actor what to emphasize, where to pause 
and where to erupt with passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in a moment, Morsell's Douglass sums up the soul of the speech: "The mob 
is its law . . . the mob is its jury . . . the mob is its judge . . . and the 
mob is its executioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Henry and Lincoln, Douglass expanded the particular event into the 
catalyst for an idea. Douglass' was to remind all that the rise in mob justice 
ensured the collapse of the American democratic project. And that the solution 
was to adhere to the Constitution, not for blacks to escape their destiny and 
flee to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In one breath, Douglass -- and Morsell today -- dismantles both white racists 
and black separatists.

THEATER BEAT: 'MOTHER' PACKS EMOTIONAL PUNCH -- IN SIGN LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marsha Norman's emotionally devastating " 'night, Mother" earned the 1983 
Pulitzer Prize for drama, so there can be no argument about its pedigree. In a 
decade of increasingly escapist entertainments, a theater that dares to 
confront this tragedy deserves respect. After all, a mother's futile struggles 
to block her daughter's suicide is not a story calculated to appeal to a mass 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about hearing-impaired audiences? 
</P>
<P>
 Can Norman's grim tale, which is told through eloquently homespun dialogue and 
as such resembles a Chekhovian parlor game of Russian roulette, be conveyed in 
American Sign Language? There is no physical struggle between Mama and Jessie. 
Their desperate ordeal is a verbal debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaf West Theatre Company's decision to produce the wordy " 'night, Mother" 
seems bewildering. Yet this seemingly incongruous scheduling provides a 
stunning revelation about a contemporary classic. The actors' urgency in their 
signing provokes even more heartbreak than would a standard presentation. Even 
the audience's headsets offering simultaneous voice translations add to the 
play's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'night, Mother" is about communication, and the alienating effects of 
isolation when we fail to communicate. The script is littered with references 
to our reluctance to truly listen to others. Mama's lifelong failure to 
accurately hear her daughter, and her daughter's hunger to silence the voices 
in her head, are emphasized by the frantic hand signals between Freda Norman's 
Mama and Elena Blue's Jessie. In this context, a signed "Your hands aren't 
washed" gets translated into a profound metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jessie, suicide offers peace. "Dead is dead quiet. . . . This is how I 
have my say and I say no to everything and all of it. No! I say no." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a shorthand to the talk," the playwright suggests in the stage 
directions, "and a sense of routine comfort in the way they relate to each 
other physically." Director Stephen Sachs has beautifully followed Norman's 
observation, allowing the performers to maneuver in real time through the 
lushly detailed kitchen and living room by set designer Jim Barbaley. It's no 
accident that we see three clocks prominently ticking away the seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are problems with an ASL production that Sachs has not overcome. The 
original version relentlessly raced to its conclusion in 90 minutes, while here 
the hand gestures add a half-hour to the drama, undercutting the momentum. 
Although the gunshot is "felt" by Mama through the door -- and it's loud enough 
to make members of the audience jump off their seats -- other crucial details 
seem incongruous, such as Mama's last signed words. It would be more effective 
and emotionally true to allow Mama a vocal exclamation, no matter how 
incoherent. After all, by the end an audience has heard Deaf West's message 
loud and clear. By language or by sound, we understand heartbreak.

'Schippel' an Entertaining Outing 
</P>
<P>
 The title doesn't exactly roll off the tongue: "Schippel, the Plumber." It's a 
name you might notice peeling off the door of a rusty pickup truck. But 
California Repertory Company, in tandem with the Goethe Institut, obviously 
liked the odd title enough to risk mounting the American premiere. The result 
is an entertaining, occasionally inspired, briskly paced evening of 
old-fashioned comedy reminiscent of silent movie slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
 British playwright C. P. Taylor's adaptation of German Expressionist Carl 
Sternheim's satire of upper-class pretentiousness requires a cast with musical 
talents galore. At the turn of the century, a German vocal quartet has lost one 
member to the grim reaper, and now must replace his sterling voice. Who's the 
finest tenor? Alas, the best available voice belongs to a plumber named 
Schippel. 
</P>
<P>
 Schippel's low social status is compounded by the fact that he's "a bastard," 
and such obscure origins clash with the quartet's belief that they're "a new 
class of humanity evolving a higher class of man." Hitler's Reich is just 
around the corner, but more immediately so are numerous farcical elements. The 
class clashes are richly staged by director Steve McCue, complete with props 
such as a ladder and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Schippel, The Plumber," California Repertory Company, 7th/West Campus 
Drive, California State University, Long Beach. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
matinees at 2 p.m. this Saturday and Feb. 26. Ends March 5. $15. (310) 
985-5526. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes. A Witty, Shallow Visit to the 
'Closet' 
</P>
<P>
 John Benjamin Martin knows how to keep us amused. His characters tell jokes 
without revealing the playwright's darker purpose. And what might that purpose 
be? For an answer, visit "The Water Closet." If the prolific writer's latest 
effort at the Burbage Theatre provides any clue, Martin's purpose is to reveal 
that human beings are nothing beyond body functions. We are what we discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tribute to director John Pieplow and a gifted ensemble that this peep 
show into "the restrooms of a somewhat trendy nightclub" make us howl in spite 
of our better moral judgment. The women, reduced by men to objects of sexual 
conquest, in turn dismiss the men.  
</P>
<P>
 Permeating the trivial singles action is terror of the opposite sex. The fear 
in these restrooms is palpable. But Martin's writing also succumbs to this 
fear. Just when "The Water Closet" is poised to plunge past the easy jokes and 
amusing stereotypes, he pulls back. 
</P>

AH, TO BE IN LOVE -- AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO CARRY OFF ANY DRESS. BUT MINIS DON'T 
CUT IT WITH MOST GENERATION XERS. THEY WANT TO BE...; A PRINCESS BRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, the "average" American woman says "I do" for the first time at 24.4 
years of age. And she is as likely to say it in a sophisticated gown without a 
pearl or a crystal bead or an extra ounce of fabric as she is in a fully loaded 
fairy-princess creation. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, unlike many older or second-time brides, this woman could pull off 
as much or as little dress as she likes. She can evoke images of Twiggy in a 
mini or Princess Di in a maxi. She can wear a sexy, silk sheath or layers of 
tulle; a high-neck bodice or an off-the-shoulder neckline; poufy sleeves or no 
sleeves at all; a floral wreath in her hair or a mile-long veil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Younger women feel they can carry tulle, silk or satin, but they still like 
the full (look) as opposed to something straight," says Lora Hazany, a sales 
consultant at Bridal Images in Beverly Hills. "(Around 27), some feel too old 
for the princess look. They want something more sophisticated, something that 
looks more their age." And the younger the bride, the more train she wants, 
Hazany says. 
</P>
<P>
 If, that is, she isn't too cynical, practical or financially strapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our generation is obsessed with keeping our heads above water," says Alan 
Fields, the 28-year-old co-author of "Bridal Bargains." "A lot of us are 
unemployed or underemployed. Weddings today compete against housing, cars and 
furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 In the $10.95 paperback inspired by their own wedding woes, Fields and wife 
Denise, 29, who live in Boulder, Colo., recommend rental services, wholesalers 
and discounters as cost-cutting alternatives to traditional bridal shops. 
Although store owners hardly endorse that strategy, they do agree that money is 
as tight as some of their form-fitting bodices. 
</P>
<P>
 Verna Huson, owner of the Mon Amie salons in Costa Mesa and Torrance, says: 
"Brides are buying very conservatively and they are putting in a lot of thought 
before they purchase. It's most definitely a sign of the times. It's not the 
parents (who are cost-conscious). It's the brides and the grooms themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Christie Lynch, 27, a Manhattan Beach advertising account executive, helped 
pay for her church wedding last month. She came in under budget for her gown -- 
an off-the-shoulder, satin sheath with discreet beading and a chapel-length 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some brides look in a dozen or more stores, Lynch went to only one, 
Mon Amie in Torrance. She arrived without photographs and asked the bridal 
coordinator for something simple and straight. "The first dress I tried is the 
one I got," Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
 The look had to be "sophisticated, elegant, beautiful," she says. "I wanted my 
husband-to-be to see me as he had never seen me before." 
</P>
<P>
 But the label meant nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The designer isn't important," says one retailer who requested anonymity. 
"It's the fit that's important. Brides are more interested in how they will 
look when they walk down the aisle than who the designer is." 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores remove labels and use secret style codes to discourage comparison 
shopping. After spending hours with a customer, they don't relish having her 
"shop and shop until she gets the best price," the retailer says.  
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of keeping down costs, Lynch enlisted her mother to personalize the 
gown. She removed a stark back bow and added five dramatic poufs above the 
train. She also made the headpiece -- five miniature poufs on a hair clip with 
a long veil -- using material ordered from the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her efforts, Lynch was in for a few surprises, such as a $200 
alterations tab for the gown. "It was like buying another dress," she says. 
"You figure because they measure you, the dress is going to come back to your 
measurements. Then they charge for the hemming, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even when price is no object, brides are leaning toward less dress, buyers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bride, young or older, wants a simple, elegant silk fabric," says Patti 
Miller of I. Magnin in Beverly Hills. "They don't want the beaded lace and they 
don't want a train." Frou-frou-free gowns in silk satin, silk Shantung and silk 
organza by Amsale, Vera Wang and SaraSusa run from to $2,000 to $5,000 in the 
store's bridal salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few young women have asked for the elaborate gown that Wang 
designed for singer Mariah Carey's recent wedding, minimalism generally 
prevails. "My bride is not a puff-sleeve bride," Miller notes. In fact, some 
are such sticklers for simplicity that "they don't even wear a headpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mon Amie stores, where prices start at $500, buyer Laurel Mungo sees a 
similar trend among the younger clientele. "They want a romantic, 
off-the-shoulder bodice and less beading. They want everyone at the wedding to 
see them. They don't want it to be all dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Under-25 brides seeking more elaborate gowns are less scarce at One Night 
Affair, a gown rental boutique in Westwood. Co-owner Sharon Gilchrist says they 
often ask for something in tulle, a fabric frequently associated with 
ballerinas and fairy-tale princesses. "(Younger brides) make a career out of 
planning their wedding. They come in with notebooks filled with information: 
their halls, bands, caterers, florists and the type of ceremony. They put a 
tremendous amount of work into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop, open by appointment only, offers everything for women in the bridal 
party, including gowns for $100 to $495 that purportedly retail for $800 to 
$12,000. The average alteration is $55. For brides who want a lot of dress for 
a little money, renting makes sense, Gilchrist says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're out on your own, maybe you're 25 and you have to pay the rent and 
the phone bill, you don't want to struggle to pay for the dress. . . . You're 
only going to wear it that one day. Then you're going to pack it in a box. You 
don't bring out the dress. You bring out the photographs." 
</P>
<P>
 But many women want the photographs and the fully loaded dress, although they 
may not realize it until they see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Dyer, 20, an El Camino College student who plans a July wedding, read 
12 bridal magazines as well as "Bridal Bargains," filling notebooks with 
pictures, before her first shopping expedition. She tried on at least 20 gowns. 
Yet, she says: "I ended up with something I wasn't looking for. It's the exact 
opposite."  
</P>
<P>
 Dyer had been set on a classic design with simple lines until her bridal 
consultant at Guardian Angel in Redondo Beach brought in the gown. "A really 
exquisite dress with lots of beads, pearls, netting, a bustle and fabric roses. 
I guess it's ironic that I went for the princess look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Liberts, 25, a Sherman Oaks advertising account executive who was 
married in November, had a similar change of heart. She spent a month shopping 
for her gown, went to 10 stores and tried on at least 20 dresses. "I went to 
bridal shows and I looked at the beads, sequins and lace and I said: 'Oh, no, 
that's not me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her white satin gown not only had beads and sequins, but also "the longest 
train I'd ever seen, with lots of beads on it," Liberts says. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a woman take what Liberts calls a 180-degree turn? In a familiar 
scenario, the consultant at Here Comes the Bride in Thousand Oaks brought in 
the dress. "If she hadn't, I wouldn't have tried it on," she says. "There were 
so many dresses to choose from, I probably could have stayed there two days." 
</P>
<P>
 Liberts had thought a lot about her perfect wedding: "I wanted it formal and 
very dressy. I just never imagined myself in anything that elaborate. But when 
I tried it on, I thought: 'You know, this is my only wedding. I want it to be 
special.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Deirdre McCormack Hill, 28, a La Habra teacher who was married last month, had 
a similar epiphany. "I'm a romantic, simple person. But my dress didn't fall 
into line," she says. "When I put it on, it was my personality, but not 
something I would normally wear."  
</P>
<P>
 She bought the satin, lace and beaded dress at Hacienda Brides International 
in Santa Ana a few days after becoming engaged and a year before her wedding. 
The chain, with stores in Beverly Hills and San Gabriel, sells gowns off the 
rack for $190 to $490. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hill worried that the dress would appear too fancy next to the 
bridesmaids' floral dresses, purchased on sale at the Broadway and decorated 
with flower-trimmed back clips. But in retrospect, "everything fit together so 
well," she says. "It was like a picture where no one thing stuck out." 
</P>
<P>
 To her satisfaction, the guests commented more about the ceremony, performed 
by four priests in a small church, than her dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain-hunter Fields would have been proud. "The key thing is, two people are 
getting married," he says. "That often gets lost. All you really need is a 
bride, a groom, an officiant and a marriage license. The rest is fluff."

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: NOT THE RETIRING TYPE; DON'T LET THE AIR 
CONDITIONING AND POWER WINDOWS FOOL YOU. THE '94 HUMMER IS STILL A COMMANDO IN 
CIVILIAN CLOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their gropings between genius and lunacy, inventors have developed cars 
that double as airplanes, convertibles that dabble as motorboats and vehicles 
that run on methane gas squeezed from chicken droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 Add AM General's Hummer to the honor roll of dreamy impracticality. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently demobilized from military service, this car-truck-tank, go-anywhere 
carryall is capable of lurching from A (Alaska) to B (Bahrain) while climbing 
the Jungfrau, butting heads with rogue elephants and fording shallower reaches 
of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes fear this vehicle. Add a few sacks of quarters and it's a Brink's 
truck. If Robert E. Lee had had a squadron of Hummers, we'all would be speaking 
Georgian. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- a man known to eat sofas -- owns four and 
stands tiny by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 On the civilian market, though, the Hummer makes little sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It is seven-feet across or about the width of a freeway lane, and at 40 m.p.h. 
that's a SigAlert. The sight and snorts of a three-ton Hummer have caused valet 
parkers to turn in their red vests. At a four-way stop, everybody quakes and 
nobody moves until the Hummer is out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly aluminum surfaces are pocked by naked bolts, bare hinges and visible 
rivets. This vehicle is so outdoorsy and all-weather even its map pockets have 
drain holes. It has two-piece wheels and Goodyear Jungle Ambush tires that cost 
$450 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower praised the jeep as one of the most 
important weapons of World War II, so Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf anointed the 
Hummer as the toughest desert fighter since Lawrence of Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 That was blessing enough for AM General of South Bend -- with Willys and Jeep 
in its corporate bloodline -- to decide to transform the High Mobility 
Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) to mufti. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 1st Infantry Division's HumVee has become the Beverly Hills Hummer, a 
much hipper persona. It has been softened by a JVC sound system, air 
conditioning, power locks and upholstery that's more Pendleton Mills than Camp 
Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes in colors, including, naturally, Guardsmen Red. There are cup holders 
that have never seen a GI canteen. Also armrests, remote entry, power windows, 
glove box, real carpets and other sissy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi has bought a Hummer. It hasn't done much for his tennis game, but 
it does appear to have earned him Barbra Streisand and Brooke Shields. When 
basso James Earl Jones cut some commercials for AM General, he happily accepted 
one of the vehicles in payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this civilization, the 1994 Hummer remains a commando in a C&R 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is square and flat from all angles and so ugly it is handsome. Any 
similarity to a barrack block is intentional. A Hummer has space for half of 
Delta Force but still seats only four. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no insulation, just the power of a megawatt sound system to distract 
from the roar of a 170-horsepower diesel slurping a gallon of fuel every dozen 
miles. Also the thumping of 37-inch tires locked in permanent four-wheel drive 
and trying to stomp through asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to enormous windshield and door pillars, visibility requires carefully 
coordinating the eyes of all occupants. Or mounting closed circuit television. 
Speeding tickets are not to be feared in a vehicle that grunts and chuffs to 
reach 85 m.p.h. Acceleration is best measured by lunar phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Every window is dead vertical and night reflections produce a sense of driving 
inside a planetarium. The interior is the center spread of an after-market 
catalogue. There is enough space between front passengers for Monopoly, a 
picnic lunch and conversations by bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 And as any Raiders' scout will tell you, brute force doesn't come cheap. 
Hummer prices start at $40,000 for a two-passenger hardtop, lumbering to more 
than $60,000 for a four-passenger wagon with basic creature discomforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hummer's warranty is three years or 36,000 miles -- or 50 wars and three 
direct hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Diesel fuel costs about $1.45 a gallon, and reduced availability restricts 
refueling to a diminished number of Los Angeles service stations or the Flying 
J truck stop at Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, civilian practicality isn't the issue here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hummer was designed to offer the strength and durability of a dumbbell, 
with a flexibility for multiple military purposes from PX runs to hauling 
grunts and ordnance over all terrains through every climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, AM General has sold more than 100,000 Hummers to friendly forces 
around the world. It is a very serious 4X4 performing the functions of several 
vehicles -- ambulance, missile platform, weapons carrier and the beloved, 
ubiquitous, but outdated Jeep. To expect this hard-nosed military ideal to 
transition easily to softer civilian life is to believe that Alexander the 
Great retired comfortably to shuffleboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That the Hummer is available at all is a tribute to the lobby of those -- 
including Schwarzenegger -- who persuaded AM General there would be a market 
for an urban wilderness vehicle that is to Range-Rover what the battleship 
Missouri is to the QEII. 
</P>
<P>
 They were right. For every conformist, there is someone who likes polka-dot 
pit bulls. Today there are 1,000 Hummers beating up American roads, a 55-member 
Hummer Owners Assn. in San Diego, and one owner who believes in revertible 
roots and plays soldier with his Hummer painted in Desert Storm camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman says only 25% of civilian sales are to suburbanites with incomes 
to dispose on adult toys. That percentage will drop as novelty wears thin. 
Then, he says, the Hummer will be recognized as the perfect pack mule for 
ranchers, winery owners, desert trekkies, oil explorers, off-road racers, bush 
doctors and anyone who does business in great construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 With 16 inches of ground clearance and springs tough enough to cushion the 
Golden Gate Bridge, obstacles may slow the Hummer, but they won't block it. Not 
two-foot snowdrifts. Not axle-high bogs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the muck becomes a struggle, there's an on-board compressor and a 
one-button system to reduce tire pressures for better traction. When sand is up 
to the steering wheel, there's a 12,000-pound winch to heave you out. 
</P>
<P>
 Water certainly doesn't dampen its spirits. The only problem is that 
hydrodynamics follow the flow patterns of aerodynamics and Hummers are as 
streamlined as house bricks. So water approached too fast will slosh over the 
vehicle, even over the windshield, and not swirl around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the marginal civilization of the Los Angeles freeway system, a Hummer 
isn't the happiest of ground-pounders. It huffs to enter traffic at a crawl. 
Steering via a surprisingly small wheel is light and a little twitchy. 
Industrial strength brakes are effective but lock easily. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, the Hummer was designed for zones of primitive combat, not the 
Hollywood Freeway. Although some may argue that degree of comparative risk. 
</P>
<P>
 So you invest $60,000 in this unarmored personnel carrier.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: IT'S THE PRAYING, STUPID

 It was a day like any other. We forgot to shave one leg in the shower. We 
brushed our teeth with the kids' Sparkle Fun Gel. We explained to a crabby kid 
why jumping up and down on Mommy's stapler would shorten its life. 
</P>
<P>
 How, we wondered, do the Supermodel Moms do it? The producers of "Rolonda" 
must have read our mind. The talk-show host this week grilled a quartet of 
Supermodels-Turned-Supermoms: Kim Alexis, Kelly Emberg, Karen Alexander and 
Linda Tonge. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you manage to stay so beautiful after having kids?  
</P>
<P>
 Personal trainers? Expensive in-home gyms? Great genetic material? 
</P>
<P>
 No, you dummies. Moral superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're Christians and we pray a lot," said Alexis, large with child No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's all us Little People. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like we have a responsibility to the public to maintain a certain 
image -- so they can strive toward that," explained Alexis, clearly the 
ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Monday, we're bleaching our hair and capping all our teeth. Tuesday, 
we'll cut out sugar and alcohol. By Wednesday, we'll have to start praying.

 We'd Rather Just Leave a Tip: How would you like to be hugged by "The Healer 
Who Hugs Diana"? That's what the London Daily Mail calls Chryssie Fitzgerald, 
whose Knightsbridge clinic Princess Di pops into every few weeks for what's 
described as a "two-hour attack on physical and mental stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana's treatment involves so-called Flower Remedies. Concentrated essences 
are diluted with water, dropped on the tongue or massaged into the body. A foot 
massage unblocks energy channels. Colonic hydrotherapy unblocks the rest. 
Fitzgerald ends the session with an embrace -- hence the tabloid-given moniker.

 Wanna Thank Your Mother for a Butt Like That: With Jane Fonda now focusing on 
the geriatric set (in the softest-focus infomercial ever filmed), there's room 
for young blood in the field of exercise videos. Enter Salt-N-Pepa, the female 
rap trio that's been strutting its stuff in such sexy music videos as "Shoop" 
and "Whatta Man."  
</P>
<P>
 All three -- Salt, Pepa and DJ Spinderella -- have slimmed down and reshaped 
themselves after recent pregnancies. They begin shooting their "Push It" 
exercise video in May, and it'll be in stores by October. Don't be surprised if 
others in the hip-hop world make guest appearances. Pepa, after all, is dating 
Naughty by Nature's Treach. 
</P>
<P>
 Before all this comes to pass, you can see how fit the trio is in upcoming 
issues of Entertainment Weekly, where they're wearing CK fatigues, and Us, 
where they're looking great in Todd Oldham's tap pants and thigh-high boots.

 Getting Naked for Charity: We can forbid Mr. Inside Out from bringing home 
Playboy magazine. We have no such control over our brilliant-but-misguided 
girlfriend. Good thing. Otherwise we'd have missed seeing shoe maker Libby 
Edelman -- the Libby in Sam & Libby -- cavorting on the beach without so much 
as an espadrille between her and the camera lens. But it's cool. Like the nude 
models in the anti-fur campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(Kim Basinger's billboard was unveiled Monday in New York), Edelman's bare-all 
is for a good cause. Playboy donated $100,000 to the American Foundation for 
AIDS Research to be first to publish fashion photographer Michael Comte's 
suggestive black and white photos of Edelman, Shannen Doherty, Sonia Braga, 
Carla Bruni and Mimi Rogers. "A Safe Sex Pictorial," Playboy calls it. Seeing 
these gals topless made us feel very safe indeed.

 What's Abstinence Got to Do With It?: For those who can't get enough vintage 
clothing, an L.A. company is reviving an age-old accessory: the chastity belt. 
Chastity Inc. claims its Fashion Accessory Belt "is designed to address today's 
styles and sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But not in a very serious way, we're afraid. Although the belts come with lock 
and key, "it's all in fun as the belts are easily removed without the keys." 
Ah, a politically correct chastity belt!  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, though, we've missed the point completely. Turns out these belts have 
a higher calling. "Our fashionable society will appreciate an accessory that 
opens the door to interesting conversation that reflects today's concerns." 
Hey, is that a chastity belt you're wearing or are you just glad to see me?

 Post-Traumatic Tress Syndrome: Hair oilier than usual? You can blame it on the 
earthquake. So says Bernard Virginie, technical director of the Parisian 
diagnostic hair-care firm J.F. Lazartigue. After recently analyzing strands of 
L.A. women under a Microviewer at the company's Rodeo Drive salon this week, 
"We saw a lot of hair that was weak and greasy." Quake-related stress may have 
cranked up oil production, he theorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazartigue treatment products are meant for home hair-care enthusiasts, and 
items are 20% off through February. But you can have the stuff applied in a 
salon setting, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the Beverly Hills salon Cristophe are being trained this week 
under the watchful eye of Jean-Francois Lazartigue himself. They will also have 
a Microviewer on hand to show you your very own hair follicles -- up close and 
personal. Sounds terrifying.

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: FRASIER, A WELL-DRESSED MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Frasier," airs Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Newly divorced psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer, 
pictured) has moved off his stool at "Cheers" in Boston to Seattle, where he 
practices his trade on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costume Designer: Audrey Bansmer, who also dresses the "Wings" ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: We don't know what a few months on the couch would reveal about his 
lifestyle and career changes, but Frasier has leaped into fashion's fast lane. 
Bearing no resemblance to the basic suit-and-tie kind of guy he was on 
"Cheers," the new Frasier conducts his life in the kind of clothes his fellow 
barflies would have never understood -- expensive contemporary knits. 
Geometric-patterned vests, cardigans and long-sleeved polo shirts dominate, but 
drapey shirts and full-cut jackets also appear. The bottom line: loose, as in 
free, unattached. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Frasier wears strictly single-breasted jackets, but his more neurotic 
and fastidious brother, Niles (David Hyde Pierce), wears only double-breasted 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: Frasier, like other successful, self-employed male professionals 
of the moment (at least in movies), fancies cashmere -- buzz fiber of the '90s 
-- and deep colors, such as burgundy, charcoal and teal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: Daphne Moon's (Jane Leeves) sexy housekeeper look: 
skintight leggings, leotard tops, baby-doll dresses and granny boots -- all 
topped off with a perky ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "When we were developing the series and describing his living room . . 
. we decided that Frasier would know what an Eames chair is and what a Wassily 
chair is, and our thought was that he'd also know who Giorgio Armani is," 
executive producer David Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Frasier's knits carry such labels as Donna Karan and Carroll & Co. in 
Beverly Hills, and his sport jackets and suits are Giorgio Armani and Karan. 
Shirt labels include Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein.

THE IDEAL MARRIAGE; IN JUST FOUR YEARS, DESIGNER VERA WANG -- WHO NEVER TIRES 
OF WORKING IN WHITE -- HAS DEVELOPED A SIGNATURE STYLE AND A GLAMOROUS 
CLIENTELE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bride-to-be, a not particularly blushing late twentysomething, went to 
bridal designer Vera Wang with a traditional request in a wedding dress: a 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'How long is the aisle you're getting married on?' " Wang recounted. 
"She said, 'Well, it's not.' I said, 'Then you're going to look like a parked 
car. Where are you going in it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wang acts more like a friend you'd curl up and gossip with than an imperious 
wedding planner. (She promised the bride a little sweep to give the feel of a 
train.) But she still sees dresses in the context of a client's real life, not 
the Cinderella story that was read to her at age 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ask them, 'What is your fantasy dress?' I ask them, 'How are you 
getting married?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wang is the Giorgio Armani of the bridal world, designing in crepe silks, 
swathing brides' arms and backs in a sheer stretch netting that has become her 
signature. Her dresses are a combination of modern and classic -- some are 
sleek narrow sheaths, others have traditional full skirts, but all are devoid 
of usual lace and overwrought trimmings. The only recurring adornments are bows 
-- "they're tailored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to be minimal when you're a bride," said Wang, 44, herself a 
spare vision in black Armani jacket, black leggings and clogs. "You want this 
to be pomp and circumstance. I see these girls who are very minimal and 
suddenly they have this metamorphosis -- they become the bride. They keep 
wanting to add on. I have to hold them back sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the most beautiful woman is a woman who wears her clothes. . . . They 
don't announce her. Trumpets don't come out blaring, 'Here's the dress!' I'd 
like them to say, 'Here's the bride.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ensconced in a pink suite at the Hotel Bel-Air amid a cheerful confusion of 
her 3-year-old daughter (the 5-month-old baby stayed home in New York), nanny 
and investment banker-husband, Arthur Becker, Wang talked animatedly and 
irreverently about the wedding fashion business. Becker poured coffee. "Service 
I usually don't provide," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang was 40 when she made her own hellish pilgrimage in 1989 as a customer 
through East Coast bridal shops. "I didn't find anything that appealed to me. 
"It just astonished me that in New York -- which has everything including 
indoor rock climbing -- there wasn't a bridal store that reflected different 
styles and different tastes." Finally, she took her own design to a seamstress. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side and graduated from Sarah 
Lawrence College, had always wanted to be a designer. But her father, the 
prosperous owner of a trading company, dismissed her initial requests for help 
in getting started. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You want to go to law school, I'm interested. You want to go to 
business school, I'll talk to you about it. Design school, are you out of your 
mind?' " Wang recalled, waving off the rejection with jocular insight. "Very 
Chinese. Please. Being Chinese American, I've got all these cultures staring me 
down. He said, 'You think you're so talented, see if you even like the fashion 
business. Go get a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So she did, working as a senior fashion editor for Vogue and then as 
accessories design director for Ralph Lauren, whom she calls her mentor. Around 
1990, after she had quit Lauren to focus on becoming pregnant (her children are 
adopted), her father suggested that she was ready for her own business. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she sold only other designers' clothes in her lush little boutique 
in the Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue. Four years later, her business has 
grown to include her own bridal collection -- now selling at I. Magnin in 
Beverly Hills and San Diego -- a budding evening line and couture dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Her concoctions have attracted glossy magazines (her back-buttoned dress with 
bows and netting graced a recent cover of Town & Country) and a glamorous 
clientele. She's working on a dress for the spring wedding of Nancy Davis, 
daughter of L.A. society moguls Marvin and Barbara Davis. Other credits include 
Mariah Carey's billowy dress for her recent wedding and Sharon Stone's simple, 
champagne-colored satin halter dress for last year's Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 A former competitive figure skater, Wang also designed Nancy Kerrigan's 
costumes for the Olympics, past and present. Kerrigan will be "completely 
covered in rhinestones" for the '94 Games, the designer said. "The entire back 
and sleeves are sheer net and heat-pressed with stones, (a process) only one 
company in the world can do." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice or in a chapel, Wang's designs are "sensual but not overtly sexy," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brides in their early 20s, seeking comfort as well as a bit of adventure, 
gravitate toward her narrow dresses and minis (two inches above the knee). 
"They want to explore," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But although they may come ready for a dressing-room adventure, game to try 
minis and rum-pink gowns, clients are considerably tamer when it's time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take some time before everyone's wearing my crepe sheath to a 
wedding, because for the most part, they like big skirts," Wang said. "Ninety 
percent of them. But, like Karl Lagerfeld said, 'I'm here to propose.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't do those dresses, (the client will) never see them. And she'll 
feel her only alternative is a lace bodice with a big satin skirt with flowers 
and bows and sequins and pearls and stuff on her head." 
</P>
<P>
 But elegant simplicity costs. Dresses in Wang's ready-to-wear bridal 
collection range from $1,800 to $4,000, with most hovering at about $2,800. 
Couture customers seeking a bridal or evening gown can expect to pay at least 
$10,000 for the "90 to 120 hours of handwork" and numerous minions such a dress 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wang has sold millions of dollars in clothes, she has yet to make a 
profit or pay back her father the $4 million he invested. "I think we'll break 
even in 1995," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On her recent trip to Los Angeles, Wang arrived at I. Magnin in the late 
morning to find a cluster of brides-to-be waiting for advice. "I haven't found 
anything that I would wear," said a frustrated Caoilfhionn Sweeney, 27, whose 
long search for a dress had brought her to Wang. "Her things come closest," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang furrowed through tightly packed dresses to pick out a severely simple 
white gown with a jewel collar and long net sleeves. Rarely does anyone buy 
this monastic vision of bridal finery. "It's one of my favorites," Wang said 
with a sigh, smoothing her hands over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "To redefine white is infinitely challenging. Is there a limit to how many 
ways I can redo a white dress?"

YOUR WHEELS / RALPH VARTABEDIAN: ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SLAMMED BY INSURANCE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety sells cars. So, it's not surprising auto makers are rushing to satisfy 
consumer demand, outpacing even federal safety regulations enacted in past 
years when the industry often fought stiffer rules. 
</P>
<P>
 A device that has become the Holy Grail of auto safety is the anti-lock brake 
system, a tricky piece of technology that prevents wheels from locking on wet 
or icy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling point of these systems is that they are supposed to prevent 
motorists from losing steering control and make quicker stops in slick 
conditions. They are also touted as a benefit in emergency stops on dry 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes have become so popular that General Motors has made them 
standard equipment on virtually all its cars. But a new study suggests 
anti-lock brakes don't deliver the safety benefits consumers believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a key report based on accident data, the Insurance Institute for Highway 
Safety says anti-lock brakes do nothing to reduce fatalities and nothing to 
reduce automobile accident claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, funded by contributions from auto insurance companies, compared 
accident and insurance loss data for cars equipped with anti-lock brake systems 
to the same models with standard brakes. The findings were that claim frequency 
and the average amounts of insurance payments were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think anti-lock brake systems are a terrific feature," says Pam Kueber, a 
Ford spokeswoman. "The customer is voting with his or her dollar that they want 
anti-lock brakes. It keeps your car from spinning out when you brake. It is a 
safety feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Lechtzin, a General Motors spokesman, contends that the study was based on 
"cursory data." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the institute's data, there are 2.4 fatalities for every 10,000 
vehicles shorter than 95 inches in wheel base. By comparison, cars with more 
than 114 inches of wheel base have 1.1 fatalities for every 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Car companies hate to be asked about the relative merits of size over 
anti-lock brakes because under federal law, they must meet ever stricter fuel 
economy standards. They can meet those goals only by selling a larger 
proportion of small cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to get into that discussion at all," Lechtzin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safety Institute says consumers may still want to buy anti-lock brake 
systems, but that larger cars and air bags make a bigger contribution to 
safety.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVELLAS; A PLAGUE OF DREAMERS: THREE NOVELLAS BY STEVE STERN ; 
SCRIBNER'S; $20, 256 PAGES; A DESOLATE PLACE TOUCHED BY MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blending the real and surreal in a tradition as ancient as the cabala, Steve 
Stern sets his stories in the years between the 1920s and the late '60s in the 
Pinch, an isolated Jewish community of Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even during periods of general prosperity, this desolate neighborhood is 
marginal, populated with struggling artisans, failing merchants and their 
rebellious offspring. The Depression is off to a head start here, and the 
postwar boom never arrives. The lives within are pinched as well, and it's no 
wonder that the adolescent boys seek excitement in outrageous pranks, while 
their elders continue to exist in a world transported virtually intact from 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Zelik Rifkin and the Tree of Dreams," the inhabitants of the Pinch are 
more wretched than usual. The summer is unbearably hot, even for Memphis, and 
the populace has taken to wearing ice bags on their heads and sleeping in an 
empty lot euphemistically called a park, although the only amenity is a huge 
and ancient oak tree that once served as the center of a thriving slave market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on these humid summer nights, the tree shelters the entire neighborhood. 
The people emerge from their stifling apartments each evening, trailing camp 
chairs and bedding in the hope of finding some relief under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zelik's widowed mother has resisted joining this hegira, she finally 
relents and follows the parade. Derided by his contemporaries as a cowardly 
mama's boy, Zelik has spent his childhood dodging his jeering schoolmates. He 
has no diversions aside from working as a stock boy and accompanying his mother 
to memorial services for long-gone relations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taunted by the neighborhood gang, trembling with terror, Zelik climbs the 
giant oak and ends up spending the night in its branches. There, far above the 
sweltering families, Zelik has fantastic dreams, so far superior to his daily 
existence that he voluntarily climbs the tree night after night. On the cracked 
sidewalks and in the dank alleys of the Pinch, he's a laughingstock, but once 
in the tree, he's a superman, transformed and, eventually, transmuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyman the Magnificent" explores another miraculous alteration. Like Zelik, 
Hymie Weiss is also one of the Pinch's more conspicuous misfits. 
</P>
<P>
 A skinny, unprepossessing boy, he's obsessed with the story of Houdini and 
determined to become a master magician himself. To achieve this ambition, he 
devises impossible stunts, which he performs at amateur night at the Idle Hour 
Cinema.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Hymie refuses to rehearse his acts, they end in ludicrous disasters, 
mishaps that leave him increasingly disabled. Each new debacle only serves to 
increase his determination, until finally, a mere ghost of his former inept 
self, he achieves a bizarre and totally unexpected triumph that would be an 
epiphany if it had happened anywhere but the Pinch and to anyone but Hymie 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three antic, metaphysical stories in this amazing volume, this 
particular saga is the most hilarious, the surprisingly upbeat ending absolving 
the reader from the guilt of laughing at Hymie's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third novella, "The Annals of the Kabakoffs," covers considerably more 
ground, beginning in 1964, shifting to the 1920s and '30s, jumping to 1968 and 
including a segment set in 1870 in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The central character is Itchy Kabakoff, the "black sheep of the Kabakoff 
clan" for reasons that become abundantly clear as the chronicle proceeds. 
Estranged from his moderately prosperous but unappealing family, Itchy travels 
with a rinky-dink carnival. On the road, he's the wild man, covered with fake 
fur, biting the heads off chickens and making himself generally useful when not 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, he reappears in the area to spy on his family, who have 
moved to a more upscale neighborhood. On this particular visit he rampages 
through his half-sister's wedding like a demon comedian, telling scatological 
jokes and driving his father to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Stern is a magic realist with a distinct preference for the 
supernatural aspects of the genre, the ensuing events are far from mournful. 
We're treated to the remarkable adventures of earlier Kabakoffs, learn Itchy's 
true origins, and read with astonishment how the residents of the Pinch 
continue to exist as specters, apparently inheriting their abilities from 
generations of dybbuks and golems before them. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, inviting comparison to the work of Isaac Bashevis Singer, "A 
Plague of Dreamers" is a heady blend of nostalgia, humor and mysticism.

LAKER WIVES SCORE BIG AT BENEFIT SCREENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "So often wives of professional athletes are seen as women who only do lunch 
and have their nails done," said Angela Worthy, wife of Los Angeles Laker James 
Worthy. "But these women are really movers and shakers, and they're about more 
than showing up and looking cute." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy and other wives of Laker players did show up and look cute, but it was 
for a good cause -- theirs. The Laker Wives hosted a benefit screening 
Wednesday night of "Blue Chips," a film directed by William Friedkin about 
corruption in college basketball recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laker Wives formed their group 10 years ago to fund educational and 
community programs in the Inglewood area. The proceeds of this evening, 
estimated at about $40,000, will go toward college scholarships.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures' plush theater was the setting for the screening. All the 
Lakers showed up, including Vlade and Ana Divac, Sam and Heidi Bowie, and Kurt 
and Linda Rambis. Also on hand were Cookie Johnson (without husband Magic), 
coach Randy Pfund and General Manager Jerry West and wife Karen. Friedkin 
showed up to introduce the film and then split early with wife Sherry Lansing, 
Paramount's studio chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stayed included producer Michele Rappaport and co-stars Alfre 
Woodard, J.T. Walsh and Anthony C. Hall. Absent were stars Nick Nolte and 
Orlando Magic player Shaquille O'Neal, who portrays a recruit phenom. 
</P>
<P>
 At a post-screening buffet reception in the theater lobby, Angela and James 
Worthy agreed that the film's portrayal of college-level basketball was 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately -- or maybe fortunately -- the public often has a very 
glamorized view of this world," Angela Worthy said. "People never see us once 
we leave the gym. So I think it gives them a more realistic look. It's a dirty 
business now, especially at the collegiate level -- that's what it's turned 
into." 
</P>
<P>
 Added James Worthy: "I was very happy that they showed how it really works for 
those who don't have a clue, and most people don't have a clue as to how the 
recruiting process happens." 
</P>
<P>
 If Worthy were in college now, would he be tempted by the under-the-table 
offers of cars and money? 
</P>
<P>
 "At a young age it was all appealing to me, the jobs, the money," he said. 
"But I wasn't for sale. I was just not for sale. And I don't think it would be 
any different for me now."

 The Scene: Wednesday's screening on its 25th anniversary of United Artists' 
"Midnight Cowboy" by the American Film Institute's Third Decade Council. A 
discussion with the filmmakers and a reception followed the screening of the 
only X-rated film ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. "It's a touching, rather 
sweet film," said David Hockney. "It tells you something about censors that 
they would give this an X." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman; co-star Brenda 
Vaccaro; director John Schlesinger; producer Jerome Hellman; plus 500 guests 
including Jodie Foster, AFI's Jean Firstenberg, Ellen Barkin, Barry Levinson, 
Joanna Pakula, Sally Kellerman and studio execs Frank Mancuso, James Middleton 
and John Calley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Hoffman on why the movie probably wouldn't be made today -- "The 
studios want high concept films, which means you have to be able to say in a 
sentence: 'Arnold Schwarzenegger is pregnant in "Twins 2." ' I don't know how 
you explain 'Midnight Cowboy' in one sentence. Jon Voight comes to town to bed 
all the ladies and become rich, but winds up having sex with gay people in the 
street. You'd see the studio execs thinking 'How's that going to open in 2,000 
theaters the first weekend?' Right then you got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: Much praise for the way the film held up. A typical comment 
was "a classic, a masterpiece that will play in the year 3000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: Maybe the '60s really are coming back. First a 1969 movie is a 
major hit with an audience, then someone smokes pot in the men's room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Anecdote: Schlesinger said an astute mind at the studio wrote a memo 
before the film was made that said, "If we could clean this up and add a few 
songs, it could be a great vehicle for Elvis Presley." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: When the screening ended, Martin Landau went up to Hoffman and 
said: "When this picture comes out, you're going to be a star."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BLUE CHIPS' DOESN'T SCORE BUT IT'S A GOOD SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports movies don't always have to be great to be fun. The ritualistic 
confrontations, the banter, the joy of physical release can keep you watching 
even when the characters are stock and the plot predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Chips" stars Nick Nolte as Pete Bell, the basketball coach of Western 
U., on the verge of his first losing season after winning two championships and 
eight conference titles. The film is about how the valiant, by-the-book Pete, 
in an effort to recruit three blue-chip high school phenoms to save his job, 
crosses the line into corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, though, "Blue Chips" is really about the wiggy, muscle-twitch 
world of high-pressure college athletics. The movie is best around the edges, 
when it's jamming and anecdotal and not taking itself so heroically seriously. 
Corruption in college athletics is not quite the eye-opener this movie makes it 
out to be; it may be a measure of our cynicism that we can't take a story like 
this straight anymore. Outrage is certainly called for but too often "Blue 
Chips" assumes we were born, if not yesterday, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that Nolte is such a heroic presence that his waverings and 
capitulations seem immensely poignant. He doesn't go in for a lot of 
heavy-browed agonizing; without making a big deal of it he shows us how small 
Pete feels when he looks the other way. Pete's love of the game is bound up 
with his love of winning. By the end of the film he learns to recognize that 
the two cannot always co-exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-existence is also a problem with the shaggy, catch-all wit of screenwriter 
Ron Shelton and the head-pounding style of director William ("The French 
Connection") Friedkin. "Blue Chips" is set up to be looser and funnier than it 
turns out to be.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, who wrote and directed "Bull Durham" and "White Men Can't Jump," the 
two best sports-themed films of the past 10 years, understands how athletic 
release can loosen you up all over. Sports becomes a way of jazzing your life, 
of giving it a rhythm you can carry in your head like a tune.  
</P>
<P>
 The congregation of characters in Shelton's movies are spangled, combative, 
intuitive, with a line of rap that's an extension of their sports playing. 
Though some of the characters and situations in "Blue Chips" are, for Shelton, 
sub-par -- he wrote the script 12 years ago -- the film might still have taken 
off had he directed it. His best ideas -- like the rival scouts who dog Pete's 
trail and who resemble a Preston Sturges troupe -- require a more glancing 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 And so do the basketball sequences. Friedkin shows us amazing ball handlers 
like Shaquille O'Neill, Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway and Matt Nover (as the three 
recruits) and then films their skirmishes in a crunch-and-thud style more 
appropriate to professional wrestling or stock car racing. What's missing is 
the poetry of the sport -- the poetry that must have attracted not only Pete to 
the game but the players too. If we had seen more of the beauty of basketball, 
the corruptions of the three phenoms would have carried a more ambiguous force. 
(Their sellouts might have seemed tragic, like Pete's.) 
</P>
<P>
 The subplot involving Pete and his former wife (Mary McDonnell) is a bit too 
undeveloped and touchy-feely, and the only thing missing from the scenes with 
J.T. Walsh as a wicked alumni organization head are rattlesnakes on the 
soundtrack. A few sequences, including the ones at the very end, seem 
truncated, and superb actors like Robert Wuhl and Lou Gossett pop up for teensy 
cameos. (Apparently G.D. Spradlin didn't make the cut at all, though he's 
featured in the TV ads for the film.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are still fine moments, like the way Alfre Woodard, as the mother of one 
of the blue chips, cuts to the quick in her conversation with Pete. (She wants 
a new home and an expensive office.) Boston Celtic legend Bob Cousy, as Western 
U.'s athletic director, has a wonderful, bemused openness; he has a terrific 
scene where he converses with Pete while sinking a seemingly endless succession 
of baskets. (Indiana coach Bobby Knight shows up as himself, and so does Larry 
Bird. Let's just say he's a better ball handler than word handler.)  
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal doesn't really try to act but he's so upfront about what he's 
doing that his amateurishness is kind of endearing. And he can stand next to 
Nolte and make him seem puny -- no small feat. (The combo is a great visual 
joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Chips" should be better than it is -- a movie about standing up to 
corruption shouldn't be this eager to go for the commercial jugular. But in 
flashes it makes you realize why you like sports -- and sports movies -- in the 
first place.

RON HARRIS: AS USUAL, IT'S A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 I like Bill Releford. He's a great guy. It's just that I get tired of always 
talking about feet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the subject is below me. But, while trying to not sound 
immodest, I like to think of myself as a fella with a much broader range of 
conversational interests -- Clinton's health plan and Haitian politics, NASA 
and the NRA, batting averages and bad movies, global warming and good sex, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm drawn to discussions that are, shall we say, a tad more eclectic than 
feet. Like the other night, I spent two hours with a bunch of friends 
discussing why timeouts in football are better than none in soccer, the 
influence of African art on world art and how Latin music, unlike American 
music, has a more cross-generational appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 I know some of it is inane stuff. Still, I find it at least mildly 
thought-provoking. Now, Bill and I do touch on a lot of subjects, such as 
travel (he just got back from Tahiti) and music (I'm trying to borrow his Dee 
Dee Bridgewater collection) and investments (he's buying beachfront property in 
Costa Rica). But almost invariably our conversations drift to the same subject 
-- feet, or feets, as my Uncle Bud used to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We were down at Fifth Street Dick's the other night and, again, Bill brought 
up the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, you'd be surprised at what some people will stuff into a pair of $500 
alligator shoes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill, Bill, I interrupted, what's up? You got a foot fetish or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. That's what I do. I'm a podiatric surgeon. I work with feet." I knew that 
Bill was a doctor, but I never concerned myself with what kind of doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill, I said, I understand that's your profession, but I've got a friend who's 
a proctologist, and we don't end up talking about his work, if you know what I 
mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you'd think it was a pretty important subject if you were lying in the 
hospital and the doctor was getting ready to cut yours off." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, excuse me?! 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's right. If your name is Velma Hollie and you're diabetic and 
three months ago a bunch of doctors had told you they'd probably have to 
amputate your foot and now not only do you still have it, but in a few months 
you're going to be walking on it, it would be important." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. My dad's an insulin-dependent diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or I bet if you are Daniel Skinner, diabetic, and you're still walking around 
your flower shop down in Santa Monica after doctors had scheduled you for an 
amputation, you'd think that feet were a pretty interesting subject." 
</P>
<P>
 I was beginning to see why Bill was so serious about this question of people's 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 What drew him to this area is a long story. It certainly isn't one of the 
glamour medical specialties. Let's just say that while in West Africa as an 
undergraduate college student, he realized that "without the lower extremities, 
you have a big change in the quality of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bill became a podiatrist, moved back to Los Angeles and set up the Diabetic 
Foot Institute in Inglewood, tending to all kinds of foot ailments. And at 
least once a week, he explained, somebody walks into his office and says, "Mom 
(or Dad) has been recommended for amputation. What can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 What Bill can do is fairly impressive. Through a special program at the Daniel 
Freeman Wound Care Treatment Center, Bill and five other doctors from different 
disciplines are saving feet and legs that other physicians around the city have 
given up on. That's important, because most people don't survive the first five 
years after an amputation. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at last count, my friend Bill had the highest healing rate of any of the 
doctors there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Bill and the other doctors are saving limbs is of particular 
note in light of a recent study by two University of Texas researchers. After 
surveying 3.7 million California patients, they found that blacks have a higher 
risk of lower leg amputation and death resulting from diabetes than Latinos or 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not news anymore when blacks are at the bottom of the health care totem 
pole, but the study is disturbing because while Latinos have a higher rate of 
diabetes, blacks are the ones having the most amputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why, nobody is sure. Socioeconomic status, access to health care and 
lifestyle all may contribute to the disparity. One thing is sure, amputation is 
preventable. It's just that a lot of people don't know that. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Bill was pushing a concert ticket toward me. It is for a salute to 
Ella Fitzgerald next Friday to raise money for the American Diabetes Assn.'s 
African American Outreach program so they can tell people just that. There will 
be great music and wonderful food, Bill promised.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure there will also be somebody there talking about feet. And this time, 
I'd be glad to listen.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: BEILENSON NEXT IN LINE TO LEAD POWERFUL HOUSE RULES PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 MOVING UP: With the unexpected retirement this week of a high-ranking South 
Carolina Democratic colleague, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills) 
becomes next in line for the chairmanship of the influential House Rules 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Butler Derrick of South Carolina, a chief deputy whip and second-ranking 
Democrat on the rules panel, shocked House members Wednesday by calling it 
quits after 10 terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me totally by surprise," said Beilenson, who heard the news while 
touring his district during a one-week congressional recess. "He's a good 
friend and sits next to me (on the Rules Committee). I never had an inkling 
that he was thinking of leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Derrick's departure puts Beilenson ever closer to one of the House's 
most powerful posts, he downplayed the political fallout of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel sad. He's a particularly important friend and an awfully 
good colleague and legislator. I hate to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet should the present chairman, Rep. Joseph Moakley (D-Mass.), also decide to 
step down, Beilenson would take over the reins of a full committee with vast 
power over the fate of House legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Moakley, 66, has no plans to fade away -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Weinfurter, Moakley's chief of staff, said his boss is definitely in 
the hunt for a 12th term and will file for reelection soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a whole portfolio of campaign events planned, and we have a ton of 
things we're working on," Weinfurter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But personal and health concerns have given rise to doubts about how long 
Moakley will stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 he had a benign lesion removed from his kidney and continues to have 
regular checkups to monitor the condition, described by his office as 
"precancerous." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Evelyn, is suffering from lung cancer and is halfway through a 
program of chemotherapy, Weinfurter said. "We are very hopeful that she will 
regain full health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Massachusetts observers are not as sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a couple of rough years," said a top aide to a Bay State 
congressman, who did not want to be identified. "He has a health problem, his 
wife is very sick and his best friend (former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) 
O'Neill) just died. At some point, he needs to make a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick, 57, cited no specific reasons for his retirement -- other than a 
desire to "do something else." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A NEW ROLE: In her role as Zelda Gilroy in the 1959-1963 CBS situation comedy 
"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," Sheila James Kuehl imagined herself guiding 
Dobie (Dwayne Hickman) into Congress or the White House, because in those days, 
a woman running for office was rare. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuehl is now a real-life candidate. She filed her declaration of intention 
to seek the Democratic nomination for the 41st Assembly District seat on Feb. 
9, her 53rd birthday. There is no incumbent in the race for the San Fernando 
Valley and Westside seat as Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) 
announced last month he would pass up a bid for a fifth and final term and 
would instead run for a Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl said her candidacy is not an example of an actor trying to cash in on 
her fame, but a "logical continuation" of her legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl serves as counsel to the California Women's Law Center, a policy 
development and technical assistance center to attorneys, educational, 
governmental and community-based organizations, working on issues affecting 
women and children. Kuehl co-founded the center in 1989 and was its managing 
attorney until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 After her final series, "Broadside," an ABC comedy about a group of Navy WAVES 
assigned to a South Pacific island during World War II, went off the air in 
1965, Kuehl turned her attention to academia, serving in various positions at 
UCLA. In the mid-1970s, she returned to the classroom, attending Harvard Law 
School and becoming the second woman in that school's history to win its Moot 
Court competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl does not consider her situation analogous to actors who leaped directly 
from that profession into politics. She said she believes her sitcom past 
"could cut both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go, people know and like the character (of Zelda), so they're 
predisposed to like me," Kuehl said. "On the downside it's possible this could 
trivialize my candidacy, but I'm not worried."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED: In the state Capitol, where legislative logjams 
are common, there is more than one way to reach one's objective. Assemblywoman 
Paula Boland of Granada Hills is testing that truism with a new bill to aid the 
campaign for breaking up the massive Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has two bills on the table that would make it easier for breakup 
proponents to take a run at whittling down the district -- one specifically 
targeting L.A. and a "generic" bill that would apply to all California school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the first bill, the new one-size-fits-all legislation introduced this 
month would lower the hurdles for those seeking to dismantle a school district. 
</P>
<P>
 If Boland's bills become law, the number of petition signatures required to 
launch the breakup process would be reduced from 25% of registered voters to 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the number of signatures required before a public hearing could be held on 
the issue would be halved from 10% to 5% of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would also repeal a portion of state law that says a school 
board must sign off on any plan to split up its district, an obstacle L.A. 
proponents would be hard-pressed to clear without a boost from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WILL HE OR WON'T HE?: Even staffers were caught by surprise when state Sen. 
David A. Roberti covered his bets recently by declaring he might run for state 
treasurer or a seat on the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 What would a man who thrives in the spotlight do with a seat on a low-profile 
panel that quietly carries out California tax policies and hears tax appeals? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he might pull in a pretty good salary, for one. Board of Equalization 
members make $95,000 annually. For another thing, he might be able to stay 
closer to home by running in the board's 4th District, anchored in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And thirdly, he might be able to put off major fund-raising while devoting his 
energy to disaster relief in the quake-stricken San Fernando Valley, as well as 
turning his attention toward the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, people in the know say Roberti is leaning toward the treasurer's race. 
He has until March 11 to make up his mind.

JORDAN AND PEACE PACT WITH ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "Why Jordan Will Be Next to Make a Deal With Israel" (Commentary, Feb. 
13), Yossi Melman states all but the right reasons for why Jordan is seeking 
peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Melman, in a conspiratorial tone, describes secret meetings and dealings 
between King Hussein and Israeli leaders over the last three decades. He goes 
further to attribute to King Hussein a fabricated admission to a group of 
American Jewish leaders in Washington that he has "met with all the Israeli 
prime ministers but Begin." If Melman's sources were so authoritative, perhaps 
he would have also known that in response to a similar question that he had 
warned the Israelis about an imminent Syrian-Egyptian attack in 1973, King 
Hussein flatly denied any such contacts with these exact words: "When the war 
of 1973 occurred we were not informed. It was kept from us. It took me totally 
by surprise. You know that and the world knows that. . . . That is totally 
untrue." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Jordan's position on the West Bank, Melman should be reminded that 
in severing legal and administrative ties with the West Bank in 1988, Jordan 
was responding to PLO wishes and in line with a longstanding recognition and 
support for the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. And it is in 
that same spirit that Jordan is pursuing peace today. The creation of a 
Palestinian state is a desirable outcome that Jordan has supported. As for the 
future Jordanian-Palestinian relations, King Hussein has stated repeatedly that 
the issue of confederation, which Melman describes as "the ideal solution" for 
Jordan, should be deferred until such time that the two peoples can decide on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, King Hussein has indeed affirmed recently his willingness to meet 
publicly with Prime Minister Rabin, only at the right time and in the proper 
context. As to the possibility of Jordan signing a peace treaty with Israel, 
that will only take place after the outstanding issues on the common agenda are 
resolved in a satisfactory manner and in the context of a comprehensive peace 
settlement.

ROBERTI RECALL AND GUN LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial ("Roberti Recall: Taking Aim at Courage," Feb. 9), regarding 
the recall of state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys), is on the mark. Roberti 
was my Senate partner in the successful passage of the Roberti-Roos bill to 
stop the sale, manufacture and transport of military assault weapons; I know 
firsthand how malevolent the gun extremists can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we publicly see why gun reforms are so difficult to enact. The recall of 
Roberti is testament to the gun lobby's zeal in attempting to discredit and 
remove from the political scene voices of courage and reason. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite apparent in every public opinion survey that more than 80% of the 
public supports a ban on these deadly assault weapons. The public knows that to 
get a handle on crime we need to increase penalties and get the heavy weaponry 
out of the hands of criminals. Yet, the reason it took so many years to enact a 
ban is because of the undue influence of the National Rifle Assn. and its 
affiliate groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to exert our collective influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is a courageous public official who deserves our help, not just 
because his name is personally on the line in this recall, but because 
literally all of our hopes of enacting sane gun reform in the future rest on 
the outcome of this election. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE ROOS 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * To me the headline of the editorial should be "Roberti Recall: Taking Aim at 
a Carpetbagger." I believe you have underestimated the voters of the 20th 
District. Most agree with the ban on assault weapons but what we are upset 
about is having a carpetbagger represent the Valley. Spending one or two nights 
in a rented apartment does not make a legislator knowledgeable about Valley 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley has 1.6 million residents and it is about time that the "political 
bosses" stop telling us who is going to represent the Valley. To represent an 
area one must live in the area and participate in its activities. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't sign the recall petition but would have if I had been approached. I 
am not a member of the NRA, support the assault rifle ban, but object to having 
incumbents from other districts who are running because of their incumbency and 
can raise lots of money to discourage good candidates from running. Although I 
am a Democrat I will vote to recall Roberti and will vote against state Sen. 
Herschel Rosenthal, who just "rented an apartment" in our district so he can 
also become a carpetbagger when he runs for the seat in November. It's time for 
the Valley to stand up and be counted.

 * Emperor Roberti thinks he can rule the world. If you want to talk about 
courage, finally someone has the courage to confront him with a recall and he 
starts calling names, "gun wackos, extremists." Everyone who doesn't agree with 
Roberti is an extremist. Well, here's a name for Roberti, "big government fat 
cat."

 * I don't live in or even near Roberti's Senate district, but the recall 
assault on him from the marshmallow-brained NRA and gun nuts is truly 
despicable, and costly to the taxpayers. And their own words unmask their 
vicious charade: 
</P>
<P>
 One leading opponent said that the recall effort "has had a marriage of 
convenience with gun activists" (Feb. 8). Another wrote in a memo that "the 
beast is wounded . . . it's time to go in for the kill. . . . " A third 
(convicted of illegally owning a machine gun) admitted that "the whole purpose 
of the recall of Roberti is retribution" for the 1989 law Roberti sponsored 
outlawing assault weapons in California that were massacring our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just eight months before his Senate career ends anyway (because of term 
limits), this effort is further sullied by the fact that several of these 
disgruntled do-nothing losers ran against (and lost to) Roberti in 1992 and 
have filed to do so again as part of the recall in April. What pathetic 
self-serving two-faced hypocrites they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Our state is better for having people of courage like Roberti in public 
office.

</P>
<P>
 * Regarding the recall of Roberti, I am one Republican that disagrees with 
this group. I believe my background qualifies me to speak on this issue a bit 
more than those folks who are asking for a recall due to Roberti's 1989 
legislation on automatic weapons control. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in law enforcement for 31 years, and in the latter part of my career 
seized 2,500 semi- and fully automatic firearms. Many of these weapons were 
used in violent crimes including multiple murders. All remaining weapons were 
used as a defense by an army of grouped criminals in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt very sincerely that these types of weapons make good collectors 
pieces, are used for hunting deer and elk, or target practice. The only purpose 
they do serve is to defend against or kill human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has been and is a pro-law enforcement politician. All one has to do is 
peruse his record for the last two decades.

REFORM IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "What a Menacing Mess We've Made," by Jeffrey Sachs, Commentary, Jan. 26: 
The listing of reform blunders started by Sachs' intrusive "shock therapy" 
fantasies is the best self-indictment of the amorphous mess created in Moscow. 
Spreading the blame on the West, G-7 and the IMF for lack of monetary aid is a 
red herring.It covers up reform mismanagement in Russia and ill advice rendered 
by Russian, Swedish and American radical reform advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of a comprehensive master plan to deracinate the deep-rooted Stalinist 
economic rot is the prime failure of Russian reforms.  
</P>
<P>
 The Russian people could have voted on a reform plan by a referendum on Dec. 
12, as they did by approving a new constitution. Instead, Russian voters by 
power of new democratic processes threw out the radical reformers and advisers. 
Gaidarism in Moscow and Balcerowiczism in Warsaw (that caused 16% unemployment 
in Poland) are classic failures of narrow economic policies. They dared to 
disobey the market needs and political will of the people.

RUSSIA IS NOT IN GOOD HEALTH; BUT DECISION TO SELL U.S.-APPROVED PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS MAY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New mortality statistics beginning to emerge from Russia offer a startling 
picture of decline, the result both of what one researcher calls an 
"unprecedented" rise in the male death rate and a simultaneous sharp increase 
in infant death rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age for male mortality is now believed to have fallen to 59, the 
lowest in Russia in 30 years and well below the average for industrialized 
countries. Infant mortality, 17.4 per 1,000 in 1990, jumped to 19.1 last year. 
Overall, Russia experienced a 20% rise in its death rate last year, with deaths 
exceeding births by 800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Shapiro, a British academic who has worked with the Russian Finance 
Ministry, attributes the high death rate for men to two primary causes: an 
increase in heart disease and strokes and an increase in violent deaths. Those 
causes appear to account for 75% of the extra deaths that occurred last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro cites what she calls a "psychosocial crisis" as a key contributor to 
the soaring death rate, meaning the stresses of living in a society 
increasingly burdened by crime and, for many, growing economic insecurity. 
Among other things, the quality and availability of health care in Russia have 
fallen markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some partial improvement may be in sight. Russia has now decided to allow 
virtually all American-made drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration to be sold in the country, dropping its own testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 That should soon begin to make available a line of pharmaceuticals that have 
been either unavailable in Russia or in short supply. Examples of the latter 
include insulin to treat diabetes and drugs to regulate high blood pressure. 
Both diabetes and hypertension contribute to the heart disease and strokes 
among Russian males that appear to have increased so greatly in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanded access to American drugs won't end what seems to be a true health 
crisis in Russia. But at least greater availability should be able to do some 
good in reducing the sharp and staggering climb in male and infant mortality 
that has suddenly occurred.

DON'T GO SLOW ON FREEWAYS; WILSON GIVES GREEN LIGHT ON RETROFITTING SPEEDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Wilson deserves credit for giving the state Department of Transportation 
the emergency authority to speed up the retrofitting of hundreds of freeway 
overpasses and bridges in the Los Angeles area that are in danger of collapsing 
during earthquakes. That should help revive a retrofitting process that had 
become bogged down in bureaucracy and legal wrangling before the Northridge 
earthquake came along to quite literally shake things up. 
</P>
<P>
 Who or what caused those retrofitting delays? Were they preventable? Both 
Wilson and the Legislature must ask these tough questions of Caltrans 
officials, be they political appointees or professional staffers, to determine 
why more retrofitting wasn't done before the Jan. 17 earthquake collapsed parts 
of six highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson announced that he had given Caltrans emergency contracting authority on 
Thursday, the one-month anniversary of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's action will allow the state agency to speed contracting 
procedures for highway retrofitting -- much as Caltrans rapidly moved to start 
taking down damaged portions of the Santa Monica, Golden State, Antelope Valley 
and Simi Valley freeways in the first few days after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it takes weeks or even months for Caltrans to award a contract, but 
the emergency authority should reduce that time to a few days. It is worth 
remembering how, in the first days after the quake, a few Caltrans contracts 
were awarded in mere hours -- proving that at times a bureaucracy can respond 
efficiently indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans won widespread praise for its initial response to the crisis, and the 
agency deserved it. But now troubling questions have been raised about its 
performance before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A special Times report, published Wednesday, documented the fact that 80% of 
the 1,313 bridges identified as quake-vulnerable in the aftermath of the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake -- in which 43 people died when two Bay Area freeways 
collapsed -- still have not been retrofitted. In Los Angeles County alone, 84% 
of the 716 designated bridges still have not been retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 An especially worrisome aspect was that Caltrans focused on bridges supported 
by single columns before retrofitting those with multiple-column support. It 
turned out that both types of bridges collapsed in the Northridge temblor. This 
while not one of the Southern California bridges that had been retrofitted 
failed in the magnitude-6.8 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, much more needs to be known about what was done and not done to make 
California's bridges and freeway overpasses safer in those critical four years 
and four months between the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes.

 College baseball has returned to Southern California in recent weeks, a 
welcome reminder of the small, reassuring certainties of the seasons of life. 
The rhythms of daily existence have been quietly resuming for many after the 
disasters of recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a story out of Southern California College in Costa Mesa this week 
brought national TV crews rushing in, and the college fielded requests from a 
national news magazine and even from a movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Ila Borders, a freshman, struck out the first 10 batters she faced, 
almost pitched a shutout and went the distance in the game as her small school 
defeated Claremont-Mudd, 12-1. This impressive outing marked the first time a 
woman has pitched in a "men's" college baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders' coach had taken some criticism for offering her a scholarship, and 
even in victory she had to endure silly questions at a rare postgame press 
conference held at second base. But as remarkable as the event was, and as 
circus-like as the atmosphere became, there was still that familiarity of 
baseball surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher said she was just interested in winning a game, not making 
profound statements. She revealed that when the coach approached near the end 
to ask her how she felt, she did what any tired pitcher wanting to hang in 
there does: She fibbed a bit, saying she felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hoopla, the landmark event was, in a sense, wonderfully ordinary. 
And what a winner the winning pitcher was.

HAIL TO THE CHIEF (SALESMAN)!; CLINTON NAILS DOWN HUGE DEAL WITH SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Constitution provides a partial job description for the President. He is 
the commander in chief of the armed forces as well as the nation's top 
diplomat.He appoints judges, ambassadors and other officials. As head of state 
he plays a major ceremonial role. Unmentioned by the Constitution, the 
President is the de facto leader of his political party. Also unmentioned, but 
of increasing significance: The President has become the top lobbyist and 
salesman in boosting America's role in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton this week had a chance to display his skill in that part, 
and clearly he relished it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton announced that Saudi Arabia will buy 50 or more airliners from the 
Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., a deal worth $6 billion and tens of 
thousands of jobs, a fair number of them in Southern California. The final 
decision by the Saudis came after a year of intense competition between U.S. 
and European plane makers in which French and British political leaders made 
personal appeals to King Fahd. So, too, by phone and letter and through 
personal emissaries, did Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, suggested the 
deal is an effort by his country to show it is a strategic asset by helping to 
maintain the U.S. aerospace industry. Saudi Arabia, a key beneficiary of the 
American-led rollback of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, is also a large buyer of 
U.S. military aircraft and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Purists might question whether the dignity of the presidency is reduced when 
the chief executive gets personally involved in lobbying for U.S. industry. Our 
view is that it's perfectly proper, simply another instance of the President 
acting to promote the general welfare.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; TIME OUT ON COLISEUM REPAIRS; WHY THE RUSH TO SPEND 
UNKNOWN MILLIONS ON THIS WHITE ELEPHANT? WHY NOT BUILD A NEW STADIUM -- 
SOMEWHERE ELSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE O'NEILL, Catherine O'Neill of Los Angeles is co-founder of the 
Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now I'm just a girl who has been to the Coliseum only when Notre Dame played 
USC, so I don't pretend to be a sports fanatic. But I do smell something funny 
in the way we are racing to throw public money into rebuilding the 
earthquake-damaged Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's think about it. Just because there was a stadium built in Exposition 
Park in the 1920s, does it makes sense in the 1990s to keep pouring money into 
what might be just an antiquated and seldom-used white elephant? 
</P>
<P>
 The race to spend the money is based on the presumption that it will somehow 
ensure that the Raiders will play here next fall. Even a non-sports-nut like me 
knows that we have no guarantees. We could spend millions, and they might take 
their footballs and helmets to Baltimore, Hartford or St. Louis.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, $15 million was spent renovating the stadium. Even then, the 
Raiders filled all the seats only a few times.  
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for putting money into the Coliseum, some argue, is that it is 
good for the neighborhood. A drive around the Coliseum calls that into 
question. The acres of empty parking lots contribute to the urban blight that 
plagues the area. On the few days of the year when thousands flock to see the 
boys play ball, they do not spend money dining or filling hotels in the 
neighborhood. At best, part-time parking-lot employees, concession workers and 
local residents who rent their front yards for parking may make a few bucks. 
But a jewel of urban development, the Coliseum has not been. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pell-mell rush to throw millions more into the Coliseum, it begins to 
look like some slick operators are taking advantage of a semihysteria to return 
everything in Los Angeles to just the way it was before the earthquake. Making 
it worse is that the construction company that has gotten a blank check from 
the Coliseum Commission to do the repairs, Tutor-Saliba, is the same company 
whose performance in building Metro Rail has been questioned. The company also 
has had questions raised about its lavish political and personal-luxury 
spending.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's look at the sequence here. On Feb. 9, the City Council voted to spend 
$10 million of our federal earthquake relief to immediately start renovating 
the Coliseum. The vote came before members knew how much damage had been done 
and what the ultimate cost might be.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Monday, the Coliseum Commission voted to give a repair contract 
without any public bids and without knowing how much it might cost. The only 
elected official on the commission who had the common sense to vote "no" was 
County Supervisor Yvonne Burke.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the City Council had some second thoughts. Led by Nate Holden and 
with support from Zev Yaroslavsky, a majority of the council tried to go on 
record as criticizing the move to repair the Coliseum without a fair bidding 
procedure. But Council President John Ferraro, who in his youth gained fame as 
a USC football star in the Coliseum, would have none of that. To reconsider 
would have taken a two-thirds vote; Ferraro lined up a few others and killed 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been to this point publicly quiet on the issue, Mayor Richard Riordan 
told the League of Women Voters on Wednesday that the issue of the Coliseum was 
"was one of those things where we should stand back and take a look," but that 
pressure groups had gotten involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan should not buckle under to those pressure groups. He should support 
Burke and the majority of the council in asking the Coliseum Commission to vote 
for reconsideration. Political leaders worked hard to get those federal funds 
for California; let's not squander them.  
</P>
<P>
 The three Coliseum owners -- the city, state and county -- should appoint a 
group of smart people, including some non-sports-fanatics, who could make a 
decision that was good for the long-term interests of Los Angeles. The 
earthquake money might be the leverage we need to build a new stadium for the 
21st Century. Maybe that stadium should be in a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long time since 1958, when small-town Los Angeles lured the Dodgers 
here as an expression that the city had arrived. St. Louis and Baltimore may 
need teams to remind the country they are on the map. We do not.

ALL WE'RE DOING IS REARRANGING THE DECK CHAIRS ON A SEAFOOD TITANIC; FOOD 
SAFETY: THE FDA'S NEW RULES DON'T ADDRESS THE REAL THREAT -- LETHAL TOXINS IN 
FISH FROM CONTAMINATED WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN and DAVID STEINMAN, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein is professor of 
occupational and environmental health at the University of Illinois School of 
Public Health and chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition. David Steinman, 
a member of the NAS seafood safety committee, wrote Diet for a Poisoned Planet 
(Ballantyne Books, 1992.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it will promulgate 
new rules to ensure that seafood is free of bacterial and viral contaminants 
that cause food poisoning. After years of foot-dragging and congressional 
criticism, the move has been welcomed by consumer groups.  
</P>
<P>
 But the announcement amounts to little more than a public-relations gambit to 
boost seafood sales, which have declined about 8% since 1987 due largely to 
public concern over safety. Many of the most critical regulations have been in 
effect for years under the National Shellfish Sanitation Program carried out by 
the states and supervised by the FDA. Others have already been widely adopted 
by industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough steps necessary to make seafood safe have yet to be taken.  
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 60,000 people suffer seafood poisoning annually, mostly from 
consumption of raw shellfish. As for the FDA's touted crusade to save the 
public from alleged bacterial and viral hazards in the rest of the seafood 
supply, that is tilting at windmills. These contaminants are often found on fin 
fish, but fin fish are usually cooked. A 1991 National Academy of Sciences 
seafood-safety committee concluded that seafood filets and steaks almost never 
cause bacterial or viral poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy committee, however, emphasized that seafood poses serious chronic 
threats to our health: cancer and birth defects resulting from contamination 
with persistent environmental toxins such as methylmercury, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, dioxin and DDT. The bulk of this risk stems from fish harvested from 
the Great Lakes, inland waterways and coastal bays and estuaries. In contrast 
with the very few who eat raw shellfish, this risk threatens almost the entire 
U.S. population.  
</P>
<P>
 Studies in the Great Lakes region have demonstrated that babies born to women 
who regularly eat PCB-contaminated fish have smaller birth weight and head 
circumference and impaired neurological development. Furthermore, the academy 
conservatively concluded that about 75 of every 1 million consumers are at risk 
for cancer. The usual federal standard for safety is 1 in 1 million. People who 
subsist on fish and who fish in polluted waters, including many Native 
Americans, are at even higher risk.  
</P>
<P>
 Totally ignored by the FDA, these delayed hazards could be substantially 
reduced through regulation:  
</P>
<P>
 * Labeling and public education. Explicit labeling would alert consumers to 
cancer- and birth-defect-causing contaminants.  
</P>
<P>
 * Monitoring. The FDA monitors only a few fish, and these for only a few 
carcinogenic and reproductive contaminants. Monitoring must be sharply expanded 
to include comprehensive analysis for industrial pollutants such as pesticides, 
dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, methylmercury and radioactive 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strengthening environmental discharge regulations. Fish from even Alaska are 
now contaminated with dioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other carcinogenic and 
reproductive toxins. In other coastal regions and inland waterways, fish are 
contaminated with pollutants such as PCBs and pesticides such as alachlor and 
atrazine. Tough regulations restricting agriculturaland industrial discharges 
must be promulgated.  
</P>
<P>
 * Restricting harvest in polluted areas. These hazards are posed by harvesting 
fish from inland waterways including the Great Lakes and specific coastal 
regions such as greater Boston Harbor and Santa Monica Bay. A 50% reduction in 
national exposure to carcinogens in fish could be achieved by restricting 
harvesting from only 5% of the most contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tightening allowable levels for methylmercury. FDA risk assessments for 
mercury-related birth defects are based on shaky science. While Canada rejects 
all fish with methylmercury levels over 0.5 parts per million, U.S. guidelines 
allow twice this amount. Furthermore, about half of all swordfish -- a major 
dietary source of methylmercury -- sold in supermarkets exceeds even lenient 
U.S. guidelines, and, if consumed too frequently, may pose reproductive 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regulating farmed fish. The nation's burgeoning aquaculture industry has not 
been adequately regulated. Aquaculture feed should be certified to be free from 
carcinogenic pesticides, antibiotics and other contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer surveys have consistently found that the public is intensely 
concerned about cancer hazards in the food supply. By following these 
recommendations, the FDA can at last fulfill its obligation to ensure that our 
seafood supply is safe.

A TORTURED FICTION IS SWEPT FROM THE TABLE; HEALTH REFORM: WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 
FORCED TO REFLECT ITS PLAN IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET, WE'RE FREE TO LOOK AT REAL 
COSTS AND BENEFITS OF OTHER SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEODORE R. MARMOR and JERRY L. MASHAW, Theodore R. Marmor is a professor of 
public policy and Jerry L. Mashaw is a professor of law at Yale University. 
They write frequently on health-reform issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outside Washington, the testimony of the head of the Congressional Budget 
Office is rarely the stuff of high drama. Yet, last week, when CBO head Robert 
Reischauer told Congress that health insurance premiums required of businesses 
and the costs of the White House health-reform program would have to be 
accounted for in the federal budget, just like other taxes and spending, 
official Washington and the national press corps were all over the story. They 
judged immediately that Reischauer had presented President Clinton with big new 
political problems. But let's look at it from another viewpoint. The fellow 
actually told an unvarnished truth: Things equal to the same thing are equal to 
each other. In doing so, he has potentially transformed the nation's debate 
over national health reform -- and in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The President initially dismissed the budget office's realism as the work of 
Washington policy insiders. But it was more nearly the opposite -- the 
rejection of a fiscal fiction that continued to treat such payments as "private 
health policy premiums." Reischauer was that rare breed of high government 
official, one who told truth to power when power didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible consequences of Reischauer's truth, however, are not those we've 
heard from most of the media commentators. Rather than seriously damaging 
prospects for the Clinton plan (or health reform generally), it should free us 
from the silly straitjacket of budgetary fabrication that has hampered serious 
reform discussion and led reformers down paths of mind-numbing complexity and 
obfuscation to keep up the pretense of "private health insurance for all." 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose were to start asking what the total cost of various health-reform 
plans might be, instead of what part of that cost showed up in public budgets? 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, all manner of simpler expansions of health care come into view. 
These are the plans previously ruled "off the radar screen" by the political 
constraint that no significant amount of new dollars could appear in public 
budgets, no matter what the actual cost of the proposed reforms might be. This 
is where Reischauer's realism comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for example, we could talk about an expanded Medicare program for all 
(that is, a universal Medicare with prescription drug insurance, long-term care 
and other coverage for the chronically ill). What about a Canadian-style system 
of cooperative federalism with a single payer in each state? What about an 
individual instead of an employer mandate with subsidies via the tax system for 
an approved basic insurance package? 
</P>
<P>
 Why mention these possibilities? For a very straightforward reason: They are 
all administratively simpler schemes. They require little in the way of new 
bureaucratic institutions and fewer immediate changes in the way medicine is 
practiced. They are consistent with basic principles for a satisfactory 
health-insurance system; that is, they can easily accommodate our desires for 
universal, comprehensive and portable coverage. They present directions for 
reform that, unlike the Clinton plan or its major competitors, such as the 
proposal of Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), would limit administrative costs and 
substantially increase the likelihood that total costs will be kept under 
control and fairly distributed. Perhaps most astonishingly, they could be 
explained to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 We should also note that these ideas -- from a tax-based individual mandate to 
the Canadian approach -- run across the ideological spectrum. They are 
associated with proponents as unlike each other as Sen. Paul Wellstone 
(D-Minn.) and former President George Bush, the American College of Surgeons 
and the Communications Workers of America. In short, the fixation on whether 
something was counted in the federal budget has made it impossible for good 
ideas of both the reasonable right and the reasonable left to get a sensible 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The constraints of the health-reform debate thus far have impoverished our 
range of possibilities in the name of protecting the federal budget. But, as 
Reischauer made clear in his testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, 
the simple fact is that what is in and what is out of the federal budget is a 
matter of arcane formal rules. These rules tell us little or nothing about what 
a particular means of arranging health insurance will really cost and who in 
the end pays for it. 
</P>
<P>
 If we could follow and extend Reischauer's example, if we could talk about the 
real costs and real benefits of alternative means of achieving universal health 
insurance, we might actually get to a system that would be far better than any 
that official Washington currently views as possible. We could fire Rube 
Goldberg as our chief health finance architect and look seriously for simpler 
and more workable designs.

ADD TEACHING TO HIGH-RISK JOBS; EDUCATION: WHEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS FEEL 
CONSTANTLY THREATENED, NO ONE CAN EXCEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA WEBSTER-DAVIS, Donna Webster-Davis left the Los Angeles school 
district last year; she now teaches English at Ayala High School in Chino 
Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read Thursday's news of the assault on a Pasadena teacher in the light of 
two images that haunt me: a frantic colleague being gathered up and taken to 
the school nurse's office after being attacked by one of her failing students, 
and the anguish on my own students' faces at the announcement of a killing at 
the school's football bleachers during class time. 
</P>
<P>
 These images remain with me not only because of the horror of those moments, 
but because they are encountered daily by teachers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate rages on as to why violence has invaded our schools: too much 
television, provocative lyrics in music, the availability of guns. The experts 
argue -- correctly, I feel -- that living in this climate of violence 
desensitizes young people to the reality of pain and death. I am still waiting, 
however, for these experts to evaluate how this violence affects teachers and 
the way we do our jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 When I started teaching, at Crenshaw High School in South-Central Los Angeles, 
I could not imagine a more fulfilling profession. I eagerly planned lessons and 
looked forward to getting my own classroom. I discovered that if I took the 
time to attend school functions, such as football and basketball games, my 
students would be more responsive in class. So I didn't mind driving to away 
games and getting home late -- it was part of my job. Many of my colleagues 
felt the same, and our social lives revolved around the school. I was 
transferred to Washington Preparatory High School, where the situation was the 
same. I found dedicated teachers happy to make the extra commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 That was eight years ago. I am not quite sure what has happened but I do know 
this: Teachers are frightened. Part of attending extracurricular activities 
includes supervising students. Naturally, their safety comes first. I have "hit 
the deck" more than once at football games when the bleachers became targets 
for drive-bys. Consoling frazzled cheerleaders after crawling around in the 
sand and mud of the track loses its appeal quickly. Traveling on the school bus 
after the game with our heads buried in our laps until it is safe to come up 
for air is no joy ride, either. School dances often are one or two hours of fun 
squeezed in between the brawls that erupt for no real reason. As teachers, we 
are obligated to break up these fights, and the angry students often turn on 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 The classroom is no better. Even though high schools in Los Angeles have metal 
detectors, students still carry weapons -- and we know that in some cases, they 
plan to use them. In the teachers' lounge, we joke and say of students these 
days, "Hey, you can have an A, just don't shoot me!" I laugh, too. It is a way 
of releasing the immense stress that chips away at our professionalism. My 
colleagues complain of having nightmares about someone bursting in their 
classrooms and just "blowing everyone away." With this in mind, the old "duck 
and cover" earthquake drills we practiced when we were students weren't as 
silly as we thought. We hear students say that they will "cap" somebody if they 
are crossed, and while it may seem that they are kidding, we have to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has to affect the way we teach. Maintaining classroom order takes 
on a different meaning when the scales are tipped so against us. We aren't as 
willing to challenge a potentially violent teen any more, opting to call 
security and pray that the student is taken away, thus risking our credibility 
with other students because, to them, we appear sheepish. They don't want us to 
be afraid. They need us to be fearless. How else can they cope? It is a burden. 
Also, taking that extra interest in students by attending their concert or 
cheering them on at the game -- interest that is crucial to their overall 
success -- becomes a luxury we are too afraid to enjoy. Ultimately, the 
students lose. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know the answers. I do know, however, that this trend cannot 
continue. It is a strain to keep up a front of not being afraid. But why should 
students feel safe when we do not? How can they excel when we are too 
traumatized to do our jobs completely? My colleague who was attacked by her 
student has moved on to what she believes is a safer job: teaching English at a 
nearby prison. What does that say?

IT'S ZANY AND ACES WITH FANS; MOVIES: 'ACE VENTURA' WITH JIM CARREY HAS TAKEN 
IN $24.6 MILLION, AND IS STILL GOING STRONG. 
</P>

 Steven Spielberg has made the most important film of his lifetime, Tom Hanks 
has taken on the most important role of his career, and Robin Williams makes a 
great housekeeper. So what's a cowlicked finder of lost dolphins doing at the 
top of the box-office tallies two weeks in a row? 
</P>
<P>
 Since its release Feb. 4, the manically lowbrow comedy "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective" has taken in $24.6 million, and doesn't show any sign of slowing 
down. The Morgan Creek film, directed by first-timer Tom Shadyac, has made an 
instant movie star out of comedian Jim Carrey, formerly best known for 
characters like Fire Marshal Bill on Fox-TV's "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this movie was going to either be something that people really went 
for, or it was going to ruin me completely," Carrey said. "From the beginning 
of my involvement, I said that the character had to be rock 'n' roll. He had to 
be the .007 of pet detectives. I wanted to be unstoppably ridiculous, and they 
let me go wild." 
</P>
<P>
 A wild, ridiculous Carrey was exactly what Morgan Creek hoped for when the 
project was green-lighted. With past releases like "Dead Ringers," "Young Guns" 
and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," the company has covered plenty of 
stylistic territory, though recent releases like "True Romance," "The Crush " 
and "Young Guns II" have been less than stellar at the box office. This time 
out, Chairman and CEO James G. Robinson was after a broad comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the movie we set out to make," he says. "I thought from the beginning 
that it would be a mistake to center a film on a great comedian like Jim Carrey 
and not let him cut loose." 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it was a complete ego trip to become Ace," says Carrey. "He's got all 
the fast, funny answers to every situation. He can fight. He can make love. 
He's the best. He's completely happy with his lot in life and just wants to 
keep his pets well-fed." 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences are responding enthusiastically to Carrey's frenzied antics, whether 
he's violently delivering a UPS package, catching bullets in his teeth or 
running football patterns in a tutu. The film, which also stars Sean Young, 
Courteney Cox, rapper Tone Loc and Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino, is 
especially a hit with the 10- to 20-year-old age group it was originally 
targeted for. Box-office grosses indicate that many fans are going back to see 
the film again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful and surprising to be at No. 1, because we're sort of an 
underdog film," says director Shadyac, 33, previously notable for being the 
youngest gag writer ever to work for Bob Hope. "But we were laughing so hard 
when we made this, we knew that if we managed to capture the fun and the spirit 
of Jim Carrey, we had a chance to put out a very successful movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Shadyac, who won the directing job by pitching a rewrite of the script to 
Robinson, says that Carrey's ability to produce laughs occasionally became a 
problem during production. "The most difficult thing about working with Jim was 
trying to keep the cast and crew from laughing during takes. We had to send Jim 
off the set in order to film Courteney's close-up lines because she couldn't 
keep a straight face with him standing there. We had to cut the movie around 
the shots where actors started cracking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many critics have been charmed by Ace Ventura's exploits, and several have 
charged that the film's humor is mean-spirited, needlessly raunchy and 
homophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reviews, work offers have been piling up at Shadyac's office. "I 
didn't imagine that a completely crazy comedy like this would be the kind of 
film I'd make my debut with, but now that it's happened, I'm thrilled," he 
says. "One of the top agents in town called us and said he laughed all the way 
through the movie and was terribly embarrassed by that. That's a compliment as 
far as I'm concerned. I know comedy directors are rare and prized, and I hope I 
can help fill that void for a couple of movies.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way a film like 'Ace Ventura' can appeal to everybody, but it's 
amazing to see how many people love it. Jim Robinson said, right before we 
began shooting this film, 'Make a film that nobody my age gets.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey was involved in rewriting the script, and was allowed a great deal of 
room to improvise on set. He says he frequently pursued comedic tangents that 
he knew would not appeal to everyone's tastes. "I wanted to keep the action 
unreal and over the top. When it came time to do my reaction to kissing a man, 
I wanted it to be the biggest, most obnoxious, homophobic reaction ever 
recorded. It's so ridiculous it can't be taken seriously -- even though it 
guarantees that somebody's going to be offended." 
</P>
<P>
 Those deeply offended by "Ace Ventura's" success may not have to wait long to 
be rankled again. Robinson decided that "Ace" was worth a sequel before the 
first film was even completed, and both Shadyac and Carrey are excited about 
having another go at the character. Joining the writing team for "Ace II" will 
be Steve Oederkerk, who worked with Carrey as a writer on "In Living Color" and 
served as a creative consultant this film.  
</P>
<P>
 "This film has shown us in a flash that there's a huge audience for Jim 
Carrey's comedy," says Oederkerk, "and I think that surprised everybody, 
including Jim Carrey." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson at least has no pretensions about the artistic value of his film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I sincerely hope 'Schindler's List' cleans up at the Oscars. 'Ace 
Ventura' is a no-brainer. Buy yourself a tub of popcorn, sit back, and just 
give it up. Relax. There are no messages here and we're not trying to educate 
anybody. It's just an hour and a half to kick back and laugh."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: HE WHO DAZZLES KNOWS WHEN TO SHUT UP 
</P>

 Nothing on television is more visually stunning and poetic than figure skaters 
at the Winter Olympics, any Winter Olympics. On Tuesday, Verne Lundquist, the 
CBS announcer at Northern Lights Hall in Hamar, Norway, chose a single word -- 
the perfect one -- to define the performance of Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur 
Dmitriev, Russian silver medalists in the pairs competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dazzling." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally so was Lundquist's silence during their program. He let the pictures, 
sounds and crowd response speak eloquently for themselves in the same way that 
Vin Scully always understands when to shut up and not compete with an epic 
baseball moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Less dazzling has been commentator Scott Hamilton's talkiness. His words often 
skate right over and draw attention from the athletes on the ice. He's smart 
and articulate, and naturally the former gold medalist knows his stuff. What he 
doesn't know is when to be quiet. What CBS should do is have Hamilton keep his 
comments on live performances to a minimum and reserve his laurels and darts 
for the replays. Otherwise, it's like hearing play-by-play for "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hamilton is a mime compared with some non-Olympics sportscasters who dish 
out hot-flaming oratory. One, in particular, comes irritatingly to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bizarre sports commentator who can overshadow the event he's supposed 
to be describing. Dick Vitale -- the mouth from hell -- is a bizarre sports 
commentator, a grating, showboating former coach who's made his reputation by 
thrusting himself into the foreground of every college basketball event he's 
assigned to cover by ESPN and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colorful" is the adjective frequently attached to Vitale. Yes, the way a 
fingernail scraping a blackboard is colorful. Vitale obliterates a basketball 
telecast by talking non-stop and shouting it into oblivion, using his tongue to 
grind it to dust. 
</P>
<P>
 You shutter when hearing Vitale relentlessly give details about Vitale, speak 
for the umpteenth time about his "diaper dandies" (a team's freshmen) or again 
dip into his bottomless bag of trivia. At the mention of shoes you may get his 
top five list of sneakers, followed by his top five sneaky fast point guards, 
followed by his top five power forwards with pointy heads. A player has baggy 
shorts? Hear Vitale's top five short players. 
</P>
<P>
 The man is merciless. And when he screams "BABEEEEEE!!!!" -- as in "HEY, 
BABEEEEEE!!!!" or "MARK IT DOWN, BABEEEEEE!!!!" -- his tubes are a thundering 
dunk that can shatter an entire backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the scenario if Vitale were rinkside at the Winter Olympics, weighing 
in on the relatively genteel figure skating competition that's been all but 
eclipsed by the frenzy over Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding "sharing the same 
ice." You'd think they were sharing the same shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, who needs Vitale to turn this into a carnival? On Thursday, for 
example, "CBS This Morning" had its cameras on Kerrigan and Harding as they 
practiced with other skaters on the big rink at Hamar. To his credit, Hamilton 
cautioned co-hosts Harry Smith and Paula Zahn not to "read too much" into any 
of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from his monitor at the alpine skiing venue at Kvitfjell, Smith reported 
breathlessly that Kerrigan and Harding "skated right by each other." A 
bulletin! And earlier, Zahn, from her post at a monitor in the snow at 
Lillehammer, reported that the two skaters "did not establish eye contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Not dazzling, babeeeeee!!!! Other Animals: KCET's admirable "Life & Times" 
does more than provide a studio for talking heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently, for example, it showed Jean Victor's scrupulously fair, yet 
sensitive, poignant and quietly impassioned film chronicling the futile efforts 
of Peter Wallerstein and his Whale Rescue Team to stop the capture of three 
dolphins off the coast of California. The dolphins were sought for an exhibit 
at the John D. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Battle for the Dolphins" presented a classic clash between environmentalists 
and a marine mammal curator over whether these animals can thrive in captivity 
as they do in the sea. Each side said it cared about the dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 The film artfully submerged you into the dolphins' acoustic environment while 
conveying the "excitement and curiosity" that Wallerstein said he felt in their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 But watching the capture, viewers could only speculate about the terror the 
dolphins must have felt upon being plucked from the water by Shedd employees 
and hauled aboard their boat. There was something deeply sad about their 
ultimate relocation in a tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the dolphins -- and also talented independent filmmakers like Victor who 
labor on modest budgets to do superior work dealing with challenging topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Infinitely bigger bucks were available to National Geographic and producers 
Dereck and Beverly Joubert to fund their recent PBS documentary, "Reflections 
on Elephants." 
</P>
<P>
 What remarkable footage of free-roaming African elephants and their 
relationship to one another. One sequence showed huge adults actually going 
down to their knees in a cooperative effort to free a calf from a mud hole. In 
another touching sight, an elephant used its trunk to hold the tusk of a dead 
elephant -- almost tenderly, like a treasured memento -- as if reluctant to 
part with a comrade. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to especially intelligent animals, it's always tempting -- but a 
mistake -- to anthropomorphize. In watching "Reflections of Elephants," though, 
you couldn't help marveling at these wondrous creatures and noting the 
qualities shared by their shrinking species and ours. While being repulsed, of 
course, by the thought of them being slaughtered for ivory.

LIVE-WIRE JIM TRENTON DOES RADIO WITH PICTURES; TELEVISION: IN HIS NEW LIFE AS 
A FEATURE REPORTER ON KTTV-TV'S 'GOOD DAY L.A.,' THE POORMAN DRAWS ON THE LOOPY 
STYLE THAT WAS HIS SIGNATURE ON KROQ-FM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Whether digging into the world's longest burrito, searching for the five 
oddest jobs in Southern California or waking up complete strangers and fixing 
them breakfast, Jim (Poorman) Trenton is determined to take morning television 
viewers where they've never gone before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like the Charles Kuralt of the '90s on acid," Trenton explains of his 
role as a feature reporter on KTTV-TV Channel 11's "Good Day L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton handles his "news" segments in the same loopy style that was his 
signature during the 12 years he was an on-air personality on alternative rock 
station KROQ-FM (106.7). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his radio background has been a big help, says Kim Paul Friedman, 
executive producer of "Good Day L.A.," who plans to step up Trenton's 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we're doing morning radio on television, and having been a radio 
guy, he understands how the imagination works," Friedman said. "What Poorman 
adds is (that) he's Everyman. He's not manufactured from a consulting firm. 
People can relate to him. I think he really is a breath of fresh air on the 
program, away from the cosmetic stuffiness we're used to seeing. Most 
newspeople wouldn't do what he does for fear of ruining their manicures or 
their hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his out-of-control, party-hearty persona, Trenton was a staple at 
KROQ, especially in recent years as co-host of the station's popular nighttime 
advice show, "Loveline." But he was suspended indefinitely last August after 
orchestrating a prank in which a group of listeners converged outside another 
KROQ personality's house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton continues to get paid by KROQ until his contract runs out in November. 
But he recently filed suit against the station and its owner, Infinity 
Broadcasting Corp., seeking ownership rights to "Loveline" and $22.5 million in 
damages for being pulled off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before he was suspended, Trenton hosted a segment on the KTTV morning 
program. That led to more work and now he's on the morning news program several 
times a week. He has interviewed Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda about an "Easy 
Rider" reunion, gone surfing with a U.S. Congressman and attended charm school. 
Several of his latest stunts have been simulcast on local radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The record-breaking burrito segment was simulcast on hip-hop station KPWR-FM, 
and a live surf session followed by an 11-cent breakfast were simulcast on 
heavy metal station KNAC-FM. An early morning movie preview was broadcast on 
urban station KKBT-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's ever tried to do morning radio with pictures," Trenton said. "I 
think that combining the two media is really innovative. I see morning TV as 
being the hottest thing there is because morning radio has pretty much done it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton's suit against KROQ and Infinity Broadcasting alleges breach of 
contract, copyright infringement and slander. His main objective, he said, is 
to establish ownership of "Loveline," the advice show he created in 1983 and 
co-hosted with Dr. Drew Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in it for the money," Trenton said. "I'm in it because I think these 
guys shouldn't get away with this. It's sad they have to steal this little 
guy's show. . . . They said I was a loose cannon. Sure there are quirks and 
what not, but if I'm that bad, why don't they fire me? What they did instead is 
try to hold me to this contract so I can't work (on radio) anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ general manager Trip Reeb refused to comment, citing the pending 
litigation.

THEATRE RASCALS MAKING THEIR MARK ON STAGE AND SCREEN; THEATER: MEMBERS OF THE 
YOUTH TROUPE SAY THEIR ACTING APLOMB IS ROOTED IN THEIR TRAINING. THEIR 'ROMYO 
AND JULIE-MAE' WRAPS THIS WEEKEND.

 Marquise Wilson had less than 10 minutes to go to curtain, but the 13-year-old 
showed no signs of jitters as he spoke earnestly, almost humbly, about his 
experience with the Theatre Rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Wilson said in his distinctive rasp as last-minute activity 
swirled around him in adjacent dressing rooms. "It's taught me a lot. How to 
rely on myself, how to carry myself. . . ." He paused, his wide eyes searching 
the ceiling for words. "What you really learn," he said finally, "is that it's 
the little things that are big." 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other members of the Theatre Rascals, Wilson is a working actor, 
most recently a regular on the ABC television series "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper." 
Wilson had some acting experience before joining Theatre Rascals, but most of 
his fellow Rascals got their start with the troupe, and many have landed parts 
in TV series and a variety of commercials, videos and independent and feature 
films. Among them are Jamil Smith, 11, for example, who has done two Nike 
commercials and has a recurring role on Fox's "The Sinbad Show," yet had no 
acting experience prior to joining the group. The same is true of LaCrystal 
Cooke, 14, who has played the role of Vanessa in ABC's "George," and Ian 
Monsette, 14, who has done voice-overs for ABC's "The Addams Family" cartoon 
series. Yet all of these young actors insist that working with the Rascals is 
the most valuable thing in their careers because, as Wilson says, "you learn 
and have a lot of fun at the same time."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Theatre Rascals, a youth acting troupe out of the Crenshaw area in Southwest 
Los Angeles, opened last week at the Richard Pryor Theater with "Romyo and 
Julie-Mae," a musical, urbanized version of Shakespeare's classic love story 
made memorable by a host of finely tuned comic characters: savvy, sassy Nurse 
Bubbles, hopelessly nerdy McCrucious, flighty but well-meaning Lady Cappy and, 
of course, the star-crossed lovers. The play winds up performances this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of 30, age 12 to 21, infuses the piece with such infectious energy 
and high spirits it's difficult for the audience not to have a good time. But 
even during the production's most chaotic moments -- and there are many -- 
actors are delivering critically timed lines without a hitch, projecting their 
voices easily and hitting marks on a dime. It's all par for the course for the 
Rascals, who say that their stage aplomb is rooted in the training and personal 
attention they receive from their parent studio, Faith Acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of scared at first. I didn't know anything," said Kenneth Brooks, 
13, who joined the Rascals barely a month ago. "Now I'm more confident. They 
really help you out here, not just with acting, but how to deal with people. 
They teach you that what matters is what's inside of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith founders Felecia Scott and Deirdre Weston know all about making things 
happen with little more than personal will. In May, 1992, with $600 pooled from 
their income tax return checks, the pair opened the studio in a rented office 
in the Crenshaw Square shopping center a week after half the structure had 
burned down during the civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought to ourselves, 'Lord, what have we done? What if nobody shows?' " 
recalled Scott, a New York native who, like Weston, taught acting at Marla 
Gibbs' Crossroads Arts Academy in Leimert Park. "We never thought we'd recoup 
our losses. But we've proven to ourselves that we were meant to be." At this 
point, the school is paying for itself, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio started with 17 students -- the original Rascals -- who urged Scott 
and Weston to keep up instruction after Crossroads temporarily stopped offering 
classes in 1992. (Crossroads has since sporadically offered some classes, but 
is currently not offering any.) The studio now has a roster of 130, including 
30 Rascals, and last June moved operations to the more spacious Consolidated 
Realty Board Building in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on discipline, however, is unchanged. Weston teaches the bulk of 
the studio's 12-week classes and makes clear from the outset that Faith is no 
place for stars or Hollywood-size egos. Whatever a child's acting aspirations, 
he or she must put other things first: developing self-esteem, keeping up 
school grades, paying strict attention and respecting others. When students are 
accepted into Faith after being extensively interviewed and auditioned, they 
sign a contract in which they agree to stick to the rules or risk suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to be kicked out. Everyone wants to work their way up to being a 
Rascal, particularly the little kids," said Weston, who wrote and directed 
"Romyo and Julie-Mae." "This studio is very important to the kids, which is why 
I never have discipline problems. It's very competitive, but it's also like one 
big family. We all love each other and understand that responsibility, 
motivation and attitude are the key things, not acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Rascal Akilah Johnson, who began training with Scott and 
Weston at Crossroads, agreed. "They give you a lot here -- discipline, speech, 
movement, dance, audition techniques," she said. "It's demanding sometimes. But 
being up on stage makes it all worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romyo and Julie-Mae" continues Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 
p.m. at the Richard Pryor Theater, 1445 N. Las Palmas Ave., Hollywood , (213) 
295-4996.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MAVERICKS MIX UP THE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't often see a country nightclub filled with dancers two-stepping their 
way across the floor while the band plays an ode to a generation of Cuban 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mavericks, who did just that Tuesday at In Cahoots in Fullerton, 
aren't your standard-issue country band. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Florida-based quintet is one of the brightest additions to the 
country scene of the '90s. While it knows classic country and honky-tonk inside 
out (several songs on the new "What a Crying Shame" album would be perfect for 
Buck Owens), the Mavericks can deliver stinging social commentary when the mood 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such material was more prevalent on its 1992 major-label debut, notably the 
title song, "From Hell to Paradise." Lead singer-songwriter Raul Malo's ode to 
those who escaped the Castro regime (including his own parents) was transformed 
Tuesday from the country-rock anthem treatment on the album to a more apt Latin 
arrangement. Malo strummed a Spanish guitar, the rhythm section emphasized a 
loping calypso beat and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden supplied accordion 
fills. 
</P>
<P>
 The new album focuses on matters of the heart, with several numbers that ring 
like future classics. The musicians brought a Blasters-Los Lobos-style 
roots-rock ethic to their playing, shifting deftly from country and Western 
swing to Tex-Mex, rockabilly and Latin pop to keep the textures varied. And the 
dancers moving.

ART REVIEW; A FOCUS ON THE GOODS THAT DEFINE OUR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As sheer spectacle, the sculptures of David Mach rarely disappoint. In the 
last decade, the Scottish-born Mach has fashioned a full-scale Rolls-Royce from 
thousands of books and rebuilt the Parthenon out of used car tires. Another of 
his trademark, maximalist gestures is to appear to send a motley assortment of 
consumer goods rushing through a room on a billowing, bulging wave of 
newspapers or magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fully Furnished," at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, is the most 
recent of such installations. Constructed during a January residency at the 
museum, the sculpture consists of roughly 15 tons of surplus local newspapers, 
meticulously layered into what appears to be a fluid current momentarily 
stilled in the corner of a large, bare gallery. Tossed about in this swollen 
sea of paper are a grand piano, television set, tanning bed, sofa, surfboard, a 
statue of a horse and a kitschy painting of a nude woman. The raging torrent 
spews out of a faux baroque fireplace cracking under the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingering by Mach's hearth does little to warm the heart. Gradually it becomes 
clear that this waste-stream doubles as society's bloodstream. Excess in, 
excess out. From high culture (the piano) to low (the pin-up girl), late 
20th-Century capitalist culture is a revolving door of material objects. Like 
Tony Cragg's playfully poignant sculptures made from plastic trash, and Bill 
Woodrow's metal objects de-junked, Mach focuses on the glut of goods that 
defines our lives. All three British artists temper despair over pollution, 
waste and greed with a sly sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mach differs in his use of objects that are not yet exhausted -- they are 
still clean, they can still claim some commercial allure. That, ultimately, is 
what makes "Fully Furnished" so fascinating and perversely beautiful. It 
attracts and repels simultaneously. The flip-side of the grand is the 
grotesque, and Mach manages to compress both extremes -- the dream and the 
nightmare -- into one spectacular sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Without this push-pull dynamic, Mach's other two sculptures are too easily 
reduced to sensational one-liners. In the wall-mounted "Untitled (Gargoyle)" of 
1991, a two-headed, fiberglass hermaphrodite gargoyle perches atop a television 
set, ready to hurl an immense brass chandelier at the viewer. "Mama's in the 
Pool" (1994) consists of about 1,000 clear glass bottles aligned in staggered 
rows. Certain bottles filled with dark liquid cumulatively read as the 
silhouette of a woman with arms and legs spread. Sexual vulnerability mingles 
with a vague violence in this haunting but unresolved work.

THEATER REVIEW; DRAMATIC OPERA HAS PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A world premiere dramatic opera that opened Wednesday at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre has had four years and generous grants to support its 
development, but co-librettists Julie Hebert and Octavio Solis have come up 
with a tale with scant relevance or interest to contemporary audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Very loosely inspired by Calderon de la Barca's 17th-Century Spanish play 
"Life Is a Dream," "Burning Dreams" tells the story of Rosaura, a 17-year-old 
adopted California girl who discovers in a dream that her biological mother 
died giving birth to her and a twin brother who also died. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the co-direction of Hebert and San Diego Rep producing director Sam 
Woodhouse, this passive story is plumbed for over two hours of operatic anguish 
in English and Spanish (the parents hail from an island off the coast of the 
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico). It's a slooooow evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame the performers -- kudos to the passionate and powerful vocal 
delivery of Alex Britton as the angry biological papa, Cheryl Carter as the 
doomed biological mother, Catalina Maynard as the luckless midwife, Anita De 
Simone as Rosaura and Rinde Eckert, fascinating as the grown, bald and 
babyish-looking dead twin in pink long johns. 
</P>
<P>
 The warm greens and golds and cool blues of Robert Brill's poetic set provide 
welcome, occasional relief to glazed eyes. Gina Leishman's modern music 
composition is haunting at times, well executed by Leishman and six additional 
on-stage musicians, but hard to separate from the banality of the story. 
Deborah Slater's choreography, John Phillip Martin's lighting, Mary Larson's 
costumes, Jeff Ladman's sound add to the piece's professional sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's nothing under the sheen. And that's the true tragedy of "Burning 
Dreams" -- so much talent is wasted. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; A WONDERFUL AND PECULIAR 'LADY FROM SHANGHAI'; ORSON WELLES' 
EXPLORATION OF FILM NOIR IS GRIMY, CYNICAL AND A LOT OF FUN. THE NEWPORT HARBOR 
ART MUSEUM SHOWS IT TONIGHT AS PART OF A WELLES RETROSPECTIVE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Lady From Shanghai" (1948) is a grimy, cynical thriller but it's also a 
lot of fun. Part of the kick: director Orson Welles' obsession with star Rita 
Hayworth. They were married at the time, and it's that clear he had the 
supernova hots for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles' camera -- always a simultaneously suggestive and revealing presence -- 
fairly leers at his lovely actress. The lens dives in for close-ups, then moves 
off to trail over her pinup body. It vamps Hayworth and she vamps right back. 
</P>
<P>
 This fascination is a tad crazed (and amusing) but it keeps with tradition for 
film noir, the genre Welles was exploring here; film noir always has fixated on 
beautiful, dangerous dames. "The Lady From Shanghai" is being shown tonight at 
the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 As Elsa Bannister, Hayworth first turns up riding in a carriage through New 
York's Central Park, an angelic light illuminating her face. Welles, as "Black 
Irish" Michael O'Hara, strides up out of nowhere and their eyes meet. The 
adventurer is hooked immediately, and the two form a lusty pact that creates 
both heat and major headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a wealthy lawyer with 
twisted legs (he scurries like a crab, with the help of two wickedly long 
canes) and a nasty heart. His partner is Grisby (Glenn Anders), a grinning loon 
with ulterior motives. Actually, everyone has ulterior motives in "The Lady 
From Shanghai," and O'Hara gets caught between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles' usual technical invention is everywhere, from the quick-jump editing 
and wide camera pans to the oddly compelling set designs. Some scenes are 
wonderful, some are merely peculiar. O'Hara's trial scene is so stylized and 
false that it's laughable; it's as if Welles had never been in a courtroom 
before. And O'Hara, the film's moral anchor, resorts to self-righteous speeches 
every now and then that are pretty silly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Welles (who wrote the screenplay based on Sherwood King's novel "If I Die 
Before I Wake") deflates these orations just in time with some biting, 
last-minute lines from Bannister and Grisby, no-nonsense villains who cut 
through all the high-minded glop. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there's the picture's famous finale: O'Hara, Elsa and Bannister 
meeting up for a brutal confrontation in a boardwalk Hall of Mirrors. As 
recriminations and bullets fly everywhere, all the mirrors shatter. Welles 
being brilliant, that's what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The second of four films in the Newport Harbor's Welles retrospective, "The 
Lady From Shanghai" will be introduced by Arthur Taussig, who teaches film 
classes at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and writes a newsletter called 
"The Film Analyst." 
</P>
<P>
 * Orson Welles' "The Lady From Shanghai" is being shown tonight at 6:30 at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. $5 ($3 for 
museum members, seniors and students). (714) 759-1122.

THEATER / RICHARD STAYTON; 'SCHIPPEL' PLUMBS THE FARCE FOR HILARITY AND DEEPER 
TEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words don't roll off the tongue: "Schippel, the Plumber." It's a lead-pipe 
title that clunks, a savvy show biz promoter's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd expect to find Schippel in the Yellow Pages; it's a name you'd picture 
on the door of a battered pickup, not on a theater poster. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens? California Repertory Company joins forces with the 
Goethe-Institut in Los Angeles to give "Schippel, the Plumber" its American 
premiere at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad. Now we're forced to recommend the lunacy to friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the awkward phone calls. "You gotta see 'Schippel.' It's a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Schippel!' 'Schippel, the Plumber!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "A plumber?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No! A farce!" 
</P>
<P>
 The play is by late British playwright C.P. Taylor, best known for the 1982 
Broadway play "Good." It's adapted from Carl Sternheim's Expressionist satire 
of upper-class pretensions, "Paul Schippel."  
</P>
<P>
 The year is 1914. We're in the city of Kassle, Germany. An award-winning vocal 
quartet has lost a tenor to the grim reaper and now must replace his sterling 
voice. Alas, the best available voice belongs to a plumber named Schippel (here 
played by Thomas Killinger). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do we care? Is this entertainment? 
</P>
<P>
 We do, and it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the old-fashioned structure, "Schippel, the Plumber" is often 
hilarious, occasionally inspired and always amusing. Applause must go to 
director Steve McCue, whose brisk pacing and intricate blocking create stage 
pictures reminiscent of silent movie slapstick. And applause must celebrate the 
superb cast's droll timing. 
</P>
<P>
 But credit must also go to a text that allowed Taylor to gently explore his 
preoccupation with the roots of Nazism. Schippel's low social status is 
compounded by the fact that he's "a bastard," according to the other singers. 
Such obscure origins clash with their belief that they represent "a new class 
of humanity evolving a higher class of men." 
</P>
<P>
 More than plumbing keeps the quartet from harmonizing. Anti-Semitism 
repeatedly strikes the wrong note. But the impending tragedy is muted, kept 
behind luxurious curtains and on a romantic balcony where a wanna-be Juliet 
fumbles with inept Romeos.  
</P>
<P>
 Worse than Schippel's profession is his intolerable love of the clarinet. Just 
when it's been decided that the bourgeoise is too good for "the filthy" 
plumber, a curious rescue changes everyone's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble has been shrewdly cast with an ear to individual musical talents. 
A piano becomes much more than a prop as it's played, repeatedly and 
beautifully, by the gifted comedian Kimberly Seder (portraying the lovely 
damsel pursued by clumsy males). She might fail at chopsticks, but Mozart? No 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A problem does exist, however, with Killinger's voice, which loses clarity as 
the long evening draws to a close. But Killinger's herky-jerky mannerisms 
splendidly project lower-class feelings of social inferiority, while his 
awkward struggles with a plumber's ladder prove the perfect metaphor for 
frustrated class ambitions. Above all, his singing -- like everyone's in the 
cast -- is lyrical and lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Jose Duran, Richard P. Gang and Jeff Paul are the snobs who can sing 
but can't tolerate difference. They fumble and stumble like a classic comic 
trio, unconsciously imitating each other in a kind of pack mentality that 
eerily anticipates the impending holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this title isn't so odd. "Schippel, the Plumber," meet "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Schippel, the Plumber" continues through March 5 at California Repertory 
Company, 7th & West Campus Drive, Cal State Long Beach. Performances are 
Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m., matinees at 2 p.m. on Saturday and Feb. 
26. $15. (310) 985-5526. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.

DANA PARSONS: RAINY DAY A PERFECT TIME TO DUST COBWEBS FROM BRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rain depresses me, but come to think of it so does bright sunshine. All of 
which makes it a perfect day for musing . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a more dynamic company in the country than Disney? Do they have a 
department over there entitled "Different Stuff We Can Do"? Even when their 
ideas are out of kilter, you have to give them credit for trying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Their Guns-for-Ducks tickets idea leaves me cold. Maybe those exchange 
programs do some good, but don't your instincts tell you they're kind of a 
farce? 
</P>
<P>
 * On the heels of that idea, however, Disney has announced a plan to set up 
youth hockey programs for kids from a couple of rough neighborhoods. A thumb 
way, way up for that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speaking of thumbs, what could Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert fame possibly 
have been thinking when he called "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective" one of the worst 
movies he's ever seen? Rog must have had his tight pants on that day; sure, the 
movie is silly and ridiculous, but that's the whole idea and it'll make you 
laugh. Most people in my theater sure were. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gee, I hate to say I told you so, but did you see that a state appeals court 
threw out the award for the Anaheim man who claimed his wife deceived him about 
love during their marriage? The justices rightly said the case had no place in 
court and was better left to advice columnists. I suggested in a column last 
April that bartenders would be the best sounding boards, but I'll defer to the 
court's vaster wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 * So the Orange County district attorney is sending the Christmas Day shooting 
of one sheriff's deputy by another to a grand jury, eh? For a case that was 
supposed to be open-and-shut, and without any of the standard ingredients for 
grand jury consideration, it's an odd move. Clearly, the D.A.'s office just 
thinks this is a potato that's too hot to handle. If they want to send this 
case to a grand jury, why not just establish a citizen review commission on 
police shootings and skip the middleman? 
</P>
<P>
 * Not a good week for the district attorney. The D.A.'s announcement that it's 
tossing this to the grand jury comes on the same day an appeals court chastised 
the office for its handling of another high-profile case, the Thomas Gionis 
matter. Gionis was the ex-husband of John Wayne's daughter, Aissa, and was 
convicted of hiring people to beat up her boyfriend. The appeals court 
overturned his conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the last couple years, I've heard people talking about how strong a 
candidate Kathleen Brown would be. Granted, I've only seen and read limited 
remarks from her as she cranks her bid for governor, but let's just say I'm 
still waiting to see those signs of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 * Would you believe Gov. Re-Pete Wilson? 
</P>
<P>
 * OK, so I'm a flip-flopper. My initial reaction months ago was lackadaisical 
to the idea that voters decide the future of the El Toro base. Then, seeing how 
wanderingly inept the public officials were on the subject, I warmed up to the 
idea of putting it on the ballot. Now, however, I'm cooling again, fearing that 
a special election like this would draw a small turnout and be heavily 
influenced by those with a back-yard interest in the base. And this is, for 
certain, a countywide issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * However, if it does go to a vote, the issue should be thumbs up or thumbs 
down on a commercial airport. That's the big-ticket emotional item with 
countywide impact. Putting that issue on the ballot by itself would focus 
attention on it. Then, if voters reject an airport, it would clear a lot of the 
dust away for public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD GUN EXCHANGE: Given the violence in the sport, I understand Anaheim cops 
are considering giving away free guns to any hockey player who turns in his 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
 * The only surprise I had after reading that convicted former legislator Paul 
Carpenter had fled the country was that more people don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * I read once that the shortest period of elapsed time was that between a New 
York City light turning green and the guy in the car behind you honking his 
horn. For me, it would be the time between hearing a Michael Bolton song on the 
radio and me reaching to switch stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * THIS JUST IN: "Disney Announces Plan for Theme Park on the Moon." "Don't 
worry about transportation," a Disney official said. "We'll find a way to get 
you there and get you back home." 
</P>
<P>
 * You've all seen the bumper stickers with things like, "My Child Is Student 
of the Month at Such-and-Such School." Perhaps I have a problem, but I like the 
one that says, "My Kid Can Beat the Crap Out of Your Kid."

CAR-POOL LANES ON I-10 COULD BECOME PERMANENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway -- a politically odious notion 
revived only as an emergency, post-earthquake measure -- could someday become 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, Mayor Richard Riordan and 
other city officials are urging the creation of permanent car-pool lanes on the 
nation's busiest freeway -- an action that would mean depriving solo motorists 
of one lane in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltrans officials introduced the notorious diamond lanes 18 years ago, 
the resulting outcry ensured that they -- and their counterparts across the 
nation -- added new lanes whenever they created car-pool lanes. Never again, 
officials had vowed, would they commandeer lanes. But the earthquake, some say, 
changed all the normal equations of today's commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the people of Southern California . . . are much more focused on their 
transportation, they realize it is a fragile system and that we have to make 
better use of it," Pena said. "This is almost 20 years later -- the congestion 
in the L.A. area is now at record levels, people are much more frustrated about 
delays, congestion and pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, discussions are still in the early stages. Ultimately, Caltrans 
officials would make the decision after surveying the affected communities and 
studying the environmental impact on the area -- which could take up to 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Pena and city officials have conducted a quiet campaign to 
establish permanent car-pool lanes. Mostly, the topic has been discussed behind 
closed office doors. But slowly, the idea has gained momentum and officials 
have begun more open talks. Tom Connor, assistant general manager of the city 
Department of Transportation, said the agency supports installing permanent 
car-pool lanes, "provided the usage grows to a point where it's justified." 
</P>
<P>
 To make car-pool lanes more palatable to commuters, the plan under discussion 
today for the Santa Monica Freeway would require a minimum of two passengers, 
rather than the three-person minimum required in 1976.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials -- still smarting from the whipping they took the last time 
around -- are steering clear of the topic, fearing the ensuing flap would doom 
its entire car-pool program, which would eventually create about 400 miles of 
car-pool lanes in Southern California. This network of car-pool lanes would be 
created by adding lanes to freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so strongly about the high occupancy vehicle system, that I am not 
willing to gamble with it," said Jerry Baxter, director of the local Caltrans 
district. "This community has to feel comfortable with (car-pool) lanes; if the 
(political leaders) insist that I take a lane away, I'll do it. But I don't 
think this is the time to experiment -- I would hate to think of losing the 
whole program over a test like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years ago, Caltrans reserved the fast lane in each direction on the 
Santa Monica Freeway for buses and vehicles carrying at least three people. The 
experiment generated so many lawsuits and outraged protests that it was ordered 
shut by a federal judge after 21 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was that the only defeat of car-pool lanes. After becoming aware of 
community opposition, Caltrans decided six years ago to reject a proposed 
car-pool lane on the Ventura Freeway. The decision cost the agency federal 
funding, and meant the state had to pay the full $22 million to open additional 
mixed-flow lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering the bitter legacy of the diamond lanes, Caltrans balked at 
installing car-pool lanes the entire length of the Santa Monica Freeway after 
the quake. Instead, they set up two-mile lanes so car-pool drivers faced 
shorter detours around closed sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that the biggest hurdle to establishing permanent car-pool 
lanes on the Santa Monica will be the same as it was years ago -- officials 
would have to take away a general-use lane.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich blasted the idea of converting the Santa Monica 
Freeway lanes, said an aide, Habib Balian. "In the past, this was an absolute 
failure." Some experts say they don't believe officials -- even with Pena's 
help -- will succeed in establishing permanent car-pool lanes on the Santa 
Monica Freeway. "Bureaucrats have long memories; they are not about to go out 
on a limb again," said Jim Sims, president of Commuter Transportation Services. 
 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that he would face a potentially heated battle, Riordan 
said he was considering several options, including installing the permanent 
car-pool lanes and making Pico and Olympic Boulevards one-way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, the westbound Santa Monica car-pool lane at its best has 
drawn about 1,250 cars in one peak hour; eastbound, 720. By contrast, as many 
as 1,800 cars take the temporary Antelope Valley car-pool lane in one hour.

STORM DAMAGE LESS THAN FEARED; RAIN: BARRIERS HOLD BACK MUD IN MALIBU. CSUN 
STUDENTS SLOG THROUGH MUCK ON QUAKE-RAVAGED CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The rains came and the winds blew -- snarling commuter traffic, setting off 
mudslides and unleashing a boulder that slammed into a woman's car -- but the 
damage from Thursday's storm was less than had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last week, when mud from hillsides stripped bare in last fall's 
devastating fires surged through homes in Malibu and buried streets in 
Altadena, the barriers built of sandbags, plywood, bales of straw and sheets of 
plastic did their job this time. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an inch of wind-driven rain hammered the fragile slopes above Malibu 
early Thursday morning, but most of the runoff was manageable. By late morning, 
the rain had begun to slacken, the sun was beginning to peek through and 
residents who had fled were returning to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds of Cal State Northridge -- furrowed during the earthquake and then 
churned to dust by heavy equipment during reconstruction work -- were reduced 
to a muddy bog by the drenching rains that struck before daybreak. Students 
slogged gamely through the muck to the trailers serving as temporary 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooded intersections and vehicles skidding out of control on slippery 
pavement turned the morning commute into a tangle of stalled cars and short 
tempers. Police said a 23-year-old Woodland Hills man was killed when his car 
skidded on a curve on Topanga Canyon Road and slammed head-on into another 
vehicle. His identity was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Clogged drains backed up water 2 feet deep on La Cienega Boulevard in Baldwin 
Hills, and the California Highway Patrol said at 8:45 a.m. that traffic on most 
Los Angeles-area freeways was moving at a crawl -- if at all. Rockslides closed 
a number of streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Malibu Canyon Road, a rock the size of a stove plummeted onto the top of a 
small car driven by Michelle Faircloth, 21, collapsing the roof to the top of 
the steering wheel and fracturing her right collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Faircloth, who was pulled from the wreckage by a friend who happened to be 
driving by, was treated at Westlake Hospital and released. She said she was on 
her way to work at Pepperdine University about 7:30 a.m. when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy snow fell in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains above 6,000 
feet on Thursday, to the delight of skiers and the dismay of Caltrans crews 
attempting to keep mountain roads open. Officials said about a foot of new snow 
accumulated at higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, where Pacific Coast Highway was blocked and 25 homes below the 
charred hillsides were invaded by mud last week, residents were better prepared 
Thursday, their houses protected with sturdy, makeshift barriers that diverted 
the cascading muck into runoff channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans crews used skip-loaders to scoop water and mud from a pond that grew 
but never overflowed above PCH at the base of Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeowners stood watch during the morning for the torrent that 
never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry McManus, wearing a plastic trash bag for a raincoat, waited in front of 
his four-unit apartment building damaged by mud Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stop it this time," McManus said. "We're doing more sandbagging and 
we're going to keep the flow moving with a fire hose." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of houses away, Randy Brant, 42, explained that he had left the doors 
on his garage open this time so that any mud seeping in one end could seep out 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd done that last time, everything would have been OK," said Brant, who 
lost a car, a washing machine and most of a set of golf clubs during last 
week's storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Brant drove a golf ball down PCH with a salvaged club while waiting 
for Caltrans to reopen the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing then was that my friends back east saw me tee off on TV and 
hit a car with a golf ball," Brant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents decided to play it safe on Thursday, leaving their homes as 
soon as the storm struck.  
</P>
<P>
 "After the fire, the earthquake, then this, I finally considered leaving for a 
while," said Linda Derussy as she loaded her dog, Sam, into a friend's Land 
Rover. She said she would be back as soon as the skies cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Knudsen, armed with a broom, watched and waited in front of the house on 
PCH that he had barricaded with a wall of sandbags three feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got hit pretty hard last time," Knudsen said before ducking out of sight 
to avoid a television cameraman heading his way. "I'm tired of being filmed in 
pestilence," said Knudsen, who was shown being carried to safety on a 
skip-loader during last week's floods. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 a.m. the rain tapered off and the sun began peeking through the clouds. 
The streams of water that had been pouring down hillsides and canyons slowed to 
a trickle, then stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, the combination of heavy rain and a patchwork of 
temporary and outdoor classrooms proved chaotic, yet manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is trying to be patient," said senior Janet Toma, 22, as she waited 
inside to find out if a sociology class that had been meeting outside would be 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the campus, the dirt around the trailers had become giant pools of mud, 
which proved too much for a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "How am I supposed to get to class?" asked senior Dolores Evans, 27, surveying 
the mire that separated her from her engineering class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not walking in that . . . not with my new rain boots on anyway," she 
said. "It's time for me to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the students decided to make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After an earthquake destroys literally your campus, who cares about a few 
inches of rain and a little mud?" said Michael Lee, a 19-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did last week, the fire-ravaged hillsides of Laguna Beach escaped 
serious mudslides, despite 0.87 of an inch of rain that flooded Laguna Canyon 
Road briefly and caused a short flash flood on Canyon Acres Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, a burst of wind about 10:30 a.m. peeled off the roof of a 
four-bedroom bluff-top home. The Newport Beach Fire Department arrived about 
five minutes later and nailed plastic over the home to protect the interior 
from the rain.  
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the forecast today called for partly cloudy skies with a 
chance of showers through tonight and a renewed chance of showers late Sunday 
and early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Thursday, 0.77 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles 
Civic Center, raising the season's total there to 4.14 inches, less than half 
the normal total for Feb. 17 of 9.71 inches. The rainfall season is measured 
from July 1 through June 30.

POLICE CONTROL HOLD MAY HAVE KILLED GUNMAN; CRIME: DAVID FUKUTO APPARENTLY WAS 
STRANGLED WHILE BEING SUBDUED AFTER HE SHOT TWO OFFICERS, SOURCES SAY. RECORDS 
SHOW THE ROBBER WAS HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police investigators believe David J. Fukuto, the gunman who killed two Palos 
Verdes Estates police officers during a robbery attempt at a Torrance hotel, 
may have died from "some sort of control hold" used by officers who subdued 
him, sources close to the investigation said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know (the cause of death) yet but he didn't die of head injuries," 
one source said. "That was eliminated. And what we are guessing is that it was 
some sort of a control hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto probably choked to death, the source said. Another source said Fukuto 
apparently died of strangulation while officers wrestled with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department, the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office, the county coroner and the Torrance 
Police Department, which is investigating the deaths of the officers and 
gunman, would not comment on the cause of Fukuto's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rarely comment about any facts of any matter that's under investigation," 
said district attorney's spokeswoman Suzanne Childs. At the request of the 
district attorney's office, autopsies conducted on Fukuto and the two officers 
-- Capt. Michael Tracy, 50, and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57 -- will 
remain confidential for 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Control holds are used by law enforcement officers to subdue combative people, 
typically by grasping them from behind, often around the neck in what is known 
as a chokehold. Chokeholds were in common use by police departments in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere until the 1980s, when public pressure over deaths tied to 
them led the Los Angeles Police Commission and other police agencies to limit 
their use to situations requiring deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Lt. Jeffrey Cameron, acting spokesman for the Palos Verdes 
Estates Police Department, said the small South Bay city has no policy that 
specifically precludes officers from using such control holds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practical terms, if you are trying to save your life, it is completely 
legitimate and legal to use whatever method that you can to save your life and 
that of other people," Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, records show that Fukuto had been experiencing financial problems, 
having delinquent credit card debts and owing the state Franchise Tax Board 
$4,062 in back taxes and penalties. In April, 1993, the state board placed a 
lien of $2,696 in back taxes on any property he might have bought in the 
future, $674 in penalties and $692.64 in interest and collection costs, 
according to records filed with the county recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators, however, said they did not know whether Fukuto's 
apparent financial woes may have led to his assault Monday on the Torrance 
hotel meeting room, where he shouted that he was conducting a robbery before 
opening fire on the two officers. The officers were among 13 Palos Verdes 
Estates employees attending a motivational seminar at the Torrance Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could figure that out. And I don't know that we ever will," 
Torrance Police Chief Joe De Ladurantey said. "We need someone to step forward 
and assist us in trying to make sense of the rationale, of his motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 An inventory of the police search of Fukuto's Mid-City home, filed in court 
Thursday, reveals the first details of the large arsenal of guns and ammunition 
that he kept in an upstairs bedroom.  
</P>
<P>
 Torrance police reported finding a cache of 13 pistols of various makes and 
models -- some in bags, some in briefcases and one in a holster -- along with 
three rifles and two shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of rounds of ammunition, both single bullets and full magazines, were 
stored in drawers, jars, pouches and boxes. Several receipts and purchase 
orders for weapons were found. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 Toyota Celica that Fukuto left parked at the Holiday Inn on the day 
of the shooting was also loaded with guns and ammunition. Inside were two 
pistols and an Uzi. There was plenty of ammunition, too, including bullets 
strewn on the floor and in the ashtray. A change of clothing, including tennis 
shoes and a sports jacket, also lay inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The warrant said that one of the two guns used in the attack was registered to 
Fukuto, but the other belonged to a high school friend, Takeshi (Tash) Nomiya. 
Nomiya refused to comment Thursday, but his parents said they were shocked that 
Fukuto might have his gun, because the two men have not seen each other in 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the affidavit to obtain the search warrant, police said they had already 
searched near a stairwell where Fukuto apparently planned to escape and found a 
backpack, which contained a police scanner, sunglasses, shoes and a sports 
coat.

TARZANA JOLT; SHAKING UNDER NURSERY IS AMONG STRONGEST EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For seven or eight seconds after the Northridge earthquake, the ground beneath 
the Cedar Hill Nursery in Tarzana shook as violently as almost any location 
anywhere in recorded seismic history. 
</P>
<P>
 It shook hard enough to send buildings airborne and hard enough to launch 
seismologists from around the world on a quest to explain what they consider to 
be one of the most puzzling aspects of the devastating temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are generally measured on the familiar scale of magnitude, but the 
tale of how the ground actually shook -- in what direction, how fast and how 
powerfully -- is told by hundreds of devices called strong-motion 
accelerographs deployed in buildings and in the open throughout the region.  
</P>
<P>
 One accelerograph, on a hilltop ranch once owned by author and Tarzan creator 
Edgar Rice Burroughs, recorded an up-down jolt of 1.82g or nearly twice the 
strength of gravity. Adding to the data's significance is the fact that the 
instrument was bolted into shallow rock, meaning that the reading was not 
amplified as it would have been if it had been located inside a building. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument also measured several spikes as high as 1.5g in all directions 
during a period of nearly eight seconds during the 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only were they the highest ground-motion readings from the earthquake, 
they were also among a handful of the highest ever recorded. Moreover, 
seismologists say that sustained shaking of that magnitude is unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, houses in the area sustained only minor damage -- cracks in walls and 
driveways and some broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying why the readings were so high, seismologists hope to better 
understand earthquakes as well as the forces they exert on structures of all 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's peculiar, and now they want to find out why it is peculiar," said Ralph 
Herman, whose family has lived on the ranch and nursery since 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 The readings have attracted experts to Herman's nursery from Japan, New 
Zealand, England and Africa. Seismologists, engineers and technicians from the 
U.S. Geological Survey and the state's Strong Motion Instrumentation Program 
have been there daily since they saw the abnormally high initial readings and 
have installed dozens of other accelerographs. They have also tested the 
instrument that took the first reading. 
</P>
<P>
 They used the additional instruments to measure ground motion from aftershocks 
as well as from artificially induced shear waves -- the waves of earthquake 
energy that cause the most damage. That work ended last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have ruled out an instrument malfunction and are confident that 
the accelerograph was properly anchored so that it measured actual ground 
movement rather than an effect caused by loose soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufus Catchings, a Geological Survey seismologist who is overseeing some of 
the testing, said a "very, very preliminary" analysis of the new data indicates 
that the high ground-motion readings were quite localized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear to extend very far from that site, so most of Tarzana 
itself seems fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further explanation will await the creation of a three-dimensional computer 
model of the local and regional geology and possibly years of analysis, said 
Tony Shakal, a seismologist who heads the state's strong-motion program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty of room for speculation and I'm sure there is a great deal of 
it going on," Shakal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question is why the ground under the ranch moved as much as it did and 
whether something there attracts or enhances an earthquake's energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakal's hunch is that the answer will be found in some quirk of local 
geology. He said the ranch is in an area in which the alluvial soils of the San 
Fernando Valley give way to the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains. A 
layer of siltstone is 19 to 33 feet beneath the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, "we don't know how much the unusual record . . . was due to 
the site and how much was due to the (strength or fault movement of the) 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the Tarzana site has been the focus of scientific 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the magnitude 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake in 1987, the accelerograph at the 
nursery recorded ground motion of 0.65g, which was stronger than what was 
picked up by instruments near the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists also studied the site after that quake and determined that it was 
stable and that the readings were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing unusual was seen there in other earthquakes, such as the magnitude 7.6 
Landers and magnitude 6.7 Big Bear quakes in 1992 or the magnitude 5.8 Sierra 
Madre quake in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists began measuring actual ground movement in 1930. During the Long 
Beach earthquake three years later, motion equal to one-third the force of 
gravity was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum ground-motion readings increased gradually with subsequent 
earthquakes, topping 1g for the first time at the Pacoima Dam during the 1971 
Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a record was set, Shakal said, seismologists were surprised and 
skeptical. He said the Tarzana reading "was a higher value than we had expected 
but recording the forces of ground movement . . . during actual earthquake 
shaking . . . is a new idea" in scientific terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest value of ground-movement readings is for earthquake engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 If engineers can predict ground movement, they can design buildings to resist 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil engineers say the high readings from several locations in the Northridge 
earthquake, including those in Tarzana, may cause them to reconsider how 
buildings, dams, freeway overpasses and other structures are designed. Ground 
Force Earthquakes are most commonly thought of in terms of magnitude, a general 
measure of a temblor's size. How the ground actually shook-in what direction, 
how powerfully and for how long-is measured by sensitive but relatively simple 
devices called strong-motion accelerographs. The readings show the relationship 
to the force of gavity. 1 G = a force equal to that of gravity. Newhall

WILSON OKS SPEEDIER WORK ON SOME BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under fire for his Administration's pace in safeguarding California's 
vulnerable freeway bridges from earthquakes, Gov. Pete Wilson on Thursday 
authorized the use of emergency powers to speed the work on some spans within 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I satisfied? I'm never satisfied," the governor told a news conference in 
Downtown Los Angeles. "I would like to see the work completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials said in interviews that the new authority will make it 
easier to hire outside engineers to help retrofit about 50 spans damaged by the 
Northridge earthquake. This amounts to about 8% of the 600 unrepaired bridges 
within the county that have been identified as vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," said James E. Roberts, chief bridge engineer for the 
California Department of Transportation. "We'll be able to reconstruct and 
retrofit these bridges simultaneously. . . . We hope to get more from him 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts had told The Times this month that he wanted emergency authority to 
retrofit all bridges statewide that have been identified as vulnerable to 
collapse during an earthquake. His boss, Caltrans Director James W. van Loben 
Sels, has said that such authority was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Wilson's action, officials said, retrofitting the structures with 
jackets of steel reinforcements would not be completed as quickly as the 
rebuilding or refurbishing of bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to extend it to the rest of the state," Wilson said at the news 
conference, a few hours before signing an executive order to speed the work. 
But the governor said there is uncertainty whether the procedures can be 
expanded to regions not directly affected by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's comments came in response to a Times article this week reporting that 
80% of the 1,313 bridges statewide identified as being vulnerable to 
earthquakes have not been fixed. In Los Angeles County, only four of the 10 
most dangerous structures identified by Caltrans have been retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than nine months until the November election, the safety of the 
state's bridge inventory has emerged as a campaign issue among Wilson's 
political opponents. They have accused the governor of slowing the program, in 
part by refusing to support a tax increase that would pay for expedited work. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Republican governor criticized his three major Democratic 
challengers. "Unlike those who have been so critical . . . who cannot wait to 
increase taxes, I recognize that the people of this state are already highly 
taxed, that they have been through a recession . . . and that they are 
experiencing, in this area, all the impact of that quake," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he sees no reason to temporarily raise any state tax to pay 
for the work on an accelerated basis. The governor instead is supporting 
placing a bond issue on the June ballot that would raise about $1 billion. He 
also said that he would support diverting money from other highway projects to 
pay for retrofitting the remaining 1,056 bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he believes that "all of the high-risk bridges have been 
retrofitted." However, records show that many of the most seismically 
vulnerable bridges have not been safeguarded. Of the 716 bridges designated for 
retrofitting in Los Angeles County, design engineering work has not begun on 
293 spans. None of the state's toll bridges has been retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor attributed the slow pace of retrofitting bridges that have 
clusters of columns, known as "multiples," to the need for extensive laboratory 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including state Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L. 
Kopp, (I-San Francisco), say there is not enough money to retrofit all bridges 
and that a temporary tax increase is imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor, sooner or later, has to tell the people of California the 
truth: We need the money for retrofitting and we need that money dedicated 
exclusively for retrofitting," Kopp said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also said he is urging the state Legislature and President 
Clinton to defer penalties for quake-disrupted individuals and businesses who 
may have difficulty filing timely income tax returns.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the union that represents 7,000 Caltrans engineers and architects 
said Wilson and the Legislature are responsible for delays in the retrofit 
program. "It's a matter of priorities," said Bruce Blanning, executive 
assistant for Professional Engineers in California Government. "The speed of 
that program has been determined by political decisions."

UC REGENTS AGREE TO REVIEW MILKEN DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from two state senators, the UC Board of Regents on Thursday 
asked for a re-examination of a controversial contract that allows fallen junk 
bond king Michael Milken to receive 95% of the profits from sales of his 
videotaped class at UCLA last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 How long the contract review will take, however, is unknown. Although several 
regents appeared willing to rescind the contract -- one suggested asking Milken 
to cancel the deal -- the board agreed at the request of UC President Jack 
Peltason to defer the issue for study. 
</P>
<P>
 Milken's involvement in an MBA finance class on the Westwood campus has been 
an undying controversy for UCLA, which faced national ridicule in November in a 
series of "Doonesbury" comic strips about the Milken classes. On Thursday, the 
subject sparked lively debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regents supported the Milken arrangement as an extension of academic 
freedom while another regent said it angered alumni and harmed public 
perception for the university to be in a contractual arrangement with a 
"high-profile crook" who shows no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving time for six securities violations, Milken co-taught 10 
three-hour lecture classes at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management. 
Guest speakers included Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and 
some figures from Milken's junk-bond past. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the class, UCLA signed a contract that allowed Milken's new 
Educational Entertainment Network (EEN) to sell videotapes of the session to 
other universities and interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Sens. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) criticized Milken's teaching stint as unethical and blasted terms 
of the contract that allow Milken's network to use UCLA's name for marketing 
but give primary control over the enterprise to the firm. After deductions for 
production costs, Milken's network would give UCLA only 5% of the proceeds, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Milken an "unrepentant felon," Johnston and Kopp charged that UCLA was 
duped by a financier whose sole interest was to use the school's reputation to 
rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the public. They also said UCLA officials 
were seduced by Milken's contributions to the Westwood campus -- more than $3.3 
million, including $40,000 shortly before the contract was finalized, according 
to records. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that in this functional equivalent of a 'junk-bond deal,' 
Milken winds up with the 'deal' and the university winds up with the 'junk,' " 
Johnston said. "He gets to use UCLA's logo and good name in order to exploit 
the management school for his purposes. For all this, the university gets 
peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young bristled over insinuations that his school 
had sold out. "Somehow the notion that this (deal with Milken) is a payoff, to 
the extent that is implied, should be discounted out of hand," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young traced the evolution of the deal, saying the business school began 
negotiating with Milken last spring and the contract was signed by a campus 
business school official. The $40,000 contribution noted by Johnston was given 
to help defray costs of the class, and Young said he considered the terms of 
the contract "boilerplate" language. 
</P>
<P>
 Young acknowledged, however, that UCLA's percentage of the proceeds might have 
been better than the 5%, explaining that the contract was negotiated under 
"time pressures" and while the administration at the business school was 
undergoing a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Peltason said that interfering with the selection of controversial 
speakers such as Milken would compromise the cherished standard of allowing 
faculty members to choose their own texts, fashion their own courses and invite 
provocative speakers to stimulate student intellectual development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Regent William T. Bagley, a former legislator, differed with Young's 
characterization of the contract, saying that its terms were "curious." 
</P>
<P>
 David Flinn, a San Francisco attorney who is the regent-designate for alumni, 
sided with the senators by saying that the University of California lives in a 
fishbowl and that its reputation is damaged "the day we bring a high-profile 
crook to teach at our university." 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding the argument over academic freedom, Regent John G. Davies made a 
motion to "approach Mr. Milken and say, 'This commercial arrangement creates a 
problem for us. We'd like to get out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davies was forced to withdraw the motion because such a governmental action 
requires at least 10 days public notice. Peltason also said he would prefer to 
have his staff review the Milken deal and other contracts and present a report 
to the regents, perhaps in time for their March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of any immediate action left Johnston and Kopp unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That motion became mush by the time the president and his like-minded regents 
were through with it," said Kopp, a frequent critic of the university system. 
"How many contracts does the university have with an ex-con whom the SEC won't 
allow to practice his profession?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Regent Harold M. Williams -- who has been the dean of the 
Anderson school and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission -- said 
Milken had paid his debt to society.  
</P>
<P>
 The wrangling over Milken and his contract threw off schedule what was 
supposed to be a full-day session to agonize over the future of the nine-campus 
system. In a series of retreats and position papers, UC officials have been 
exploring ways to meet the goal of keeping the university's quality among the 
best in the nation while operating on less money and serving an onslaught of 
new students. 
</P>
<P>
 The options laid before the regents in reports included the drastic step of no 
longer automatically admitting those among the top 12.5% of the state's 
graduating high school seniors, as is now required under the state's 1960 
Master Plan for Higher Education.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; 3 TO BE 
ARRAIGNED TODAY IN BANK ROBBERY, SIEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three suspected robbers who held a Long Beach bank under siege for nine hours 
Wednesday while four female bank employees hid inside face arraignment today on 
felony robbery charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Young, 18, of Los Angeles and two teen-agers were found hiding in 
air-conditioning ducts or on a ventilation shaft about 9 p.m. Wednesday, 
Officer Margarita DeWitt said.The four hostages had locked themselves safely in 
the vault during the incident and were rescued by a Long Beach SWAT team using 
flash-bang grenades to storm the bank at 5:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that Young and the two youths, who are 16 and 17, vaulted bank 
tellers' counters about noon Wednesday, beginning a standoff that lasted until 
after 9 p.m. and virtually shut down the bustling business district at Pacific 
Coast Highway and Ximeno Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Young is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail and the teen-agers, whose names 
were not released because of their ages, are in a juvenile hall, DeWitt said. 
All three are from Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-HUSBAND IDENTIFIED 
AS KILLER IN 3 SLAYINGS, SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 58-year-old Alhambra man used a 12-gauge shotgun to kill his divorced wife, 
the couple's 12-year-old son, the woman's boyfriend and himself, sheriff's 
investigators confirmed a day after the bodies of all four were discovered in a 
small home in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Eugene Larsen, a former Pasadena insurance agent whose ex-wife, Jane 
Larsen, 49, had secured a restraining order against him, brought the weapon to 
the house the day after Valentine's Day, Fidel Gonzales, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen killed his ex-wife, their son, Benjamin, and his ex-wife's boyfriend, 
Michael O'Brien, 43, with the shotgun before shooting himself in the chest. A 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun also recovered in the home had not been 
fired, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Larsen, whom friends said feared her former husband's violent temper and 
knew he carried weapons, had requested the restraining order from Pasadena 
Superior Court on Nov. 12, 1991. But the document was not on file with the 
South Pasadena or Pasadena police departments, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court doesn't notify us about the orders," South Pasadena Police Sgt. 
Mark Miller said. "People are told that at court and it says it right at the 
top of the form." 
</P>
<P>
 Those obtaining a restraining order are responsible for notifying local police 
departments in order to get the protection they sought in court, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Larsen's attorney, Annabelle Dahl, declined to comment on whether police 
had been notified of the restraining order, saying only that she had done her 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Jane Larsen obtained a court order Dec. 12, 
1991, that prohibited her husband from coming within 100 feet of the family 
home, at that time in Pasadena. In the court documents, Larsen said her husband 
left the home July 1, 1991, and returned Nov. 10, forcing her to let him spend 
the night. Jane Larsen said she spent the night in fear, locked in the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, also called a "keep away order" is secured at no cost by victims of 
violence or those who are threatened by violence. It lasts for three years, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police can arrest those who violate the order, Miller said. A first-time 
violation is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in County Jail and a 
$1,000 fine. New laws effective this year make a second violation a possible 
felony, punishable by up to three years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines, 
said Sean Gallagher, a prosecutor with the district attorney's domestic 
violence unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of restraining orders are issued annually, mainly to protect women 
from men. The orders work well in stopping some men from committing violence, 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "Even if the order had been filed, it wasn't going to do 
anything for (Jane Larsen). If he was intent on killing them, I don't think a 
restraining order would weigh real heavy on his mind." VICKI TORRES

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BEATING 
CHARGES AGAINST 2 EX-OFFICERS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Thursday dropped charges against two former Baldwin Park police 
officers whose trial charging them with beating a suspect ended with a hung 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jan Pluim rejected a request by the 
prosecution to retry Kenneth Shearen, 39, and Louis Price, 30.Their trial ended 
Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and assault under color 
of authority in an incident involving burglary suspect Gilbert Gutierrez. 
Shearen also had been charged with filing a false police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys argued that Gutierrez's injuries were not as serious as they 
would have been if he had been hit 15 times with the officers' batons and 
flashlights, as he had alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers Howard Price and Darryl Munger argued that Gutierrez was injured when 
he fell off a roof and was wrestled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against the former officers stem from a Feb. 11, 1991, robbery of 
a Texaco Food Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began after an officer who had been at the scene read police 
reports indicating that Gutierrez had fallen off a roof. The officer told his 
supervisors about the discrepancy in the description of what had happened. 
Price later resigned and Shearen was fired after an administrative hearing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE; SCHOOL 
EMPLOYEE SUSPECTED IN ALLEGED CHECK FORGERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Leuzinger High School employee is under investigation in the alleged forgery 
of a series of checks totaling $14,078.91 and withdrawal of money against the 
school's student body account. 
</P>
<P>
 Centinela Valley School Supt.Joseph M. Carrillo said the district was alerted 
to the withdrawals early in January when Union Bank returned a check for 
$6,621.58 for insufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The check had been drawn against school trust funds and deposited into the 
personal account of Leuzinger High School student store clerk Jeff Kern, bank 
officials told the school district. The district immediately placed Kern on 
leave and hired an accounting firm to audit the store account. 
</P>
<P>
 An audit by the accounting firm of Vavrinek, Trine, Day & Co. found that 
signatures on eight checks totaling $23,863.91 probably had been forged. 
Despite the fraudulent signatures on some of the checks, auditors said, $9,785 
of that amount was spent on legitimate disbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been referred to the sheriff's forgery and fraud unitfor 
investigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
EX-COUNCILMAN BERNARDI, 81, SUFFERS HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former San Fernando Valley Councilman Ernani Bernardi suffered a heart attack 
Thursday morning as he was being treated for unrelated health problems at a 
Panorama City hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old saxophonist-turned-politician is in guarded condition at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center's cardiac care unit, said hospital spokeswoman 
Magdalena Beltran-del Olmo.She said it was too early to tell how serious the 
attack was or to make a prognosis for his recovery. Bernardi was admitted to 
the hospital last Friday for treatment of other health problems, but 
Beltran-del Olmo said Bernardi's family requested that no additional 
information be released. 
</P>
<P>
 However, friends and former colleagues said Bernardi has appeared frail and 
sickly since his wife of 60 years, Lucille Bernardi, died in October after a 
lengthy bout with Alzheimer's disease. They said he was being treated at the 
hospital for an unspecified prostate problem.

APPEALS COURT REJECTS JUDGE'S LIBEL LAWSUIT; MEDIA: RULING AGAINST FORMER 
PRESIDING JURIST CITES LONG TRADITION OF SATIRIZING THE JUDICIARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presiding judge was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a memo on Los Angeles Superior Court letterhead no less, he was 
pompously describing himself as "a judicial officer with august status" who was 
suspending "the election of my successor until such time as I determine it to 
be appropriate to hold such election." 
</P>
<P>
 The memo was phony, circulated in July, 1992, as a joke by the Metropolitan 
News-Enterprise, a 2,000-circulation legal newspaper embroiled in a 
long-running battle with then-Presiding Superior Court Judge Ricardo A. Torres 
-- a judge it had once called a "despotic twit." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres did not laugh. He sued for libel, among other things. The newspaper 
sought to have the libel allegation thrown out, and appealed when a judge 
refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, an appellate court agreed with the newspaper, ruling that the 
phony memo was an obvious parody and ordering that the libel portion of Torres' 
suit be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Pickwick Papers of the 1830s to Colorado of the 1890s to Monty 
Python of the early 1970s, judges and the judiciary have been fair game for 
satirists," Presiding Justice David G. Sills wrote for the 2-1 majority on the 
4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 If the basis of humor is exaggeration, Sills wrote, "the formality (and, no 
doubt on too many occasions, outright pomposity) of judges and legal 
proceedings . . . provide rich ground for mockery and parody." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's conflict with Torres can be traced to its aggressive coverage 
of his tenure as presiding judge, News-Enterprise Co-Publisher Roger Grace said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torres threatened our general manager with economic retaliation if we didn't 
reform our coverage to his liking," Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Torres informed the court's administrative staff, 234 judges and 60 
commissioners, that the county would pay for only one subscription to a legal 
publication. Most selected the Daily Journal, a larger competing legal 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace said the loss cost his paper $34,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were peeved," Grace said. "We lost $34,000. We thought it interfered with 
our freedom of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace said he tried "hard-hitting, straightforward commentary, but that didn't 
work." While sitting in his rocking chair one Saturday afternoon, he said, he 
was inspired to write the offending memo. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he showed it to his wife, and they agreed that "no judge on the court 
would take it seriously. This memo was to caricature Torres. We thought it was 
an obvious parody." 
</P>
<P>
 Three News-Enterprise staffers were sent to the courthouse to distribute the 
mock memo to other Superior Court judges, Grace said, but Torres heard about it 
and had bailiffs bring the newspaper employees to his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable that Torres had these women interrogated," Grace said. 
"We had no idea they were being put in any kind of jeopardy (by distributing 
the memo). I knew the guy was a jerk, but I didn't know he was a sadist. He 
brought contempt charges against these women." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper sued Torres, and Torres countersued, accusing the newspaper of 
libel, fraud, deceit and false impersonation. The impersonation allegation is 
still pending. Torres could not be reached Thursday for comment.

UC JUGGLES BUDGET TO ADD $3.5 MILLION FOR SEISMIC WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling the Northridge earthquake a wake-up call, University of California 
officials said Thursday that they are juggling their construction budget to 
allot $3.5 million for additional seismic retrofitting, including three 
buildings at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's magnitude 6.8 temblor caused damage to UCLA's Royce Hall, a 
landmark structure, and prompted some critics to say UC officials have been 
slow to seismically retrofit dozens of buildings that have been known as 
potential earthquake deathtraps since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 UC administrators said the Legislature has been stingy with money for seismic 
retrofitting and said they must also worry about building enough classrooms for 
their burgeoning student population. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials changed their priorities by deferring plans for three 
capital projects -- including construction of a southern regional library at 
UCLA -- so additional seismic work could be put on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, UC officials want to accelerate five retrofitting projects, among them 
UCLA's Royce Hall, Kinsey Hall and the School of Dentistry building. The Hearst 
Memorial Mining Building at UC Berkeley and 10 wood-frame structures at UC San 
Diego were also listed. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Baker, UC vice president for university and external relations, 
said administrators are hoping that the $26 million needed to repair and 
retrofit Royce Hall -- originally not in line for such work until 1996 -- will 
come from the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

STORM CAUSES ACCIDENTS, SMALL SLIDES; WEATHER: MORE THAN AN INCH FALLS ON THE 
VALLEY. ONE MAN DIES IN A COLLISION, AND QUAKE- WRACKED CSUN IS TURNED INTO A

 A powerful Pacific storm dumped more than an inch of rain on the San Fernando 
Valley on Thursday, triggering dozens of traffic accidents and minor landslides 
and transforming the quake-crippled Cal State Northridge campus into a muddy 
bog. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Woodland Hills man died as a result of the rains when he lost 
control of his speeding car and collided head-on with an oncoming vehicle on 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard about 9 a.m., said Los Angeles Police Officer Theresa 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no estimate of the number of rain-related traffic accidents, except 
that there were many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is no different than any other day when it rains," said Sgt. Paul 
Modrell of the LAPD's Valley traffic division. "On rainy days, it seems we 
can't put enough officers on the streets for all the fender-benders." 
</P>
<P>
 In another accident on Malibu Canyon Road, 21-year-old Michelle Faircloth of 
Calabasas narrowly escaped serious injury when a boulder the size of a kitchen 
stove fell onto the roof of her compact car about 7:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend, Paul Barton, who was driving about 100 feet in front of her 
because the road conditions were so poor, pulled her from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking in my rear-view mirror and I saw her lights shut off and I knew 
something was terribly wrong," Barton said. "I sprinted to her car, and when I 
got there I thought she was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 She was "very lucky . . . to be alive," California Highway Patrol Officer Dave 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faircloth, a senior at Pepperdine University, was treated at Westlake Medical 
Center for a broken collarbone and released but sought another medical opinion 
and underwent surgery at West Valley Hospital and Health Center later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Antelope Valley Freeway near San Fernando Road, a semi-trailer truck 
slid out of control and its trailer overturned about 10:30 a.m., blocking 
southbound traffic for nearly 90 minutes, CHP Officer Bill Granados said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain-drenched earth churned from reconstruction efforts at CSUN, which was 
devastated one month earlier by the magnitude-6.8 Northridge earthquake, 
reduced the 353-acre campus to a muddy mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most students and teachers seemed to take another day of difficulty in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was leaking this morning, but the students did all right," said Carlos 
Guerrero, a part-time Chicano studies instructor who taught a morning class in 
one of the hundreds of portable modular classrooms that have been set up 
throughout the campus to temporarily replace damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero said he saw a woman slip and fall in the mud while walking across the 
campus but added, "She got up laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some, the rain was the final straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "How am I supposed to get to class?" asked senior Delores Evans, as she looked 
out onto the muck between her and the modular unit that serves as her 
engineering classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not walking in that . . . not with my new rain boots on anyway. It's time 
for me to go home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The downpour delayed by one day the assembly of several hundred more portable 
classrooms, but university officials expect the work to be completed by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were able to protect rare books and other materials at the Oviatt 
Library by covering the roof with tarps, said Elliot Mininberg, CSUN's vice 
president for administration. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an inch of wind-driven rain hammered the fragile slopes above Malibu 
early Thursday morning, but most of the runoff was manageable. By late morning, 
the rain had begun to slacken, the sun was beginning to peek through and 
residents who had fled their homes were returning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, where the Pacific Coast Highway was blocked and 25 homes below the 
charred hillsides were invaded by mud last week, residents were better prepared 
on Thursday, their houses protected with sturdy makeshift barriers that 
diverted the flow into runoff channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans crews used skip-loaders to scoop water and mud from a pond that grew 
but never overflowed above Pacific Coast Highway at the base of Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeowners stood guard against the torrent that never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry McManus, wearing a plastic trash bag for a raincoat, waited in front of 
his four-unit apartment building that was damaged by mud Feb 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stop it this time," he said. "We're doing more sandbagging and we're 
going to keep the flow moving with a fire hose." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of houses away, Randy Brant, 42, explained that he left his garage 
doors open this time so that any mud seeping in one end could flow out the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd done that last time, everything would have been OK," said Brant, who 
lost a car, a washing machine and golf clubs during last week's storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Brant drove a golf ball down PCH with a salvaged club while waiting 
for Caltrans to reopen the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing then was that my friends back East saw me tee off on TV and 
hit a car with a golf ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents decided to play it safe on Thursday, leaving their homes as 
soon as the storm struck.  
</P>
<P>
 "After the fire, the earthquake, then this, I finally considered leaving for a 
while," said Linda Derussy, as she loaded her dog, Sam, into a friend's Land 
Rover. She said she planned to return as soon as the skies cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Knudsen, armed with a broom, watched and waited in front of the house on 
Pacific Coast Highway that he had barricaded with a wall of sandbags 3 feet 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got hit pretty hard last time," he said before ducking out of sight to 
avoid a television cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks I'm a victim -- I hate it," said Knudsen, who was shown being 
carried to safety on a skip-loader during last week's floods. "I have relatives 
in Colorado sending me photos of myself being saved."' 
</P>
<P>
 As they did last week, the fire-ravaged hillsides of Laguna Beach escaped 
severe mudslides, despite .87 of an inch of rain that briefly flooded Laguna 
Canyon Road and caused a short flash flood on Canyon Acres Drive at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, a sudden burst of wind about 10:30 a.m. peeled the roof off a 
four-bedroom bluff-top home. The Newport Beach Fire Department arrived five 
minutes later and nailed plastic over the home to protect the interior from the 
rain.  
</P>
<P>
 The main body of the storm moved east into Arizona and southern Nevada by 
nightfall Thursday, and forecasters expected today's weather to be partly 
cloudy with a chance of showers through tonight. The National Weather Service 
said skies should remain partly cloudy on Saturday with a renewed chance of 
showers late Sunday and early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Thursday, .77 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic 
Center, raising the season's total there to 4.14 inches, less than half the 
normal count of 9.71 inches for the date. The rainfall season is measured from 
July 1 to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rainfall figures as of 5 p.m. Thursday included 1.87 inches at the Santa 
Monica Pier, 1.81 in Torrance, 1.49 in Santa Ana, 1.21 in Woodland Hills, .86 
in Monrovia and .75 in Pasadena.

EARTHQUAKE / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SPAN RETROFITTING, CAR-POOL LANES GET A 
PUSH; TRAFFIC: PERMANENT CORRIDORS ARE URGED FOR THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY, 
DEPRIVING SOLO DRIVERS OF ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway -- a politically odious notion 
revived only as an emergency, post-earthquake measure -- could someday become 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, Mayor Richard Riordan and 
other city officials would like to see creation of permanent car-pool lanes on 
the nation's busiest freeway -- an action that would mean depriving solo 
motorists of one lane in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltrans officials introduced the notorious diamond lanes 18 years ago, 
the resulting outcry ensured that they -- and their counterparts across the 
nation -- added new lanes whenever they created car-pool lanes. Never again, 
officials had vowed, would they commandeer lanes. But the earthquake, some say, 
changed all the normal equations of today's commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the people of Southern California . . . are much more focused on their 
transportation, they realize it is a fragile system and that we have to make 
better use of it," Pena said. "This is almost 20 years later -- the congestion 
in the L.A. area is now at record levels, people are much more frustrated about 
delays, congestion and pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, discussions are still in the early stages. Ultimately, Caltrans 
officials would make the decision after surveying the affected communities and 
studying the environmental impact on the area -- which could take up to 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Pena and city officials have conducted a quiet campaign to 
establish permanent car-pool lanes. Mostly, the topic has been discussed behind 
closed office doors. But slowly, the idea has gained momentum and officials 
have begun more open talks. Tom Connor, assistant general manager of the city 
Department of Transportation, said the agency supports installing permanent 
car-pool lanes, "provided the usage grows to a point where it's justified." 
</P>
<P>
 To make car-pool lanes more palatable to commuters, the plan under discussion 
today for the Santa Monica Freeway would require a minimum of two passengers, 
rather than the three-person minimum required in 1976.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials -- still smarting from the whipping they took the last time 
around -- are steering clear of the topic, fearing the ensuing flap would doom 
its entire car-pool program, which would eventually create about 400 miles of 
car-pool lanes in Southern California. This network of car-pool lanes would be 
created by adding lanes to freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so strongly about the high occupancy vehicle system, that I am not 
willing to gamble with it," said Jerry Baxter, director of the local Caltrans 
district. "This community has to feel comfortable with (car-pool) lanes; if the 
(political leaders) insist that I take a lane away, I'll do it. But I don't 
think this is the time to experiment -- I would hate to think of losing the 
whole program over a test like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years ago, Caltrans reserved the fast lane in each direction on the 
Santa Monica Freeway for buses and vehicles carrying at least three people. 
Although traffic flowed more smoothly, the experiment met a swift and painful 
end -- generating so many lawsuits and outraged protests that it was ordered 
shut by a federal judge after 21 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was that the only defeat of car-pool lanes. After becoming aware of 
community opposition, Caltrans decided six years ago to reject a proposed 
car-pool lane on the Ventura Freeway. The decision cost the agency federal 
funding, and meant the state had to pay the full $22 million to open additional 
mixed-flow lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, officials predict that the biggest hurdle to establishing permanent 
car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica will be the same as it was years ago -- 
officials would have to take away a general-use lane because the freeway is not 
wide enough to accommodate an additional lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is likely to become a vocal opponent, blasted 
the idea of converting the Santa Monica Freeway lanes, said an aide, Habib 
Balian. "In the past, this was an absolute failure. Taking away the lane really 
didn't help the flow."  
</P>
<P>
 Citing longtime, widespread resistance, some experts say they don't believe 
officials -- even with Pena's help -- will succeed in establishing permanent 
car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bureaucrats have long memories; they are not about to go out on a limb again. 
While the public may be ready, I don't think transportation officials and 
politicians are ready," said Jim Sims, president of Commuter Transportation 
Services. "Transportation officials think (car-pool lanes) are a good idea but 
they are gun-shy. Pena doesn't have to live here." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that he would face a potentially heated battle, Riordan 
said he was considering several options to help ease the flow of traffic, 
including installing permanent car-pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway and 
converting Pico and Olympic Boulevards into one-way thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of these things with a lot of political overtones. But these types 
of solutions are worth a lot of effort on my part," Riordan said. "The Santa 
Monica would be the most natural." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake downed portions of six freeways, transportation officials 
opened two emergency car-pool lanes, bypassing damaged areas on the Santa 
Monica Freeway and the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange. But 
remembering the bitter legacy of the diamond lane, Caltrans officials balked at 
installing car-pool lanes the entire length of the Santa Monica. Instead, they 
set up two-mile lanes so car-pool drivers faced shorter detours on a section of 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the westbound Santa Monica car-pool lane has drawn about 1,250 
cars in one peak hour; eastbound, 720. By contrast, drivers began car-pooling 
immediately on the Antelope Valley, near the I-5/California 14 interchange, 
where traffic has delayed drivers by as much as two hours. As many as 1,800 
multi-passenger cars take the Antelope Valley car-pool lane in one peak hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never carried that much before. Our eyes almost popped out," said Charles 
J. O'Connell, deputy district director at Caltrans. "But if ever there was a 
time to car-pool, it is now."

BERNARDI IN GUARDED CONDITION AFTER HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former San Fernando Valley City Councilman Ernani Bernardi suffered a heart 
attack Thursday morning as he was being treated for unrelated health problems 
at a Panorama City hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailing 81-year-old saxophonist-turned-politician is in "guarded condition" 
at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center's cardiac care unit, said hospital 
spokeswoman Magdalena Beltran-del Olmo. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was too early to tell how serious the attack was or to make a 
prognosis for his recovery. Bernardi was admitted Feb. 11 for treatment of 
other problems, but Beltran-del Olmo said Bernardi's family requested that no 
additional information be released. 
</P>
<P>
 However, friends and former colleagues said Bernardi has appeared sickly since 
his wife of 60 years, Lucille Bernardi, died in October after a bout with 
Alzheimer's disease. They said he was being treated at the hospital for an 
unspecified prostate problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Fant, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn. and a close 
political ally, said Bernardi's family told her that the heart attack was very 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, who became the longest-serving council member, has also been the 
city's fiercest foe of community redevelopment programs, which he views as 
wasteful. In fact, he sued the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday over a community redevelopment program that he has spent years 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit accuses the board of violating state open-meeting laws when it 
held a closed-door session in December to discuss lifting a spending cap on a 
downtown redevelopment project. Bernardi has filed a similar suit against the 
city of Los Angeles for private meetings that two city panels held on the same 
subject in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Fant said that despite his health problems, Bernardi has continued to be a 
devout advocate for eliminating wasteful spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, who represented the East Valley, was elected to the City Council in 
1960. He retired in June.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; QUAKE JOLTS FACILITIES, ENROLLMENT AT PIERCE 
</P>

<P>
 The men's gym at Pierce College will likely remain closed until next semester, 
while the women's gym and library on campus may reopen within about a month, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although overshadowed by the havoc at Cal State Northridge, earthquake damage 
at Pierce College in Woodland Hills caused a four-day delay of the start of the 
spring semester, with about $2.1 million of damage to the gyms, library and 
five classrooms, making Pierce the hardest hit of the Los Angeles community 
colleges, said Pierce President Lowell Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The southeast wall of the men's gym is bowed and must be rebuilt, Erickson 
said. The women's gym and library suffered minor damage to ceiling supports and 
tiles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Final damage estimates have not been made, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 physical education and other classes have been moved to other 
classrooms or held outside. The only class canceled because of the earthquake 
was an evening volleyball course. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake also rocked the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that a lot of our students were affected in their housing and where 
they work," Erickson said. "We had many people who withdrew their registration 
money because that was suddenly all they had to live on." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment dipped by more than 2,000 students from last spring to 14,663, said 
William Norlund, vice president of academic affairs at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, we pick up a lot of students during the first two weeks of the 
semester," Norlund said. "That didn't happen at all this semester. We have more 
students dropping classes than adding them." 
</P>
<P>
 That does not bode well for future semesters at Pierce, since budget 
allocations from the district are based in part on enrollment changes and state 
funds are granted per student, Norlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, before the earthquake the school learned that more than 
$1 million in cash promised for accepting topsoil from the adjacent Warner 
Ridge would not be coming in because of the financial problems of the 
property's developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're operating on a deficit budget this semester," Norlund said. "And we're 
not looking at a good year next year." KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LEGAL AID STAFF VISITS SHELTERS TO HELP VICTIMS CALL IT 
LAWYERS ON WHEELS.

 San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services has been sending out vans of 
staff members to shelters and disaster assistance centers to help low-income 
earthquake victims with their problems tapping into relief programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that they care enough to come and find out what's going on," said 
David Shawn Perry, 21, an unemployed store clerk who described his problems to 
a paralegal from the Pacoima-based legal services organization at the Mason 
Recreation Center shelter in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who has been living at the Mason shelter since Jan. 20, told paralegal 
Craig Minami that he has had a difficult time getting back the security deposit 
on the Canoga Park house he rented, which was knocked off its foundations by 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. Perry also told of a delay in getting an inspector from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to confirm damage to the house, and the 
delay has held up receipt of a grant to replace lost personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Minami made an appointment with Perry to meet with a legal services lawyer at 
the shelter the next day about going to Small Claims Court to get back his 
deposit. The paralegal assistant promised to report Perry's FEMA woes to the 
legal services office, which has been collecting information about such 
problems and raising concerns with the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, lawyer Roberta Stovitz spoke in Spanish to a group of shelter 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first barrier is trying to understand an extremely complicated system and 
program," said Neal Dudovitz, executive director of San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services. "And there's no doubt that language barriers are a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the quake, the legal services organization prodded FEMA and 
state welfare agencies to put in place relief programs that were sensitive to 
the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the legal services organization complained to the state Department 
of Public Social Services about senior citizens and disabled people having to 
wait in line up to six hours to receive emergency food stamps, Dudovitz said. 
Partly as a result of the complaints, Dudovitz said program managers later 
allowed senior citizens and the disabled to bypass the main line. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; ART CONTEST TO DRAW ON FAMILY PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kids draw the darndest things. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon and muralist Manuel 
Velasquez found out when they started judging the Pacoima Pride art contest 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were asked to depict Pacoima in the future, children drew spaceships 
with people committing drive-by shootings. Well-rendered depictions of 
buildings also showed bullet holes. And too many of the young artists seemed to 
know liquor advertisements verbatim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, it's a lot of heavy-duty things," said Velasquez, who joined 
Alarcon in kicking off this year's contest at Haddon Avenue Elementary School 
on Thursday. "There was a lot of good things too, a lot of positive things," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the positive that the event sponsor, TransWorld Bank, hopes to show this 
year with the theme of "Family and Community Pride."  
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the contest receive cash prizes and have their art displayed in 
City Hall and the Los Angeles Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm particularly pleased they've selected that theme, because most of us here 
are Latinos, and as Latinos, most of us hold our families near and dear to our 
hearts," Alarcon told about 150 parents, teachers and students who gathered in 
the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in Pacoima, there are two families you can choose -- yours or 
the homeboys on the street," Velasquez warned. "If you can't give them love and 
support, they (gangs) will." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, four schools will participate -- Haddon, Pacoima Elementary, Mary 
Immaculate School and newcomer Vaughn Learning Center. Teachers will tailor 
their lesson plans around the contest, which runs through March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really into it," said Liane Clark, who teaches second- and 
third-grade students at Haddon Elementary. "It involves arts, science, social 
studies -- we bring everything into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had the top three winners for the second grade in her class last year 
and said she hopes to repeat the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-grader Santana Flores won third prize last year for drawing an answer to 
the contest-theme question: "How can I make a difference in my community?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I drew bears drinking water, someone helping an old lady cross the street, 
and a boy giving a girl an apple," she said. She was not so forthcoming about 
this year's endeavor, however. "I don't know yet," she insisted. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; RESIDENTS MAY GET OLD ZIP CODE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case of the purloined postal code may finally be drawing to a close in 
Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to persistent petitions from local residents, San Fernando Valley 
postal officials have recommended returning the 91332 postal code to Arleta -- 
taken away and merged with Pacoima's 91331 in 1968 -- and have passed that 
recommendation to state officials, said Terri Bouffiou, a postal spokeswoman in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's significant progress, because a local-level approval is necessary for it 
to go through," Bouffiou said. "We did a cost analysis and realized the cost at 
the local level is very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta resident John Maxon, who has fought to recoup the five-digit designator 
since 1970, was pleased at the news Thursday. "That's what I have been yelling 
for several years," he said. "None of the postal routes would have to be 
changed, and they could use the same building." 
</P>
<P>
 Why change the ZIP then? To Maxon and other civic boosters, the chance to have 
91332 appended to Arleta symbolizes the final act of independence from 
neighboring Pacoima. The two were divorced in 1968 -- oddly enough, around the 
same year that postal officials decided the two communities should share ZIP 
codes. Both have received mail under the 91331 code ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxon and the Arleta Chamber of Commerce claim Arletans get so peeved at the 
sight of Pacoima on their envelopes they simply throw them out -- even 
sacrificing their chances at big money in the Publishers Clearinghouse 
Sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxon and chamber board member Hawley Smith were set to go even further.  
</P>
<P>
 They were going to dump sacks of discarded "Pacoima 91331" mail on the 
doorstep of the local post office on federal income tax deadline day, April 15. 
It was going to be a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they will wait until regional and federal officials make their decisions, 
which could take four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get it, you're going to see a parade," Smith said. "It's going to get 
everybody excited. It's just impossible not to get excited." GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: MALIBOU LAKE; RESIDENTS HOT OVER BUILDING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spared by last November's devastating wildfires, residents of Malibou Lake are 
mad as blazes over a Los Angeles County building ordinance that intends to 
protect their mountain hamlet from future infernos. 
</P>
<P>
 Some don't think it goes far enough.Other think it goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides will have their say Wednesday when the Regional Planning Commission 
considers establishing a permanent community standards district that aims to 
balance fire safety issues with the rights of landowners to use their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary restrictions have been in place since January, 1993, but will expire 
this summer unless made permanent by county planners and the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners say the restrictions -- which govern how much of a lot a new house 
can occupy, ban street parking and require fire sprinklers -- do little to 
alleviate fears that they would be unable to escape the path of oncoming 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 They say their narrow, winding mountain roads will not handle any additional 
traffic and want the county to severely limit the number of new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But owners of vacant property complain that curtailing new construction would 
be a violation of their rights.  
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary meeting Tuesday night, fire officials told residents that 
they thought the new requirements would allow more houses to be built safely in 
the community -- something few wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will the county guarantee our safety?" one woman asked. "Will you have 
firetrucks coming in to save us? We're on our own up there. It's already 
overbuilt." AARON CURTISS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NEW ADDRESS FORMS SWAMP POSTAL SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waiting for your mail to be delivered to a new address? You are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Postal Service is receiving more than twice the average daily change 
of address requests in the San Fernando Valley following the Northridge 
earthquake, forcing postal workers into overtime at the main office on Sherman 
Way in Van Nuys to prevent processing delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the largest amount of change of address forms to go 
through the Van Nuys central forwarding unit," U. S. Postal Service spokeswoman 
Terri Bouffiou said. "Normally, they get 1,000 change of address cards a day. 
Right now, they are getting a little under 2,500 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Valleywide, there have been 50,000 requests for changes of address. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, it takes a letter or package three to four extra days to be 
forwarded from an old address to a new one, Bouffiou said. Despite the volume, 
she said, that delay is not expected to increase because the post office has 
added extra shifts to handle the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The area where mail delivery was most affected by the temblor is Northridge, 
Bouffiou said. Out of 32,500 homes, businesses and other places to deliver mail 
in Northridge before the quake, slightly more than 4,000 are no longer 
accessible because they were condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "One out of eight deliveries can't be made there," Bouffiou said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of these difficulties, Bouffiou said the Postal Service has decided to 
continue indefinitely the practice of holding mail at the local post office for 
people whose homes were condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier plan to discontinue the program after Feb. 11, she said, was 
scrapped because "we really have to be concerned about people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said it will be a long time before the dust settles in the post 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 "Only about 50% of the people who will move have come in to file the change of 
address forms," she said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY TO BUY LOT FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Housing Authority has agreed to spend $240,000 to buy a 
15,633-square-foot vacant lot for a proposed affordable housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Authority members voted 6 to 0, with Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian abstaining, 
to purchase property on West Vine Street from owners Antonio I. Esteban and 
Jose Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that it's a very good site for affordable housing," said Madalyn 
Blake, director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 No timeline for beginning construction has been set.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials are also expected to meet with the Salvation Army this month to 
discuss a possible joint venture in developing the Vine Street property. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army Capt. Floyd Bacon said Thursday that the site could be used to 
house people coming out of the Army's Booth House program, which provides 
shelter for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still in a proposed stage," Bacon said. "We're very, very excited about 
the prospects of it . . . and we're looking forward to working with the city." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will use redevelopment funds to pay for the Vine Street 
lot.TOMMY LI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; REPAIR COSTS FOR GOODE HOUSE STILL 
UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale officials have yet to determine how much it will cost to repair 
earthquake damage to the historic Goode House, which sagged onto the ground and 
shifted as much as four feet after its foundation collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Stochl, an administrative analyst for the city's housing department, said 
Thursday that city officials still are planning to restore the 1890s 
Victorian-style home at 119 N. Cedar St. as long as expenses do not increase 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on how much the cost is for doing the additional work" to rebuild 
the foundation and to lift the home back onto it, Stochl said. "If the 
(restoration) cost was doubled, we definitely would bring it back" to the 
Glendale Housing Authority for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Authority had set aside $400,000 in 1992 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolted by the Jan. 17 quake and its aftershocks, the Goode House finally gave 
way last weekend, officials said. The damage was discovered Saturday afternoon 
after neighbors reported hearing creaking sounds from the boarded-up landmark, 
slated to be turned into an office and recreation center for the disabled by 
early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A preservation consultant hired by the city to restore the home surveyed the 
collapsed foundation and determined that the building was still salvageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building is not lost," said Lawrence Winans, who runs his own restoration 
service in Downey. "We feel that the building can be lifted and put back to 
where it belongs and a new foundation system put under it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if aftershocks were to continue, "it can't topple over now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Housing Director Madalyn Blake told the Glendale Housing Authority 
that it would need to reassess the restoration costs for the building in the 
next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Winans has said repairs to the foundation alone would cost about $35,000. He 
is expected to meet with housing officials Tuesday to renegotiate a contract to 
repair and restore the historic building. 
</P>
<P>
 'We're doing the best we can to bring it forward," Winans said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goode House, named after former Glendale civic leader Edgar Douglas Goode, 
is to be restored as part of a 22,500-square-foot housing project with the 
Crippled Children's Society of Southern California Inc. TOMMY LI

BENHARD LAUNCHES BID FOR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN SEEKS TO OUST 
BEILENSON. HE URGES TAX CREDIT, NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Mark Boos Benhard kicked off his campaign to unseat U.S. Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson at a Woodland Hills rally Thursday, where he urged a $500 
tax credit for working families and a get-tough policy against illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, 28, for three years an aide to former Rep. William Dannemeyer, said 
he supports using the armed forces to patrol the U.S.-Mexican border and 
eliminating all benefits for illegal immigrants, including automatic 
citizenship, education and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, an Orange County Republican who is running for the U.S. Senate, 
endorsed Benhard at the event, and the pair are scheduled to appear together at 
another event in the Conejo Valley tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer praised his former aide Thursday -- saying the political climate is 
right to elect conservative Republicans like Benhard -- and criticized 
Beilenson as a tax-and-spend liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 people attended the event at the home of Mary Barrientos, who was 
appointed to the Los Angeles Housing Commission by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those in attendance are graduates of Riordan's 1993 campaign, 
including Todd Blair, Benhard's campaign manager. Others, like Darlene Woods, 
who identified herself as the leader of a John Birch Society chapter, and 
investor John Popp, are veterans of numerous conservative crusades, including 
Howard Jarvis' tax-reform movement and, currently, the campaign to recall state 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, who is Benhard's mentor, has long been a vocal critic of the gay 
lifestyle and a supporter of voluntary school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, who owns a public relations firm, reminded his audience that he was 
born and raised in the west San Fernando Valley, a distinction the other two 
Republican contenders cannot claim.  
</P>
<P>
 Also seeking the GOP nomination are Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park banking 
consultant, and Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. Hammer 
has lived in the area since 1985, while Sybert, a native of Whittier, has 
resided in the West Valley for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say my opponents are more liberal than I am, but I am no 
right-winger," added Benhard, who lives with his wife and three sons in the Oak 
Park area of the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Benhard said he supports a recent proposal to deny all but 
emergency aid to illegal immigrants who were affected by the Northridge 
earthquake, wants to see increased use of the death penalty, and opposes the 
recently enacted federal Brady Bill, which mandates a 10-day waiting period 
before the purchase of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard warned that Beilenson, who with reapportionment represents an 
increasingly Republican and Valley-based 24th Congressional District, has tried 
to change his tune to suit his new constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson talks a good game, for example, when it comes to immigration, 
but he doesn't follow through," Benhard said. Beilenson has advocated denying 
citizenship to infants born in the United States to parents who are in this 
country illegally.

GUARDSMAN CREDITED WITH SAVING LIFE OF CHOKING BABY; EMERGENCY: JASON BARTON 
AND A COLLEAGUE VISIT THE BOY AND HIS PARENTS A MONTH AFTER THE RESCUE AT A 
TENT CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Staff Sgt. Andrew Barajas and Specialist Jason Barton of the 
National Guard saw 3-month-old Jeffrey Barcenas was at a tent city at Lanark 
Recreation Center after the earthquake. The infant was convulsing and choking. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, nearly a month later, the two guardsmen saw a healthy -- and 
bawling -- baby boy in the arms of his beaming mother. 
</P>
<P>
 A pediatrician had just declared the infant fit and credited quick action by 
Barton on Jan. 23 for saving the child's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes everything I learned in the military well worth it," said Barton, 
23, an agent with an Upland mortgage lending firm who is in his first year with 
the Guard. "To see the child now, and see the difference from when we first saw 
him. . . .I'm just overjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 And Jeffrey's parents were grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they were there when we needed them," said the boy's mother, Erika 
Garcia, 20, as she held her son, who was dressed in a Cookie Monster shirt and 
wore Mickey Mouse booties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God and them," the boy's father, Efrain Barcenas, 25, said, and 
then hugged Barajas. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas and Barton, assigned to the Army National Guard's Company B 240 Signal 
Battalion out of Burbank, were putting up tents at Lanark Park six days after 
the Jan. 17 quake forced thousands to flee to the safety of the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after noon that day, Barton, who is Red Cross-certified in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and has taken emergency medical training classes, 
had just stabilized a child who had been suffering from a high fever and heat 
exhaustion. He was walking back to his unit when Barajas brought Jeffrey to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His face was reddish and he looked like he was panicking," Barton recalled. 
"He was choking on his own saliva." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother told Barajas in Spanish that Jeffrey had a cold and a cough from 
sleeping outside in the park since the quake, and that she had given the baby a 
small dose of adult cough medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that the infant was having difficulty swallowing, Barton picked up the 
child and held him in his arms face down. With paramedics en route, Barton put 
his little finger in the baby's mouth to clear it and allow the saliva to flow 
downward. He held that position until paramedics arrived and took the child to 
nearby West Valley Hospital and Health Center, where he was stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Garcia and Barcenas brought their child back to the hospital for 
a follow-up exam. Pediatrician Mojdeh Zafaranchi said Jeffrey was fine and 
should not suffer any aftereffects from his near-death experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have died within a few minutes if (Barton) had not cleared the 
baby's passageway," Zafaranchi said. "He did the right thing at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barton, who did not even know the child's name until Thursday, 
downplayed his heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just reacted as if it was my own kid," said Barton, the father of two 
children ages 3 and 2. "I'm just a citizen-soldier. It's part of the job to 
save and defend lives."

SUSPECT HELD IN INSURANCE FRAUD RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Hills man was arrested Thursday and charged with running a workers' 
compensation insurance-fraud ring that state investigators believe may have 
bilked insurance companies and doctors out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Phillip Fleder, 30, is charged with 56 counts of insurance fraud and 
19 counts of grand theft. He is expected to be arraigned today in San Diego 
Municipal Court and is being held in lieu of $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested was Paul Stanzione, 27, a claims examiner for Republic Indemnity 
Co. in San Diego. He is charged with 21 counts of insurance fraud and nine 
counts of grand theft, and is also expected to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 Each count of workers' compensation insurance fraud carries a maximum penalty 
of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged fraud scheme involved workers' comp bills submitted to Republic by 
Fleder's medical administration companies, Falcon Medical Services and Medical 
Specialist Group, both based in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, from May to December, 1992, Stanzione referred 
about 20 workers' comp patients covered by Republic to doctors working under 
agreements with Fleder's companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fleder's firms allegedly would create new, inflated bills with forged 
doctors' signatures to submit to Republic for payment or would submit 
additional phony bills to Republic, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanzione is accused of approving fraudulent bills sent by Fleder's companies 
without submitting the bills to the normal review process. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents state that Falcon Medical and Medical Specialist Group 
collected about $20,000 from Republic, none of which was paid to doctors. "But 
our investigators believe that the actual fraud ring that Fleder created may 
have defrauded other insurance companies and involved (other) adjusters not yet 
apprehended," said Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the state Department of 
Insurance, which aided the 13-month investigation. "The actual damage by this 
operation may run into the millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulz said it's also believed that Fleder defrauded doctors by withholding 
insurance payments intended for them. The doctors were not part of the fraud 
scheme, Schulz said, and many are expected to testify in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulz and Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Canning in San Diego declined to say if more 
arrests would follow. They said the investigation also encompassed activities 
of Fleder's father and business partner, Jules Fleder, who has not been 
charged.

GIRL FILES SUIT OVER FATHER'S DEATH AT JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 3-year-old daughter of a man who died of meningitis while he was an inmate 
at a Los Angeles County jail in Castaic sued the county and the Sheriff's 
Department on Thursday, alleging negligence and violation of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Betancourt, a 45-year-old inmate at the South Facility of the Peter 
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, died in February, 1993.The suit filed on behalf of 
Ana Marie Betancourt by her half-brother and guardian, Alexander Betancourt 
III, alleges that the Sheriff's Department denied her father medical care, 
resulting in his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to establish that there was a conscious or reckless disregard 
of his then-known medical condition," said Hermez Moreno, an attorney 
representing Ana Marie Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount 
of damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar suit was filed this month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Alexander 
Betancourt III -- Betancourt's son -- and the son's mother, Martha Betancourt. 
The mother and son have also filed a separate federal lawsuit alleging 
violation of civil rights in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials quarantined and gave antibiotics to more than 2,000 inmates 
at the jail's ranch facility in February, 1993, when two other inmate trusties 
were stricken with meningitis. It was not known when or how Betancourt of El 
Monte contracted the deadly virus.

4 INDICTED IN ROBBERIES THAT INVOLVED HOSTAGE-TAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted four Santa Clarita men Thursday for allegedly 
holding bank officers and their families hostage overnight and forcing them to 
open their banks' vaults under threats to their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Yepes, 25, of Valencia and brothers Chad Pelch, 23, of Saugus and Brett 
Pelch, 25, of Valencia were named as defendants in one of two indictments 
returned by a federal grand jury alleging conspiracy, armed bank robbery with 
forced accompaniment and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. They stem from the 
June 11, 1993, robbery of TransWorld Bank in Canyon Country in which bank 
officer Toula Demosthenous and eight others were held overnight by gunmen at 
Demosthenous' Canyon Country home. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar but separate indictment charges Yepes, Brett Pelch and Donald 
Sallee, 26, of Santa Clarita in the Sept. 17 robbery of a Coast Federal Bank 
branch in Northridge. Before that robbery, a group of gunmen invaded the Canoga 
Park home of bank officer Terry Duranso and held her and four others, including 
twin baby boys, hostage overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 In both robberies, gunmen accompanied each of the women to their banks and 
forced them to open vaults under threats to their own and their families' 
safety. Nobody was injured.  
</P>
<P>
 The robbers stole $107,689 from TransWorld and $107,449 from Coast Federal, 
according to court documents.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested Yepes and Chad Pelch on Feb. 5 in Las Vegas. The two men 
are scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 28. Meanwhile, authorities are searching for 
fugitives Sallee and Brett Pelch.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents previously arrested Darren Patrick Towers, 25, of Saugus in 
December as a suspect in both robberies after he confessed to an FBI agent that 
he had been recruited by a friend to commit a bank robbery that involved taking 
hostages, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers pleaded guilty to the same three counts facing Yepes, Sallee and the 
Pelch brothers.

ELDERLY MAN DIES AFTER DRIVING CAR INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An elderly man died late Wednesday when he drove his car into oncoming 
traffic, possibly after suffering a heart attack, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was not disclosed pending notification of next of kin, 
was backing his car out of a driveway on Burbank Boulevard just west of 
Sepulveda Boulevard at 10:40 p.m. and continued through two lanes of traffic, 
across a center divider and into another lane of oncoming traffic, said 
Detective Don Bellante of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have had a heart attack," Bellante said. "It has all the indications 
of that because of the driving and because of the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The man's car was struck by another vehicle, but suffered only minor damage. 
He was pronounced dead on arrival at Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center, 
Bellante said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is being performed to determine the cause of death, Bellante said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE HIRES CITY ATTORNEY IN COST-SAVING 
MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Palmdale, which has been using a Los Angeles law firm for legal 
services, has hired its first city attorney saying the move will save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Angil Jones, who has been city attorney in Turlock since 1989, will assume 
that office in Palmdale beginning April 1.Her annual salary will be $98,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the day-to-day presence of a city attorney will greatly benefit city 
operations," Mayor Jim Ledford said in a prepared statement. "We have been 
studying the costs of outside legal services for the past two years and have 
analyzed a five-year breakdown of legal billings. We feel the city will save 
money with an in-house attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, attended Immaculate Heart 
College and Loyola University School of Law. During her 18-year career as a 
lawyer, she has served as senior deputy county counsel in Fresno and chief 
deputy county counsel in Merced.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRANSIT SYSTEM REDUCES SCHEDULE ON HOLIDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley's public transit system will operate on a reduced holiday 
schedule Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority will run just four commuter buses, 
rather than the usual nine, to Downtown Los Angeles, and just three of the 
typical five buses will transport people to and from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, which is Presidents' Day, the local fixed-route service will 
run on a reduced schedule. The Dial-a-Ride service, which offers door-to-door 
transportation to seniors and the disabled, will operate at normal hours. 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA commuter buses, effective Monday, will also stop picking up passengers at 
the Target center in Palmdale. The buses will continue to stop at the Lancaster 
park-and-ride at 10th Street West and Avenue K-8 and the Palmdale park-and-ride 
at Avenue S and the Antelope Valley Freeway. SHARON MOESER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEACHER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO SEX ASSAULT ON 
COLLEAGUE; SANTA CLARITA: THE ALLEGED VICTIM MAY SUE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER 
ITS HANDLING OF THE CASE, HER ATTORNEY SAYS.

<P>
 An elementary school teacher and former sheriff's deputy has pleaded not 
guilty to charges he sexually assaulted a female colleague in a classroom in 
the school where the two work. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Keith Culhane, 35, entered the plea Tuesday in Newhall Municipal Court, 
where he was charged this week with felony counts of rape by a foreign object, 
sexual assault, and attempted forcible oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was released on $50,000 bail. If convicted of all charges, he faces a 
maximum of 10 years in state prison. A preliminary hearing is set for March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old alleged victim is considering a civil suit against the Saugus 
Union School District over its handling of the incident, her attorney said 
Thursday. Attorney Gary Paul contends that district officials were negligent 
when they allowed Culhane to return to work four days after he allegedly 
attacked a fellow teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put this guy back in the same school with her, which made her completely 
uncomfortable," Paul said of the district's action. "They were negligent and 
intentionally inflicted emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Troy Bramlett said the incident was dealt with "by the book," 
and in accordance with the school district attorney's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged attack occurred late on the afternoon of Nov. 5, a Friday, in a 
Santa Clarita Elementary School classroom after the students had been dismissed 
for the day. The woman reported the incident to school authorities the 
following Monday and the school put Culhane on paid leave for four days while 
the matter was investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett said disciplinary action was taken, but it was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was arrested after the alleged victim filed a criminal complaint with 
the Sheriff's Department on Jan. 14.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's attorney said that her first inclination was to report the alleged 
attack to police immediately, but that school district officials dissuaded her 
from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was led to believe that he would be removed from the school and that she 
would not have to face him," Paul said. "Now, the same people who talked her 
out of going to the police are trying to use the fact that she didn't against 
her."  
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was a deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
from January, 1982, to August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He was put on paid leave Jan. 14 from his teaching position pending the 
results of the criminal proceedings, Bramlett said.

 FERTILE GROUND: Volunteers are gearing up for the second phase of a project to 
restore native plant life to a fragile wetland. The Moorpark chapter of the 
Environmental Coalition is heading up the replanting project in the Arroyo Simi 
wetland. . . . "What we are trying to do is increase the native habitat to 
allow animals to thrive in this area," project manager Roseann Mikos said. . . 
. Last year, more than 200 volunteers removed grass that had been choking 
native willow and mule fat plants in the freshwater habitat.

 STAYING PUT: State officials have decided against relocating as many as 60 sea 
lions to the waters off Ventura County (B1). . . . The National Marine 
Fisheries Service had proposed the move to prevent the mammals from devouring 
steelhead trout at their Washington state spawning grounds. . . . Local fishing 
enthusiasts opposed the move, fearing that the ravenous sea lions would fish 
out county waters.

 SHOW TIME: An earthquake shut down the Fillmore Theater. And community 
opposition has put a proposal for a Camarillo movie house on shaky ground. But 
in Santa Paula, plans for a seven-screen theater have quietly sailed through

Santa Paula, Fillmore and Saticoy -- are anxious to have a place to go for 
entertainment," said Scott C. Wallace, president of Honolulu-based Wallace 
Theatre Corp. . . . The theater, at Harvard Boulevard and Main Street, could

 STILL NOT EASY: Though gay students at Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine see 
much to be improved, they generally give good marks to their schools . . . this 
according to a new book called "The Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Students' Guide 
to Colleges, Universities and Graduate Schools," published by New York 
University Press. . . . Gay students surveyed for the book at both colleges 
were unanimous that homophobia was a "serious" problem on their campuses. Yet 
the majority would recommend their schools to other gays. 
</P>
<P>
 HOMEWORK: The gay students surveyed have problems that go beyond campus: A 
majority at Cal State Fullerton -- and a high number at UC Irvine -- say they 
are openly gay on campus, but are not "out" to their parents. And most said 
that "coming out" was the most serious issue among gays on the campus. . . . At 
UC Irvine, 50% said they have been victims of hate mail, vandalism or verbal 
abuse. Another major problem for them: a lack of role models on their campuses.

 RIGHT PITCH: A star softball player at Trabuco Hills High, Linda Lunceford is 
now in her fourth year playing for Cal State Long Beach. But she's got a

starting pitcher for the San Diego Padres this year. She hopes to start a 
family and "be supportive" to Sanders' career. "I've known disappointment on 
the ball field," she says with a laugh. "So if that happens, we can share it." 
They plan an October wedding -- after the baseball season ends.

 WAVES OF SHOPPERS? Some cities spend big bucks to put in auto malls to attract 
out-of-town business. In Newport Beach, with its picturesque waterways, 
officials are kicking around something similar, except with boats. . . . 
Assistant City Manager Ken Delino says Newport Beach needs to push itself as a 
nautical center. "What we have is boats," says Delino, "so we're exploring the 
idea of a showcase for boats." As a base, the city has more than 100 boat 
dealers.

GLORIA STEWART; ACTIVIST AND WIFE OF JAMES STEWART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gloria Stewart, actor James Stewart's wife, who was prominent in animal 
support groups and other community activities, has died. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stewart died Wednesday of lung cancer at her Beverly Hills home. Stewart, 
to whom she was married for 44 years, their twin daughters and her son from a 
previous marriage were with her at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria Stewart was one of our dearest friends for more than 40 years," former 
President Ronald Reagan said in a statement. "She was a very special woman with 
a wonderful sense of humor and not an ounce of self-pity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stewart was active on the boards of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., 
Natural History Museum, African Wildlife Foundation and St. John's Medical 
Center, and was a regular at charity dinners, dances and other events 
supporting those groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Larchmont, N.Y., the daughter of a newsreel executive, the former 
Gloria Hatrick was educated at private schools and worked briefly as an actress 
and model. She drove an ambulance during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 She married and divorced Edward B. (Ned) McLean, whose mother, Evelyn Walsh 
McLean, had owned the Hope diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to Los Angeles with her two small sons, she met Stewart, then 
Hollywood's favorite bachelor who had vowed he would remain single because "I 
could never marry just one and be disloyal to all the others." He proposed on 
his 41st birthday and they were married Aug. 9, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't too difficult to land," Mrs. Stewart later told Hollywood columnist 
Hedda Hopper. "The first time we met, he told funny stories and I laughed. That 
was how it all started." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stewart died in the only house the couple had shared -- a large Tudor the 
late actor Henry Fonda once described as "comfortable as Jimmy with a splash of 
style thrown in by Gloria." She raised vegetables on an adjacent lot the 
Stewarts had bought, demolishing the house on it in favor of a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 She shared her husband's interests in skeet shooting, fishing, animals and 
travel. A fan magazine in 1985 called their partnership "Dream Factory's 
Outstanding Marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include her husband, daughters Judy Merrill of San Francisco and 
Kelly Harcourt of Davis, son Michael McLean of Phoenix, and two grandchildren. 
Her other son, Marine Lt. Ronald McLean, was killed in the Vietnam War.

PROPOSAL TO RELOCATE SEA LIONS REJECTED; CONSERVATION: COASTAL COMMISSIONERS 
DECIDE THAT MOVING 60 OF THE MAMMALS FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO SANTA BARBARA AND 
VENTURA COASTS WOULD NOT WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission on Thursday rejected a proposal to move 
about 60 California sea lions from Washington state to waters off Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties, despite a proposal to relocate the mammals in an effort 
to reduce their preying upon steelhead trout in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Marine Fisheries Service had proposed moving the sea lions from 
their plentiful hunting ground near Ballard Locks, Wash., where steelhead trout 
spawn, to join sea lions already in the Santa Barbara Channel and the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coastal Commission rejected the proposal by a vote of 5 to 3, with one 
commissioner abstaining. Commissioners who opposed the plan argued that moving 
the sea lions to Southern California wouldn't solve the problem because they 
would probably swim back north, said Jack Liebster, public affairs director for 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think it would work," Liebster said. "Experiments have shown they 
do return rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1989 relocation experiment, five out of six sea lions moved from 
Washington to San Miguel Island, in the Channel Islands, returned within a 
month, according to a report to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The steelhead population is already depressed, and managers of fisheries in 
the Northwest fear that the fish could become threatened or endangered if 
predation continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebster said there was also concern among the commissioners that, while they 
were in Southern California, the sea lions "might also damage the small 
steelhead population that we have. But the overall issue was, 'Why do this if 
it didn't work?' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time that the Coastal Commission has rejected a sea lion 
relocation plan. In 1989, a similar proposal was brought before the commission 
by the National Marine Fisheries Service, but that was also defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff had recommended approval of the most recent proposal, saying 
an all-time low in the steelhead population and new information on potential 
effects warranted reconsideration of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scordino of the fisheries service said the agency was disappointed at the 
decision and frustrated that the commission failed to offer alternative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did was say this action is not consistent with their plan. They 
didn't say why," said Scordino, deputy chief of fisheries management for the 
service's Northwest division. "Rather, they were saying they didn't like the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Scordino said that under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, the 
commission must explain why it didn't concur with the proposal and come up with 
"prudent alternatives" to the relocation plan. "That's what they are supposed 
to do legally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, the steelhead winter run is under way, and the sea 
lions are hungrily waiting. About 1,000 fish are expected to make the run this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "One or two animals by themselves could eat the run," Scordino said. "We've 
seen one animal eat 11 fish in one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Local commercial and sport fishermen applauded the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable," commercial fisherman Bill Sutton said. "It's a blessing that 
somebody made that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Rasmussen, a commercial fisherman who works off the coast of Santa 
Barbara, said that moving the sea lions to Southern California would have been 
a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous waste of money. They're going to turn around and go right 
back; that's what they did in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton said the sea lion population is out of control. In peak seasons, 
officials estimate that there are more than 100,000 sea lions in the Santa 
Barbara Channel. Although 60 additional lions may seem a small number, Sutton 
said, it's still contributing to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is taking care of these darn things. The population is going crazy. 
That doesn't sound like very much, but they increase at 10% per year -- that's 
10,000 sea lions per year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sport fisherman and seafood restaurant owner Gus Garcia agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty percent of the catch they tear up" without eating them, Garcia said of 
the sea lions. "You're trying to make a living, and they're tearing it up."

POLICE AGENCIES UNITE ON PURSUIT POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies in Ventura County for the first time have adopted 
uniform policies covering vehicle pursuits that cross city-county boundaries 
and involve officers from more than one department. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies also spell out in greater detail when an officer has the 
authority to start and end a pursuit, or use his or her car to ram a suspect's 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we did not have a formal agreement between the agencies," said 
Sheriff's Cmdr. Bruce McDowell, a member of the countywide task force that 
studied the issue. "This is a totally new policy." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell said the task force was formed early last year after two California 
appellate court decisions found that cities with vaguely worded policies could 
be held liable if a suspect injured someone while being chased by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most pursuit policies of agencies in Southern California were pretty much the 
same, and they were all fairly vague," said Ventura Police Lt. Pat Miller, who 
also served on the task force. "Those two cases, and some high-publicity 
crashes at the end of pursuits, made it real clear that we had to do something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Port Hueneme became the last jurisdiction in Ventura 
County to adopt a revised pursuit policy modeled on that developed by the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies involved in the task force were Santa Paula, Simi Valley, 
Ventura, Oxnard, the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office. 
The task force drew on the statewide policy used by the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Police Chief John Hopkins said the most significant changes focus 
on pursuits involving multiple agencies. Under the new guidelines, officers 
joining another department's chase will switch to the first department's radio 
frequency. The first department will be in charge of the chase and suspect 
unless it requests that another jurisdiction take over. 
</P>
<P>
 All the officers involved should then be able to communicate with each other 
directly rather than filter information back through dispatchers and watch 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, McDowell said, a communications gap sometimes caused confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no real agreement as to who was in charge of the pursuit and who 
was going to organize the response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme's policy now lists several specific conditions when a pursuit 
should be discontinued, such as when the only known violation is a misdemeanor 
or traffic offense. Other factors to be considered are speed, traffic volume, 
weather conditions, the length of the pursuit and the likelihood of catching 
the suspect at another time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department adopted its new policy in December, and copies have 
been distributed to deputies. But it will probably take some time for the 
changes to become habit, McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something they do every day," he said. "Under the stress of the 
moment, it's easy to revert back to old training." 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics cited by Hopkins in a report to the Port Hueneme City 
Council, in the first half of 1993, about 25% of pursuits involving state and 
local agencies resulted in collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Cmdr. Mark Hanson believes that the county's new policies 
could reduce such risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the officers more cause to think," he said. "Probably what you'll 
see now is more of the less serious pursuits discontinued earlier."

PLAN TO SHIFT AIRPORT MANAGEMENT ALARMS CIVIC, AVIATION GROUPS

<P>
 An announcement that Ventura County supervisors are considering eliminating 
the department that manages the Camarillo and Oxnard airports has triggered 
alarm among local aviation officials and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of Supervisor John K. Flynn, the Board of Supervisors 
decided this week to consider putting both airports under management of the 
county public works agency and eliminating the post of airports administrator, 
which has been vacant since the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors also abruptly decided at the meeting Tuesday to cancel interviews 
that had been set up this week with seven candidates for the administrator's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn emphasized Thursday that county officials have so far made no decision 
on the proposed merger but are merely examining the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to try to find a more efficient way to manage" the airports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal has riled Camarillo and Oxnard civic leaders, business people 
and pilots, who argue that the airports need to be managed by a staff 
experienced in both business and aviation, rather than by a county department 
whose expertise is in maintaining roads and public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very dangerous in terms of the efficient operation of the airport," 
Camarillo City Councilman David Smith said. "The airport is not like another 
building. It's an ongoing business and requires someone who has experience in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Airport alone pumps an estimated $20.8 million into the local economy. 
And Camarillo Airport generates $29.5 million in spending on local goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big piece of Camarillo's business," said Wally Boeck, a member of 
the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce board. "We as a community have a huge 
resource out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a businessman, Boeck is a pilot and member of the Ventura 
County Aviation Advisory Commission, which advises the county on airport 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Merging the airports administration into the public works agency could save an 
estimated $180,000 to $220,000, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the savings would not benefit taxpayers by helping to alleviate the budget 
crisis: The county is forbidden by law from tapping into any of the revenues 
generated at Camarillo Airport, the only one of the two airports that makes 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, county officials said they would funnel savings from the merger into 
airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boeck and other aviation officials charge that the proposed merger is a 
ploy by the county to replace airport staff with public works personnel who 
would be paid from airport revenues, thus reducing county payroll costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Public Works Director Arthur E. Goulet first presented the merger 
proposal in a March, 1993, memo that identifies several airport staff positions 
that could be eliminated. The memo also indicates that at least one of the 
airport jobs, an engineering position, could be filled by a public works staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Goulet said Thursday that the public works department was overstaffed 
at the time he wrote the memo, a situation that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an attempt to gain revenue for the public works agency," he said. 
"It is just a look to see if there are some ways of affecting economies" in the 
airport management. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the airport administrator position would alone save an estimated 
$90,000 in salary and benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the reorganization would allow the county to eliminate some of 
the other 31 staff positions at the airport by merging finance, clerical and 
other functions performed in both agencies. The workers in these eliminated 
positions would either be laid off or transferred to other county departments, 
Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the merger also say they are concerned that the move would strip 
the airports of their relative independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county owns the two airports, the Board of Supervisors already has 
ultimate control over their operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the existence of a separate airport department whose administrator and 
staff work from offices at Camarillo Airport instead of at the massive County 
Government Center gives the airports a certain amount of autonomy that would be 
lost through a merger into the public works agency, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, it's being operated independently, and it's getting the kind of 
attention that it needs," Oxnard Councilman Michael Plisky said. "It's just 
going to get buried in bureaucracy in Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 If control of the airports were transferred to the public works agency, Plisky 
said, pilots and other airport users would have less access to airport 
management. "It would be less responsive to public needs," he said.

CLERGYMAN'S TRIAL IS ROCKED BY 2 LATE DEVELOPMENTS; COURTS: THE JUDGE WILL LET 
THE DEFENSE ARGUE THAT PRIEST ACCUSED OF THEFT COULD HAVE BEEN FRAMED. AND AN 
AUDIT BY THE ARCHDIOCESE IS REVEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli's month-old church embezzlement trial was rocked 
Thursday by a reversal and a revelation -- two late developments that could 
sharply alter its course. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Piroli's attorney and the prosecutor learned that the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles had audited bookkeeping records at St. Peter Claver 
Church immediately after Piroli's arrest on embezzlement charges in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers immediately demanded and received a copy of the audit of the Simi 
Valley parish and began studying it for evidence that could bolster either the 
prosecution or defense case. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in an unrelated development, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan 
L. Steele ruled that Piroli's attorney can argue to the jury that another 
priest could have planted the $50,000 in cash and parishioners' checks and the 
collection envelopes that were found in Piroli's office and bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 That reversed an earlier ruling in which the judge forbade the use of such a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 37, faces two charges of grand theft for allegedly stealing a total of 
$60,000 in collection money from St. Peter Claver and his previous posting, 
Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. Parish employees discovered the cash in his 
rooms after Hollywood police found Piroli in his church car with $10,000 in 
cash, church collection envelopes and traces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's developments came relatively late in the trial, as defense attorney 
Richard Beada was preparing to question the last few defense witnesses on 
Piroli's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the trial, Steele had forbidden Beada to argue that Piroli was 
framed by Father James McKeon, his superior at St. Peter Claver. Beada had said 
he hoped to persuade jurors that McKeon planted the money in Piroli's rooms 
because he feared his own embezzlement of church funds was about to be exposed 
by the associate pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steele had said there was not enough evidence to support such a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Steele changed his mind after Beada cited testimony that had 
come out since the judge's initial ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada recalled testimony that, within a day of Piroli's arrest on May 29, 
1992, McKeon and church secretary Eileen Slavin had handled special holy day 
collection envelopes like those found with bundles of cash in Piroli's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace argued that many church officials had access to 
the envelopes, and that there is no evidence linking McKeon or Slavin to the 
envelopes in Piroli's dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steele ruled that Beada could cite the envelopes in a bid to persuade 
jurors that there was enough reasonable doubt of Piroli's guilt to prevent them 
reaching a guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steele expressed dismay that Beada was only now tying together enough evidence 
to bolster his argument, some 18 months after the case was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was displeased to learn for the first time Thursday that the 
archdiocese had audited the books at St. Peter Claver immediately after 
Piroli's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Diocesan officials had said publicly after Piroli's arrest that they were 
auditing the books at St. Peter Claver. But both sides apparently neglected to 
uncover the audit disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit was not made public and has not yet been introduced as evidence. But 
after reading the audit Thursday, the attorneys hinted at its contents in 
discussions with Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada noted that the audit criticizes one church official -- whose name has 
not surfaced in the trial -- of falsifying financial records. And Peace said 
she was not aware until she read the audit that Piroli had access to the St. 
Peter Claver bingo fund -- a fact that has not been focused on in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we are all appalled to obtain this kind of information this late 
in the game," Steele said. "But it seems to me we have to make some choices 
with respect to where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he would let Beada alter his witness list slightly so that 
jurors can hear testimony about the audit. But he warned: "I'm not going to 
turn this case into another three weeks" of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada then continued with his witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacia Michaels, a former bookkeeper at St. Peter Claver, testified that the 
church was in bad shape financially when she arrived in 1989 -- before Piroli's 
arrival the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly didn't know where the funds were always going," she testified. 
"And nothing was being done to keep the church in its proper mode or 
maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels testified she once walked into McKeon's office and saw him sitting 
with piles of cash on his desk, opening collection envelopes. She also said 
McKeon sometimes kept church cash in envelope boxes like those found in 
Piroli's bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli testified last week that he never kept such boxes in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was not unusual for McKeon to count collection money on his desk 
and he made no attempt to hide it from parish employees, testified Pamela 
Prendeville, a former secretary at St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Michaels and Prendeville testified that they stopped giving money 
to the church building fund because they never saw it being spent properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church was falling into disrepair" in 1990, Prendeville said. "We did not 
see the funds being used for the maintenance of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 After a week's break, testimony is scheduled to continue Feb. 28.

FORECAST INCLUDES SCATTERED RAIN; WEATHER: THURSDAY'S STORM BRINGS ONE TO TWO 
INCHES OF PRECIPITATION TO THE COUNTY, BUT NO MASSIVE MUDSLIDES OCCUR IN 
FIRE-RAVAGED AREAS. 
</P>

 Scattered showers through early Saturday will give way to partly cloudy skies 
and warming temperatures over the Presidents' Day weekend, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between one and two inches of rain fell countywide from the latest storm 
front, but homeowners in east Ventura County were spared the massive mudslides 
that emergency officials worried would strike fire-ravaged hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been real fortunate it just hasn't come down on us," said Josie Conlon, 
a Thousand Oaks woman whose Spring Canyon Place home came within yards of 
burning during last fall's Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Local flood control and public works officials said Thursday's rain fell 
gently and caused little damage to property in Ventura County. But they warned 
that erosion could become more serious as the ground is saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more cumulative rains we get, the more sensitive the erosion problems 
become," said Dolores Taylor, division engineer with the Ventura County Flood 
Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U. S. Soil Conservation Service were also keeping a close 
watch on the blackened hills around the county. Many were seeded last month 
with fast-growing ground covers, which are helping prevent mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water was running clear off the hills; we saw very little debris and the 
growth is coming through," said Peggy Rose, a Soil Conservation Service civil 
engineer who toured the Green Meadow area Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit luck and a little bit good planning," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there could be a little more rain this weekend, it was not expected 
to be enough to cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be another chance at scattered showers late Sunday," said Bruce 
Thoren of WeatherData Inc., which forecasts for The Times. "Monday and Tuesday 
so far look dry, but it may get a little breezy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren predicted temperatures in the high 60s or low 70s for most of the 
weekend, with the thermometer dipping to the low 40s overnight. Gusts of 15 to 
25 m.p.h. were predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the mild forecast for the weekend, flood control district officials 
are continuing to monitor several mudslide-vulnerable spots throughout the 
county. Taylor said workers have not finished building emergency basins to 
prevent mudslide damage at fire sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that it's been several months, and the native stuff is 
starting to grow back," Taylor said. "But we are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Kaufer, a spokesman at the Wheeler Hot Springs resort near Ojai, where 
hundreds of acres burned in the Matilija fire in November, said damage from 
mudslides so far was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had quite a bit of mud and shale come down on the south end of the 
property, but fortunately it's in an area we don't use," he said. "As long as 
we can keep those drainage channels open, we'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the Malibu area of Los Angeles County, hard hit last week during 
another storm, were better prepared for sliding mud Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stop it this time," said Barry McManus, who owns a four-unit apartment 
building in Malibu that was damaged from mudslides Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing more sandbagging, and we're going to keep the flow moving with a 
fire hose," said McManus, who used a plastic trash bag for a raincoat. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of houses away, Randy Brant, 42, explained that he had left the doors 
of his garage open this time so that any mud seeping in one end could seep out 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd done that last time, everything would have been OK," said Brant, who 
lost a car, washing machine and set of golf clubs to mudslides during last 
week's storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the recent rainfall, Ventura County still lags well behind 
precipitation totals for a typical year, according to figures compiled by the 
Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 19 rain gauges around the county indicates below-average 
precipitation to date, with Piru and Fillmore recording the lowest amount -- 
50% of normal -- and Saticoy receiving the highest amount at 76%, the district 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The precipitation early Thursday had varied impact on farmers, according to 
Rex Laird of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citrus and avocado ranchers are thrilled, the vegetable guys probably see 
it as a nuisance, and the strawberry growers are likely to have had the worst 
of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain fell hard enough to cause physical damage to the strawberries," 
Laird said. "They'll have to go in there and strip the fruit from the plants." 
</P>
<P>
 The rains also took a toll on Ventura County drivers. Streets in downtown 
Oxnard and Creek Road in Ojai flooded as rainwater overwhelmed drainage 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three dozen crashes -- none serious -- were reported to the 
California Highway Patrol between 6 a.m. and noon Thursday, Officer Jerry 
Sawasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't absolutely have to drive in the hard rain, then don't do it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists in Los Angeles County were not so fortunate, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said an unidentified man was killed when his car spun out of control 
along Topanga Canyon Boulevard and crashed into a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 On nearby Malibu Canyon Road, a stove-sized boulder loosened by rain plummeted 
onto the top of a compact car driven by Michelle Faircloth, a 21-year-old 
Pepperdine University employee. She suffered a fractured collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County business and hospitality industry leaders are counting on 
warmer weather to draw visitors over the three-day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather will hold, we'll get people up from the L. A. area," said Russ 
Smith, executive director of the Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hotels are quite busy; convention business in town is good and there are 
a couple of movie shoots going on," Smith said. "So far, it's been quite good, 
but this is all weather-dependent." 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SHERIFF TELLS HOW HE'D USE PROP. 172 FUNDS 
</P>

 Ventura County's sheriff said he would hire 65 deputies, launch an anti-gang 
program and restore courthouse officer positions with his department's share of 
$26 million a year in special sales tax funds if he is allowed to spend the 
money as desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter made his proposal at a meeting Wednesday with the 
county's budget subcommittee, which is charged with devising a spending plan to 
distribute the funds generated by Proposition 172, the statewide half-cent 
sales tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the spending plan discussed Wednesday, $12 million would be set aside to 
fund the County Jail, which is expected to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $10 million would be divided among the Sheriff's Department, the 
district attorney's office and the public defender's office. The rest of the 
money would be spent on special crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In future years, the funds would be split among the departments, with 65% 
going to the sheriff, 17% to the district attorney, 12% to corrections and 6% 
to the public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is scheduled to be considered by the Board of Supervisors on March 1.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 MORE SET SIGHTS ON CONTROLLER'S JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two more people have taken out nomination papers to run for Ventura County 
auditor-controller, including an Oxnard accountant who says he will challenge 
the qualifications of Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton to run for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Wigen, 60, of Simi Valley and Richard Morrisset, 41, of Oxnard, 
both certified public accountants, said they plan to run for the controller's 
job, which is responsible for overseeing the county's $836-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates who have taken out papers for the position include Stratton, 
Ventura accountant Scott Weiss, and Thomas O. Mahon, who was appointed 
auditor-controller by the Board of Supervisors last year after serving more 
than 20 years as assistant controller. Mahon and Weiss have also questioned 
Stratton's qualifications for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrisset, who is also an attorney, said he does not believe that Stratton has 
the accounting experience to legally qualify for the controller's job, which 
pays $128,000 a year including benefits. He said he will take Stratton to court 
once he files his nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's cut-and-dried," Morrisset said. "He's not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, director of the software department for Teledyne Systems in 
Chatsworth, said he believes that he has the experience and educational 
background necessary for the job and is prepared to stand up to a legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the controller's position, a candidate must be a certified 
public accountant or have served as county auditor or deputy auditor for at 
least three years, or possess a certificate or diploma from a school of 
accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no more schools of accountancy in California, Stratton said 
he believes that his master's degree in business administration -- including 10 
units in accounting -- from Cal Lutheran University qualifies him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that the law requires is that you have the education to be a CPA, and 
that's what I have," Stratton said. He said his education qualifies him to take 
the CPA exam, noting that Mahon is also not a CPA. CARLOS V. LOZANO

 Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery was selected Thursday to serve for 
one year as chairman of the Ventura County Waste Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, vice-chair for four years, replaces Ventura County Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee at a time when the commission is preparing to establish a 
countywide regional waste authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary objective over the coming year will be to create a single waste 
authority," Montgomery said. "We have been planning for this for four years; 
now it's just a matter of getting it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is a countywide board with representatives from 10 cities; it 
was formed to coordinate management of waste issues in the county. MATTHEW MOSK

 "Whoa, neat! It's orange," the second-grader declared to his classmates, who 
bounced up and down in anticipation as they waited their turns. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were taking part in a program called Lights in the Sky, which 
parents paid for through fund-raisers that brought in more than $500. The 
program saves the cost of a field trip by bringing the sky-gazing equipment to 
the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 By looking through a telescope, "students get an appreciation for their place 
in the universe," said astronomer Tom Dorff, who runs the program at schools 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program at Hollow Hills Fundamental School in Simi Valley brought 
students and parents together after dark to learn more about the sky, teachers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Astro, funded by the National Science Foundation, provided training 
and equipment to make the subject come alive for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing has a hands-on emphasis, rather than just memorizing the 
names of the planets and constellations," fifth-grade teacher Jeanine Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project, local astronomer Tim Robertson has volunteered to help 
Miller and two other fifth-grade teachers in the classroom throughout the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronomy lessons will culminate later this school year with a trip to the 
Moorpark Observatory, Miller said. BRENDA DAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL EASES CURBS ON REPAIRING WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has amended an ordinance passed after last month's 
earthquake regulating the reconstruction of damaged walls and buildings after 
some residents argued that it was too strict. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Wednesday voted 5 to 0 to remove a section of the ordinance that 
dealt with free-standing masonry walls, in response to angry comments by 
residents who said the restrictions in the new law would force them to rip down 
partly damaged walls and pay too much to build new walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by damage sustained during the Jan. 17 earthquake and the potential 
for more in another quake, the council earlier this month passed the emergency 
ordinance requiring all new block walls to be designed by a certified architect 
or engineer, Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also required that block walls that sustained more than 50% 
quake-related damage had to be torn down and rebuilt according to the most 
modern building codes, Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents at Wednesday's meeting said the ordinance would force them to 
tear down walls that could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said it would make erecting new walls too costly and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 After some debate, council members agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We modified it and exempted six-foot or under garden walls," Lawrason said, 
"which, in effect, says we are going to leave the situation as it was and you 
are free to do what you will to retrofit them." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Experts from the medical community, vitamin users and officials from the Food 
and Drug Administration will meet in Ventura today to debate the wisdom of 
regulating dietary supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few months, strict new FDA regulations are scheduled to take 
effect to control over-the-counter sale of certain supplements and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) who is leading a congressional effort to 
overturn the new regulations, has organized today's public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the consumers should have access to these supplements," said John 
Frith, Gallegly's press secretary. "But there will be people from both sides of 
the issue at the hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to medical and government experts, celebrities including Morgan 
Fairchild, Heather Thomas, Eddie Albert and Los Angeles Raiders lineman Anthony 
Smith are scheduled to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at the Ventura Holiday Inn, 450 E. Harbor Blvd., from 
1 to 5 p.m. For more information, call 485-2300. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; SPIDER BITE MAY HAVE TRIGGERED DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A massive infection that killed a 44-year-old Santa Paula woman may have been 
triggered by a spider bite as the family believes, but the connection cannot be 
proven, a Ventura County deputy coroner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said an autopsy revealed that Linda Christine 
Lougdan died after succumbing to a three-month infection, which led to heart 
failure.But Marilyn Lougdan, who found her daughter late Tuesday, said she 
believed that an untreated spider bite three months ago caused the infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Lougdan did not seek medical attention for the bite, her mother said, because 
her Christian Science religious beliefs prohibited seeking treatment from a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be ruled out, but we don't know for sure the exact cause of the 
infection," Deputy Craig Stevens said of the spider bite. He said the woman's 
weight -- 370 pounds -- may have contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Lougdan was a former accountant with the Ventura Unified School District, 
authorities said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; JOBS PROGRAM AIDS DROPOUTS AND 
OFFENDERS

<P>
 Two arrests for carrying a concealed .38-caliber revolver do not look good on 
a resume, but with the help of a federally funded job-training program, 
20-year-old Jose Cerda of Santa Paula was able to land his first full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got plans. I want to move up in life, make some money so I can buy some 
clothes, a car and help out my parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerda works at a silk-screening factory in Ventura, producing T-shirts and 
baseball caps. He won the position after spending just one month in a 
job-training program conducted by Arbor Inc., a national organization that 
teaches high school dropouts and juvenile offenders the skills they need to 
find work. 
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of a $140,000 federal grant, Arbor opened a training center in 
Santa Paula in early January for Fillmore and Santa Paula youths from 18 to 21 
years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Cerda, four other Arbor trainees have found employment after going 
through the program. Arbor helps them contact employers and pays their salaries 
for the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
 While working, the trainees keep in contact with a caseworker for support. 
Most employers, Arbor officials said, keep the trainees employed after the 
six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 10 young men and women are now in the program, spending their days 
learning such tasks as how to open a checking account, find an apartment, write 
a resume and interview with a prospective employer, with the hope that they too 
will get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their backgrounds would disqualify them for most jobs, it is their 
troubled past that qualifies them for the Arbor program. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be eligible, they had to show multiple barriers to employment," said 
Millie Kelly, Arbor's director in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said those barriers include reading below an eighth-grade level, having 
a criminal record and being on welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Esmeralda Magana hopes that the program will help her.  
</P>
<P>
 She dropped out of high school when she became pregnant with her son, who is 
now 2. She also has an 11-month-old daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of work and living at home on the east side of Santa Paula while trying to 
care for her children left her feeling trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get off welfare, find a place of my own," she said, wearing a 
business suit and fresh from an interview for a job as a receptionist at a 
local car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a better life for my kids," she said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DAIRY STORE CLERK FOILS ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A clerk at an Oxnard dairy store foiled an attempted robbery Thursday when he 
challenged and then chased the robber, believing that the gun the man pointed 
at him was not real, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kenneth Myers, 28, entered the store on Channel Islands Boulevard 
shortly before 6 p.m. and initially told clerk Reynald Andico that he wanted to 
buy an ice cream cone, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled a gun on me and told me to stand back," Andico said. "I told him 
how to open the drawer, but when he was taking the money, I looked at the gun 
and I realized it was fake. I said, 'Hey, that's fake!' and he ran out of the 
store." 
</P>
<P>
 Andico said he ran after Myers screaming "Hey, that's a fake gun!" and "Turn 
around and fight me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Police said officers spotted the two men running down Ventura Road and 
intervened, arresting Myers without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later said the weapon used in the incident was a BB gun. Andico said 
Myers had taken $20 from the register before he was stopped. Myers was being 
held late Thursday on suspicion of armed robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were investigating a possible link with several other armed 
robberies that have occurred in the vicinity. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MARINE ENVIRONMENT STUDY GETS GO-AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission approved a three-year study Thursday that 
will examine the state of the marine environment off the coast of Ventura and 
Los Angeles counties and in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, 
commission spokesman Jack Liebster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $600,000 study will be funded by Chevron Corp. and its Point Arguello 
corporate partners in compliance with a condition of a 1993 permit to ship oil 
by tanker to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will begin next month and run through February, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also approved Chevron's request to annually discharge about 
49,000 barrels of drilling muds and about 29,000 barrels of drill cuttings off 
Platform Gail, situated about 11 miles off the coast of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the coastal study is to record conditions at shoreline sites to 
be used in the event of an oil spill. The inventory will include wetlands, 
estuaries and other coastal habitats, and will be conducted by scientists at 
UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Associate Prof. Richard Ambrose said the study will allow scientists and 
others to know which coastal habitats are vulnerable in the event of an oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate proposal, commission staff members recommended approval of the 
discharge from Platform Gail, saying the discharge produced a smaller threat to 
the environment than shipping the wastes off the platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil platform, built in 1987, produces about 4,500 barrels of oil and 
20,000 cubic feet of natural gas a day. Chevron's discharge plan has been 
approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. TRACY WILSON

ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; BENHARD OPENS RACE WITH CALL TO CURB 
ILLEGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Republican Mark Boos Benhard of Oak Park kicked off his campaign to unseat 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson at a rally Thursday, where he urged a $500 tax credit 
for working families and a get-tough policy against illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, 28, for three years an aide to former Rep. William Dannemeyer, said 
he supports using the armed forces to patrol the U. S.-Mexican border and 
eliminating all benefits for illegal immigrants, including automatic 
citizenship, education and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, an Orange County Republican who is running for the U. S. Senate, 
endorsed Benhard at the event, and the pair are scheduled to appear together at 
another event in the Conejo Valley tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer praised his former aide Thursday -- saying the political climate is 
right to elect conservative Republicans like Benhard -- and criticized 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) as a tax-and-spend liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 people attended the event at the Woodland Hills home of Mary 
Barrientos, who was appointed to the Los Angeles Housing Commission by Mayor 
Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those in attendance are graduates of Riordan's 1993 campaign, 
including Todd Blair, Benhard's campaign manager. Others, like Darlene Woods, 
who identified herself as the leader of a John Birch Society chapter, and 
investor John Popp, are veterans of numerous conservative crusades, including 
Howard Jarvis' tax-reform movement and, currently, the campaign to recall state 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, who is Benhard's mentor, has long been a vocal critic of the gay 
lifestyle and a supporter of voluntary school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, who owns a public relations firm, reminded his audience that he was 
born and raised in the west San Fernando Valley, a distinction the other two 
Republican contenders cannot claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seeking the GOP nomination for the 24th Congressional District seat are 
Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, and Richard Sybert, a former 
top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. Hammer has lived in the area since 1985, while 
Sybert, a native of Whittier, has resided in the West Valley for less than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say my opponents are more liberal than I am, but I am no 
right-winger," added Benhard, who lives with his wife and three sons in Oak 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Benhard said he supports a recent proposal to deny all but 
emergency aid to illegal immigrants who were affected by the Northridge 
earthquake, wants to see increased use of the death penalty, and opposes the 
recently enacted federal Brady Bill, which mandates a 10-day waiting period 
before the purchase of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard warned that Beilenson, who with reapportionment represents an 
increasingly Republican and Valley-based district, has tried to change his tune 
to suit his new constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson talks a good game, for example, when it comes to immigration, 
but he doesn't follow through," Benhard said. Beilenson has advocated denying 
citizenship to infants born in the United States to parents who are in this 
country illegally.

4 TEEN-AGERS PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN SHOOTING THAT INJURED 3 YOUTHS; ARRAIGNMENT: 
BRAWL INVOLVED SOME WESTLAKE HIGH STUDENTS. DEFENSE LAWYERS SAY THEIR CLIENTS 
SUFFER RACISM AT SCHOOL AND IN COURT. 
</P>

<P>
 All four juveniles charged in a brawl in which three Westlake High School 
students were shot pleaded not guilty Thursday, and their lawyers said the 
defendants are victims of racism at school and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a situation where nerdy Asian types are being harassed by football 
players who are much larger than them," Deputy Public Defender Zane Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defense attorney also questioned during the arraignment why four Asian 
16-year-olds have been charged and detained over the melee while their white 
adversaries remain free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it because (they are) Asian?" said Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., who represents 
one of two Westlake students charged in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After court, Mesereau said his client, a Taiwanese American, has been a target 
of racial epithets and "other derogatory names that reflect bigotry and racism" 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren, who ordered the 
defendants to remain locked up, reacted angrily to the suggestions of racism in 
his court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Race just isn't an issue in this courtroom," Perren snapped from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 A top school official said he is not aware of any unusual racial problems at 
Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that there were some problems between two kids, but that was about 
it," said Fred Van Leuven, director of secondary education for the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of Curtis Simmons, one of the Westlake football players injured in 
the incident, has denied that his son racially harassed the Taiwanese boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations by defense attorneys Thursday represent the most extensive 
statements yet from the defendants' supporters in the case. The comments also 
mark the first time that the defendants have charged the legal system with 
racism in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee originated after the Taiwanese teen-ager and Simmons agreed to 
engage in a fistfight at North Ranch Park after school Feb. 3, both sides 
concede. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese youth arrived with five cars of associates, police said. They 
jumped out of the vehicle, announced, "We're the Asian Mafia," and attacked 
Simmons and others with baseball bats, sticks and gunfire, authorities and 
witnesses said. One youth was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies apprehended the two defendants from Westlake 
High within a day. They arrested a teen-ager from Brea in Orange County and one 
from Rowland Heights in Los Angeles County six days after the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's not-guilty pleas set the stage for hearings March 22 in which 
Perren will decide, based on probation reports, whether to try the youths as 
juveniles or adults. Prosecutors have asked that they be tried as adults, 
citing the seriousness of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea teen-ager, also a Taiwanese American, was the first to be arraigned 
Thursday. He is charged with two counts of assault with a firearm and one count 
of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren refused to allow him to be released to his parents and handed out the 
same ruling for each of the remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesereau said his client was involved in "mutual combat" and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Cardoza, however, said the teen-ager was "the hub" 
of the brawl, a comment that prompted Mesereau to say: "If my client was the 
hub, then so was the alleged victim," because they both agreed to the 
fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perren said the behavior the defendant is accused of is "predatory in 
nature," noting that he allegedly arranged for five carloads of his friends to 
attack the crowd with weapons. The youth is charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The third defendant -- a Korean American student at Westlake charged with 
shooting at an occupied vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon and discharge of 
a firearm -- "fired for the purpose of breaking up the crowd," said his lawyer, 
Michael F. Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
 And Smith, the lawyer for the final defendant -- a Laotian American from 
Rowland Heights who is charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon 
-- produced a letter from his client's teacher. The letter said the boy is a 
good student who gets along well with classmates, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an isolated, unusual incident," he said. "Unfortunately, it's a 
product of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I think it's amazing that you have larger people picking on smaller 
people and then they are shocked when people bring sticks, bats and guns to 
equalize the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said he was surprised that a defense attorney would justify the 
conduct of the defendants by saying they were at a size disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find this offensive," he said in court.

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; SCHILLO BACKS NEW DISTRICT FOR PORT HUENEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate Frank Schillo said Thursday that if 
elected, he will push for new library and transit services for Oak Park and 
work to have Port Hueneme included in a more appropriate supervisorial district 
in the west county. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Thousand Oaks councilman is running against taxpayer advocate H. 
Jere Robings for the 2nd District supervisor's seat now held by Maria 
VanderKolk, who will not seek reelection. Her district represents most of the 
Conejo Valley, Oak Park and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Schillo and Robings are the only officially declared candidates in the 
race. But four other residents have taken out nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, during a press conference in Oak Park, proposed building a new 
satellite library in that unincorporated community of more than 14,000 
residents. The facility would be part of a larger library system and could 
include the cities of Thousand Oaks, Agoura Hills, Calabasas and the Las 
Virgenes Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he plans to call a meeting of all parties that would be included 
in the proposed library system to try to work out some arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know exactly how all of this is going to shake out," Schillo said. 
"That's the whole idea of getting everyone together and saying what is it we 
can do to make everyone happy." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected to county office, Schillo said another priority would be to try to 
move the city of Port Hueneme into another supervisorial district where it 
could be better represented, possibly the 5th District now represented by 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. That district includes Oxnard and part of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as Port Hueneme is concerned, I feel strongly it should not be part of 
this district," Schillo said. "People down there have told me that they don't 
have anything in common with Thousand Oaks. It's so far away. They have 
different issues and concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings agreed that the 2nd District's boundaries should be adjusted and Port 
Hueneme moved to a west county district. He said that each district must have a 
balanced population and that this might be accomplished by incorporating some 
of Lang Ranch in Thousand Oaks into the 2nd District. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be some adjustment of the district," said Robings, a resident of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the library issue, Robings said it is mainly a financial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community of Oak Park is not large enough to support its own library," he 
said. "They like staying as a county service district but because of its size, 
they don't have enough financial support for the services they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said he also had serious reservations about Schillo's plan for a 
regional library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how that would work," he said. "If you try to set up a system 
that crosses county lines, you may spend a few years trying to put the 
operation together." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park residents, who have lobbied for a library for years, must now pay an 
annual $55 fee to check out books and use reference materials at the Thousand 
Oaks Library. Schillo said under his plan, Oak Park would have its own library, 
as well as free use of the Thousand Oaks library. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he would also like to see bus service extended to Oak Park, but 
Robings said he would need more information on how much this would cost before 
he could endorse such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In other issues, Schillo said the county should share with its 10 cities $26 
million in revenues derived from the Proposition 172 half-cent sales tax. The 
statewide sales tax measure was approved by voters in November to help local 
governments pay for law enforcement and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are considering spending most of the revenues on the Todd 
Road jail under construction near Santa Paula, increases in sheriff's patrols 
and staffing of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo proposed that the county give a 10% rebate of Proposition 172 funding 
to the cities, dividing the money among themselves, to help pay for local law 
enforcement services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need that money for crossing guards and additional police services for 
gangs," he said, referring to the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robings said he did not believe that there was enough money to give the 
cities a rebate. Besides, he said, the money is being used for countywide 
services, such as the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of county services already going to the cities," he said. "I 
don't think we should be cutting up Proposition 172 money." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo was officially endorsed Thursday by Ron Stark, a longtime member of 
the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council who had planned to run county 
supervisor but decided to bow out after talking with Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other residents who have taken out nomination papers for the seat are 
former County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, former Assembly candidate Alan 
Guggenheim, county Corrections Officer David Goodman and Oak Park resident Alan 
H. Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, two Conejo Valley residents have launched a campaign to draft former 
Ventura County Supervisor Ed Jones as a candidate.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; THIS COURT ASSIGNMENT A HARD CELL; SAN 
FERNANDO: WITH THEIR BUILDING RED-TAGGED DUE TO QUAKE DAMAGE, CITY, COUNTY AND 
FEDERAL AGENCIES SET UP SHOP IN THE OLD POLICE STATION AND JAIL. 
</P>

 Inside the old San Fernando police station, where the Cabinet secretary came 
calling Thursday, city clerks, Los Angeles County prosecutors and sheriff's 
deputies toil in jail cells every day, while U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman works 
in one of the building's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 A bizarre bureaucratic punishment? An ironic change of careers? No, not 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced out of their regular quarters by last month's earthquake, several city, 
county and federal agencies now have makeshift offices in the old building, 
some behind bars, others in padded rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to accommodate people the best we can under the situation," said 
San Fernando Mayor Dan Acuna, looking into a graffiti-scrawled cell being used 
to store court case files. "It's just a place to work for the time being, 
although we're thinking of keeping some of our clerks in here permanently. They 
have beds, so they can sleep, and that way we'll get more work out of them," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich visited San Fernando on Thursday to honor 
"The Unsung Heroes of the Earthquake." Before he and Berman (D-Panorama City) 
presented certificates of appreciation to about 50 designated heroes, Reich 
toured the converted station to get a first-hand glimpse of local 
resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the money in the world, all the federal assistance, wouldn't mean a 
thing if it weren't for people like you," Reich said during the ceremony, held 
in the San Fernando City Council chambers. "We must celebrate the ordinary 
people, the workers of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 The council chambers are now serving in part as a San Fernando Superior 
courtroom, Acuna said. The main court building was red-tagged after the quake 
and many workers transferred to Van Nuys Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 But some remained, and in a strange twist, prosecutors in the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office who were formerly housed in the basement of the San Fernando 
Courthouse are now working out of jail cells in the old police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic what we're doing to keep the justice system moving," said David 
Knokey, the deputy city attorney who oversees the San Fernando branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Knokey himself has set up shop in a 4-by-8-foot yellow cell from which the 
urinal and toilet have been removed to make way for his desk. Knokey's police 
liaison officer is working in a former padded cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers with the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence of the San 
Fernando Valley have set up shop in a large, gray holding tank, complete with 
bunk beds and a long set of iron bars. The two women, who place convicted drunk 
drivers in treatment programs, have decorated the sparse surroundings with a 
bouquet of flowers provided by a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an emergency situation, we do the best with what we got," said Diana 
Perez, court referral manager for the NCADD.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: BUILDING A VISIONARY INFRASTRUCTURE; AS STRUCTURES ARE 
REMODELED, THE AREA'S REMARKABLE LANDSCAPE FEATURES CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO 
DESIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

in the SWA Group in Laguna Beach.

 In the coming months and years, Southern California will spend billions of 
dollars to rebuild its earthquake-damaged freeways and other infrastructure 
components. And it will spend billions more to retrofit them against future 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than pursue rebuilding as usual, let's use this massive public works 
program to promote a vision for a Southern California landscape, particularly 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 This vision will celebrate Orange County's remarkable landscape features: its 
mountains, plains, rivers, beaches and ocean. It will also encourage the 
creation of distinctive community identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's freeways are one good place to start implementing this 
landscape vision. Why can't sound walls, now little more than empty canvases 
for graffiti, be covered with attractive flowering vines? Graffiti would be 
removed from our freeways permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled widening of the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) in Orange County now 
presents another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Anaheim proposed innovative design guidelines for the 
stretch of I-5 between the Riverside Freeway and the Santa Ana River. These 
design standards call for graceful shallow-arched "nostalgia bridges" recalling 
the 1920s and 1930s, improved roadside landscaping and sound walls, public art 
at important spots, and use of the Santa Ana River crossing as a ceremonial 
gateway into the cities of Anaheim and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has adopted part of this proposal, and its engineers are now 
designing the "nostalgia bridges" for this section of I-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's rivers and flood control channels offer another opportunity to 
implement a vision for the landscape. Think of waterways like the Santa Ana 
River and San Juan Creek as "land banks" winding through our crowded region and 
unifying disparate communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of covering these waterways in concrete, let's install more attractive 
landscaping along their banks, where possible, and prepare long-term plans for 
adjacent land uses like parks or entertainment. Portions of some waterways 
could be returned to their natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 How can Orange County implement a vision for the landscape? A countywide 
entity -- including both government and grass roots organizations -- would seek 
the ideas and support of various municipalities and agencies, environmental 
organizations, and community groups in a two-year series of public forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, these public forums would create this landscape vision which would be 
organized in a series of five-year plans. Public agencies would follow these 
provisions in construction and repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will the money to implement this vision for an Orange County landscape 
come from? Most can come from the more imaginative use of existing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 To plant shrubs and vines along freeway sound walls, Caltrans could supplement 
its limited landscape funds with current anti-graffiti and "Adopt-A-Wall" 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, consider the flood control "improvements" along the Santa Ana River. The 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to construct higher walls along the river, 
raise numerous bridges and overpasses, and raise the height of the nearby Prado 
Dam. If past experience is any indication, this project will cost far more than 
the estimated $1 billion. Worse, its single-purpose approach treats the Santa 
Ana River as a concrete-lined drainage pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, let's spend that money on a more effective multipurpose solution 
incorporating flood control, parks and entertainment, and conservation of 
rainwater which now flows into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look what Phoenix has done with a similar program in only five years' 
time. In 1988, several city agencies expanded the "per cent for art" program 
from individual buildings to the entire metropolitan infrastructure -- 
highways, neighborhood streets, canals, bus stops, even water and waste 
treatment plants. Today, 68 public art and landscape projects are completed or 
underway, making Phoenix a more attractive city and a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 If Phoenix can do this, why can't Orange County? If we do, our children will 
thank us for strengthening Orange County's identity, reclaiming some of its 
natural beauty, and improving the local economy by attracting more business and 
tourism.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JOHN LIPPMAN: PARAMOUNT A PRELUDE TO DEALMANIA? 
</P>

 With the Paramount Communications takeover battle finally concluded and set to 
be immortalized in a TV movie called "The Deal From Hell," people should be 
"dealed out" by now. But action-driven Wall Street and Hollywood executives 
regard Paramount as a prelude to any number of other possible alliances, 
especially with Barry Diller and John Malone on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
 At the studio level, most of the remaining players have been linked to deals 
that could fundamentally change the structure of their companies. People are 
also spinning out merger, acquisition and strategic-alliance scenarios for the 
Big Three broadcast networks, especially CBS and NBC. Whether any of it comes 
to pass, the speculation will keep people hopping. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a shoppers' guide to entertainment companies, both deal-ready 
and not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures: The most openly solicitous of an alliance, so long as Sony 
retains management control. Michael P. Schulhof, president of Sony Corp. of 
America, has reportedly held discussions with everyone from the regional phone 
companies to Malone, chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc. Sony recently 
consolidated its movie operations under Mark Canton and Jonathan Dolgen. One 
intriguing scenario has the company selling off its TriStar Pictures division, 
which is regarded as a valuable stand-alone asset. Studio executives deny 
that's in the cards near-term, however. On the investment front, sources say 
Schulhof optimistically values the Sony Pictures operation at about $7.5 
billion. At current multiples, sources estimate TriStar's movie assets could 
fetch $500 million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Inc.: Malone has also been linked to discussions with the Universal 
City-based company in the past, but no one's talking imminent deal. Sources 
close to MCA say its parent, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., is still open 
to taking on a minority partner, while also exploring the possibility of a 
public offering in the United States for 20% or more of MCA. The time is 
thought to be right for one deal or the other, with MCA coming off the 
$1-billion success of "Jurassic Park" and the acclaim of "Schindler's List." 
Company executives won't comment on either scenario, though one high-level 
source says MCA values itself as highly as $12 billion since the $10-billion 
Paramount sale. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Fox: While Rupert Murdoch's expressed no interest publicly in 
unloading the studio, knowledgeable sources insist he's open to a full or 
partial deal. One reason: Murdoch doesn't necessarily need the movie business 
to build his global TV empire. Sources say he could sell the movie assets of 
the studio outright and still negotiate long-running, favorable terms on Fox 
films for his TV outlets. Fox had the holiday season's big hit in "Mrs. 
Doubtfire." The ubiquitous Malone, who is personally close to Murdoch, pops up 
in conversation as a possible buyer. Fox would also make sense for Diller, 
though people think there's too much bad blood between him and Murdoch. On the 
other hand, Fox may rank as a bargain. Analysts say the major movie assets 
could be had for perhaps $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co.: Everyone expects Disney to join the deal-making sweepstakes 
this year, though no one's quite sure how. People close to the company deny 
that a CBS merger is in the cards, despite continuing speculation to that 
regard. Chairman Michael D. Eisner is said to be more interested in alliances 
involving cable, phone and video game companies, as Disney studios prepares to 
release as many as 60 films in the coming year. A few people contend that the 
Mouse could become a takeover target, but the price would be north of $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner: Within hours of Diller's defeat in the Paramount marathon, Wall 
Street started to swirl with rumors that he had set his sights on bigger game: 
Time Warner. Analysts and traders speculated that Diller would accomplish this 
through a "reverse merger" between QVC Network and the media giant. Under the 
scenario, Diller would sell QVC Network to Time Warner, then be installed as 
its chief executive with the backing of the Bronfman family (which now owns 
11.8% of the media conglomerate). One source close to Diller describes that 
scenario as "nonsense." Either way, look for the Bronfmans to continue 
accumulating stock in the powerful company, which boasts of Hollywood's most 
consistent management at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM: The battered studio is gradually regaining some luster, with Frank 
Mancuso in charge and its owner, Credit Lyonnais, providing more backing. 
Everyone from Diller to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment has been mentioned as 
possible suitors. But no one expects a sale to occur anytime soon, partly 
because much of MGM's library is tied up for years. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS: Wall Street has considered CBS for sale since the day Laurence A. Tisch 
took control in 1987. A wildly successful strategy of wooing David Letterman 
has been offset by CBS losing NFL football to Fox, slippage in prime-time 
ratings and the anticipated exit of chief programmer Jeff Sagansky when his 
contract expires in May. With CBS no longer in the ascendancy -- and no other 
assets to fall back on -- Tisch may be looking for a taker. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC: NBC is a long way from its glory days of the mid-1980s under Grant Tinker 
and Brandon Tartikoff, but in recent months there has been noticeable 
improvement at the network. Thursday night ratings have come roaring back. A 
strategy to diversify into cable is paying off with CNBC and investments in 
networks such as Arts & Entertainment and Bravo. Jack Welch, the hard-driving 
chief executive of NBC parent General Electric, entertained offers from buyers 
last year, but he was unwilling to consider anything less than the $4 billion 
that the network was valued at on GE's books. Welch is apparently keen on a 
"strategic deal," and the global-minded GE boss may be looking to link NBC with 
some international media heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC: Now that Thomas Murphy has returned as chief executive in 
the wake of Dan Burke's retirement, many observers expect him and Cap Cities' 
largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, to take the company to the "next step" 
through a mega-merger. The company recently spent $700 million buying back its 
own stock. Considered to be the best-run broadcaster in the country -- margins 
at Cap Cities' TV stations are known to reach 50% -- Murphy still has not 
spelled out who the heir apparent is, although most assume it's Senior Vice 
President Robert Iger. A merger might be the answer to Cap Cities' "succession 
problem" by, say, putting it in the hands of the Walt Disney Co. Murphy has 
reiterated several times that Cap Cities believes the future is in software and 
programming, which would rule out a deal with a telephone company.

SHAKEN BUT INSURED; MOBILE HOME POLICIES WILL PAY FOR MOST QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's a silver lining for owners of earthquake-damaged mobile homes, it's 
that most were insured for quakes -- compared to just one-third of all other 
houses in Southern California. About 5,600 mobile homes -- one out of 10 in Los 
Angeles County -- were deemed uninhabitable after the Jan. 17 temblor. But it 
is expected that the majority will be rebuilt because quakes are usually 
included as part of mobile homeowners' comprehensive insurance policies.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 85% of the people here didn't think they had earthquake insurance, but 
they found out they had it," said Curt Atwell, owner of Crest Mobile Home 
Village in Simi Valley. Atwell said all but two or three of the 40 homeowners 
at his seniors-only park had coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquake insurance is one of the greatest benefits of a mobile home 
policy," added Ruth Walker, a spokeswoman for Foremost Insurance of Grand 
Rapids, Mich., the nation's biggest insurer of mobile homes. Foremost has about 
150,000 policyholders in California and has received 2,707 claims from the 
Northridge earthquake, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, many insured residents of mobile home parks -- particularly those who 
are retired or have small incomes -- say they cannot afford their deductibles, 
typically 5% on mobile home policies, or $2,000 to $3,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Insurance will be crucial in the rebuilding of such places as Tahitian Mobile 
Home Park in Sylmar, where more than 60 of the 240 mobile homes went up in 
flames after the quake. Charred remains of ovens, car shells and ashes still 
litter a large section of the grounds. Many homes have been emptied of 
furniture. Signs on the windows identify the insurance company and policy 
number.  
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the remaining residents are shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think mobile homes are that safe," said Jean Priestman, 56, as she 
sat in her cold, dark home, still without utilities a month after the quake and 
just a couple of houses away from a burned hull. "I'm not anxious to be here 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Priestman, insured through Foremost, said she will repair her home. But some 
owners at Tahitian and other mobile home parks have walked away, contractors 
and residents say, and others have sold their damaged homes on the spot for as 
little as $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U.S. Census, there are 555,000 mobile homes in 
California, most of them in the Southland. And in the wake of the Northridge 
quake, many of their owners have renewed concerns about safety -- along with 
worries about further depreciation of their homes, which tend to lose value 
even in good economic times.  
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home owners also face higher insurance premiums as a result of the 
quake. Foremost last week applied to the state for a 13.6% rate increase. That 
would come on top of a 29% increase it was granted earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the company charges $200 to $300 a year for a comprehensive mobile 
home policy in California. That's relatively expensive, given that an average 
trailer sells for about $30,000 -- or about one-seventh the price of a 
single-family house in the region. Conventional homeowners' premiums typically 
run $500 to $600 a year without earthquake coverage; adding it costs an 
additional $2 per $1,000 in coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 5,600 mobile homes severely damaged by the quake, about 4,500 
trailers slid off their tripod supports, according to the state's Housing and 
Community Development Department. Most of those were in the San Fernando 
Valley, but the quake also affected several mobile home parks in Simi Valley. 
Altogether, the state says, 184 mobile homes burned to the ground in fires 
ignited mainly by quake-ruptured gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the damage varies widely from park to park. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunburst Park Mobile Homes in Chatsworth, all but a few of the 118 homes 
lurched off their piers. Two burned down; a 92-year-old woman died when her 
home burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 JK Construction, an Orange County contractor that has set up its own trailer 
for an anticipated year of work at Sunburst, said it has already put 80 homes 
back on their tripods at a cost of $1,500 to $3,500 each. The overall repair 
bills will be much higher, work crews said; floors, aluminum siding, awnings, 
wood paneling and utility lines all have to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bev Miller, a 17-year Sunburst resident, says she is fortunate to have 
survived. The earthquake made her double-wide home jump three feet and land on 
the ground, crushing water and utility lines underneath her trailer and causing 
a gas leak that wasn't shut off for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said we were real lucky we didn't have a fire," said Miller, who with 
her husband, Jim, has been living in a rented motor home next to their trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Frick vividly described the morning of the earthquake at the Tahitian 
park in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oooh, it was such a boom!" she said. "The fire started; we had to get out, 
but the door was stuck. All the gas mains were exploding. . . . If there's 
another earthquake, it's all going to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Frick also has insurance, but she isn't sure she can pay the $2,000 deductible 
because she has been laid off from her job. Her employer, the Robinsons-May 
department store at Topanga Plaza in Woodland Hills, was damaged by the quake 
and may not reopen for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so discouraging," Frick said. "It looks like a bomb hit this place. All 
our neighbors are gone."

U.S. DEFICIT WITH JAPAN HITS RECORD $59.3 BILLION; TRADE: THE JUMP OF 23% LAST 
YEAR PROMPTS THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW ITS CALL FOR OPEN MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The politically charged U.S. trade deficit with Japan grew to almost $60 
billion last year, the worst showing on record, the Commerce Department 
reported Thursday. The news drew renewed calls from the Clinton Administration 
for the Japanese to open their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade gap with Japan accounted for more than half the U.S. trade imbalance 
worldwide in 1993, with U.S. imports exceeding exports by $115.8 billion. The 
overall figure was 37% higher than the year before and the worst level since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the surge in red ink occurred largely because economic 
conditions in the United States were better than those of most of the nation's 
major trading partners. Americans had more money to spend on imported goods 
than did the citizens of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a steadily increasing growth phase during this period, and many of 
our trading partners were not," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the White 
House Council of Economic Advisers. "As a consequence, one would see the trade 
imbalance deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson said a deep economic slump in Japan contributed to the $59.3-billion 
deficit with Tokyo, the largest bilateral imbalance the United States has 
recorded with any country. The trade deficit with Japan was 23% higher last 
year than it was the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures were especially explosive because President Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed last week to resolve a festering trade 
dispute between the world's two largest economies. The Administration has 
already threatened to impose sanctions because Japan failed to open its 
cellular telephone market to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the 1993 figures "underscore the need 
to push for open markets with our trading partners." 
</P>
<P>
 He was especially critical of the deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This high trade gap does not benefit either the United States or Japan," 
Brown said. "The deficit does support President Clinton's strong commitment to 
concrete initiatives to improve access to the Japanese market." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Hosokawa and his top economic strategists promised to put together a 
package of measures intended to open Japan's markets and avert a trade war with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the package have not been completed. But the measures will focus on 
promotion of imports, deregulation, tougher anti-monopoly enforcement and 
fairer government purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade specialists in the United States say such steps would be welcome, but 
they say the Japanese have promised such measures in the past without having 
much impact on their chronic trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade deficit with China amounted to $22.8 billion last year, second 
only to the imbalance with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials saw some hope for improvement in the coming months, noting that 
the trade gap for December was $7.4 billion worldwide, the smallest of the 
year. Tyson said non-government analysts had expected a monthly deficit in 
December to equal the average of about $10 billion for the previous 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other analysts were less optimistic. The National Assn. of Business 
Economists predicted this week that the trade deficit for 1994 will increase to 
$135 billion, and in 1995 to $137 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual trade figures are closely watched as a barometer of the nation's 
competitiveness in international markets. In theory at least, a nation must 
earn from exports the money it spends on imports. However, the United States 
seldom achieves that kind of balance. The last U.S. trade surplus was recorded 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. exports increased 3.7% to a record $464.8 billion last year. But imports 
rose 9% to $580.5 billion, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. exports to Central and South America exceeded imports from that region by 
$562 million, the only U.S. trade surplus with any region. Of that amount, the 
U.S. trade surplus with Mexico accounted for $155.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade deficit with the countries of Western Europe was $280 million 
last year. The previous year, the United States recorded a surplus of $6.4 
billion with Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, announced a half-point cut in its 
discount rate, to 5.25%, a step intended to push down interest rates throughout 
the German economy. As a result, the dollar gained slightly against the mark, a 
trend that is expected to slightly worsen the trade gap with Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * TAKING ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Japan says it will take "voluntary" measures to trim its trade surplus. D2

INFLATION INDICATOR HOLDS LINE AT ZERO; ECONOMY: BUT BOND YIELDS RISE ON 
ANOTHER REPORT SIGNALING POSSIBLE PRICE INCREASES AHEAD.

<P>
 Consumer prices remained flat in January, the first month in which costs 
failed to rise in more than four years, the Labor Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the zero growth in the consumer price index, a broad measure 
of ordinary living costs, reduces the need for the Federal Reserve Board to 
hike short-term interest rates -- as the Fed did earlier this month -- to curb 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, economists noted that the zero increase is somewhat misleading 
because the government is using a new method of calculation that is supposed to 
smooth out seasonal fluctuations. Under the old method, the CPI would have 
risen 0.3% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, economists said, the report is encouraging because the underlying 
rate of inflation -- excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- inched 
up a mere 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, bond market yields -- which initially fell Thursday following 
release of the CPI report -- later rose to 6 1/2-month highs following release 
of a report signaling possible inflation ahead. The "Business Outlook Survey" 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed a large number of companies 
reporting higher prices in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they were generally surprised by the reaction to the 
Philadelphia Fed report, given the positive consumer inflation news. 
</P>
<P>
 Flat consumer prices -- if they help keep interest rates low -- could be a 
balm to California, where economic recovery and job creation have lagged the 
rest of the nation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more invisible than one of your buddies being unemployed," said Joseph 
Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. But if the value 
of money isn't eroding and interest rates aren't climbing, he said, both 
consumers and businesses are in a better position to spur economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing the continuing discrepancy between Southern California's economy and 
the rest of the nation, consumer prices rose 0.2% in the five-county 
metropolitan Los Angeles area. Higher housing costs led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy prices dropped during the month, both nationally and in the Los Angeles 
region, according to Labor Department figures. Nationally, energy prices were 
down 0.8% in January, reflecting a surplus of oil supplies on the world market, 
and gasoline prices fell 0.4% after a 1.2% December drop. Home heating oil, 
electricity and natural gas prices also declined. 
</P>
<P>
 In the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura, 
costs of fuels and other utilities dropped 0.4% from December. Gasoline prices 
were down 2.4% in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 James Padinha, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said 
that "there are some weird things going on" causing fuel costs to fall, and "we 
don't expect energy prices to keep doing this over the next months." Padinha 
expects the consumer price index in all of 1994 to increase about 3%, as it has 
in each of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 January's unchanged national index was the lowest since a similar report in 
August, 1989. Analysts had expected an increase of 0.3% in the CPI, following 
the 0.2% growth in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the national scene, there's no question that inflation for the time being 
is a non-event in America," said Wahed of Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fed has dropped broad hints that another credit tightening will 
occur soon, Wahed said: "Now inflation is the last thing we have to worry 
about. Why beat a dead horse? In the next few months, we can take a look at 
interest rates again." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, food prices fell 0.1% in January, led by lower-priced fruits and 
vegetables, following a 0.5% December rise. Entertainment and medical costs 
were key areas of higher prices, both up 0.3% for the second straight month.

NEW SUPPLY SHIP ALREADY NEEDS A TUG; MILITARY: A CRASH DURING SEA TRIALS CAUSED 
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. IT MARKS THE LATEST SETBACK IN THE TROUBLED NASSCO PROGRAM. 
</P>

 The Navy is planning a big bash next week to celebrate the commissioning of 
Supply, its newest cargo supply ship in San Diego, built by National Steel & 
Shipbuilding Co. But what few know is that the vessel, of a design known as 
AOE-6, has a severely damaged propeller. After the ceremony, it will be towed 
to a Navy shipyard for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it seemed the Navy was finally going to get its troubled AOE-6 -- 
after more than three years of schedule delays, massive cost overruns and 
technical snafus -- the big vessel was involved in an accident that received 
virtually no notice. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing its sea trials prior to delivery in December, a tugboat 
pushing the ship to the dock slipped under the AOE-6's hull and took a couple 
of hard whacks from one of the ship's 26-foot-diameter propellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident tore a gash in the tug, the Pacific Queen, operated by Foss 
Maritime. The collision also bent the fast combat support ship's bronze 
propeller, according to Lt. Tracy Slack, the Coast Guard's senior investigating 
officer in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a big-money case," said Slack, who would not speculate as to who was at 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 A government investigator said preliminary estimates of the damage are likely 
to run to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Navy has not decided whether to 
repair or replace the propeller, said John Goodwin, a Navy shipbuilding 
official in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Richie, vice president of operations for Foss Maritime, said he hopes the 
government will pay for the $40,000 damage done to his tug. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goodwin said the accident was not the government's fault because the ship 
was under the control of Nassco and Foss Maritime. Nassco executives could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a nine-month guarantee," Goodwin said. "Anything that the contractor 
is responsible for will be replaced under warranty." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Navy had identified about 5,000 deficiencies after the ship 
completed its first sea trials last year. After a second set of trials, known 
as the acceptance trials, the number of deficiencies was reduced to 2,500, 
Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin said the ship could move under its own power, but with the bent 
propeller, the Navy will tow it around in crowded San Diego Harbor. Despite the 
mishaps and troubled history, Goodwin remarked: "It is a gorgeous ship. It is a 
showcase." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has many similarities to the first flight of the B-2 bomber. 
Shortly after that first flight, the Air Force spent several months fixing 
problems on the new airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 The AOE-6 is Nassco's largest and most important program, though the firm has 
received additional contracts in the past year that have given the shipyard new 
life. The project to build four AOE-6 ships is $677 million over budget, an 
increase of 72% from its original contract, according to Navy documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery of the first ship is three years behind schedule, in large part 
because of problems in a special transmission with a reverse gear that was 
designed by the Italian navy.

 GE, Swiss Firm Charged With Fixing Diamond Prices: General Electric Co., De 
Beers Centenary of Switzerland and two executives were indicted by a federal 
grand jury on charges of conspiring to raise and fix the price of industrial 
diamonds around the world. The Justice Department said the two firms have 80% 
of the market in industrial diamonds, which are man-made gems used in saws to 
cut stone and concrete, in bits for oil drilling and in machine tools.The 
one-count indictment, returned in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, 
charged that the price-fixing scheme was carried out by GE manager Peter Frenz 
and De Beers associate Philippe Liotier beginning in 1991. It said the 
increased prices went into effect worldwide in February and March, 1992.

 Health Club Settles Charges: Bally's Holiday Spa Health Club has agreed to pay 
$138,062 to settle false-advertising charges in connection with a membership 
promotion, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said.Bally's, with 48 
spas in Southern California, did not admit wrongdoing. The district attorney's 
office said Bally's had advertised a $15-a-month membership fee but did not 
clearly disclose that use of facilities was limited to three days a week during 
specific hours. In addition, Bally's had failed to provide Spanish-speaking 
people with contracts in Spanish, as required by law. As part of the 
settlement, Bally's has agreed to work with members to resolve complaints.

JAPAN TO COMPILE 'VOLUNTARY' TRADE PACKAGE; RELATIONS: BID TO TRIM SURPLUS WILL 
FOCUS ON IMPORTS, INVESTMENTS, DEREGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Under the threat of U.S. sanctions, Japan announced Thursday that it will 
compile a broad package of "voluntary" measures to trim its trade surplus. The 
package will focus on promotion of imports and foreign investment, 
deregulation, anti-monopoly enforcement and fairer government procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must draw up more concrete and visible measures as soon as possible," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said after Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa held an emergency meeting with his top trade negotiators to discuss 
steps Japan could take to head off a possible trade war. "I would stress that 
the prime minister is serious when he says 'urgent,' " Takemura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura urged that Washington "act cautiously in deciding whether to 
implement unilateral measures" against Japan. He indicated that Japan hopes to 
announce details of the market-opening package before finance ministers and 
central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven industrial nations meet in Frankfurt 
on Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was concurrent with the release of a report showing that the 
U.S. trade deficit with Japan grew to almost $60 billion in 1993, the worst gap 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was met with criticism from U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale, 
who said the Japanese government's four-point program isn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is an open market," he said in a forceful manner that seemed to 
depart sharply from past postures of counseling patience. "We have not seen 
anything along that line. The fact is that the government is not deregulating, 
not opening up the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said vague promises of deregulation must be followed up with concrete 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures under consideration by Japan include steps that had been under 
discussion in trade talks with the United States. Those negotiations failed to 
reach an agreement in time for the recent Washington summit between Hosokawa 
and President Clinton. Measures under consideration include actions to improve 
the speed and openness of government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment and changes aimed at making it easier for foreign 
companies to penetrate Japan's insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials also said Hosokawa may send a special envoy to Washington 
to try to head off trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Japanese officials stood firm Thursday on a dispute over access to 
Japan's cellular phone market by Motorola Inc. Washington accuses Japan of 
having broken a 1989 agreement on the dispute and has taken the first step 
toward imposing retaliatory sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Masahito Tani, deputy minister of posts and telecommunications, said Japan 
will not negotiate under the threat of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little Japan can do to avert the threat of U.S. sanctions in the 
cellular phone market, Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and 
telecommunications, told reporters Thursday.

RATES CLIMB ON A HINT OF INFLATION TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * The bond market brushed off a surprisingly tame January 
inflation report and zeroed in on a lesser economic indicator, sending 
long-term bond yields shooting up to 6 1/2-month highs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market seesawed to a lower level as technical forces intensified 
selling, incited by rising interest rates and lingering wariness about 
inflation. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds zoomed from Wednesday's 6.46% to close at 
6.54%, the highest level since early August, as traders dumped bonds with a 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's abrupt turnabout reflected a new market psychology colored 
by the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board is inclined to raise 
short-term rates at any sign of inflationary pressure, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The market initially showed a favorable reaction to Thursday's government 
report of a flat consumer price index in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But later, traders began to focus on an economic report from the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Its regular regional manufacturing survey showed 
what many took to be signs of impending inflation: None of the manufacturers 
responding to the survey reported lower supply prices this month, but more than 
30% said raw materials prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough to raise worries that inflation could re-emerge as a problem 
and prompted widespread selling in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the damage was in long-term bonds. Shorter-term yields were only 
marginally higher. The yield on three-month T-bills closed at 3.35%, up from 
3.34% on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 And many bond pros believe that, at worst, the 30-year T-bond yield could hit 
6.75% soon. After that, many experts believe rates will fall again by midyear, 
because economic growth is expected to moderate. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The stock market was shaken by the bond market's slide, but prices climbed 
back from their worst levels. Off 27 points at midday, the Dow industrials 
ended down 14.63 points at 3,922.64.  
</P>
<P>
 Most broader market indexes also were off marginally, though losers 
outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange in active 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial burst of stock buying in the morning subsided when the bond market 
abruptly reversed course and lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the profit taking wasn't as severe as many analysts expected, given the 
severity of the bond market's drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Losses in the Dow were concentrated in International Paper, down 1 to 74 
1/2; 3M Co., down 1 1/2 to 108, and Procter & Gamble, down 1 1/4 to 58 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive financial stocks were also weak, with insurer American 
International Group down 1 to 88 7/8 and Federal National Mortgage off 1 3/4 to 
85. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's winners, Boeing rose 1 1/4 to 47 3/4 and McDonnell Douglas 
added 7/8 to 119 3/4, continuing to rise on news of a major Saudi plane order. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raytheon fell 3 1/2 to 62 after the Army said it selected a new Loral 
missile to upgrade the current Patriot anti-missile system over Raytheon's 
multiple-mode missile. Loral rose 3/8 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valassis Communications surged 5 3/4 to 17 1/2. Rival Sullivan Marketing 
said it will sell its coupon insert business to a competing unit of News Corp., 
in effect ending a yearlong price war between Valassis and Sullivan, which has 
resulted in price declines in the newspaper coupon business of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 * International Game Technology added 1 1/8 to 28 1/4 after Smith Barney 
raised the firm's investment rating to "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended 
off 120.72 points at 18,931.39 as arbitrage-linked buying kicked in at the 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 lost 7.89 points to 2,128.72, though after the close 
the German central bank cut interest rates. London's FTSE-100 index gained 7.6 
points to 3,425.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 4.71 points to 2,775.52. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar edged lower against the German mark despite an interest rate cut 
by Germany's central bank. The greenback was mixed against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.S. currency closed at 1.722 German marks, down from 
Wednesday's 1.723. It rose to 104.17 Japanese yen from 103.80 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the New York Comex, gold closed at $382.80 an ounce, off 80 cents, while 
silver fell 4.4 cents to $5.230 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures prices rebounded from a two-month low as two OPEC members 
expressed support for production cuts, but analysts doubted the cartel will 
act. Light, sweet crude oil for March delivery ended 30 cents higher on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange at $14.23 a barrel.

 Transamerica Earnings Up 92%: Transamerica Corp. said its fourth-quarter 
profit nearly doubled, boosted by strong performances by its Los Angeles-based 
life insurance operations and real estate services businesses. The company 
earned $22.8 million, or 24 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 
31.Net income was $11.9 million, or 6 cents a share, for the same period of 
1992. The results included the effect of extraordinary loss for debt retirement 
and investment losses in 1993, investment gains in 1992 and discontinued 
operations in both years. Revenue totaled $1.2 billion for the final quarters 
of both 1992 and 1993. For the year, Transamerica's profit rose to $377.4 
million, or $4.51 a share, 55% above 1992's earnings of $243.2 million, or 
$2.83 a share. Revenue for the year edged up 4% to $4.8 billion from $4.6 
billion.

PRICE WAR TALK STIRS UP BEVERAGE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A price war may be brewing in ready-to-drink iced tea, even though it is still 
winter, with market leader Snapple's stock falling Thursday on talk of price 
cuts from Lipton, its nearest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple Beverage Corp.'s stock slipped $2.75 to $28 in Nasdaq trading after an 
analyst voiced concerns about competitive pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 Iced teas account for about 55% of Snapple's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Hambrecht & Quist analyst John-Michel Valette said Lipton iced tea, second in 
sales to market leader Snapple, could be applying price pressure in Denver, an 
important test market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I saw the first signs that Pepsi (producer of Lipton iced teas) may 
be taking a very aggressive posture on price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited a Denver supermarket chain flyer advertising two-for-a-dollar Lipton 
iced tea. The usual price is 79 cents each. Snapple sells for 89 cents in that 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a price war, this would be extremely regrettable for the beverage 
industry," said Jesse Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest newsletter.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing the example of branded soft drinks, Meyers said that "price discounting 
has made soft drinks commodities." 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple had no comment on the stock move or on the analysts' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it has plans to introduce new drinks in its 58 fruit drink 
and iced tea lines in 1994, including mango-flavored tea, and kiwi-strawberry 
and mango soda.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: ALLURING FOREIGN BOND FUNDS CAN BE RISKY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine two cars on opposite ends of a roller coaster, and you'll get the 
picture on the sudden divergence between U.S. interest rates and rates in most 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. rates are climbing as investors focus on our economy's strength. But in 
Europe, Japan and Latin America, rates remain on a downward slope because 
economic weakness still is the rule abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, we saw new supporting evidence for both trends. Yields on 30-year 
U.S. Treasury bonds jumped to 6.54% -- the highest since August -- as investors 
anticipated inflation rising as the U.S. economy revs up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Germany's central bank cut its short-term discount rate to 5.25% 
from 5.75%. It was another in a string of cuts aimed at priming the German 
economy for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 For the millions of Americans who own bonds or bond mutual funds, the polar 
difference between the interest rate outlook here and the outlook abroad is no 
minor issue: The simple fact is, rising rates here are eating away at U.S. 
bonds' principal values, while foreign bonds are appreciating as market rates 
slide elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, is it time to trade your U.S. Treasury or corporate bond fund for a 
foreign fund? On the surface, at least, that looks like a smart move. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, long-term bond yields abroad are generally higher or just 
slightly lower than U.S. yields, which means you may be able to grab a higher 
current yield than what you're earning in a U.S. fund (depending on when you 
bought your U.S. fund).  
</P>
<P>
 Second, the likelihood of foreign rates declining further is strong, because 
there's no sign of economic recovery in Europe or Japan. "The Europeans figure 
they're 18 months behind us" in their economy, said Carl Ericson, manager of 
the Colonial Strategic Income mixed-bond fund in Boston. Eighteen months ago, 
of course, the United States thought it was still mired in recession, and 
interest rates were ratcheting ever lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in 1993, though U.S. interest rates were still falling for much of the 
year, foreign rates fell faster. The result: The average foreign bond fund 
produced a total return (yield plus share-price appreciation) of 17% last year, 
according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York. In contrast, 
the average U.S. government bond fund's total return was 9.3% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the numbers make foreign bonds look like a layup. They aren't. 
The risk in buying foreign bonds today is substantial, experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with currency risk. If our economy continues to expand while Europe 
flounders, a natural side effect should be a stronger dollar. When the dollar 
rises, it automatically devalues foreign securities held by Americans -- which 
means you can lose money, on paper, even if foreign interest rates fall and 
your foreign bonds appreciate in their home country. 
</P>
<P>
 A bond fund can attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations using futures 
and options, and many do. But hedging costs money, and it doesn't always work 
as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 For a reminder of the pitfalls in foreign currency fluctuations, think back to 
the trauma to Europe's monetary system in 1992, when European nations suffered 
from a mass devaluation of their currencies. The result was havoc in many 
U.S.-based foreign bond funds, hedged and unhedged. That year, the average 
world bond fund's total return was a paltry 2.82%, even though nominal yields 
on the funds were over 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greater risk today in foreign bonds is political, said Robert Di 
Clemente, economist at Salomon Bros. in New York. Japan is obviously in a 
political uproar over the trade row with America. In Europe, elections loom in 
Italy (March), Germany (October) and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 With high unemployment and social strife across Europe, Di Clemente said 
politicians could be tempted to choose re-inflation (i.e., heavy government 
spending) as a way out. If that happens, interest rates could reverse in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, before you dump your U.S. bond fund because interest rates are rising 
here, remember that the rise has been going on since last fall. Di Clemente and 
many other pros believe that long-term U.S. yields are closer to a near-term 
top than a bottom. This may be the wrong time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you can accept the risks in foreign bonds, they may make sense for a 
portion (say, 20% to 25%) of your bond portfolio. If you don't want to buy a 
foreign fund directly (most fund companies offer them), you can get foreign 
diversification another way: Choose a "flexible" or "mixed" bond fund that can 
invest in any type of bond. Most of them own at least some foreign issues.

2 ACCUSED OF RUNNING WORKERS' COMP FRAUD RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were arrested Thursday and charged with running a workers' 
compensation insurance fraud ring that state investigators say has bilked 
insurance companies and doctors of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Phillip Fleder, 30, of West Hills is charged with 56 counts of 
insurance fraud and 19 counts of grand theft.He is expected to be arraigned 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 The other suspect was identified as Paul Stanzione, 27, a claims examiner for 
Republic Indemnity Co. in San Diego. He is charged with 21 counts of insurance 
fraud and nine counts of grand theft and is also due to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Stanzione referred workers' compensation 
claimants to doctors working under agreements with Fleder's companies. The 
claimants received legitimate treatment from the doctors, who in turn sent 
claims to Fleder's companies, Falcon Medical Services and Medical Specialist 
Group, both based in Malibu, the documents allege. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleder's firms then created inflated bills to submit to Republic for payment, 
or submitted additional, phony bills, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the state Department of Insurance said Fleder is also believed 
to have defrauded doctors by withholding insurance payments intended for them.

JET DEAL MAY VIOLATE GATT, AIRBUS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $6-billion U.S.-Saudi aircraft deal announced by President Clinton on 
Wednesday might be in violation of recently concluded world trade talks, 
according to Airbus Industrie, the European plane manufacturers consortium.  
</P>
<P>
 If the United States allowed Saudi Arabia to reschedule payments on military 
equipment orders as an incentive to buy the planes, the deal would violate 
GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Airbus spokesman Sean Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Saudi Arabia will upgrade its flagship Saudia Airlines with 50 
planes made by Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. Airbus, a four-nation 
consortium, had been vigorously wooing the Saudis and was expected to be 
awarded at least part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said Saudia has not told Airbus of its decision. "As of today, we have not 
had any information from Saudia or confirmation or rejection of our proposal 
for aircraft," he said in a telephone interview from the consortium's 
headquarters in Toulouse in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbus employees were taken aback at Clinton's personal announcement of the 
deal, an Airbus executive said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has strongly criticized Airbus for receiving what it calls official 
subsidies from the governments of the four countries that make up the 
consortium -- France, Germany, Britain and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbus counters that its "launch aid" is instead loans that are repaid 
regularly and that American aircraft manufacturers themselves benefit from 
indirect subsidies in the form of U.S. military research and development 
contracts, resulting in such planes as the Boeing 707 and 747 and the MD-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a catalogue of hypocrisy here," the Airbus executive said. "From the 
person accusing us of unfair support, it's the most incredibly overt sales 
campaign we've ever seen. (Clinton) has basically gone and sold his aircraft. 
It looks very much like Airbus versus the President of the United States."

 * Theater: Broadway theaters and the visitors they attract contribute 
approximately $2.3 billion to the economy of New York City, according to a 
study. Citing a ripple effect of spending on hotels, restaurants, stores and 
taxis by tourists drawn to New York primarily by Broadway, the study concludes 
that theater supports more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and contributes 
$142 million in state and local taxes.Of all economic activity generated by 
arts-motivated tourists, the report attributes a full 60% to the draw of 
Broadway. The report was prepared for the League of American Theatres and 
Producers by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a supplement to 
its study "The Arts as an Industry," which was released in October.AMY HARMON

BREAKING INTO POPCORN'S MARKET ; THEATERS: TWO YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS FIND SUCCESS 
WITH TASTE OF NATURE SNACK FARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Moviehouse snack counters historically have been willing to sell theatergoers 
anything as long as it crunched and came with or without a butter-like 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Popcorn -- or so the industry truism goes -- was the staple of the theater 
operator, maybe more than the film itself. But two young Los Angeles 
entrepreneurs have been turning a tasty profit by targeting movie audiences 
with a line of healthier, or at least hipper, snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In little more than 18 months, Douglas Chu and Scott Samet have managed to 
sell their bulk trail mixes, dried fruits and yogurt-covered snacks to 
concession stands serving 1,000-plus movie screens in 25 states -- and they are 
hungrily eyeing the remaining 24,000 or so screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since more people are eating healthier these days, the idea was to bring some 
healthier snacks into the theaters," said Samet, who started Taste of Nature 
with Chu in mid-1992 with only $15,000. "The growth has been explosive." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu and Samet refuse to reveal their exact revenue, but they say they're 
plowing all their profit back into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a modest debut at Metropolitan Theaters' Santa Barbara 
operations but has spread to snack counters at nearly two dozen other chains, 
including AMC, General Cinema, Edwards and Cineplex Odeon. The latest sales 
have been to theaters in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would work in Tennessee," said Chu, who, like his partner, 
is 25. "But hell, it's going through the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 Samet and Chu trace their success to the unusual product display and to the 
snacks' unexpectedly broad appeal. Taste of Nature's customers, their research 
has shown, come from the mass of moviegoers -- estimated at one-half to 
two-thirds of the audience -- who weren't snack buyers. That trend allays the 
fears of theater owners who don't want to trade high-profit popcorn sales for 
other items, Samet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought our demographics would be the yuppie, health-conscious, young 
adult and females who were watching their waistlines," Chu said. "Then we sold 
Barstow." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie concession business, which took in nearly $1.5 billion in 1993, has 
tried many different items in recent years to increase customer interest, said 
Charles A. Winans, executive director of the Chicago-based National Assn. of 
Concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been different fads that have come and gone," Winans said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the 85-screen Harkins Theaters chain, the Taste of Nature snacks have "gone 
over very well," said Vice President Wayne Kullander. The Phoenix-based chain 
emphasizes gourmet items, including imported chocolates and bottled waters. 
</P>
<P>
 And while these treats may be healthier than, say, the industrial-size Milk 
Duds with a cola chaser, don't expect to slim down with this stuff. A 
five-ounce bag of dried apricots weighs in at nearly 500 calories. And trail 
mix? Don't even ask. "It's just an attempt by us to give people an 
alternative," Kullander said.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: ROD TURNER, CHIEF OF KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Turner, president and chief executive of La Crescenta-based multimedia 
software firm Knowledge Adventure, has left the company. The firm's chairman 
and founder, Bill Gross, will assume Turner's duties on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, an experienced manager of high-growth companies whom Gross himself 
helped recruit last year, said he and Gross had fundamental disagreements about 
how to guide the fledgling educational software firm. "Basically, we weren't 
able to agree on the way forward," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But both sides said the conflict was mainly one of style. Gross, who has a 
reputation as a creative genius, is said to have clashed with Turner's more 
traditional management style. Knowledge Adventure, whose investors include 
Paramount Communications Inc. and AT&T, is regarded as one of the most 
promising start-ups in the fast-growing multimedia industry.  
</P>
<P>
 * Actor Billy Crystal's Face Productions named Lynne Boyarsky vice president 
of production. She previously was vice president of development at Wildwood 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jess Wittenberg was named senior vice president of business and legal 
affairs with Castle Rock Entertainment, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
 * QVC Network Inc. said it's changing its name to QVC Inc. and announced a 
corporate reorganization, including the retirement of President and co-founder 
Michael Boyd. Boyd will continue to consult for the home shopping channel, 
which also announced that Douglas Briggs has been promoted to the new position 
of QVC Electronic Retailing.

EX-N.Y. POST SUITOR HOFFENBERG ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Hoffenberg, the former head of scandal-ridden Towers Financial Corp. 
and once a suitor for the New York Post newspaper, was arrested Thursday and 
charged with securities fraud and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal charges relate to a civil suit filed last year by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission that accused Hoffenberg and Towers, now in bankruptcy, 
of using false financial statements to sell more than $400 million in 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities regulators consider the criminal case a key move toward stopping 
the flamboyant debt collector from continuing to operate or open new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffenberg, 48, was expected to be released on a $1-million bond Thursday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending SEC civil suit accuses him of cheating 2,800 investors in 40 
states, but authorities said Hoffenberg is still in business, with two new 
companies in New York: Stratford Credit Corp. and Haley Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffenberg is charged with one count of criminal securities fraud and one 
count of obstruction of justice. If convicted, he could be sentenced to as many 
as 15 years in prison and fined up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers bought unpaid medical accounts and tried to collect them. Two of its 
subsidiaries have also been targets of legal actions in New Jersey and 
California for improperly holding debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing Towers proceedings said in 
a lawsuit that he had found evidence of theft and squandering of more than $400 
million. That suit seeks treble damages of $1.2 billion.

BEYOND PETER RABBIT; NEW EXHIBIT SHOWCASES THE THREE BEATRIX POTTERS: ARTIST, 
CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHER AND PIONEERING CONSERVATIONIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is writer Alison Lurie's contention in "Don't Tell the Grown-Ups" that many 
of the best-loved books of childhood are paeans to misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories youngsters read when no adult is looming over them are filled with 
acts of rebellion, committed by small creatures who manage to escape all but 
the most trivial of the dire consequences their elders insist will befall them. 
Children love the literature of subversion, Lurie argues persuasively. 
</P>
<P>
 Few books fit as neatly into Lurie's paradigm as those of Beatrix Potter, 
whose world is the subject of an exhibit that had originally been planned for 
the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's Burbank satellite, now 
closed temporarily because of earthquake damage. At press time, museum 
officials announced that the exhibit opening would be delayed until March 1 and 
moved to the main museum downtown, at 900 Exposition Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Through the Garden Gate: The World of Beatrix Potter," the exhibit 
includes enlarged story boards of Potter's first and favorite story, "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit," first editions of her distinctive small-format books, family 
photographs, more than 40 of her meticulous watercolors of fungi and an 
original painting of one of the world's best known frogs, Jeremy Fisher, in his 
lily pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will enter the exhibit area through a very Victorian trellis. Inside 
there's a tunnel small children can crawl through just as an adventuresome 
bunny might. There is also a computer featuring a game in which players try to 
decipher phrases written in the secret code Potter invented when she was 14 and 
used for the journal she kept until she was 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized last year by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to 
mark 100 years of Peter Rabbit. Peter first appeared in 1893 as the rebellious 
protagonist of an illustrated letter Potter wrote to cheer up the ailing 
5-year-old son of her former governess. In 1900, Potter borrowed the letter 
back, expanded it into a book with a drawing for every page and sent it to six 
publishers. All of them rejected it. A major stumbling block was the pint-sized 
format Potter insisted on. The book had be small enough to accommodate little 
hands and to be carried easily to the places children go, including to bed. In 
1901, she finally had 250 copies of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" printed at her 
own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Museum's Laura Lee Martin says the same question kept popping up 
when the museum announced it planned to do a Potter show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't she just write children's books?" people asked. Martin is indignant at 
the very thought. "Potter was infinitely more than just a spinster who dabbled 
in picture books," says Martin, who cites Potter's lesser known achievements as 
an amateur scientist and pioneering conservationist. And, indeed, Potter 
married at 47, at which time she concentrated on raising sheep rather than 
writing books. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-taught naturalist, Potter began sketching whatever scurried or bloomed 
as a child and was soon dissecting mice, owls and foxes, then boiling their 
skeletons and reassembling them. A lover of mushrooms as well as ducks and 
hedgehogs, she was the first person in Great Britain to propagate certain 
fungi. She also theorized, correctly, that lichens represent the marriage of a 
fungus and an alga. But Potter was born (in England in 1866) into a world that 
thought that only the trousered could do science. When one of her papers was 
read before the prestigious Linnean Society, her uncle had to make the 
presentation. Women could neither belong nor attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibit presents the three Beatrix Potters in their own words and with 
their own images," says Martin. "The young artist, who began painting as a 
lonely child. The woman who saw publishing children's books as a way to achieve 
financial independence from her rigid parents. And the conservationist, who, 
before her death in 1943, managed to protect more than 4,000 acres of Britain's 
fragile Lake District from development." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Potter found a publisher, she became a phenomenon. In 1902, Frederick 
Warne & Co. published 8,000 copies of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" with 
watercolor illustrations. It had sold 50,000 copies by the end of 1903. Many of 
her 20-plus children's books still sell briskly. First editions and other 
special copies are highly collectible. Books of Wonder, a Beverly Hills shop 
that specializes in children's literature, is currently offering signed copies 
of two of her books, "Ginger and Pickles" and "The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies," 
for $1,500 apiece. Uninscribed copies of the privately printed first edition of 
"The Tale of Peter Rabbit" command $45,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cart, a Los Angeles-based expert on children's literature, attributes 
Potter's remarkable success to her genius and to the fact that she was the 
first English writer/illustrator to create books for preschoolers. But Cart 
also thinks clever marketing has fueled almost a century of Pottermania. "Peter 
Rabbit was probably the first so-called licensed character in children's 
literature," says Cart. Potter put her imprimatur on dolls, wallpaper and even 
bedroom slippers based on her characters. And Warne has been as assiduous as 
Disney in collecting its share of every bunny-bearing crib sheet and coloring 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 But savvy marketing isn't everything. Something deeper and darker explains why 
children grow quiet time after time as they hear how Peter outwits Mr. McGregor 
and pays no greater price than having to swallow a dose of chamomile tea. 
Potter never patronizes her young readers. She always includes a difficult word 
in her stories. And her work is underpinned by her vast knowledge of nature. 
Nature is sometimes cruel in her stories, but it rings true, as do her 
illustrations. Like Maurice Sendak, she eschews the merely cute. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter probably turned to nature for the same reason that she turned to her 
own imagination -- because her childhood was characterized by powerlessness, 
repression and aching loneliness. And whose is not? Potter created her tales 
with an acute understanding of what both nature and the imagination can do. 
They can give us surcease from the ache of self, if only for as long as it 
takes to plumb the mysteries of a mushroom or gobble a radish with a very 
plucky bunny. Where and When What: "Through the Garden Gate: The World of 
Beatrix Potter."

COYOTE AS GUIDING SPIRIT; JENNIFER TAUB'S DRAMA, SET IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO, IS 
INFUSED WITH A SENSE OF THE SUPERNATURAL. SHE UTILIZES THE NAVAJOS' CRAFTY 
CREATURE, WHICH IS A TRICKSTER AND CAN TRANSCEND DEATH.

<P>
 Ask anyone who has been there and they'll tell you about how the landscape 
stretches to the horizon, bordering the gigantic sky like a supernatural 
painting, and how the air is either impossibly clean or heavy with the power of 
an electrical storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Jennifer Taub about northern New Mexico and she'll tell you more. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, after all, the place where she was riding in a hot-air balloon in 
1987 with a group of elderly women when the balloon suddenly descended far from 
its intended destination. When -- as Taub explains it -- you drop out of the 
sky, land in an uninhabited, wild place, and begin searching on foot for help. 
You become extremely aware of the landscape around you. 
</P>
<P>
 "We eventually found people and got back," she says, "but while I was there, I 
was so struck with a sense of how large the place was, and how small I was. It 
made me sense my own mortality." 
</P>
<P>
 Something was bubbling up inside her, she says, and it seemed to come out 
later that night: "I was back at my motel in Santa Fe and I did this totally 
crazy thing. An electrical storm was blowing through, and I just ran outside 
next to the pool, and looked at it, almost mesmerized." 
</P>
<P>
 There are less risky ways to be inspired to write a play, but Taub's way 
resulted in her first full-length work, "Coyote in the Blue Mountains," playing 
at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks. It straddles the disparate worlds of 
a pent-up Los Angeles and a more spiritually potent Taos, N.M., the dual homes 
of Marty, an artist-victim of the nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the 'down-winders,' " Taub says, referring to victims of 
radiation exposure during the United States' aboveground nuclear bomb tests of 
the 1950s. "Technically, her New Mexican family would have been unlikely to be 
affected by the tests, but her disease isn't really the play's center. It's a 
play about hybrids: Her family is intermarried Pueblo and Navajo; David, the 
man she falls for, begins as a manipulative lawyer and ends up spiritually 
transformed; John and Fran, Marty's friends, cross back and forth between love 
and hate." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only character in Taub's world who resists hybridization is 
Marty's uncle, Tio, who exists above the fray, unswervingly faithful to the 
peyote-based religion that is still strong in the U.S. Southwest and northern 
Mexico. "Tio believes in the old gods," says the playwright-producer-actor, in 
her late 20s, who also plays Marty in director Bruce Whitney's staging. "He's 
not very old, but old enough so that all of his friends are dead. That's why he 
hangs out in graveyards all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Taub wrinkles her face at any mention of New Age spiritual thinking, which she 
takes pleasure in dismissing as "ersatz." But, she says, she does believe, with 
the Navajo, in ghosts. And the guiding spirit behind her play is the coyote 
figure himself -- that alternately clownish, bumbling and crafty creature that 
is ubiquitous in Native American literature. Coyote literally appears in "Blue 
Mountains," but Taub's strategy is to suggest coyote through David, who's a 
little conniving, a little sexy and a little lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to conjure up the coyote figure of the Southwest, which is very 
different from California, where tribes depicted him as goofy. In the region of 
Arizona and New Mexico," she says, "he's both a trickster who can screw things 
up, and passes through death, transcending it. What I like about the Navajo 
view of dying is that their coyote figure can say, 'Boo!' to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the theme of death seems to have a life for Taub: Her play in progress 
is about the Mexican Day of the Dead celebration in Los Angeles. "You can see 
that I'm into it," she says, pointing at a living room table filled with a 
collection of calaveras , those playful Day of the Dead figurines. 
</P>
<P>
 The production is the culmination of five years of workshops, readings and 
rewrites, some at Taub's artistic home, the Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble. 
Vince Melocchi, who portrays John, first glimpsed the script in fall of '93: 
"I'm a huge football fan, and I thought I'd scan it over during game breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I got into it as I turned the pages, and I completely lost track of the 
game. I could also see Jennifer in it, especially Marty's strong will. That's 
Jennifer: intelligent, secure with who she is and what she wants in life."

THEATER REVIEW; HOLDING BACK ON TRAGEDY; 'THE PEN,' A PLAY OF SIN AND 
REDEMPTION, HAS PLENTY OF TEETH-GNASHING BUT LACKS PASSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just as surely as there's the African-American theater and the 
Mexican-American theater, there's the Irish-Catholic-American theater, and Paul 
T. Murray's drama "The Pen," at American Renegade Theatre, is the latest 
example of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest might suggest new. But "The Pen" is an old soul of a play, born of a 
belief in sin and redemption, in the triumph of good over evil, and in a story 
having a beginning, middle and end. It's also directed by Stephen Hastings with 
the almost-as-old belief in acting the Method Way. This is a barroom play with 
a lot of Scotch, and even more gnashing of teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Old soul or not, though, it simply takes something extra in the '90s to 
swallow this mixed potion. At points, it appears that Murray or Hastings' cast 
may provide it; but, in the end, nothing ever rises above the dusty "Playhouse 
90" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in some ways, it isn't up to that Method-driven tradition, the one that 
gave us "Marty" and "The Pawnbroker," or the Irish tradition of Eugene O'Neill 
and Brendan Behan -- two big shadows over "The Pen." Irish-Catholic drama has 
always had a fortified sense of tragedy, and Murray seems far too hesitant to 
provide it here.  
</P>
<P>
 The story, set in the '90s, describes what happens to the denizens of Old Town 
Tavern, run by old Specs (Paul Vent) in South Boston, when veteran hood Gags 
(C.J. Bau) gets out of the slammer and returns to the neighborhood. Because of 
10 years in the pen (one of the title's double meanings), Gags has missed out 
on the local "yuppiefication." It's all too much for Gags' protege, Jimbo 
(Charles Leon), who has picked up the crime life that Gags abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimbo is the classic character in this kind of theater, enacting the sin of 
the hero -- Gags -- and seeking redemption. Although Jimbo goes to great 
lengths to extol his mentor Gags, it becomes clear that Gags only wants to "be 
legit," leading to inevitable conflict between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this sure-fire formula for tragedy, Murray inserts Gags' one chance for 
goodness: Jimbo's mentally retarded brother, Stevie (Paul Gunning), who wants 
to do good but is seduced to do bad. (This is also how Murray's characters 
describe themselves.) There's no doubt that bad will happen here; but it's 
doubtful that so much good is the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pen" is a lot rosier than its aforementioned predecessors, which may 
suggest that the '90s are nicer than, say, the '50s. Or perhaps it suggests 
that there's a lack of nerve to put a full-blown tragedy on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, that Murray really believes people can save themselves -- a passion and 
conviction that requires more than this cast delivers. Too often, Leon as Jimbo 
appears to be doing his best Al Pacino number. But in any case, he doesn't 
convey enough requisite street toughness.  
</P>
<P>
 His real match is in Taylor Phillips as his gal, Lisa, who wills a marvelous 
quality of energy into a cliche-ridden character. The cliches get the better of 
Vent as the run-down bar owner, Gunning as the sweet, clueless Stevie and Myra 
Turley as the bar's bitter "alkie." 
</P>
<P>
 Bau and Sunny Reale, as Gags' old flame, deliver performances that are rich in 
back story and set off some palpable ghosts on stage. Those, too, are essential 
for the Irish-Catholic-American drama. You only wish that "The Pen" was a 
little less dusty, and a lot more haunting. Where and When What: "The Pen."

SWINGING WITHOUT JOHNNY; 'TONIGHT SHOW' ORCHESTRA KEEPS BUSY ON THE ROAD LONG 
AFTER THE FINAL BROADCAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On May 22, 1992, when NBC's "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" had its 
final broadcast, the curtain also fell on what was probably the longest-running 
job in music. For some people, like saxophonist Tommy Newsom, working with Doc 
Severinsen's orchestra had provided 30 years of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year-round job in music was almost unheard of," says Newsom, 64, who lives 
in Tarzana. "And then to think that it lasted that long, and occasionally 
they'd give you a raise. Not bad!" A Portsmouth, Va., native, the saxophonist 
also served as Severinsen's assistant conductor on the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Its end has not meant the demise of the band, however. Flashy trumpeter 
Severinsen has taken his orchestra, without the "Tonight Show" name, out on the 
road on several occasions, and has performed with the ensemble at the Playboy 
Jazz Festival and at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once, though, has the band played without him at the helm: as the Tommy 
Newsom orchestra, it performed outdoors last summer at Warner Park. 
</P>
<P>
 This evening, under the banner of the "Johnny Carson Big Band," the former 
"Tonight Show" musical gang makes its second appearance sans Severinsen. 
Gathering almost all the orchestra's regulars and using a handful of subs who 
actually played the show, the 17-piece band appears at the Castaways in 
Burbank. The performance is a benefit for Burbank-based Bridge Focus, a 
nonprofit social service agency that offers programs aimed at preventing drug, 
alcohol and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Conte Candoli, 65, of Sylmar, the jazz great who played with the 
band 20 years, organized the event. "This is my attorney's favorite charity, 
and I wanted to do something for him," he says. "All of the guys volunteered 
their services gratis." 
</P>
<P>
 And gladly, says Newsom. "Conte asked us, and everybody said 'Yes,' except a 
couple of guys, like Pete Christlieb, who will be out of town," he adds. "This 
is a good group of people and everybody loves to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup for tonight goes like this: Candoli, his brother Pete Candoli, 
Maury Harris, Chuck Findley and Snooky Young will play trumpets; Ernie Tack, 
Gil Falco and Charlie Loper, trombones; Newsom, John Bainbridge, Bill Perkins, 
Lee Callet and Brian Scanlon, saxophones. The rhythm section consists of Ross 
Tompkins, piano; John Leitham, bass; Bob Bain, guitar, and Ed Shaughnessy, 
drums. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Castaways, the band will play a concert set, and then two sets for 
dancing. Candoli says that compared to the band under Severinsen's aegis, 
"we'll play what I think is a wider selection of tunes, and play more 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
 "And we'll feature a lot of the individual members, which is a nice way to 
showcase the band," Newsom says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the arrangements will be Newsom's. They include a version of "Things 
Ain't What They Used to Be," showcasing Young; the classic "Stardust," 
spotlighting Findley, and "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart," featuring Newsom 
on alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a pleasure to play these tunes all the way through, which often 
didn't happen on the 'The Tonight Show,' " Candoli says. 
</P>
<P>
 And to play them for a receptive audience, Newsom adds. "This is a musical 
opportunity," he says. "We get to reunite the guys and have an audience that's 
tuned into what we're doing. They're coming there for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Candoli and Newsom, like most of the Carson show regulars, have kept busy 
since the show ended. Candoli has traveled numerous times to Europe -- he just 
got back from Spain and heads for Switzerland in April -- and appears in the 
United States, supporting his recent album, "Sweet Simon." Newsom, who says he 
plays "once in a blue moon" at Chadney's in Burbank, also is a regular at jazz 
parties and festivals. Where and When What: The Johnny Carson Big Band. 
Location: Castaways Starlight Ballroom, 1250 Harvard Blvd., Burbank. Hours: 8 
tonight. Price: $35. Call: For tickets, (213) 480-3232. For information, (818) 
563-5666.

ROCKABILLY REDUX; * JANIS MARTIN RETIRED IN THE '60S. LIKE MANY FANS, THE 
'FEMALE ELVIS' IS REDISCOVERING THE ROOTS OF ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Janis Martin retired from a brief but eventful rockabilly career in the early 
'60s, when she was just 21. She had been dubbed "the Female Elvis," no less, 
before bowing out for marriage and family. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Martin is a rock star only when she can work it into her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 That would include Saturday's performance at the Palomino in North Hollywood, 
marking her first visit to California. She will be traveling here from her day 
job at a golf club in Danville, Va., ready to wail on "My Boy Elvis," "Drug 
Store Rock 'n' Roll" and other vintage rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of us still around," Martin said of her pioneering generation 
of rock musicians. "And we can step back in time and be a star again for a week 
or two out of the year, and it really makes you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, some of 30 songs she recorded during her career for RCA and 
elsewhere began appearing on European album anthologies. And in 1982, the 
lingering overseas popularity of the rockabilly sound (as demonstrated by the 
chart-topping success of the Stray Cats abroad as well as here) prompted her to 
agree to perform at a British music festival. 
</P>
<P>
 She celebrated her 42nd birthday on stage there. "It was just amazing to walk 
out there and see the kids dressed like we did in the '50s, driving cars we did 
in the '50s. They paid good money to get hold of any model '50s car," Martin 
said. "They wore the ducktails, poodle skirts, the saddle oxfords, the 
off-the-shoulder blouses, everything. It was like stepping back in time." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, it's not just fashion or nostalgia that binds these new fans. 
"It's the raw sound," she said. "It's not all the synthesizers and electronic 
instruments and whatever. It's just basically the guitar, drums and stand-up 
bass. It's not polished." 
</P>
<P>
 The edgy power of that early rockabilly sound -- whether performed by Presley, 
Carl Perkins, Martin or others -- continues to inspire a later generation of 
players. Elements of rockabilly have reached the country music of singer Rosie 
Flores, the passionate roots rock of the Blasters and the intense 
neo-rockabilly of Reverend Horton Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some of these older rockabilly people who don't realize how much 
people love their music and listen to it every day," said Jim Heath, leader of 
Reverend Horton Heat. "Me and my girlfriend of three years listened to Janis 
Martin every day. She probably doesn't even realize there are people who do 
that every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's own inspiration had come while listening to blues. When Ruth Brown's 
voice came roaring from the radio one day, she understood what sort of music 
she wanted to play, and phased out the traditional country she had performed 
since she was 8 years old. "It was a combination of hillbilly music and black 
rhythm and blues," she said. "So they called it rockabilly." 
</P>
<P>
 She enjoyed some popular success. But when she returned from a USO tour 
married and pregnant at 17, that phase of her career soon ended. "That kind of 
blew the RCA career," she said, with little obvious regret. "They had spent so 
much money and time on publicity promoting the fresh-faced teen-age rocker, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fans tell her that the young voice that recorded all those old singles has 
only improved with the years. "There's not a day that goes by that I don't 
sing," Martin said. "Your voice is like a muscle; if you don't use it, it gets 
weak." Where and When What: Janis Martin, with the Dave and Deke Combo, and 
Ronnie Mack.

IT'S NOT CHURCH MUSIC; * LEADER JIM HEATH DESCRIBES REVEREND HORTON HEAT'S 
SOUND AS 'LATIN HEAVY METAL AS PLAYED BY A ROCKABILLY BAND.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The raw rockabilly sound of the trio Reverend Horton Heat has already hit the 
mu sic business big time, as far as singer-guitarist Jim Heath is concerned. He 
says he hasn't had to work a real job in at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Dallas trio is even riding to its gigs on a private tour bus, courtesy 
of label Interscope Records, retiring the old van that once carried Reverend 
Horton Heat to as many as 225 gigs a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week the band was in Chicago with producer Alain Jourgensen (front 
man to the post-industrial rock act Ministry), finishing work on a new album 
due in April. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the high-powered neo-rockabilly band has managed all this without 
musical compromise. In spite of all the attention that has come since last year 
-- all the press, the tour with Frank Black, the gigs in Russia, the possible 
role in the upcoming Lollapalooza Festival tour -- that manic Horton Heat sound 
remains as always, something Heath is proud to say "doesn't sound like we're 
trying to get a record deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we do," explains Heath, who grew up in Corpus Christi, Tex., 
listening to the old Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis records of 
his elder cousins. "This is our baby. We're not going to give it up and go back 
to college if we don't get a big record deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the band does have a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverend Horton Heat released two albums on the Seattle-based Sub-Pop label 
before being discovered by critics and becoming the focus of a record company 
bidding war last year that ultimately landed it at Interscope. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new album essentially finished, and tentatively titled "Liquor in the 
Front," the trio is embarking on a tour that will lead them to the Country Club 
in Reseda on Saturday, and keep them on the road for much of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect to hear at least a handful of the new album's selections, which Heath 
describes as "like Latin heavy metal as played by a rockabilly band. Melodic, 
but still hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to have a little bit more Latin influence than our other records," 
Heath says. "All my first bands had Chicano, Mexican American people in it. 
It's finally coming out in our music, and it's kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
 The album is also expected to be the band's first to include Horton Heat 
versions of outside material, including pungent renditions of Deep Purple's 
"Smoke on the Water" and Scott Joplin's rag "The Entertainer," both recorded on 
a lark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a little splice of us being drunk, basically," Heath says of the 
brief Joplin track. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Club show will also lean on the longstanding repertoire of the 
band that critic Chris Morris of the Los Angeles Reader terms "energetic and 
more than a little warped; they put a soulful twist into the oft-moribund 
conventions of neo-rockabilly." 
</P>
<P>
 How all this came about is more difficult to explain. Heath never intended to 
call himself Reverend Horton Heat or lead a band by that name. It was someone 
else's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 About six years ago, Heath, attempting a solo career, was desperate to win 
some gigs and earn enough money to move out of his room above a Dallas 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rats were so fat that they couldn't even walk right," he said. "And the 
roaches were so huge I had pet names for them, and they hung out in their own 
little area of my place. It was real disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 But the club's owner had faith in Heath, even if he insisted on calling him 
Horton. ("He said I just look like some guy who should be named Horton.") And 
the owner soon offered the starving rocker a weekly Monday night gig, if only 
he would streamline his surname into Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 By the day of the first show, this friend and club-owner had added Reverend, 
printed it up on fliers all over Dallas, and got it listed it in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Heath stepped on stage, the crowd was chanting, "Reverend! Reverend! 
Reverend!" 
</P>
<P>
 He put up with it. But he doesn't seem to mind the name now, as long as he can 
play his music. "It's fun. That's what everything that you do has got to be, or 
why do it?" Where and When What: Reverend Horton Heat, with the Flat Duo Jets 
and Big Sandy.

FOR THE THRILL OF REAL-LIFE DRAMA, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING ONE OF THE...; 
COURT WATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the old boys at the Van Nuys Courthouse trade war stories, recollecting 
their all-time favorites, the talk turns to stab wounds and tattoos, drug deals 
and death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 J.W. Steele is the senior member here. A retired aerospace worker, he's been 
prowling the courtrooms for 21 years. There's also Bill Shussett, who's been 
around for 17 years since he stopped working as an electrician, and another man 
referred to as the Pope because he blesses everyone. These guys are the regular 
court watchers at Van Nuys. They make a hobby of watching trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good trial is like a good detective novel," Steele says, nodding with 
visible satisfaction. "I've probably seen 15 or 20 defendants sentenced to the 
chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this pastime can be lurid. And when the boys recall the trial of a 
dentist charged with sexually molesting his patients, or the rapist who got 
caught because of a peculiar tattoo on a particular portion of his anatomy, it 
might be easy to dismiss court watching as mere voyeurism. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to it than that. Beneath all the gore -- and the Latin and 
legalese -- court watching offers a chance to see the law at work, an 
experience that can be, by turns, bewildering, exhilarating and frustrating. 
Given the intricacies of the American judicial system, it is often compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Judge John Fisher suggests, "it beats staying at home and 
watching the soap operas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Courthouse is the biggest and busiest in the San Fernando Valley. 
A great deal of public attention was recently focused here during the murder 
trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez. But just because the trial has ended doesn't 
mean that courthouse goings-on are any less interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys will grow even busier in coming months, as cases are transferred here 
from the San Fernando Courthouse, which will remain closed for up to a year 
because of earthquake damage. And even after the Menendez case becomes a faint 
memory, court officials and veteran watchers say, people who gained a taste for 
legal drama as a result of that proceeding will probably find even more 
interesting drama in less-celebrated trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the key to court watching. This hobby demands a keen eye and 
patience. It's all a matter of selection, the regulars say. They advise 
potential newcomers to know what's going on in the courthouse and what makes 
for good viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Courthouse encompasses more than a dozen Superior Court 
departments on seven floors. Adjacent trailers will house San Fernando's cases. 
And the Municipal Court building stands just across a promenade. On a given 
day, a half-dozen court watchers will roam the halls and walkways. Many are 
retired. Some are law students. Others simply have free time on their hands. 
They have learned the knack of sniffing out drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We walk around the different courtrooms," Shussett said. "We're friendly with 
the district attorneys and the judges. They usually let us know what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailiffs represent another source of information. At Van Nuys, Deputy Sheriff 
Maurice Hill -- the bailiff in Department P -- is the one to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let the guys know that there's a good case in E or in F," Hill said. "We 
also get a lot of students who like to sit in on court. I'll give whatever 
information I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Highly publicized trials provide juicy sound bites for the evening news, but 
often lousy viewing in person. They can plod along, weighed down by days, if 
not weeks, of closed hearings and expert testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule, we don't care for coroner's reports or psychiatric reports," 
Shussett said. "They get a psychiatrist up there and ask him about his 
credentials. That's all you have to ask a psychiatrist -- he'll be on the stand 
for two or three days talking about himself. There's not enough action for a 
day's listening." 
</P>
<P>
 Steele nodded in agreement. "We also don't care for jury instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Interpreters, too, drag out the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the time you form an opinion by someone's tone of voice," Steele 
said. "You lose that in translation." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesser-known cases -- be they for murder, medical malpractice or just 
divorce -- represent the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal cases begin with an arraignment and preliminary hearing, during which 
the defendant enters a plea and the prosecutor must provide enough evidence to 
have the case held over for trial. Such hearings can be of interest to novices, 
but veteran court watchers usually wait for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trials begin with opening statements by the prosecution and defense. These 
statements provide a useful indicator for choosy court watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have an idea of what's going on," Shussett said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the prosecution presents its case, calling witnesses and 
submitting physical evidence. The attorneys' strategies soon become apparent, 
and watching this chess match unfold can be every bit as fascinating as the 
facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The action often moves at a deliberate pace. It can be like watching a 
no-hitter baseball game -- the tension builds slowly. Shussett and Steele will 
nod their admiration for various questions asked by the attorneys, or shake 
their heads at what they believe are missteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the pace goes too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is falling asleep," Steele said. "The bailiff had to wake 
us all up the other day." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, he and Shussett walked into Department I to watch 
testimony in a murder trial. A man had been charged with killing a child during 
an alleged gang shootout in a public park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the sleeping section?" Shussett asked the bailiff as he took a seat 
in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 She responded: "We'll just throw stuff at you." 
</P>
<P>
 During off moments, when the judge is in chambers or the court is waiting on 
clarification of some matter, the bailiffs are likely to chat with court 
watchers they recognize. The gossip may touch on various judges' personalities 
or a particularly loud jury deliberation in a nearby courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all a family, to a degree," Hill said. "The guys who come here all the 
time, I consider them as such." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys, for their part, may participate in such small talk or ask for 
the court watchers' opinions on how the trial is going. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are great," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lester Kuriyama, one of the 
prosecutors in the Menendez case. "They've been around a long time. They know 
more about the judges and prosecuting attorneys and defense attorneys than 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuriyama is a favorite among the Van Nuys court watchers. Knowing which 
attorney to watch is every bit as important as picking an interesting trial, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all," Shussett said, "we like to be able to hear them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys have a tendency to mumble, it seems. Others talk too much, 
slowing the proceedings with their objections and requests for conferences at 
"side bench," which leaves watchers to wonder what is being whispered between 
the attorneys and the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why judges are also a crucial consideration. Court watchers prefer a 
judge who keeps a tight rein on the attorneys, who limits the number of "side 
bench" discussions and the number of consultations in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interplay between the attorneys and the judges is important," Steele 
said. "There's quite often friction between them and that's interesting when 
you pick up on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Combine a dramatic case with two efficient attorneys and a judge who can keep 
the action rolling, court watchers say, and you're in for some compelling 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder, narcotics, medical malpractice -- we like them all," Shussett said. 
"You come here in the morning and you have your choice of what you want to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, it's better than staying at home and watching the soap 
operas. 4 Tips for Watching 
</P>
<P>
 1. Roam the halls: Check in at each courtroom to see what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Chat with bailiffs, attorneys, judges: They can be your best source for 
which trials to watch and which to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Avoid expert testimony: Psychologists, doctors and other such professionals 
can talk for hours on end. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Don't be lured by the glitter: Often, the less-publicized cases move faster 
and make for better viewing. Where and When Location: Van Nuys Courthouse, 6230 
Sylmar Ave., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested Dishes: Coffee in the cafeteria, 35 cents a cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays. Metered parking on the street.

UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL; * THE CENTURY GALLERY SHOW 'INTIMATE IMAGES,' 
REPRESENTING 10 ARTISTS WHO WORK IN A WIDE RANGE OF MEDIA, DRAWS THE VIEWER'S 
IMMEDIATE FEELING AND INVOLVEMENT.

<P>
 No doubt, pouring out heart and soul in broad strokes and sweeping gestures on 
a large canvas has its big rewards for artists. But working on a small scale 
has its thrills as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working small in the studio, you're right there with your nose right on the 
subject. It's immediate. Many artists like that kind of relationship. It 
stimulates all of your senses at one time, and it's very involving," says Lee 
Musgrave, Century Gallery director. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting images are not merely small in size, but often especially 
intimate and involving for the viewer also who will get up close to them. One 
should do just that when viewing the small-scale work of 10 artists in the 
show, "Intimate Images," at Century Gallery in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Sim-Edwards, who curated this exhibit with Musgrave, had organized two 
shows by that same title at the LACA Gallery in Los Angeles in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular show, the artists don't have any political or social 
agenda," Sim-Edwards said. "There is a stress these days to carry some double 
or didactic meaning. You don't see that here. (The images) are intimate in 
size, but in feeling as well. They are personal sketches of personal thoughts. 
They are pleasant to look at, and not very demanding. The artists come from 
different backgrounds, but you would never guess who did what from just 
looking" at the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The clay sculptures of Yun-Dong Nam of New York -- two of them called 
"Couple"; a "Hand" and a "Head (self-portrait)" -- are "simple and 
straightforward, but abstract and contemporary," Sim-Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a ceramic artist, I am dealing with a history of connections to the Earth. 
. . . What I am seeking in my work is a reconnecting to the rhythms of nature," 
he wrote in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunju Kang's etching and monoprint "doodle plus three" presents references to 
nature and her personal relationships that take viewers "into her psyche, into 
part of a world. She invites you to sense and feel what is going on there," 
Sim-Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang was born in Korea, lived in Japan as a young girl, and moved to the 
United States as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoella Razili grew up in Israel, attending university there before she moved 
to the United States. Her mixed media self-portraits convey divergent 
influences that affect a life by combining sharp edges and rough textures with 
delicate images of herself and gentle references to nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Peeper's untitled oil on canvas paintings consist of lavish mixtures of 
colors applied not with a brush but a pallet knife to form energetic textures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very erotic in a way. He uses paint as if he were sculpting, as a 
three-dimensional object," Sim-Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Holland, Peeper attended school in Beverly Hills and then lived in 
London and Switzerland before returning to this area a few years ago. "He's not 
really a trained painter. I think he's a natural painter, though." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of various palpable textures is also an important element of 
Craig Antrim's "Cross" paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The five on view here are from a series of 150. From "Cross I/Leaves/The Vine" 
to "Cross 12/8 = Infinity," they seem to muse on various aspects of the 
universe, rather than the religious traditions associated with the cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Sim-Edwards herself has five watercolor collages in the show, including 
"Auntie Joon-Francis." Her English husband's aunt gave their young daughter a 
small silver spoon. Sim-Edwards has commemorated that gesture in this artwork, 
by including part of the note accompanying the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always work small," Sim-Edwards said. "Watercolor is my primary medium. I 
can control the medium a lot better when I work small, and words and typography 
won't get lost. I view my painting as a process of learning. Sometimes I 
develop something. Sometimes it just happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists represented in the show are: Lisa Adams, Scott Gordon, Jeri 
Jackson and Joseph Piasentin. Where and When What: "Intimate Images." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: County of Los Angeles Century Gallery, 13000 Sayre St., Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Ends March 4.

POURING OUT THEIR HEARTS; * GROUNDS ZERO COFFEEHOUSE GIVES POETS GREAT LEEWAY 
IN EXPRESSING THEIR 'INTENSITY AND AUTHENTICITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HEEGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Susan Heeger writes regularly about 
readings for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compared to some of its hip but grimy rivals in the coffeehouse world, 
Burbank's Grounds Zero is a pal ace -- which makes it a popular spot on poetry 
nights. Every Thursday by 8:30 p.m., all its velvet sofas, armchairs and cafe 
tables are usually spoken for, and the crowd is spilling around the coffee bar. 
Which brings up one of the dis advantages of the place: noise. 
</P>
<P>
 As the poets -- mostly Burbank locals -- take the mike, the espresso maker 
sputters away; chatty customers enter and leave, and cars rumble by on North 
San Fernando Boulevard. From time to time poetry host Jennifer Ross screams, 
"Shut up!" at the talkers, but otherwise the racket is accepted as part of the 
evening's high-octane gestalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like people to feel free -- to clap, to shout, to make their point with as 
much feeling as they need to," said Ross, 22, who started the poetry nights a 
year ago, shortly after the cafe opened. She described herself as "a 
confrontational poet: I stand up there and yell and get in people's faces. I 
think it's opened it up a lot for others." 
</P>
<P>
 George Simay, 41, of Burbank, a regular Grounds Zero reader, confirmed her 
speculation and added, "The crowd tends to be younger -- and less inhibited in 
their presentation of poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the writers are also less experienced at reading aloud than their 
counterparts at other coffee bars -- and even less experienced at writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be good to read here," observed Karene Stapleton, who has 
been coming to the coffeehouse for a year. "You're not judged on how 
technically capable you are, but more on your intensity and authenticity." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, who estimated the age of most Grounds Zero readers to be between 16 and 
27, said she has seen "a lot of poets grow -- people who started out not 
thinking they could write." This pleases her, she said, because "we're here to 
give the public a place to speak. It's not a contest. What you say -- anything 
you say -- is important." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of such tolerance is that rhymed verse -- of the sort frowned on by 
performance poets elsewhere -- abounds at Grounds Zero, as do gut-wrenching 
confessionals full of misery and Angst . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear amazing things," said Stapleton. "About the death of parents. About 
not being accepted by others. It's phenomenal, the amount of pain these kids 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than feeling alienated by the work of writers decades younger than 
herself, Stapleton, 47, described "a commonality of experience" enabling 
readers of all ages to enjoy each other's poems. By the same token, having her 
work applauded by the youthful crowd "made me realize I had more to say than I 
thought -- that my stuff had value across the generations." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent visit to Grounds Zero on a Thursday night made this point for several 
poets, among them 63-year-old Mona Lethbridge, who charmed her audience with a 
work called "The Making of a Mother." William McLain, 83, went a step further, 
getting the crowd to join in on the chorus of his poem, "You're a Dirty Old 
Man." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the work -- largely by twentysomething poets -- ran the gamut of 
subject, tone and accomplishment. Jason Yaeger read poems critical of 
consumerist culture and modern relationships. Jason Rutberg's work explored 
identity against the backdrop of contemporary life. George Mihalopoulos broke 
into song for the refrain of a love poem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Ross shouted angry, humorous commentaries on women's rights and 
breast implants, while other poets examined politics, world conflicts and the 
desperation of Lorena Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a kind of testing ground," said Lethbridge, just before her moment 
came. "If you can make it here, you have the confidence to go elsewhere. 
Exposure. That's what this is all about." Where and When Location: Grounds 
Zero, 124 N. San Fernando Blvd., Burbank.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: BUDGET BUYS FOR BATH AND KITCHEN; * AMERICAN PREMIUM 
DISTRIBUTORS NOW OFFERS MAJOR APPLIANCES, PLUMBING ITEMS AND FIXTURES FOR 
LITTLE OVER COST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thirteen years ago, when I first discovered American Premium Distributors, 
they were selling jewelry, pens, small appliances along with a few major, plus 
some other merchandise, all at excellent prices. Since then, they purchased the 
building they occupy and expanded their operation at the same location. It's a 
whole new ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 They liquidated the jewelry, pens and small appliances, and now deal in major 
appliances, doors, windows, plumbing and, in general, fixtures for the kitchen 
or bath at prices that hover a small percentage over cost. 
</P>
<P>
 When I revisited APD a few days after the Jan. 17 earthquake, every available 
staff member was working with a customer, poring over plans.  
</P>
<P>
 According to part-owner Stacey Fisch, daughter of founders Bob and Kevy 
Greenwald, half of the business at American Premium Distributors is from the 
sale of plumbing equipment. There are catalogues and floor models to look at 
from such companies as Kohler, Raphael, Grohe and Price-Pfister, and items are 
available at competitive prices. A single-lever kitchen faucet with pullout 
spray from Price-Pfister is popular, selling for $147 instead of the $227 list 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 A cast-iron steeping, or deeper, bathtub by Kohler is a new, sought-after 
product that lists for about $1,342. But the price here is $872. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the specific need, Fisch recommends that the homeowner purchase 
plumbing fixtures directly to eliminate any markup by trades people. 
</P>
<P>
 Major appliances represent another large part of this family-owned and 
-operated business. Almost all of the upscale names in built-in or 
free-standing appliances are available.  
</P>
<P>
 Nutone, Kitchen-Aid, Caloric, Vent-A-Hood, Gaggenau and Jenn-Air are a few. 
One Jenn-Air built-in single, self-cleaning convection oven sells elsewhere for 
about $750, but the price here is $649. A popular Whirlpool side-by-side, 
25-cubic-foot refrigerator with ice and water through the door is $1,159 
instead of the $1,400 many retailers ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Door and window manufacturing companies represented by APD include A.A.W. 
Inc., International, Anderson, Fleetwood and Velux. One standard size interior 
paneled door from T. M. Cobb is $34.50 instead of $69.60. Where and When What: 
American Premium Distributors.

MOTHER KNOWS BEST; * VALLEY TORAH'S DEAN OF GIRLS HAS NO ADVANCED DEGREES. SHE 
EARNED KNOWLEDGE OF KIDS THE HARD WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Andrea Heiman writes regularly for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eileen Weiss was never trained as an administrator. Or a dean. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new dean of girls at Valley Torah High School in North Hollywood has 
plenty of related experience -- as the mother of 15 and grandmother of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not have the formal academic training, but I know how to deal with 
children," says Weiss, 53, whose children are 12 to 35 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' reputation as a mother and member of the community caught the attention 
of administrators of Valley Torah, the only Orthodox Jewish high school in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Mrs. Weiss had a knack for dealing with people," says Rabbi Avrohom 
Stulberger, dean of Valley Torah, which has separate boys and girls schools of 
about 90 students each. "You can spend 10 minutes with her and feel like you've 
known each other for 20 years. I knew she would be a good role model and bridge 
the gap between administrator and dean." 
</P>
<P>
 Stulberger's prediction seems to have come true. Many of the girls refer to 
Weiss as their second mom and decorate her office walls with cards and 
drawings. They come to her for everything -- family problems, school problems 
and just to say "hi." 
</P>
<P>
 "I set up a rapport -- they know me, I know them," says Weiss, who also 
teaches a course in basic Torah Judaism. "I like to be involved in what's going 
on at home -- if there are problems with a parent, we discuss it. I don't take 
sides, but I have the ability to talk on any issue. I set up a trust. I don't 
counsel, I listen, and try to relate and see myself in what they are saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarit Ben-Yaacov, 16, visits Weiss' office daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I can really talk to her," says Ben-Yaacov, who lives in North 
Hollywood. "Sometimes people hold things against you, but I can trust her, she 
understands. She sees the nice person inside of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, an Orthodox Jew who was raised in Woodbourne, N.Y., (in the Catskills) 
earned a two-year teaching degree from Bais Yaacov Teachers Seminary, a 
religious institution in Brooklyn, N.Y. She and her husband, Meshulum, ran a 
bakery in Miami Beach, Fla., for 32 years before they came to North Hollywood 
five years ago when Meshulum was offered a principal's job at a Los Angeles 
religious school. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss attributes her skill with children both to her experience as a mother as 
well as to an innate gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as some people have an innate ability to play the piano, I have an 
innate ability to listen to children and pick out what they are trying to say," 
says Weiss, who has been married for 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss has also learned not to take the misbehavior of her children or students 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never treat children as bad," she says. "Maybe what they did was bad, but 
there are no bad children. We all have problems, but nothing they do will 
disappoint me. I know the only people they are hurting are themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mothering technique Weiss incorporates into her dealings with students 
is a "safe room," where girls are allowed to express their feeling freely and 
know that they will not be punished for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because one of her own daughters is dyslexic, Weiss also has tools to help 
girls who suffer from learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I don't feel great about myself," says Yocheved Berghoff, 14, who 
has a learning disorder. "Whenever I'm upset at myself or angry, she has me 
make a list of all my good points. I look at that list and it makes me feel 
more confident, and like I can accomplish anything even though I have 
disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' own children -- four girls and 11 boys -- have a potpourri of interests 
and are scattered across the world -- from Israel to Australia to New Jersey to 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Three are rabbis, one is a psychologist, one is a special education teacher, 
one runs a pizza shop in Miami Beach. And Weiss' 33-year-old daughter, who has 
nine children, won $5.5 million in the lottery in 1990 just as she and her 
family were being evicted from their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they are Torah observant, keep the laws of the Bible and the 
Sabbath, love God, and are good to human beings, I am happy," Weiss says. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' youngest daughter, Shaina, attends Valley Torah, and says she likes 
having mom so handy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," says Shaina Weiss, 15. "At first I didn't want her to come here, 
because she's my mom. But now I always have someone to talk to and someone to 
come to. And when all the girls come and call her mommy, I think it's cute. I 
know they can't have her all the time, like I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Weiss looks at her job as a mother and counselor as one God meant 
for her to have, and one that helps her continue to grow.

<P>
 Ever since his retirement in 1986, Dr. Irwin Linden has been battling disease, 
parasites, dehydration and other maladies he doesn't even like to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come at night," he says with distaste. "You've got to watch out for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly an Encino-based dermatologist, Linden has traded in one set of 
patients for a quieter, more delicate bunch: prize orchids. Where once he waged 
war on skin ailments, his enemies now are the slugs that sneak into his 
greenhouse to munch the buds on his dendrobiums. Or the viruses that render his 
cattleyas ugly, infectious and dead. 
</P>
<P>
 His primary weapon is constant vigilance -- watching his plants' appearance, 
moisture level, food and temperature needs. His reward is a year-round crop of 
flowers that smell like heaven and won him the 1993 award for "outstanding 
orchid culture and presentation" from the San Fernando Valley Orchid Society. 
</P>
<P>
 If most people associate orchids with butterfly-shaped prom corsages, a tour 
of Linden's state-of-the-art greenhouse considerably expands the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded together on benches amid the constant whir of heaters, fans and 
humidifiers, are some of the most exotic flowers on the planet. They resemble 
moths in full flight, pom-poms, lions' heads, monkeys' faces, even dried autumn 
leaves clinging fast to the branch. They come with starched sails or ruffled 
petals -- white with yellow-stained centers, magenta with rusty depths or pale 
green with purple polka dots. Their perfumes are just as varied, ranging from 
spicy and sharp to heavily sweet and tropical. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer variety of orchids is part of their appeal for Linden, who began 
collecting them in 1962 but got more serious when he retired. Rather than 
focusing on one type of orchid, he fills his greenhouse with a full complement 
of cattleyas, dendrobiums, phalaenopsis, oncidiums and paphiopedilums, and 
maintains an outdoor growing area for cold-loving cymbidiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I buy plants," he explains, "I look for certain forms I don't have or 
things that bloom during quiet months." 
</P>
<P>
 Buying largely at auctions or through catalogues, he doesn't seek out 
rarities, but he has, through meticulousness and patience, achieved some 
startling effects. One of these, an extravagantly blooming cattleya, measured 
more than a yard wide and had to be loaded into a borrowed truck for its 
blue-ribbon performance at an orchid show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people wouldn't have bothered," he jokes. "But if there's a challenge, I 
persist." 
</P>
<P>
 Ned Daniger, president of the San Fernando Valley Orchid Society and owner of 
the Daniger Orchids nursery in Northridge, credits Linden with more than just 
persistence. "He takes a lot of care with his plants; they always look 
spectacular," Daniger says. "You can start with a $500 plant (but), if you 
don't grow it right, it can look like a $12 plant." 
</P>
<P>
 For Linden, who starts with orchids in the $10 to $50 price range, growing 
them right involves spending time every day watering, pruning, repotting and 
checking for signs of infestation or disease. He also monitors the machinery 
that keeps the atmosphere in the greenhouse moist, warm and breezy -- akin to 
the ambience of a tropical jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture and temperature control are especially critical. Twice, in an earlier 
greenhouse, Linden lost his entire orchid collection when an evaporative cooler 
failed, resulting in a fatal level of dry heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for his pains, his plants send up a steady stream of blooms that 
come in waves with the seasons and hang around for months. His papery white 
phalaenopsis (moth orchid), for example, is blooming now and will continue for 
a good three months. His dendrobiums, on the other hand, may hold their pink 
and purple flower clusters for half the year -- or even longer, in the case of 
his Dendrobium sonya , which is hardly ever out of bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the part I enjoy," says Linden's wife, Barbara, pointing to a sunny 
kitchen window that's always crammed with flowering orchids. 
</P>
<P>
 Linden agrees. "They're beautiful. They're my raison d'etre. " 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, his responsibility for the survival of more than 600 
delicate beings weighs heavily on him. "I love looking at them, I love showing 
them," he admits. "But if suddenly they were gone, I think I'd say, 'I've had 
my fun.' "

THE COMEBACK BLUES; * AZURE EYE SHADOWS ARE BEING REVIVED AND RETOOLED. THE NEW 
LOOK IS APPLIED LIGHTLY, NOT USED LIKE THE '70S 'CUPCAKE FROSTING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Blue eye shadow may very well be coming soon to a pair of eyelids near you. 
Unbelievers may simply review the return of the platform shoe and the crocheted 
vest for evidence that anything old is new again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue eye shadow is making a strong comeback," says Paulette Cleghorn of The 
Body Shop. However, any woman with frosty-blue cream shadow left over from a 
few decades ago better rethink more than just hygiene if she is tempted to 
unearth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleghorn says translucence best describes the consistency of more cutting-edge 
blues. "What's happening now doesn't (revolve around) the light aqua shade of 
the '70s," explains Jackie Kolla, cosmetic buyer for Nordstrom's L.A. region. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus to revive blues at Estee Lauder, where 18 varying shades are 
offered, came from the many models sashaying down the runway wearing the hues 
during the fall '93 European fashion collections, explains Dominique Szabo, 
senior vice president of product development worldwide for Lauder. Though the 
market seemed ripe for revival, retooling was necessary, she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new looks are applied with a light hand, not like the cupcake frosting 
look of the '70s that we saw on our mothers and our grandmothers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the amount of shadow used is significantly less than was needed for the 
'70s look, says Kolla, the depth of color used is much bolder. The M.A.C. 
makeup line, available at Nordstrom, offers a variety of matte powders, rather 
than the frosty creams featured two decades ago. Chanel and Christian Dior, two 
other popular department store lines, are also singing the blues in eye 
shadows. Drugstore shoppers can find a variety of more affordable blue shades 
in the Revlon and Clarion lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How blue-shadowed eye makeup is intended to be finished varies from line to 
line. Szabo says using automatic pencils and liners to discreetly line the 
inside of the rim of the lower lid can be flattering, but The Body Shop's 
Cleghorn feels that look is passe. She suggests using smoky blue and gray under 
the lower lid and over the upper lid but never directly on the rim. Or blend 
slate eye shadow across the lower lid with a smudging applicator. Then, she 
suggests, use an eye pencil in Passion Blue to draw a line from the outer 
corner of the lower lash line, about three-fourths of the way across the lid 
and blended to create a wash of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Some naturalists may wince at the rainbow of mascara shades now available. 
Even so, some of the season's most maverick mascara choices include brightly 
colored versions or others imparting a metallic shimmer. Yves St. Laurent, 
particularly keen on "party" mascaras, is offering black mascaras with a hint 
of steel and peacock blue-green, among others. Lancome also offers shades of 
blue, green and auburn. Lauder's Night Navy offers a hint of color without the 
electricity present in the '70s renditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bold blues of '93 are gaining momentum for spring '94, as many cosmetic 
lines make plans to carry them over and introduce new hybrids of blue, purple 
and even green. Look for teal, says Kolla, to take the makeup world by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the look is nothing more than trend hype and obvious artifice. Take 
Heather Brown, a Merle Norman makeup artist and manager who works in the 
company's Fashion Square Sherman Oaks boutique. In Brown's boutique, the teal 
shades available in the line aren't even shipped because demand for them in the 
San Fernando Valley is virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't find that a lot of our customers come in asking for the latest 
thing," Brown said. "What they want are colors that look best on them." Brown, 
who has green eyes, says she plans to skip the trend herself, regardless of any 
perceived momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't see myself walking around in teal eye shadow," she says flatly. 
As for Brown's personal bests? Deep, smoky plum and, naturally, brown.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; KEEPING IT SIMPLE; * THE WINE BISTRO IS A FEAST FOR THE EYES 
AS WELL AS THE PALATE. ITS LACK OF FLASHINESS IS ONE OF ITS STRENGTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life! 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many newer restaurants try to pull customers in with complex, innovative 
dishes. More often than not, they leave patrons longing for plain old 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Simplicity is the strength of the not-so-new Wine Bistro, a restaurant that, 
for no particular reason, I have always driven right past. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I got the notion to stop in at this modest, comfy cafe, a local CBS 
Center haunt that is relatively easy to miss amid the hundreds of restaurants 
that line Ventura Boulevard. Now I'm wondering how I could have passed it up 
for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Without being particularly flashy or brilliant, Wine Bistro manages to be 
better than most of the restaurants on this street. The veteran owner, a man 
named Alain Cuny, is responsible for the popular Le Sanglier in Tarzana, as 
well as a place called Berty's in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine Bistro is my favorite of his three restaurants -- especially for the way 
it looks. The dining room is one of those long, mirror-lined rectangles, the 
kind of room you might find in a non-touristy Paris arrondissement . 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the booths, upholstered in creamy white vinyl and framed by high 
wooden backs, are shielded by ornate glass dividers with brass posts. And if 
you fail to get a booth -- which you will, if you do not reserve one -- you'll 
be stuck in the middle of the dining room at a small table.  
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is a good value here, and you can order it on weekdays until 4 p.m., 
when the restaurant switches to its  
</P>
<P>
 dinner menu. Lunches at Wine Bistro favor salads, steamed shellfish and 
various comfort foods: liver, sole, chicken. You can have pasta, too. Though it 
has nothing to do with a restaurant that calls itself country French, pasta is 
de rigueur on this stretch of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Grab the off-menu four seasons salad with smoked duck when it is available. 
(Usually it's a daily special.) The salad is composed of endive, arugula, 
rocket and other greens, topped with pieces of smoked duck. 
</P>
<P>
 The mussels tend to be the Eastern Establishment type. And, as in any bistro 
worth its salt, they are piled in a bowl in a sauce mariniere made of white 
wine, stock, cream and shallots.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm also fond of the lunch menu's sole meuniere , the traditional "miller's 
style" sole. It's nothing flashy, merely fresh white filets dredged in flour, 
pan-fried in butter and moist from a squeeze of lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinners are a slightly different affair here, if only because the business 
trade is almost nonexistent and the waiters -- and the kitchen -- seem 
infinitely more sluggish. The menu at night is a bit more elaborate, and 
caloric. Things that come unadorned at the noon hour are now blanketed in rich 
sauces, garnished with luxuries such as morels, sauce Nantua, green 
peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiters keep diners abreast of the many evening specials, one of which is 
almost always a hearty bouillabaisse. This version is about as generous as it 
gets: clams, mussels, salmon, scampi, whitefish, swordfish and whatever else 
the chef throws in. You'll need every square inch of your cloth napkin to 
finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Calf's liver is pan-seared and quite tender, served with white onions and 
crisped bits of bacon. One of the menu stalwarts, grilled fresh salmon with 
lobster bisque sauce, is delicious, though one might wish for a bit more of the 
grainy, buttery sauce. I found filet mignon with morels, from the blackboard 
menu, more of a disappointment. The dried morels came up a bit on the rubbery 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, you'll see a pastry board groaning with the usual assortment of 
classic French concoctions: a tarte tatin , a puffy Napoleon, a fruit tart with 
kiwi sneaked into it. I'd describe the pastries as pleasantly lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
 I do wish to put in a word, though, for the unique, small wine list this 
restaurant has. There is a fine collection of vintage Bordeaux wines at prices 
lower than I have seen elsewhere. An '83 Chateau Gloria, for example, is only 
$35, while the lofty '85 Chateau Lynch Bages, often $125 on local lists, rests 
at a mere $85 on this list. Where and When Location: Wine Bistro, 11915 Ventura 
Blvd., Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested dishes: mussels mariniere , $7.95; sole meuniere , $10.50 (lunch); 
calf's liver, $15.95; salmon with lobster bisque sauce, $17.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Lunch 11:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday-Friday; dinner 4-10:30 p.m. 
Monday-Friday, 5:30-10:30 p.m. Saturday. Closed Sunday.

BRUINS FIND RELIEF IN DESERT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: A SOLID SECOND HALF HELPS 
UCLA DEFEAT ARIZONA STATE, 76-70. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Call off the buzzards. For UCLA, things aren't nearly as bad as they have 
looked lately, said Charles O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, right after the Bruins defeated Arizona State, 76-70, Thursday night, 
O'Bannon said it was time to deliver a message to Arizona in time for 
Saturday's game in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back," O'Bannon said. "Yeah, we had a couple of bad games, but we're a 
good team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was very, very big," he said. "Now we still have a two-game conference 
lead and if we win Saturday, we pretty much have a chance to clinch." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 UCLA, probably the most highly critiqued 18-2 team in college 
basketball, ran its Pacific 10 Conference record to 11-1 by continuing what it 
seems to do best -- beating the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been five years since UCLA lost to Arizona State, which ran its losing 
streak against the Bruins to 11. The Bruins made sure with a withering stretch 
run when they scored 10 points on their last five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, UCLA had just enough to withstand consecutive three-point 
baskets from Stevin Smith, Isaac Burton and Quincy Brewer, the last one tying 
the score, 70-70, with 1:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA scored the game's last six points. Cameron Dollar broke the tie with a 
driving layup, then got in the way of Brewer, who missed on a drive. Ed 
O'Bannon got chopped with 20 seconds left and made two free throws for a 74-70 
lead, Brewer missed again on a drive and Tyus Edney wrapped it up with two more 
free throws with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate," Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but the Bruins were also pretty resilient. Smith made four 
three-pointers in the first half as he shot Arizona State to a 36-27 lead, but 
UCLA scored the last eight points of the half to get back to within 36-35.  
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver, who had four of those points on breakaway layups and finished 
with 18, said the Bruins knew then that they had something special going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, it was incredible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins kept it close and edged ahead even without all of their usual 
weapons. Ed O'Bannon did not have a basket in the half, George Zidek had only 
one and Charles O'Bannon already had three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened in the second half? UCLA had only four turnovers, Ed O'Bannon 
had 12 points, Zidek finished with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots and 
Charles O'Bannon cleared the backboards with 13 rebounds in 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A glum Bill Frieder added it all up and knew why his team went down the drain 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the big plays when they had to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also made the big free throws, which is something of a recent occurrence 
for the Bruins. After the first 11 games of the season, UCLA was last in the 
Pac-10 in free throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has improved to No. 5 and probably is going to go higher after making 15 
of 17 against the Sun Devils. Edney was seven for seven from the line and 
matched Tarver with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieder saw the Bruins get 17 free throws the first meeting at Pauley Pavilion 
and didn't feel much better after watching after Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fouling techniques are not the best against UCLA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Arizona State's shooting techniques left something to be desired, 
at least in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tarver as his shadow, Smith scored only seven points in the second half. 
Bennett, guarded closely by Ed O'Bannon when Zidek started a collection of 
fouls, had only six points after halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for 26 offensive rebounds, it might have been even worse for the 
Sun Devils (12-9, 7-5), who also missed 13 of 25 free throws and probably waved 
goodby to any shot at the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Gets Worse

IT'S VETERANS' DAY AT DAYTONA; NASCAR: EARNHARDT AND IRVAN WIN TWIN 125 
QUALIFYING RACES FOR SUNDAY'S DAYTONA 500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran drivers regained the upper hand Thursday at Daytona International 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt and Ernie Irvan, stock car racing's two hardest chargers, won 
the Gatorade Twin 125 qualifying heats for Sunday's Daytona 500, and Rusty 
Wallace, last year's biggest winner, was second behind Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
 After Loy Allen Jr., a rookie, won the pole for the 500 and Jeff Gordon, at 22 
the youngest driver on the premises, won the Busch Clash last weekend, it 
appeared that change was the order of the day in Winston Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Twin 125s, the real racing began. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Fords, driven by Irvan, Wallace and Mark Martin, raced to the wire in a 
first heat made closer at the finish by a caution flag that brought the field 
together for a two-lap sprint. As they had during most of the race, their Fords 
quickly pulled away and finished in that order without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, making his debut in a Ford after a career driving Pontiacs, led 
briefly, as did Martin, but Irvan led for 37 of the 50 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Chevrolets, driven by Earnhardt, Sterling Marlin and Gordon, were 
equally impressive in the second heat. Earnhardt led 34 of the 50 laps and late 
in the race was challenged only by Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan's average speed of 156.304 m.p.h. was faster than Earnhardt's 146.771, 
primarily because of a five-car pileup in the first turn immediately after the 
leaders had passed the starting line in the second race. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jarrett, defending Daytona 500 champion, dropped a cylinder in his Joe 
Gibbs-owned Chevrolet as he tried to shift from second to third gear, and when 
his car slowed, it set off a chain-reaction that knocked four others, including 
former 500 winner Buddy Baker, out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett was given a provisional starting position at the rear of the 42-car 
field for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prerace driver's meeting, Wallace made an impassioned plea for safety, 
caution and prudence in the 125s and the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of 10 races and runner-up to Earnhardt for the Winston Cup title last 
year, Wallace said he was concerned that "too many things have been happening 
and too many friends have been lost recently" to ignore the dangers in racing 
3,500-pound stock cars at speeds approaching 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared, I know you're scared, your wives are scared at what's been 
happening," Wallace said. "I want to remind (everyone here) that getting into 
the Daytona 500 is not the most important thing in the world, that it's not 
worth taking that foolish chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, who lost one of his closest friends when Neil Bonnett was killed 
while practicing at Daytona last Friday, said he backed Wallace "100%." Four 
days after Bonnett's death, a rookie driver, Rodney Orr, was also killed while 
practicing for the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 An emotional Earnhardt added: "Neil was definitely with us today, and he's 
definitely in our hearts all the time. Sunday will be a very emotional race." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation as to how Allen, driving in his sixth Winston Cup race, might 
survive the pressure of starting on the pole Thursday, did not last long. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving out smoothly at the green flag, he soon found himself driving 
alone alongside the locomotive-like chain of cars -- out of the draft. By the 
end of the first lap, the rookie had been shuffled back to 10th, and by the 
eighth lap, he was 21st. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had handling problems, and when the leaders started to catch us, we just 
brought the car in (on Lap 26) because we didn't want to get in trouble or 
anything," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen had his front-row position assured for Sunday's race, as did Earnhardt, 
from their qualifying times last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several drivers suggested that Allen's problem might have been with his choice 
of Hoosier tires. This was Hoosier's first race since 1989 in a revival of the 
tire war with Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why those guys (on Hoosiers) didn't change," Irvan said."It was 
obvious that once we got running, the Hoosiers didn't stand up to the 
Goodyears. They have a narrower patch (of rubber) on the track, and at a place 
like Daytona, which is a handling track, it makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR, in an unusual move, announced before Thursday's races that teams could 
switch tire brands during the race if they desired.

MORNING BRIEFING: COMING NEXT: JOHN MADDEN AT THE BUNDYS

 Call it the NFL meets "Beverly Hills 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox television network is wasting no time in its attempt to attract young 
viewers for its broadcasts of NFL games next fall. Starting next week, NFL 
players will occasionally be guests on Fox shows, play hosts on Fox nights and 
star in personality-based ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take off the helmets and put personalities behind them," Fox's Tracy 
Dolgin told Adweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, apparently, is to make players such as quarterback Steve Young of 
the San Francisco 49ers as popular as Luke Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw him," Dolgin said of Young, "you might be more interested in 
watching a game to see if he gets his lunch eaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling an audible: Quarterback Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys said he 
would be in Los Angeles this month to make a cameo appearance on the ABC 
television show, "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman said he had not seen a script but was familiar with the story line. The 
coach, played by Craig T. Nelson, and his wife, played by Shelley Fabares, have 
been trying to have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tries to talk me into having sex with his wife so he can have an 
All-American quarterback play for him when he gets older," Aikman said. "She's 
not real thrilled with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who are the only players to be ranked No. 1 in women's tennis 
since 1975? 
</P>
<P>
 Failing report card: Sports cards might be big business for manufacturers and 
collectors, but Scott Ostler wrote in Sport magazine that he is not thrilled 
with "a hobby that has turned millions of youngsters into junior Donald 
Trumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostler continued: "Young boys should not be reading those card-price 
catalogues, straining their eyes on the teensy print. They should be reading 
catalogues from Toys R Us, eventually graduating to Victoria's Secret. I don't 
want my son hanging out with investors, card-forgers, counterfeiters, pirates, 
dealers and other card-industry types, even if they are his classmates." 
</P>
<P>
 Sand trap: Golfers looking for a new challenge might try entering the Eldo 
Desert Classic, which is played yearly at the Woomera Club in Australia and is 
true to its name.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Golf Digest, "The only green spots on the Woomera course are the 
portable patches of artificial turf from which players hit their shots. Players 
are advised to wear their gloves as they putt so the scorpions don't sting 
their hands when they pick the golf ball out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The club motto? 'Eat my dust.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sport with an edge: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post described the 
danger faced by skaters in the Winter Games: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the pairs skating, the women are so tiny and bird-like, and the men are so 
strong, it's like the hammer throw; some beefy John Goodman type of skater 
could unsuspectingly fling his partner into Lake Mjosa. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as we all know here in the post-Tonya Era, figure skating has become 
dis-figure skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Tracy Austin, Steffi Graf and 
Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Chris Chelios of the Chicago Blackhawks, no stranger to 
disciplinary action by the NHL, after his most recent four-game suspension for 
gouging the eye of the Vancouver Canucks' Dana Murzyn: "The suspensions have 
affected my reputation, and it was bad enough before this." GARY KLEIN

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL / TONIGHT'S GAMES; USC, UCLA TRY TO REGROUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Its Pacific 10 Conference winning streak ended and its conference lead 
slightly reduced, the USC women's basketball team will play host to last-place 
Arizona State tonight while Arizona visits UCLA. Both games start at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Cheryl Miller's Trojans, 17-2 overall and 10-1 in the Pac-10, get an 
apparent breather at the Lyon Center after losing at Washington, 63-55, last 
Saturday. Arizona State is 2-16 and 0-10. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (12-8, 7-4) faces a tougher task against Arizona (11-8, 5-6) at the 
Wooden Center. Sunday, the teams will switch opponents for games at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after losing by 15 points to USC, Coach Kathy Olivier's Bruins beat 
15th-ranked Washington, 65-62, last Thursday at Seattle. UCLA thus enabled USC, 
despite the Trojans' loss to Washington, to keep the Pac-10 lead, by two games 
over the Huskies and Stanford, both of whom are 8-3 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins got another big weekend from senior low-post star Natalie Williams. 
In victories at Washington and Washington State, she scored her 17th and 18th 
double-doubles of the season, getting a total of 39 points and 26 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is fifth in the Pac-10, a game ahead of Arizona and a half-game behind 
Oregon. EARL GUSTKEY

UC IRVINE'S BUBBLE IS BURST AT NEW MEXICO STATE, 90-60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine hoped to carry over the emotion and momentum from Saturday's runaway 
victory over Nevada into Thursday night's game against New Mexico State. Sure, 
the Aggies hadn't lost at home in almost two years, but the pumped-up Anteaters 
figured they could make it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the only suspense in this one was whether crowd favorite walk-on Mike 
Schutz would play. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (18-3, 10-2) led by 28 in the opening minutes of the second 
half and rolled to a 90-60 Big West Conference victory over the deflated 
Anteaters (6-15, 3-10) before 6,749 in the Pan American Center. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight minutes remaining, the crowd began to chant, "Shoootz, Shoootz," 
and with 3:20 left Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy walked down the bench, pointed at 
the sophomore from Wagon Mound, N.M., as if to say, 'You want him?' and the 
fans went into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schutz came in and hit a three-pointer, getting fouled on the play. He made 
the free throw to equal his previous total point output of the season. It was 
that kind of night for the Aggies. They shot 51% from the floor and 50% from 
three-point range and caused Irvine to commit 21 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards D.J. Jackson and James Dockery combined to make 13 of 22 shots from 
the floor and scored 34 points for New Mexico State.  
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Khalid Channell was the only Anteater in double figures with 16 
points. JOHN WEYLER

TROJANS HIT BOTTOM AGAINST WILDCATS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NO. 15 ARIZONA'S 94-61 
VICTORY BECOMES FRUSTRATED USC'S BIGGEST LOSS IN PHYSICAL CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's season to forget added a new chapter Thursday night as No. 15 Arizona 
handed the Trojans their worst loss of the season, 94-61, before a sellout 
McKale Center crowd of 13,974. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning 10 of its first 12 games, USC has now lost eight of nine to drop 
to 11-10 overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for the Trojans is that their next four opponents -- Arizona 
State, Stanford, California and UCLA -- have already defeated USC this season 
by an average of 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I think that our losses show our inexperience, lack of 
confidence, and in some cases lack of knowledge of what to do out there," said 
guard Burt Harris, who led the Trojans with 16 points. "As a team, we just have 
to do a lot of soul searching." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (20-4, 9-3) exposed all of USC's shortcomings in outrebounding, 
outhustling and outshooting the Trojans after spotting them an early 
eight-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first five minutes, USC played like a team that had nothing to lose in 
rushing to a 12-4 lead, thanks to two three-point baskets by Harris. On 
defense, the Trojans aggressively forced Arizona into missing four of its first 
five shots and two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we kind of caught them sleeping," Harris said. "Then, they 
realized what was going on and stopped making silly mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 104-3 at home since 1987, responded to outscore the Trojans, 34-14, 
over the final 14:39 of the first half. The Wildcats ended up shooting 47% in 
taking a 38-26 halftime lead, with guards Khalid Reeves and Damon Stoudamire 
combining for 14 points despite making only six of 16 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves and Stoudamire then buried the Trojans, combining for 10 consecutive 
points in the first two minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "SC came out and did an excellent job early but I think our depth wore them 
down and got us back into the game," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "Then, we 
came and put them away early in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 With USC trailing by 20 points, the game got physical, as both teams made 
their share of hard fouls. The contact reached its peak at the 15:05 mark when 
USC's Stais Boseman and Arizona's Joe McLean were ejected for flagrant fouls 
after a loose-ball struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USC players were fouling hard and a lot, so it was real emotional out 
there," said Reeves, who led the Wildcats with 21 points. "When other teams are 
throwing elbows, you get frustrated. You just have to talk to the refs and have 
them watch out for it." 
</P>
<P>
 USC senior Mark Boyd suffered from physical play, going scoreless by missing 
two field goal attempts in 15 minutes due to foul trouble. It was the first 
time Boyd, who had scored in 94 consecutive games, was held without a point 
since his freshman year against California in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boyd's fouls were ill-advised because his first three happened 20 feet out on 
the perimeter," USC Coach George Raveling said. "It might have been frustration 
from a trying season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats had four players score in double figures, with Stoudamire scoring 
12 with 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will now try to regroup against Arizona State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a difficult season for me as a coach," Raveling said. "I don't 
think our goal is to win. Our goal is to just play competitive college 
basketball."

NBA ROUNDUP; THREE IS GOOD, FOUR BETTER FOR ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Robinson leads the NBA in triple-doubles this season with five. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 He also leads the league in quadruple-doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 He has one. 
</P>
<P>
 That came Thursday at San Antonio when Robinson had 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 
assists and 10 blocked shots to lead the Spurs to a 115-96 victory over the 
Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first quadruple-double since Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon had one in 
1990 and only the fourth in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been close a number of times, so this is something I wanted to do," 
Robinson said. "I'm excited because it's one thing you never know if you're 
going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's teammates knew he was close, and they kept him apprised of what he 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could I not know I was close with the bench and the stat crew?" Robinson 
said, laughing. "Every time I came to the bench, (reserve center) Jack (Haley) 
would tell me how many more blocks I needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's heroics powered the Spurs to their team-record 11th victory in a 
row and put them into a virtual tie for first place in the Midwest Division 
with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio's last loss came Jan. 20 at Minnesota. The Spurs have won 22 of 25 
games since Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons lost for the 25th time in their last 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 115, Seattle 112 -- Steve Smith matched his career high with 32 points 
and Grant Long scored the Heat's final six points at Miami, where the 
SuperSonics' five-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third victory this season for Miami in 15 games decided by 
five or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Rice added 28 and extended to 40 his team record for consecutive free 
throws, going seven for seven. Sean Kemp and Detlef Schrempf each had 22 points 
for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 117, Boston 98 -- Derrick Coleman had 28 points and 17 rebounds and 
Kenny Anderson added 17 points and 16 assists for the Nets at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put the Nets at the .500 mark (24-24) for the first time since 
Nov. 14, when they were 3-3. Boston lost its sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 84, Dallas 73 -- Reggie Miller scored 22 points at Dallas, where the 
Pacers took advantage of the Mavericks' 33% shooting in their lowest-scoring 
game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas trailed, 70-66, with 3:12 to play, but Vern Fleming hit a 15-foot jump 
shot, Antonio Davis made one of two free throws and Miller nailed a 
three-pointer with 1:29 left to push the lead to 76-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming scored 19 points for the Pacers, who won for the eighth time in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 102, Cleveland 95 -- John Starks scored 32 points and made all nine 
of his second-half shots at Richfield, Ohio, as the Knicks avoided their first 
three-game losing streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, which has won five in a row against Cleveland, won it with free 
throws, scoring 18 of its 28 fourth-quarter points from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks also had seven assists and six rebounds. Patrick Ewing had 22 points 
and nine rebounds for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 109, Minnesota 105 -- Rookie Calbert Cheaney scored a career-high 
30 points on 11-for-16 shooting as the Bullets extended the Timberwolves' road 
skid to nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gugliotta had 18 points and 18 rebounds for the Bullets, who snapped a 
four-game losing streak. Michael Adams contributed 18 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug West scored 26 and Chuck Person 24 for Minnesota, which has lost eight of 
nine overall and 14 of its last 15 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 119, Atlanta 115 -- Chris Mullin's layup with 39 seconds left put 
the Warriors ahead for good, and Latrell Sprewell had a steal and two free 
throws with 12 seconds left to clinch the victory at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row and seventh in nine games for Golden 
State, which had six players in double figures. Sprewell finished with 20 
points.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; PARISI HUNTS FOR BIG GAME AT FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bigger the game, the better Mike Parisi pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be the rule for the Cal State Fullerton right-hander, who is 
3-0 with an 0.72 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, a junior from Arcadia, has beaten Stanford and pitched consecutive 
shutouts against Arizona and Texas. He has helped the third-ranked Titans 
compile a 10-1 record, their best start since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi has a history of pitching well when it counts most. As a freshman, he 
defeated Louisiana State at Baton Rouge, La., in an NCAA regional game, then 
beat Florida State in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he beat San Jose State to give Coach Augie Garrido his 1,000th 
victory and beat Maine in the Central II regional at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it, but when I look back on it, all of my best games -- even 
in high school -- were against the better teams," said Parisi, who is 18-4 at 
Fullerton. "I guess I'm more focused, but going into those games, I don't 
really do anything differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi is one of several pitchers back from last season who are expected to 
help carry Fullerton to its second College World Series appearance in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into this year, I just wanted to be one of the top pitchers in the 
country," Parisi said. "My work ethic is a step above what it was last year in 
all areas, including lifting weights and eating right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm starting to open up some eyes. I'm definitely starting to see 
more interest (from pro scouts). Hopefully, I'll handle it the right way."

 Trivia time: What USC player was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1965 and 
by the Dodgers in 1966 and 1970, but never played professional baseball? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Shaken up: USC pitcher Ben Tucker's streak of bad luck continued last month 
when he broke his thumb when he fell down a spiral staircase during the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, a junior right-hander from Fresno who was expected to be a starter, 
probably will not play until April. Or he might become a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up during the earthquake and tried to get out of my (second floor) 
apartment," Tucker said. "The next thing I knew, I was at the bottom of the 
staircase. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the aftershocks, I've been gripping onto the bed and staying there." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Tucker was sidelined for six weeks because of a broken rib. He 
missed most of a summer league season in Kansas after breaking his hand in a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teammates call me 'Bad Luck Tuck,' because of all the stuff that has 
happened to me," Tucker said. "Coach (Mike Gillespie) calls me 'Bubble Boy.' 
They think they need to put me in a plastic bubble to keep me ready for the 
last part of the season."

 Demolition order: The cinder-block outfield wall at Cal State Northridge was 
damaged in several places during the quake. School officials, busy with more 
serious rebuilding concerns, are still deciding whether the wall will be 
repaired or replaced by a chain-link or wood fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestion: Tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years. Several 
outfielders have suffered injuries by running into it it, and the university 
has been lucky that no one has suffered a serious head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 For a campus facing millions of dollars in quake-related repairs, an outfield 
wall obviously does not rank as a priority. But when the issue does receive 
consideration, replacing the cinder-block wall with a more forgiving material 
would be a wise investment.

 Riptide: Pepperdine pitchers gave up 25 home runs in 58 games last season. In 
their first seven games this season, the Waves surrendered 11 and issued 51 
walks in 62 innings. Not surprisingly, Pepperdine started this week with a 3-4 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves will try to get their pitching staff in order this weekend when they 
travel to Texas for a three-game series against the Longhorns.

 Hot water: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, scheduled to move to Division I next 
season, is off to a 6-0 start and ranked No. 1 in Division II by Collegiate 
Baseball magazine despite an internal investigation into the program's 
financing and Coach Steve McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland, in his 10th season, admitted in January that he paid six current 
and former players $6,400. The money, McFarland said, was for registration 
fees. McFarland is on paid leave while a university committee conducts its 
probe. The committee's findings will be presented to university officials and 
the NCAA, both of which could levy penalties against the program.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; UNDER IT ALL, LEGALITIES WEAR ON THE 
JOCKEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 15 years ago, a public relations man in New York wrote Jockey 
International, the company that makes underwear, inquiring if it might be 
interested in using some bona fide riders to endorse its goods. Jockeys for 
Jockey seemed such a natural idea, but when the underwear people replied, the 
brainstorming flack was caught short. Jockey International had no interest 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a few years ago, the Jockeys' Guild, which represents most of the riders 
in this country, made plans to introduce its own line of sports apparel -- 
jackets, caps, sweaters, golf shirts, etc. Just about everything but underwear. 
This is when the antennae of several executives at Jockey International in 
Kenosha, Wis., began pointing in the direction of the Jockeys' Guild 
headquarters in Lexington, Ky. The antennae of Jockey International's legal 
staff were especially homing in on Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Jockeys' Guild has come out with its first line of clothes. The group 
has published a snappy four-color brochure that has some of its most celebrated 
riders -- Pat Day, Jerry Bailey, Mike Smith and Tami Purcell -- modeling the 
gear. But there's one thing missing. The logo on all the items doesn't have the 
word jockey in it. In fact, jockey appears only a few times in the brochure -- 
mostly buried in the advertising copy's small print. 
</P>
<P>
 The logo on the clothing says "The Guild," and there's a riding cap above the 
lettering and a riding crop underneath. Thank heaven for small pictures, 
because otherwise the public might not know whether this is the Jockeys' Guild 
selling these articles, or the Newspaper Guild, or the Actors' Guild, or any of 
the dozens of other guilds. 
</P>
<P>
 A call was placed to Kentucky to see who took the Jockey out of the Jockeys' 
Guild. "Jockey International did," said John Giovanni, a former rider who is 
national manager of the Jockeys' Guild. "We've been in business a long time, 
but we never registered the 'Jockey' trademark. Jockey International did. And 
they wrote me a nasty letter saying that I'd better not use (their trademark) 
in any of the things we're selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey International has owned the licensed trademark since the 1930s or '40s, 
according to Charlotte Shapiro, legal counsel for Jockey International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone familiar with trademark law would understand that this is not such a 
far-fetched restriction that we're putting on the Jockeys' Guild," Shapiro 
said. "We're not being unreasonable. If the Jockeys' Guild came out with the 
word jockey on their clothing line, most people would not know that this isn't 
Jockey International's products. This was our greatest concern. Besides 
underwear, we produce a lot of things that are like the line that the jockeys 
are coming out with." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanni said that as the Jockeys' Guild attempted to launch this enterprise, 
Jockey International was willing to make one concession. "They were going to 
allow us to sell a few thousand caps and T-shirts over a two-year period, 
providing that we would then never use the word jockey again," he said. "I put 
that letter in my round file. They're a bunch of bullies, that's what they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to her own file on this matter, Shapiro said Jockey International's 
offer wasn't the way Giovanni remembered it. "We were going to let them use the 
word jockey if they agreed to sell only 2,500 T-shirts, 2,500 jackets and 2,500 
caps a year, for an unlimited number of years," she said. "But only their own 
members could buy these items, and all of the proceeds would have to go to the 
Jockeys' Guild's disabled-jockeys fund." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, a percentage of the profits from "The Guild" clothing line is going 
toward the support of disabled jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our idea from the beginning," Giovanni said. "All I'm trying to do 
is provide money for 47 riders who are permanently disabled. I wish I had a 
couple hundred thousand dollars to spare, and I'd take them to court. But I 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro wanted to make it clear that Jockey International is not suggesting 
that Giovanni's organization be stripped of its official name. It's just that 
when it comes to selling clothes, the jockeys can't be "Jockeys." 
</P>
<P>
 This does not appease Giovanni, who because of his battles with Jockey 
International has recently become a critic of television underwear commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see some of the things they've been running?" Giovanni said. "They've 
got some guys who are dressed up like jockeys, and not one of them looks like a 
real jockey. None of their caps fit. And one of them looks like he's about 80 
years old. The least they could have done was hire Laffit Pincay. He's got a 
body that looks like it's been sculpted. And there are a lot of other riders 
around who are built just as good as he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting back the only way he knows how, Giovanni has been fishing around with 
other companies, competitors of Jockey International, to see if they would join 
the Jockeys' Guild in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already got the theme for the first campaign," Giovanni said. "How 
about: ' Real Jockeys Wear Munsingwear'?"

NHL ROUNDUP; CLARK PICKS UP SLACK IN MAPLE LEAF VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On an evening of fraught with streaks, a few ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the chagrin of New Jersey Coach Jacques Lemaire, none of them were the 
Devils'. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto broke a streak Thursday at home, where Wendel Clark scored both goals 
in the Maple Leafs' 2-1 victory over New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Toronto's first victory since Nov. 27 without a goal by Doug Gilmour or 
Dave Andreychuk, whose 16-game point streak also ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark skated on the second line, with Mike Eastwood and Rob Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Leaf Coach Pat Burns said he liked what he saw from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys were playing hard, and I say if they're playing hard, I'll give them 
ice time," Burns said. "Gilmour and Andreychuk, it wasn't their night. If 
Eastwood's line doesn't show up, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemaire was angry after his team's troubles continued, even after a four-day 
rest period. New Jersey is winless in its last three games overall (0-2-1) and 
its last six on the road (0-3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few guys looking for excuses," Lemaire said. "If they're not 
happy, they can watch from the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 8, San Jose 2 -- Mike Ricci scored five goals at San Jose, tying a club 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricci scored three times at even strength, once on a power play and once 
short-handed. He has 15 points in his last four games against the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, Hartford 4 -- After the Penguins had gone 0 for 6 on power 
plays, Kevin Stevens and Mike Stapleton scored with the man advantage in the 
third period to lift the Penguins at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and Stapleton scored from close range against Hartford goaltender Sean 
Burke as the Penguins won their third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 4, Montreal 3 -- Shawn Chambers scored on a power play at 18:54 of 
the third period to lift the Lightning at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers got the game-winning goal with a slap shot from just inside the blue 
line as the Lightning snapped a five-game home winless streak (0-3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Chicago 2 -- Geoff Courtnall and Jyrki Lumme each had a goal and 
an assist for the Canucks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks have lost five of their last six games.

 The NHL must hand over millions of dollars in pension funds to hundreds of 
former players, Ontario's highest court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a lower court judgment that said the NHL 
wrongly used a pension-fund surplus in the mid-1980s to add to pensions for 
active players. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Toronto Maple Leaf Carl Brewer said the ruling should mean about $45 
million in Canadian funds and will be distributed to about 1,000 former 
players. The Canadian dollar is worth about 74 cents. Football

 John Shaw, the Rams' executive vice president, said the team will entertain 
trade talks for Jim Everett, adding that the quarterback "definitely has market 
value."

 The Rams extended an offer sheet for $649,000 to restricted free agent 
defensive end Robert Young, securing the team a first-round draft pick as 
compensation if another team signs him.

 The Rams' offer to Young was nearly $500,000 more than what he made last 
season.

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S. OFFICIALS HEARTENED -- AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. officials now expect NATO to achieve at least ragged compliance with its 
demand for withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb howitzers and other heavy weapons 
that have rained random death on Sarajevo for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And respite for Bosnia's battered capital is likely to be accomplished without 
an immediate need for allied air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unsteady cease-fire in the snow-encrusted mountains above Sarajevo is 
not expected to last more than two or three months at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed fighting, when it comes, will probably include not only a resumption 
of the shelling that has claimed 10,000 lives in the besieged capital but also 
a determined ground offensive by numerically superior Muslim forces that have 
heretofore been defensive underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 New fighting by Croat troops seeking to recapture lost ground and stabilize 
their positions in Bosnia is also expected. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, with Monday's deadline for compliance with the U.N. and NATO 
ultimatum in Sarajevo close at hand, the assessments that are guiding the 
Clinton Administration run nearly parallel with those of analysts on the ground 
in Bosnia and elsewhere: a bittersweet mixture of surprising optimism for the 
short term and deep-seated pessimism for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best, the West has provided an interval of sanity for Sarajevo. But the 
war will continue," said a congressional source, echoing the thinking of 
officials inside the U.S. government. "The factors required to make all the 
parties believe that peace is in their best interest at the same time simply 
aren't there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders want to avoid an outright armed clash with allied air 
power and will comply with the ultimatum enough to avoid such attacks. Their 
ultimate goals will not change, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the immediate future, we're likely to get cooperation. But whether within 
a month or even sooner, all sides will begin a testing period to see what they 
can get away with," said Zalmay Khalilzad, former assistant undersecretary of 
defense for policy planning and now senior strategist at the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, even immediate respite for the dispirited citizens of Sarajevo -- 
welcome as it will be in psychological and humanitarian terms -- is not likely 
to end the grim work of "ethnic cleansing" by Serb nationalists using terror, 
harassment and persecution against Muslims elsewhere in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will lifting the siege of Sarajevo bring automatic relief for dozens of 
cities and towns lacking the symbolic prominence of the long-suffering capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the 40,000 Muslims trapped in Srebrenica will not change, nor 
will that of the 150 Canadian soldiers serving as the encircled town's human 
shield. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bosnian Serb forces still operate deadly artillery cordons around the 
predominantly Muslim cities of Gorazde, Zepa, Maglaj and Bihac. So far, they 
are believed to have held back from wholesale killings and expulsions primarily 
to stave off the kind of punitive actions that NATO is threatening for Bosnian 
Serb gunners above Sarajevo. But such enclaves remain highly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, angry Serbian leaders in Belgrade and in the Bosnian Serb stronghold 
of Pale have warned that Western intervention might widen the Balkans conflict, 
rather than contain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are openly telling everyone: In case of air strikes, all foreigners who 
find themselves on our territory will become hostages," Gen. Manojlo 
Milovanovic, the Bosnian Serb army chief of staff, was quoted as warning in the 
latest edition of the Serbian weekly Intervju. "Those include International Red 
Cross and (U.N. relief) workers and, sadly, journalists too." 
</P>
<P>
 The defiant rebel leader also threatened "massacre of international 
representatives" in Muslim enclaves, an apparent reference to the Canadians in 
Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hundreds of aid workers and 12,000 U.N. troops deployed throughout 
Bosnia could be moved to more secure areas as a precaution against their 
becoming targets for retaliation. But some have recently been reminded of their 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Five officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office in the 
northern Serb stronghold of Banja Luka were prevented from leaving Serb-held 
territory last week on the pretext of having failed to apply for travel 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 A UNHCR official conceded privately, however, that the agency interpreted the 
incident as an attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to keep potential hostages within 
their grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Real as such dangers are, what will bring short-term relief to Sarajevo, if it 
comes, will be the punishing potential of NATO air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has amassed more than 200 combat aircraft and a flotilla of warships 
around the Adriatic Sea in its biggest show of force since the 1991 allied 
strike against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance officials have not said publicly when and how they would strike 
against recalcitrant Bosnian Serb gunners who defied the 1 a.m. Monday (4 p.m. 
Sunday PST) deadline for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior Western military officials have indicated that they might target 
command posts, ammunition bases and other strategic sites as well as the heavy 
artillery emplacements retained in defiance of the withdrawal order. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strikes would likely do more to shackle the Bosnian Serb war machine than 
would direct hits at artillery, because communications with rebel commanders 
throughout Bosnia would be frustrated and vital lines of supply broken. 
</P>
<P>
 If Monday's deadline does in fact bring an acceptable level of Bosnian Serb 
compliance without allied air strikes, the next critical period is expected to 
come in late March, as the spring thaws and longer hours make fighting easier 
and as the U.N. peacekeeping mandates in both Bosnia and Croatia are up for 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, congressional sources and other experts all 
predict a series of violations before there is any significant or lasting 
progress on a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 After an interval, in this view, the Bosnian Serbs will resume their 
cat-and-mouse game of testing U.N. resolve by secretly moving weapons back near 
Sarajevo and resuming the bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Muslims are equally unlikely to use the long-awaited end 
to fighting in the Bosnian capital to seek a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Western government leaders have been saying for months that they want a viable 
Bosnian state to emerge from partitioning talks underway in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 But an apparently successful U.N. ultimatum will embolden the Muslim forces to 
go on the offensive in an effort to recover more territory, it is believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the past six months, Muslims and Croat forces have initiated much of 
the combat in Bosnia, and that's not likely to change, regardless of the action 
to secure Sarajevo," the congressional source noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim troops were considered elite in the army of the former Yugoslav 
federation, according to U.S. officials. They are also more numerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb forces have been able to seize large sectors of Bosnia largely 
because of vastly superior armaments and disorganization among the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims have carried out an effective reorganization of their forces and, 
while almost completely lacking in heavy weapons, have plenty of small arms and 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "With their superior numbers, the Muslims now have a chance to dominate on the 
ground. And there are sections of greater Sarajevo and other areas of Bosnia 
that they might try to take to enhance the size of their region," Khalilzad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wild card is the Croatians. On the one hand, Croatia holds the key to a 
major Muslim demand -- access to the Adriatic Sea for the landlocked state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosnian Croats have also been losing territory to the Muslims in recent 
weeks, leading Croatia to dispatch its troops into Bosnia. Well in excess of 
5,000 Croatian troops have joined their ethnic brethren to fight Muslim forces. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the Croatian-Serbian front has been comparatively quiet recently, 
it remains highly unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, congressional sources and U.S. experts all 
anticipate some kind of renewed fighting to sort out the boundaries of a larger 
Serbia and a more abbreviated Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided to use a large cannon to secure a small target because the 
target -- Sarajevo -- is important. But there's a great deal more of Bosnia to 
worry about. The current arrangements are not likely to either stabilize or 
eliminate this problem," another congressional source said.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOUND AT WEST L.A. POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two veteran officers have been transferred and others may also be disciplined 
as a result of a sweeping investigation of sexual harassment inside the LAPD's 
West Los Angeles station, which has a long-held but hotly disputed reputation 
for hostility toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal inquiry, under way for four months and all but completed after 
interviews of more than 100 officers, has concluded that some male officers 
harassed female counterparts, while others covered for male officers or failed 
to take action to stem the problem, department sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrative charges are being contemplated against the two officers who 
were transferred and perhaps against an unspecified number of others, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation also has prompted LAPD leaders to review department training 
in order to determine whether additional measures are needed to supplement 
sexual harassment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the inquiry, investigators concluded that 
some male officers from West Los Angeles derided the abilities of women, 
publicly complained that women officers were given preferential treatment and, 
in at least one instance, failed to come to the aid of a woman who was fighting 
off a suspect in the back of a police car. Investigators also found that 
supervisors either failed to detect sexism or that they tolerated it, creating 
an environment that made working at the station uncomfortable for some female 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the department has yet to release any official findings from the 
inquiry, City Councilman Marvin Braude and members of the Los Angeles Police 
Commission have been briefed about it privately. The commission briefing took 
place Tuesday, and sources said some members were slack-jawed with amazement at 
the breadth of the alleged problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, several commissioners declined comment, saying the inquiry was 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission President Gary Greenebaum said he could not comment on the status 
of the investigation. But he stressed that the inquiry was initiated by the 
department, and he credited LAPD officials with moving aggressively to root out 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners at first "were disconcerted," Greenebaum said. "And we were 
also, at the same time, heartened by the fact that the department moved as 
quickly and as well as it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. David J. Gascon, a department spokesman, would not discuss the specific 
allegations but confirmed that there was an "inquiry into the work 
environmental conditions in one of our areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon added that the inquiry was "substantially complete and has led to some 
immediate management actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations of sexual harassment at the West Los Angeles station are far 
from the LAPD's first brush with the issue. When the Christopher Commission 
reviewed the department in 1991, it found a "strongly felt gender bias" and 
widespread discrimination against female officers. Also, the commission 
uncovered a number of computer messages, some laced with profanities, that it 
labeled "blatantly sexist." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the current investigation reportedly touches a number of areas, a 
Police Department source said "the focus primarily is on West L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The station's reputation dates back more than a decade. In the early 1980s, a 
group of male officers there formed an informal group to protest what they 
considered the unfair promotions of female officers. They jokingly dubbed that 
group M.A.W., short for "Men Against Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Since those days, rumors of sexism and racism have continued to dog the West 
Los Angeles station despite vehement denials by many officers who work there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the current inquiry -- formally known as an "audit" -- two 
officers, Stephen M. McNicholas and Jay A. Varga, have been transferred and 
removed from the list of officers eligible for promotions, officials said. More 
action is expected soon, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude, who chairs the council's Public Safety Committee, said he had been 
briefed about the progress of the investigation, but he declined to provide 
details. "It's a personnel matter," Braude said. "The charges are serious, and 
it's inappropriate for me to comment." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit has stirred deep anxiety within the West Los Angeles police station, 
where officers have been pulled aside and interviewed one at a time since fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've questioned at least half of the personnel at West L.A.," said Gary 
Fullerton, a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League who has 
represented officers involved in the inquiry. "The way they're doing this is 
just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fullerton, three detectives and a lieutenant were assigned to 
conduct the investigation, which he and other critics derided as a "witch 
hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials say the audit, which was not sparked by any specific 
complaint, was not intended to investigate individual officers, but rather was 
focused on how to improve working conditions for all police officers. 
Nevertheless, a team of investigators has been brought in to review the 
findings and to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the sexual harassment allegations, Varga, 44, and 
McNicholas, 33, are said to be outstanding officers with sterling personnel 
records. Varga, who has been with the department for nearly 20 years, is a 
"senior lead officer," a supervisorial position that generally is given only to 
officers who have won high marks for their service. McNicholas, also a 
respected officer, recently marked his 10th anniversary with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the department tried to transfer the two officers but was blocked 
after they objected in court. Gregory G. Petersen, an Orange County attorney 
who specializes in representing police officers, said the current investigation 
was an effort to punish his clients for arguing with the department brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bogus," Petersen said, who ii. "I know one thing: LAPD is not telling 
the truth about what it's doing to its officers." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit report is said to run several hundred pages and to detail a number 
of alleged instances of sexual harassment. The allegations range from the 
merely rude -- one male officer was said to have worked an entire shift with 
barely a word to his female partner -- to the potentially dangerous: 
Investigators maintained that McNicholas failed to come promptly to the aid of 
a female officer when a suspect overwhelmed her in the back seat of a police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas and other officers have denied those allegations, Fullerton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disturbing to some observers is the allegation that supervisors failed to 
detect, or tolerated, such behavior, in the process creating a working 
environment that made some female officers uncomfortable. Police officials 
stressed that officers who willingly allowed misconduct to take place could 
face discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams has been monitoring the inquiry and will 
review any proposed changes in training, Gascon said. "The chief of police is 
committed to having a professional work environment where all employees -- male 
and female, sworn and civilian -- are treated properly, with respect and 
dignity, and are able to perform at an optimum level," Gascon said.

IN U.S. REVERSAL, MINORITY-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing a controversial George Bush Administration policy, Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley announced Thursday that colleges and universities 
can offer scholarships made available only to members of minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy will encourage institutions to offer scholarships based on race 
or national origin to remedy past discrimination by the institutions or to 
achieve diversity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the doors to post-secondary education to remain open for minority 
students," Riley said. "This policy helps to achieve that goal in a manner that 
is consistent with the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is based on the Clinton Administration's interpretation of Title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funds 
from discriminating on the basis of race, color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the legal complexities involved, however, the policy said that the 
awards must be "narrowly tailored." For example, colleges should demonstrate 
that they have considered other methods of diversifying their campus before 
turning to minority scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy over race-specific scholarships erupted in late 1990 
when the head of the Education Department's civil rights office advised 
officials of the Fiesta Bowl -- a post-season college football game -- that it 
should not earmark scholarship money for African American players on the two 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The education department official, Michael Williams, argued that the 
restriction would violate the civil rights law by discriminating based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision catapulted Williams -- a relatively obscure Bush appointee -- 
into the limelight and made the White House nervous. Williams, who still stands 
by his interpretation of the law, said the issue made such a big splash 
"because I'm black, because I'm Republican and because the White House got 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid further negative publicity, the Bush Administration decided not to 
issue further rulings until the Government Accounting Office issued a report on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, issued last month, found that scholarships restricted to 
applicants based on race, sex, religion, disability or national origin amounted 
to only a small portion of all scholarships -- 5% in undergraduate schools, 3% 
in graduate schools and 10% in professional schools. Of those, at least 
three-fourths were granted on the basis of racial or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials believe minority-targeted scholarships help them attract 
students who might otherwise not be interested because of financial limitations 
or a perception that they would be culturally isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 "By increasing diversity within their student bodies, schools can promote 
equal access to educational opportunities and provide a broader and more 
enriched educational experience," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams challenged the assumption that it will give more minority students 
access to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not increase the total number of minority kids going to college," 
said Williams, who now works as a civil rights attorney in Ft. Worth. "What 
these scholarships do is decide what school they go to -- they're recruiting 
tools." 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to increase the total number of minority students going to 
college, he argued, is by offering better elementary and secondary education so 
more students are prepared for college. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the new policy "allows for discrimination," he argued. "Any 
time it's advantageous to one group of people, by definition, it's 
disadvantageous to another." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, a federal judge ruled that a four-year, all-expenses-paid 
scholarship program at the University of Maryland that is exclusively for black 
students is constitutional because it is aimed at correcting past 
discrimination at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino student who filed a lawsuit challenging the scholarship 
requirements has filed an appeal and the case is now under review by the court 
of appeals. The student's attorney said Thursday he is confident that the lower 
court's decision will be overturned, making the new education department policy 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ultimately the courts that will decide this question," said Richard A. 
Samp, chief counsel at the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public 
interest group. "The department of education does not interpret the 
Constitution, the courts do." 
</P>
<P>
 Samp argues that the department is "misinterpreting the law." 
</P>
<P>
 "Title VI clearly states that any recipient of federal funds may not 
discriminate based on race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Atwell, the president of the American Council on Education, called 
the "reverse discrimination" argument "bogus" and said the department's action 
will increase the opportunities for minority students by encouraging 
post-secondary institutions to establish special scholarships for minority 
students.

RANDY SHILTS, CHRONICLER OF AIDS EPIDEMIC, DIES AT 42; JOURNALISM: AUTHOR OF 
'AND THE BAND PLAYED ON' IS CREDITED WITH AWAKENING NATION TO THE HEALTH 
CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Shilts, a tenacious, award-winning journalist who became the nation's 
foremost chronicler of gay life and the AIDS epidemic, died early Thursday at 
his ranch in the Sonoma County redwoods. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Shilts, who learned he was infected with HIV in 1987, died of AIDS, according 
to a statement released by the San Francisco Chronicle, where Shilts worked as 
a national correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for his groundbreaking writing on the disease that took his life, 
Shilts was hailed by gay leaders and fellow journalists as a pioneer whose work 
propelled AIDS out of anonymity and into the consciousness of mainstream 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each and every person claimed by AIDS is a loss to the movement," said David 
M. Smith of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "But Randy's contribution 
was so crucial. He broke through society's denial and was absolutely critical 
to communicating the reality of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 William German, editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the newspaper 
where Shilts worked for 13 years is indebted to him, as society should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire world community has reason to honor Randy Shilts for his . . . 
relentless investigation that helped all of us become aware of a global 
epidemic," German said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Respected for his dogged reporting, painstaking research and obsession with 
fairness, Shilts became the first newspaper reporter to cover the gay community 
full time shortly after he was hired by the Chronicle in 1981. Later, he 
persuaded the newspaper to let him focus exclusively on the then-mysterious 
disease that came to be known as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he published an acclaimed book about the epidemic and its neglect by 
government, science and some gay organizations. "And the Band Played On: 
Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic" was translated into seven languages and 
became a docudrama broadcast on HBO in September. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent book, "Conduct Unbecoming," was published last year and 
examined discrimination against gays and lesbians in the military. Like "And 
the Band Played On," it reached the bestseller lists. Shilts also wrote "The 
Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk," about the gay San 
Francisco supervisor who was murdered along with Mayor George Moscone. Warner 
Bros. is developing a film based on the 1982 book. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleve Jones, founder of the Names Project, which produced the AIDS quilt, 
called Shilts a hero whose writings are "without question the most important 
works of literature affecting gay people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones also sounded a somber note, arguing that despite the efforts of 
Shilts and other prominent gays "who believed they could single-handedly stop 
the epidemic," AIDS rages on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy's death is a very sad milestone because it underscores for me our utter 
failure," said Jones, a friend of Shilts for 20 years. "All of this 
extraordinary talent is gone and none of this has moved the Congress and 
President to responsible action." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was worshiped by many in gay circles for enlightening 
heterosexuals, Shilts was controversial among more radical members of the 
movement, some of whom labeled him a "gay Uncle Tom." In the mid-1980s, his 
stories suggesting that gay bathhouses in San Francisco were breeding grounds 
for AIDS made him a pariah, unable to walk through the city's Castro District 
without being jeered or spat upon. 
</P>
<P>
 When "And the Band Played On" came out, he was attacked for charging that gay 
groups initially pretended that AIDS did not exist. More recently, he was 
faulted for opposing the "outing" of prominent, closeted gays, including two 
four-star generals he described anonymously in "Conduct Unbecoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Shilts was hurt by such barbs, but refused to alter his message or obscure the 
truth to win friends. In the author's note for "The Mayor of Castro Street," he 
offered this explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only answer that I tried to tell the truth and, if not be objective, at 
least be fair; history is not served when reporters prize trepidation and 
propriety over the robust journalistic duty to tell the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Martin Shilts was born Aug. 8, 1951, in Davenport, Iowa, but spent most 
of his youth in the Chicago suburb of Aurora. His father, Bud, sold 
prefabricated housing, while his mother, Norma, saw that Randy and his four 
brothers grew up as solid Methodists. Early on, Shilts appeared to share his 
parents' politically conservative views; in high school, he founded a local 
chapter of Young Americans for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 He went west for college, choosing the University of Oregon in Eugene and 
beginning his journalism career on the student paper. At age 20, Shilts 
declared his homosexuality, and later ran for student office under the slogan 
"Come Out for Shilts." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite graduating at the top of his class, Shilts struggled to find work in 
Oregon, a fact he attributed to homophobia. Eventually, he signed on as 
Northwest correspondent for the Advocate, a national gay and lesbian magazine, 
and later made his way to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years as a television and free-lance journalist, Shilts was 
hired by the Chronicle, becoming the first openly gay reporter at a major 
metropolitan newspaper. That same year marked the emergence of a rare pneumonia 
and skin cancer afflicting a handful of gay men in New York, Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. In 1982, Shilts began covering what then was called "the gay 
plague." 
</P>
<P>
 Shilts learned he was infected with HIV the day he wrote the final page of 
"And the Band Played On" in March, 1987. He had allowed his doctor to test him 
a year earlier, but asked not to be told the result, fearing it might influence 
his reporting. He did not disclose his condition publicly until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, he took the drug AZT and his health remained good. Gradually, 
the drug's effects faded, and in August, 1992, the day before his 41st birthday 
party, he came down with AIDS-related pneumonia. Four months later, a lung 
collapsed, and he was forced to dictate the final pages of "Conduct Unbecoming" 
from his hospital bed. Last year, he was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, the 
AIDS-related cancer that causes lesions. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Shilts had been mostly homebound since then, weak and tethered to 
an oxygen machine but continuing to enjoy life with his partner, Barry 
Barbieri, and beloved golden retriever, Dashiel. In January, he managed to take 
a long-anticipated trip to the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and in 
August attended what some called a highlight of his life -- the Los Angeles 
screening of HBO's version of "And the Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his battle with AIDS, Shilts maintained a philosophical attitude 
about the disease, once likening it to "high blood pressure or some other 
life-threatening illness." As his battle worsened last year, he said in an 
interview with the New York Times that AIDS was "character-building." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made me see all of the shallow things we cling to, like ego and vanity. 
Of course, I'd rather have a few more T-cells and a little less character." 
</P>
<P>
 Credited for his foresight about the danger of AIDS, Shilts died just days 
after a report that showed that the annual number of new AIDS cases in San 
Francisco peaked at 3,326 in 1992. City health department officials, who expect 
the number of AIDS cases to decrease dramatically by 1997, credit aggressive 
prevention efforts for the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Shilts is survived by Barbieri, who was beside him when he died; four 
brothers, Gary, Reed, Dennis and David, and his stepmother, Pat. Funeral 
services have not yet been scheduled.

MARTIN MARIETTA MAY CUT 2,400 JOBS IN PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of its pending deal to buy General Dynamics' space systems business, 
Martin Marietta has told the Defense Department that it may eliminate 2,400 
jobs by moving the San Diego operation to Denver, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant aerospace firm is also seeking extraordinary government concessions 
during the next 10 years that would reimburse the firm for more than the 
$208-million cost of the acquisition, arguing that the deal will also save the 
Pentagon money, internal Defense Department documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that what Martin Marietta has proposed amounts to asking U.S. 
taxpayers to subsidize the closure of a key aerospace plant in Southern 
California at a time when the region can least afford it. A big winner would be 
the shareholders of General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government agrees to share the cost savings, it would set an important 
precedent as the defense industry confronts its difficult future. Historically, 
the government has claimed virtually all cost savings that occur on military 
programs. The issue is hardly ever raised, however, because defense costs have 
seldom gone down. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the space systems operation would deal another sharp blow to 
California's aerospace industry, which has lost dozens of critical aerospace 
plants in recent years. For San Diego, struggling through the impact of 
military base closures, it would mark the loss of one of the city's remaining 
major aerospace firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta's brash proposal is being made by Chairman Norman Augustine, a 
highly respected expert on defense procurement issues. If the proposal had come 
from anybody else it might have been rejected out of hand. But Augustine 
carries perhaps more clout than any chief executive in defense and he was 
considered last month for the job of defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta officials have acknowledged that they are weighing an option 
to move production of the Atlas rocket system from San Diego to Denver, but 
insisted that they have made no decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they say another option is moving the operations from Denver to San 
Diego -- a possibility most experts consider remote. Under terms of the 
proposed sale, Martin Marietta has not even agreed to acquire the General 
Dynamics plant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the pattern of many aerospace consolidations since 1985, it appears 
all but certain that the company will leave California, according to one 
Defense Department official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 At a series of meetings in early February in San Diego, Martin Marietta 
officials told Pentagon administrators and auditors that the acquisition will 
reduce government contract costs by $450 million in the next decade, and Martin 
Marietta wants 50% of those savings, according to Pentagon documents obtained 
by The Times. (In addition to the plant consolidation, the savings would also 
come from combining the companies' launch pad operations at Vandenberg Air 
Force Base and Cape Canaveral.) 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials who attended those meetings came away with the 
understanding that the savings would be achieved by shutting down the San Diego 
plant, moving about 200 employees to Denver and laying off the other 2,200 
employees. But a Martin Marietta spokesman said that was only one of several 
options raised during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The precipitous downturn in defense procurement has left the industry saddled 
with massive overcapacity. The industry has been slow to cut back, in part 
because federal regulations have provided little profit incentive for major 
companies to merge or shut down, according to investment industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July policy memo, Undersecretary of Defense John Deutch said the 
government should be willing to pay for the restructuring costs of industry 
that arise in a merger or acquisition if the government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin Marietta proposal goes much further in asking for a sharing of 
future cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta has until mid-March to obtain government approvals for the 
deal, which was announced in December. Thus, the aerospace firm, based in 
Bethesda, Md., wants government approval of its controversial proposal in the 
next 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line on this deal," said one government official opposed to it, 
"is that General Dynamics shareholders are going to get rich, Martin Marietta 
is going to get a company for free, and 2,200 workers are going to lose their 
jobs."  
</P>
<P>
 However, a New York investment executive said that if the government turns 
down the Martin Marietta proposal it would represent a serious blow to future 
defense consolidation. The compelling need for cutting defense industrial 
capacity demands this kind of flexible approach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta has agreed to pay General Dynamics $10 million if the deal 
fails and has insisted that it will not go through with the deal without 
concurrence by the government to share the cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pentagon documents obtained by The Times, defense officials have 
not made up their minds about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed shared savings clause is considered unique," according to one 
Defense Department memo. "Martin Marietta is pursuing policy level decisions 
through formal briefings with senior (Department of Defense) and Air Force 
personnel." Defense officials turned down requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 LeRoy Haugh, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Assn., said his 
industry trade group supports the concept of the government sharing cost 
savings that result from mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first of its kind," Haugh said. "I am not aware of any other case 
where the same set of circumstances have come up. In principle, we would 
support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than buying the plant in San Diego, Martin Marietta is taking out a 
two-year lease. The arrangement is similar to one that General Dynamics struck 
with Hughes Aircraft on the sale of the missile business in Pomona, which 
resulted in Hughes shutting down the Pomona operation and taking the business 
to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Mayor Susan Golding said this week that she does not believe Martin 
Marietta has decided to move, based on discussions that city officials are 
having with the company. Although San Diego has higher housing costs than 
Denver, its workers' compensation rates are now lower than Denver's. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego submitted a proposal to Martin Marietta last week, outlining a case 
for keeping the operation in the city. Golding declined to say whether the city 
has offered any concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Martin Marietta has decided to leave San Diego, it would be precluded 
from saying so because it does not yet own the General Dynamics business and 
any announcement would make it subject to federal plant closing laws, the 
investment executive said.

RACER WINS EMPIRE CROWN; PRETENDERS LEFT IN THE DUST; NEW YORK: 80-FLOOR RUN IN 
FAMED BUILDING IS LIKE RUSH HOUR IN A DIRTY STAIRWELL, COMPLETE WITH THE 
BOTTLENECKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The annual race to the top of the Empire State Building began Thursday like so 
many things here in Gotham, with a big crowd of anxious people rushing for a 
small doorway in a ritual of angling and jostling and cursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once into the stairwell, scrambling up the 1,430 steps in a corridor only 40 
inches wide, there were the other predictable woes: overcrowding, stale air, 
occasional impoliteness. "Nobody wanted to yield," complained Darrin Eisman. 
"They held onto both the handrails and wouldn't let me by." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was Eisman who won. The 29-year-old research chemist from Golden, 
Colo., huffed and puffed up the 80 stories in 9 minutes and 37 seconds. "It was 
awful," he commented at the finish line, commencing what would become a 
half-hour coughing jag. "The dust, the dust, my lungs are so full of dust." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 17th year, the Empire State Building "Run Up" is true to this city of 
great events and tall deeds, of strange people and stranger undertakings. A 
hybrid of theatrics and aerobics, the race is part P.T. Barnum and part James 
Fixx. The runners start in the famous Art Deco lobby, but in a few quick feet, 
they must cram themselves into a dank, seldom-used stairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Each story in the building has two flights of stairs divided by a landing. It 
is hard to establish a running rhythm. The number of steps at each level 
varies; so does the length of the landing. Since no set of stairs goes clear to 
the top, competitors must change stairwells at the 20th and 65th floors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lung-busting jaunt, like some fevered dream of a marathon being run 
inside an M.C. Escher drawing. And somehow it is also glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 The run up now has 100 imitators worldwide. In Los Angeles, people charge up 
the First Interstate Bank building. In Cleveland, the Society Tower. In 
Orlando, the SunBank Center. In Detroit, the Renaissance Center, where they go 
up the stairs and down the elevator eight times for a "vertical mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisman, a lithe figure decidedly unmolested by the sweet rolls and hoagy dogs 
of life, had previously won the 37-story race up the 1999 Broadway building in 
Denver. "I can tell you that 37 is certainly a lot less than 80," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's winner among the women was the Australian schoolteacher Belinda 
Soszyn, 39, a sturdy stick of a person with legs like two iron bars. To get to 
New York, she had recently won the Sydney Tower Run Up. Her time here was 11 
minutes and 57 seconds. "A bit of a sweat," she said. "And I don't usually 
sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 116 entrants in all, some of them serious runners and climbers but 
others off on a whimsical lark or a personal quest. Roger Hull, president of 
Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., does something like this once a year. "You 
need to prove you're still alive, even if it kills you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chico Scimone, an 83-year-old orchestra conductor, lives on a farm in Sicily 
and makes his own wine and olive oil. He competes here to "test" if he has been 
living right. "I finish last, but I'm always first in my age category," he 
said, pleased with a time of 23 minutes and 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Nally, a high school track coach, is someone who enters every oddball 
event she can find: the 8 1/2-mile Thanksgiving Day race up an extinct volcano 
on Maui; the Midnight Run through Central Park on New Year's Eve; the dash up 
and back through the Lincoln Tunnel with a quick turnaround in Weehawken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your life," she said. "You have to do these things." Her favorite 
climb is the one up the CN Tower in Toronto, where the stairwell has a glass 
wall and the city skyline grows smaller as a runner ascends. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very clearest of days the Empire State Building has a wonderful view as 
well. The panorama from the top affords a look at not only New York, but four 
neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 Its stairwell, however, offers little that is pleasing to either the eye or 
the nose. "It smells like dust and body perspiration and people's leftover 
lunches," said Dr. Joseph Kenny of Franklin, Ind., who finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The building itself is 102 stories high, and the run up usually ends at the 
86th-floor observation deck. This year, because of construction, the finish 
line was on 80. The shorter distance created no changes in tactics. In fact, a 
run up does not have as many questions of strategy as of habits and manners. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, is it wise to pay attention to what floor it is? "I never look 
at the numbers," said Scimone, the 83-year-old. "I wait till I'm well up there. 
I saw 75, and I said, "Oh, that's nice, almost there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What is the etiquette for passing? "When you're 60 flights up and you're 
dragging and dying, believe me, you're not thinking about moving over for 
someone who wants to get through," said Stephen Maluk, who finished 48th. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing, nevertheless, is essential for the swift. To minimize commotion in 
the lobby, the race has only three heats started 86 seconds apart, first the 
women, then the faster men, then the slower men. The top men inevitably pass 
all the women on the way up. "Coming through," they yell. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, not everyone is cheerful about moving aside. Eisman, the 
winner, not only had trouble getting by the women, he found it hard to engage 
them in the simplest of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know if any men are ahead of me?" he asked as he sped past. No one 
would answer. Finally, he caught up to a female acquaintance from Colorado. 
"Any men pass you yet?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, there's just one woman ahead," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 He was inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe this," he said later, holding a trophy replica of the 
historic building. "The Empire State Building. Pretty tall." 
</P>
<P>
 And famous for being so. The building has been in 150 movies. King Kong scaled 
it much faster than Eisman, bothering with neither stairs nor elevators and 
cradling Fay Wray all the while. 
</P>
<P>
 The Empire State, located at 5th Avenue and 34th Street, was built in 1931 
during a time of skyscraper one-upmanship. It needed to be taller than the 
Chrysler Building, which opened the year before. (Today, Chicago has the 
tallest building, the Sears Tower.) 
</P>
<P>
 Getting up -- and down -- has always had its challenges. Some might say the 
building was too tall for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 A wayward, fog-lost B-25 bomber smashed into its 79th floor in July of 1945, 
killing 14 people. Migrating songbirds, drawn to the building's lights through 
a mist, once crashed into the tower by the hundreds, raining down on 
pedestrians below. The suicidal made frequent use of the spectacular decks 
until tall wire mesh was installed with incurving steel spikes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1945 citywide strike of elevator operators, the tenants of the Empire 
State were in for particular grief. Workers on a few of the higher floors put 
down cots and simply holed up. Even then, some were nearly starved out. The 
enterprising owner of a luncheonette carried sandwiches and coffee up to 
famished stockbrokers on the 31st floor. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no record of how long it took him to ascend the stairwell, but news 
accounts were consistent about his tip. The climb was worth $75.

PRIVATE VACATION CABINS IN PUBLIC FORESTS. SOME LIVE THERE FULL TIME, ERECTING 
EYESORES SUCH AS SATELLITE DISHES. A FEW POST 'KEEP OUT' SIGNS, CLAIMING LAND 
AS THEIR OWN.

<P>
 Richard Grillat wasn't looking for a fight -- just a peaceful day of fishing 
when he dropped his line in Bouquet Creek in the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 But cabin owner Janet Peters told Grillat he was trespassing, and allegedly 
heaved a rock at him when he refused to leave. Then her husband pumped two 
bullets into Grillat's van, according to a sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reactions seemed all the more extreme because Grillat was fishing on 
public land, as he had every right to do. But the Peterses blamed Grillat for 
refusing to be bullied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lived here off and on for nine years," they said in court papers. "We 
have asked over 300 carloads of people not to fish in that area and they all 
listened and left without question." 
</P>
<P>
 The episode reflects mounting problems with a nearly century-old policy of 
allowing private vacation cabins in public forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, nearly 16,000 people have summer homes on public land -- most 
paying permit fees of less than $500 per year for the privilege of keeping 
private retreats on some of America's most picturesque real estate. The cabins 
were built decades ago under permits from the U.S. Forest Service, and most 
have since been sold or passed on to heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the obscure program is rife with mismanagement and abuse, a recent report 
by the Forest Service says. Nowhere are the problems more glaring than in the 
Angeles, Los Padres, Cleveland and San Bernardino national forests of Southern 
California, where some cabin owners -- taking advantage of tight budgets and 
weak administration -- virtually have become a law unto themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Foresters say many cabin dwellers respect the rules and help them by acting as 
extra eyes and ears. "We've got some good permitees out here, and I wouldn't 
paint them all with the same brush," said Don Stikkers, assistant recreation 
officer for the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a few of the other kind, too, who think they own the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Intimidation of visitors is but one complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many permit-holders defy the most basic requirement that they use their 
dwellings only for recreation. Although that restriction is clearly spelled out 
-- and accounts for the modest permit fees they pay -- hundreds or even 
thousands of owners improperly use their cabins as cheap, full-time housing or 
as rental income property, according to interviews and the Forest Service 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-time occupancy, in turn, has converted many vacation tracts from rustic 
haunts into suburban outposts that bristle with satellite dishes, swing sets, 
paved driveways, security fences, and guard dogs -- along with odd piles of 
auto parts and construction debris. Officials also fear pollution of streams by 
primitive sewage systems that weren't designed for year-round use. 
</P>
<P>
 Unauthorized construction is a related problem. Virtually all exterior 
improvements must be approved as being in character with the forest setting. 
But the recent study, based on surveys conducted in 21 of the 155 national 
forests, found unauthorized construction at about half the cabin sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations were most severe in the Angeles and other forests of Southern 
California. "I couldn't believe how bad it was in the Angeles," said study team 
leader Roy Droege -- who attributed part of the area's problem to climate and 
geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cabin owners in the wilds of Montana may have little choice but to 
lock up for the winter, weather does not discourage those in the Southland from 
staying year-round. Moreover, the proximity of the city, with its high housing 
costs, means a windfall for forest dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "recreation residence" program, as it is formally known, has long outlived 
its original goal of getting Americans into their forests. Early this century, 
when long distances and primitive roads were formidable barriers to 
recreational use, the Forest Service began creating vacation tracts and issuing 
construction permits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sweet deal for permit-holders. Vacation tracts were laid out on 
choice stream and lakefront sites, setting the stage for future conflicts. The 
scenery was grand, and the price was even better. As Sunset magazine, in a 
how-to manual on cabin construction, exulted in 1938: "The cost -- and this 
will amaze you -- averages $15 per year for cabin sites." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, recreation access improved, and the government stopped issuing 
new permits in 1976 because the program was no longer needed and was breeding 
conflicts with other public uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some were wiped out by fires or floods, 15,570 cabins remain. 
California leads the nation with nearly 6,600 -- including 2,026 in the four 
Southland forests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angeles' 732 cabin owners typically are charged permit fees of $200 to 
$800, depending on the size and location of lots. About 10% of the dwellings 
change hands each year, selling on the open market at $12,000 to more than 
$100,000. New owners must obtain their own permits, often for 10-year terms, 
but these are issued routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeles officials estimate that 50% or more of these cabins are occupied 
full-time. The annual fees -- based on vacation use only -- clearly "are not 
commensurate with the kind of use we're getting. If you're a taxpayer, you're 
subsidizing somebody to live here," said Lee Urquhart, special use permits 
coordinator for the Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But most full-time residents are determined to stay. "I plan on dying here," 
said William Jackson, who lives year-round in San Dimas Canyon. "They'd have to 
take me out of here by gun," he said -- adding that "people would come up here 
and break all the windows" if he weren't there full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although perhaps worse than ever, full-time occupancy has been a chronic 
problem. In a halfhearted effort to eliminate it, Angeles officials declared in 
1970 that they would allow cabin dwellers who had been living full-time to 
stay, but would enforce the rules once their cabins changed hands. That amnesty 
still covers some full-time forest residents. Most, however, are newcomers who 
have simply refused to honor terms of the permits they've signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Foresters concede the scofflaws have little to worry about. Proving full-time 
occupancy is time-consuming and difficult -- involving extensive surveillance, 
case preparation and lengthy appeals. "There's a real reluctance . . . to get 
into one of these things because you know it's not going to happen easy," said 
Angeles Forest Supervisor Michael J. Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, while occasionally going to court or taking administrative action 
against violators, foresters usually try coaxing them into compliance or look 
the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if we could wear blinders, because every time we go out 
there to take care of a problem we find 30 more," Urquhart said. "I don't think 
we have a lot of credibility." Indeed, enforcement is so weak that about 100 
cabin owners don't even have permits -- having refused to sign a new one when 
the old one expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I would like to clean it up," said Mike Wickman, who heads the 
Angeles' Saugus ranger district. "But I'm pretty well handcuffed, and some of 
those people up there know it." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent driving tour of cabin tracts, Angeles officials seemed frustrated 
by a host of obvious violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tract of cabins in the Mt. Baldy ranger district, a man standing in front 
of a cabin told foresters he had been renting the place for months. The owner 
had ignored requirements to seek permission and rent for short periods only. 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby stream, officials were surprised to see a new bridge that the 
Forest Service had neither built nor approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in scenic San Dimas Canyon, foresters learned of the unauthorized 
burial of a new septic tank a few feet from a tributary of San Dimas Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Bouquet Canyon, unauthorized signs on ancient oak and sycamore trees 
inaccurately proclaimed: "Warning! No Trespassing. This is Private Property." 
</P>
<P>
 Many cabin lots were tidy, but others held boats and motor homes, old car 
batteries, metal drums, and battered furniture. Some had non-indigenous trees 
and flower gardens -- pretty, but inappropriate in a place reserved for native 
vegetation. Although required to be chained, large, menacing dogs roamed free. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said austere budgets have made it impossible to enforce the rules. 
Nationwide, cabin permit fees provide $7.2 million per year -- more than enough 
to overhaul the program. But that money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Meanwhile, 
"permit enforcement is minimal and declining," said the Forest Service report, 
because funds for the program "are almost nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 The squeeze seems particularly tight in the Angeles, whose operating budget 
has plunged 25% during the last dozen years to about $16 million. This, despite 
the fact that the Angeles is among the most heavily used forests, with a 
near-doubling of visitors since 1980. Nonetheless, the forest in recent years 
has closed 13 campgrounds and four picnic areas. The picture is so bleak that 
Angeles officials last fall appealed to forest users to help identify the 
agency's most important tasks -- since "we are no longer able to maintain the 
level of service we once provided." 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting staff to the cabin program is impossible, Rogers said, because 
"we've got too many other forest users that we need to provide services to." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a forest where litter, graffiti and vandalism are endemic, Angeles 
cabin owners hardly see themselves as part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they consider themselves a calming influence, whose mere presence 
serves "to mitigate some of the destructive behavior that forest visitors 
engage in," said David A. James, head of the Forest Preservation Society of 
Southern California, a cabin owners' advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more cabin owners that you have, the better your forest will behave," 
said Barret H. Weatherby, a long-time cabin owner in San Gabriel Canyon. For 
those reasons, said James and Weatherby, the Forest Service should be trying to 
expand the number of cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some cabin dwellers help with trail maintenance, litter pickup and 
graffiti removal. Others have performed rescues and other exemplary deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 When an ice storm stranded motorists near their cabin at Manker Flat several 
years ago, Frank and Carol Tapia suddenly found themselves hosting -- and 
feeding -- 43 grateful overnight guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive side is also reflected in the cabin community of Big Santa Anita 
Canyon, which may best approach the original ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Strung along Big Santa Anita Creek, these 80 cabins can be reached only by 
hikes ranging from one to four miles. That discourages full-time occupancy, and 
explains the lack of suburban amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where it all went wrong -- when the roads got built," said Glen Owens, 
53, whose cabin was built in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 A wiry man whose sandy mustache is going gray, Owens bought his cabin 30 years 
ago, paying $1,200 for the small wood-and-stone structure above the creek that 
gushes among alders and rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite waterfalls that attract day hikers, the canyon seems free of the trash 
and graffiti that spoil other forest sites. According to Owens, cabin owners 
and other volunteers are largely responsible for keeping it clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the people care about this canyon -- that's why it's this way," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other owners, however, who take too literally their roles as keepers 
of the forest. Some "get very possessive," even though their cabins are "a 
privilege . . . not a right," Urquhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have personally experienced use conflicts with some recreation 
residences and their owners," said a dozen retired Forest Service officers in a 
letter to top agency officials a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than a few permitees have been unpleasant . . . and attempted to 
exercise exclusive jurisdiction over use of the waterfront areas adjoining 
their cabins. These encounters can spoil a whole trip." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Angeles, such efforts often take the form of bogus "No Fishing" and "No 
Trespassing" signs. Those who don't take the hint, like Richard Grillat, may be 
in for a rude reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Grillat's trout fishing adventure unfolded in July, 1992. As detailed in court 
records and interviews, he was about to try his luck in Bouquet Creek when he 
was intercepted by Janet and Russell Peters and told he was trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical, Grillat drove to the Saugus ranger station, where foresters assured 
him he could fish the creek. So he went back, grabbed his pole and waded into 
the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, Janet Peters screamed at Grillat to leave, and threw a large rock 
when he would not go. Grillat said he soon heard several bursts of gunfire, and 
looked up to see Russell Peters standing on the cabin porch holding a smoking 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Grillat thought Peters was firing into the air. But the next morning, he 
gashed his leg on the door of his van and looked down to see jagged metal from 
a pair of bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, 66, acknowledged trying to drive Grillat away. "We're paying $400 a 
year to live there. Four hundred bucks!" he said in a recent interview. Yet 
"(Grillat) just said, 'Nuts to you, I'm fishing here,' " Peters recalled, as if 
he still could not believe it. According to the couple, however, Janet Peters 
threw the rock to splash Grillat, not hurt him. And they said Russell Peters 
didn't shoot up the van -- explaining that the spent shells which investigators 
found at the scene were from an earlier encounter with a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities charged the couple with disturbing the peace, shooting into an 
unoccupied vehicle and assault with a deadly weapon for throwing the rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Forest Service did not revoke the Peters' cabin permit. And the 
charges were dismissed when prosecution witnesses did not show up the day of 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Grillat said prosecutors gave him the wrong the court date and he "was pretty 
upset" the case was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 His run-in with the Peterses was not his only bad experience in Bouquet 
Canyon. Another time, Grillat said he was harassed by dogs and told by another 
cabin owner: "I planted the fish here, so they are . . . like my pets." 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are pretty wild," Grillat said. "Every time I go over there, I 
have some kind of story, so actually, I don't go over there anymore."

 Bosnian Serb forces Thursday began what U.N. observers called a massive 
withdrawal from mountaintop artillery nests ringing Sarajevo, offering the 
first serious sign that they may comply with a NATO ultimatum to end their 
siege or face air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials reported large weapons convoys moving away from the Bosnian 
capital, an apparent effort by the Serbian rebels to comply with a week-old 
NATO order to withdraw or surrender all heavy weapons within a 12-mile radius 
of the capital by 1 a.m. Monday, Sarajevo time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very heartening sign," said Col. Bill Aikman, spokesman for the U.N. 
Protection Force in Bosnia. "Clearly, there's a major withdrawal going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Since NATO issued its ultimatum, fewer than three dozen of the Serbs' hundreds 
of heavy artillery pieces had been removed before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. observers reported the dramatic increase in compliance efforts after 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met with a senior Russian envoy and 
announced that his nationalist forces will meet the NATO demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The envoy, Vitaly Churkin, conveyed to Karadzic a promise from Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin to contribute Russian soldiers to any new 
peacekeeping duties in Sarajevo if the Serbs would withdraw their heavy weapons 
from around the city, and urged them to turn over their artillery to U.N. 
forces "without delay." The two men met in Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold 
southeast of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin said after the talks that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw their 
weapons. It was not clear whether that pledge resulted from the Russian offer 
or the looming threat of NATO attacks, but Yeltsin's government claimed credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, said in Moscow that the Russian 
offer and the positive response of the Serbs "make the NATO bombardments 
groundless." 
</P>
<P>
 He told Russia's Interfax news agency that Yeltsin's plan "provides an 
opportunity to avoid an international conflict which could come about if the 
threat of air strikes materialized." 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, speaking on Russian television Thursday night, said he is certain the 
Serbs will withdraw fully from Sarajevo. He said the NATO ultimatum should be 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no need for air strikes in Bosnia because there will be no 
objects to bomb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian leaders have consistently opposed NATO air attacks and complained 
about not being consulted before last week's ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations' Aikman declined to specify what weapons were sighted in 
the evacuating convoys. Nor would he say where observers believed the arms were 
being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that at the current pace, the Serb rebels could complete 
withdrawal from the exclusion zone within 36 hours -- well ahead of the 
deadline set by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton said NATO is determined to force compliance 
with its ultimatum, but he expressed hope that the crisis is easing. "I hope 
the air strikes will not be necessary, and they will not occur if the Serbs 
will comply," Clinton told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. officials reacted cautiously to Yeltsin's offer of troops for 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has frequently tried to enlist Russian support to show 
solidarity between the world's major nuclear powers. However, most Russians are 
far more sympathetic to the Serbs, with whom they share ethnic and religious 
backgrounds, than to the rest of the international community. So the presence 
of Russian troops could complicate NATO's tough talk to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NATO defense ministers agreed to meet at Aviano air base in Italy 
on Sunday, just before the alliance deadline. The base would be an important 
one if air strikes were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry will attend, meeting with the defense 
ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands and Italy and with Gen. George 
Joulwan, the NATO commander, and Adm. Jeremy Boorda, head of the NATO air 
armada. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry will be accompanied by Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. reports of Serbian efforts to comply with the ultimatum came amid 
accusations by the Muslim-led Bosnian government that the rebels have been 
burying heavy weaponry on Mt. Trebevic, the Serb-held high ground at the 
southeastern edge of the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Ejup Ganic told reporters that the Bosnian Serbs were "digging 
holes." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to defuse the deadline," Ganic alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government has made no secret of its eagerness for Western 
military intervention to drive Serb forces back from the gun emplacements that 
surround the capital. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic has said NATO action would 
provide "a balance of force" that would lead to liberation of Sarajevo and 
re-establishment of government control over a considerable swath of central 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs loyal to the Belgrade government in the rump Yugoslavia have 
conquered and occupied 70% of Bosnia since taking up arms against this 
republic's 1992 vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb military commanders had vowed to defy the NATO ultimatum, 
claiming withdrawal would be tantamount to "capitulation." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a possible sign of internal conflicts about how to respond to the 
West's ultimatum, a senior Bosnian Serb officer in an interview published 
Thursday reiterated threats to take foreign aid workers and journalists hostage 
in retaliation for any air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel posture changed, at least publicly, after the Karadzic-Churkin 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. reports of departing Serb convoys came as mobs of Sarajevans returned 
to the streets, reveling in the relative serenity that has followed the 
ultimatum and the first cease-fire of the war to last more than a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 As the countdown to Monday's deadline continued, even as NATO fighter jets 
screeched over the city in ear-splitting acts of intimidation, the public mood 
seemed more cynical than anticipatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people are so consumed by the daily shortages of food, water and 
electricity that few are concentrating on the pronouncements of the West, said 
Haris Pasovic, head of a theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hoping too much is not good for our stomachs," he said, alluding to earlier 
Western threats of force that were not followed through. "People don't want to 
be betrayed anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In packed streets, children sledded in fresh snow, women marched out to get 
jugs of water, and dozens packed the few remaining cafes for sugarless Turkish 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Selma Rizvic, claimed to be winning the fight for normalcy and 
dignity among the horrors. "The problem isn't that we're hungry," said the 
26-year-old computer graphics artist. "The problem is that we know what it is 
like to live normally. We're not wild animals."

5 '3-STRIKES' BILLS OKD BY SENATE PANEL; LEGISLATION: ALL MEASURES ON REPEAT 
VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE APPROVED. THEY MUST CLEAR ANOTHER COMMITTEE BEFORE GOING 
TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All five "three strikes" bills aimed at imprisoning repeat offenders for life 
cleared their first Senate hurdle Thursday, and the upper house's new leader 
predicted that the Senate would end up passing them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The votes in the Senate Judiciary Committee came at the end of a daylong 
hearing at which senators added provisions to two bills making spousal abuse 
count as a "strike," which could lead to a sentence of 25 years to life or life 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the "three strikes" concept, and some senators who ended up voting 
for the bills, said the measures were misguided and called for more prevention. 
But as happened in the Assembly last month, senators cast aside such concerns 
and approved the bills overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have got to put these people away," said Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), Judiciary Committee chairman. "What else are we to do? There is no other 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost generations of people to drugs, the streets, and violence. We 
have lost them," Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) said. "You're going to have to 
lock the key up, and say, 'Lord, forgive us, we failed them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The measures must clear one more Senate committee before reaching the Senate 
floor. But Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer said after Thursday's hearing 
that the measures probably would win passage. 
</P>
<P>
 All the bills have passed in the Assembly. If they gain Senate approval they 
would return to the Assembly for concurrence on changes made in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus remained on legislation by Assemblymen Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim 
Costa (D-Fresno). Approved on an 8-3 vote, the Jones-Costa bill is almost 
identical to the proposed "three strikes and you're out" initiative that may go 
on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, Mike Reynolds, the initiative's proponent, said that unless 
the Jones-Costa bill clears the Legislature and is signed into law by March 7, 
he plans to turn over 600,000-plus signatures to the secretary of state's 
office, which will determine whether it qualifies for a statewide vote in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the hearing, Lockyer called the Jones-Costa bill and the 
initiative "overly broad, poorly written and fiscally irresponsible." But 
Lockyer, a Judiciary Committee member who voted for the bill, described a 
political subplot to explain Thursday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer pointed out that Rep. Michael Huffington, a Republican from Santa 
Barbara, hopes to use the "three strikes" initiative in his campaign against 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November. Even though Feinstein has 
endorsed the "three strikes" idea, the measure could be expected to draw more 
conservative voters to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said that by defusing the initiative, he hopes to help Feinstein, a 
fellow Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If their goal is simply to cause political mischief for the November ballot, 
that's cut off by enactment of the (Jones-Costa) bill," Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones-Costa bill says that a criminal who has committed two prior violent 
or serious felonies and commits any third felony could be sentenced to a term 
of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill lists more than 25 crimes as violent and serious, ranging from murder 
and rape to residential burglary. There are more than 500 other felonies for 
which a three-time loser could be sentenced to life, including such crimes as 
auto theft and repeated drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the political support for the Jones-Costa bill, opposition to it and 
the proposed initiative is building among prosecutors, including Los Angeles 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who testified against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Mike Bradbury told the senators that the 
Jones-Costa bill would require that a defendant with two prior serious or 
violent felonies, who is then convicted of five counts of credit card forgery, 
could receive a 125-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not being tough. This is being unreasonable," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 By votes of 9 to 0 and 10 to 0, the committee also approved identical bills by 
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton). Johnson's bill, the least detailed of 
the proposals, states that criminals who commit a third violent felony would be 
sentenced to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee approved by a 9-0 vote a bill by Assemblyman Richard Rainey 
(R-Walnut Creek). Rainey's bill, narrower than the Jones-Costa measure, is 
backed by the California District Attorneys Assn., which helped write it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's bill says that someone who has been convicted of a third "violent" 
felony would be sentenced to life without parole. The bill says someone with 
two convictions for prior violent or serious crimes who is convicted of a third 
"serious" felony would face an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill lists violent crimes as murder, rape, child molestation, any crime 
that causes great bodily injury, arson, kidnaping and several others. There are 
more than 20 crimes defined as serious, including all violent felonies plus 
others such as the sale of hard drugs to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 By an 8-2 vote, the committee approved another "three strikes" measure by 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). Umberg announced at the hearing that 
he was strengthening his bill by making it virtually identical to Rainey's. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Rainey agreed to include spousal abuse as a crime that would qualify as 
a "serious" felony. A three-time spouse beater could be sentenced to a term of 
25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills move next to the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is supposed 
to consider the cost of legislation. Whether there will be any firm cost 
estimates by the time the Appropriations Committee considers the measures is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections is working on a detailed -- and delayed -- cost 
estimate. The corrections report is scheduled to be released March 1. The 
Senate Office of Research places the annual cost of the initiative and 
Jones-Costa bill at $2 billion or more.

MARITAL FRAUD DAMAGE AWARD VOIDED; DIVORCE LAW: MAN HAD PERSUADED JURY THAT 
EX-WIFE DUPED HIM BY CONCEALING LACK OF SEXUAL PASSION. APPEALS PANEL SAYS SUCH 
MATTERS ARE 'BEST LEFT TO ADVICE COLUMNISTS.' 
</P>

<P>
 In a unique fraud case that jurists labeled "Sex, Lies and Trust Agreements," 
an appeals court panel on Thursday reversed a $242,000 damage award to an 
Anaheim banker who had persuaded a jury that his former wife duped him by 
concealing her lack of sexual passion for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are matters best left to advice columnists than to judges and juries," 
concluded a three judge-panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal. "We agree 
that courts should not be in the business of probing a suitor's state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's 31-page ruling was prompted by the divorce of Pacific Inland Bank 
President Ronald Askew, 50, and his former wife of 11 years, Bonnette Askew, 
46. Askew sued his ex-wife for fraud in civil court after she admitted during 
marriage counseling that she had hidden the fact that she felt no physical 
attraction for him before or during their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an Orange County Superior Court jury sided with Ronald Askew, 
ordering Bonnette Askew to give up her share of four jointly owned parcels of 
property valued at about $242,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, she said that she was relieved and elated with the outcome of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that this has gone on so long is that he flat-out wanted to 
destroy me. And when a person becomes obsessed, they lose all concept of 
proportion," said Bonnette Askew, who added that the legal battleground 
eventually became a high-stakes poker game. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the lawsuits in civil court and the legal skirmishes in family court, 
Bonnette Askew estimated that the couple's legal costs approach $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Askew was not available for comment Thursday. His attorney, Albert M. 
Graham Jr., said he was disappointed with the appellate court ruling but needed 
more time to study the opinion before deciding on a next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts had predicted that the verdict -- if upheld -- could have 
spawned copycat lawsuits, reshaping the California concept that property must 
be split evenly upon divorce. The case attracted worldwide publicity and 
sparked debate about how far the the legal system should go in regulating 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the appeals court also raised concerns that such lawsuits could 
have played havoc with California's no-fault divorce system and its "anti-heart 
balm" statutes. The laws, which date back to the 1930s, were passed to prevent 
jilted lovers from using the civil courts to seek damages as a "heart balm" for 
the pain of a broken engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words of love, passion and sexual desire are simply unsuited to the 
cumbersome stricture of common law fraud and deceit," wrote Judge David Sills 
in a section of the opinion titled: "Sex, Lies and Trust Agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that a judge, or jury of 12 solid citizens, can arbitrate whether an 
individual's romantic declarations are true or false, or made with intent to 
deceive, seems almost ridiculously wooden," Sills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Askews were granted a divorce in 1992. But in a separate civil trial, 
Ronald Askew charged that four pieces of property the couple owned should not 
be included as community property in their divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the marriage, Ronald Askew said he pleaded for honesty, asking his 
future bride if there was anything he should know. Ronald Askew argued that he 
would not have married Bonnette Askew or made her joint owner of the properties 
if he had known she considered him physically undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said that Ronald Askew could appeal the decision, ask for a new hearing 
on the issue before the same panel of judges, or return to family court to 
settle the issue of community property.

PRACTICING FOR THE BIG ONE; QUAKES: STATE BRINGS PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND PUBLIC 
AGENCIES TOGETHER FOR WEEKLONG SESSION. PARTICIPANTS SAY TEAMWORK IS A KEY TO 
PREPAREDNESS.

 Memories of the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake were still rattling 
through Carl Alexander's head Thursday when he found himself worrying once more 
about collapsing buildings and motorists trapped beneath fallen freeway 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is a captain with the tiny Warner Bros. Studios Fire Department in 
Burbank, where sound stages suffered plenty of real damage Jan. 17. Happily for 
him, the destruction was only imaginary this time. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among 65 safety officials from cities and businesses around the state 
who have gathered this week at a World War II Army camp near San Luis Obispo to 
learn how to keep their wits about them when the Big One really hits. 
</P>
<P>
 A realistic earthquake drill staged Thursday was the highlight of a weeklong 
seminar being conducted by a little-known state agency called the California 
Specialized Training Institute. Since 1983, the school has trained more than 
5,400 emergency managers how to react after a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials say last month's Northridge quake has prompted them to 
sharply underscore the need for gut-wrenching decisions that public officials 
must make during -- and after -- an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Which people do you pull from the rubble first when an apartment building 
collapses and whose screams for help do you ignore? Later, who do you let into 
the tent city shelters you've set up and who do you kick out? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard decision to make when you're standing in front of a collapsed 
building," said James Petroni, a former arson investigator who helped create 
the earthquake training program in 1985. "And with shelters are you creating a 
short-term solution or a long-term problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 If there are not enough rescuers to go around, they must be sent where they 
can do the most good. And that means officials must have a good enough grasp of 
the disaster to know where to send rescuers where they are needed most, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroni said the Northridge quake was the state's first major disaster to feel 
the impact of the growing problem of homelessness and its effect on emergency 
relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute students faced many of those questions during Thursday's mock 
earthquake -- an imaginary 7.1 shaker in the imaginary town of Santa Luisa del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were required to set up an emergency command post and size up the 
scope of the disaster as they decided how best to allocate Santa Luisa's 
firefighters, police and utility workers for rescue work. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Marquez, a veteran dispatcher with the Montebello Police Department, was 
one of those hunched over a map showing trouble spots in the fictional city. 
She said the weeklong exercise was pinpointing some potential trouble spots in 
her department's emergency dispatching procedure, too. "I'm going to work on it 
back home," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Charles Roper, newly named chief of tactical planning for the Los Angeles 
Police Department, played the role of command post chief during Thursday's 
drill. It was an eye-opener for him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've personally never worked closely with the Fire Department before," he 
said. "Now I see some of their problems from their perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Safety experts from private businesses were surprised to learn how their 
companies can benefit from better communications with public agencies during 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Miller, a safety coordinator with Kaiser Permanente -- which lost a 
Granada Hills medical clinic in last month's quake -- said hospitals run by her 
company are setting up emergency command posts modeled after those run by local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Studios emergency services manager David Geary said he picked up 
ideas for better post-quake coordination with Los Angeles city and county 
officials. "We want our procedures to be as similar as possible to what 
government is doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say that is a good idea for other companies, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms that are prepared to handle their own emergencies during a quake not 
only relieve pressure on public agencies but can be a potential resource that 
local authorities can draw on in a pinch, said John Mirolla, director of the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Alexander, he said he will have a new view of earthquake rescue work 
when he returns next week to his studio firetruck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an earthquake ever happens to me again, I'll still just be a small cog in 
a big machine," he said as he penciled in reports of mock bridge failures, mall 
collapses and people trapped onto a huge wall chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll sure know I have the capability of communicating with my superiors."

DOCTOR'S ASSAULT CONVICTION OVERTURNED; COURT: APPELLATE RULING CITES 
PROSECUTOR'S MISCONDUCT AND ATTORNEY'S IMPROPER TESTIMONY. THOMAS GIONIS WAS 
ACCUSED OF PLANNING ATTACK ON ESTRANGED WIFE, THE DAUGHTER OF JOHN WAYNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court on Thursday threw out the conviction of Dr. Thomas 
Gionis, who was accused of orchestrating an attack on his estranged wife -- the 
daughter of actor John Wayne -- and her boyfriend during a bitter custody 
dispute in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing misconduct by a prosecutor and improper testimony by an attorney, the 
4th District Court of Appeal overturned four felony convictions of assault and 
trespass that resulted in a five-year prison sentence for Gionis, a wealthy 
orthopedic surgeon and former husband of Aissa Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices, in a unanimous decision, said Superior Court Judge Theodore E. 
Millard improperly allowed the incriminating testimony of one of Gionis' 
divorce attorneys in violation of the attorney-client privilege, which requires 
all discussions between lawyer and client to remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, the lawyer said that about a year and a half before the attack, 
Gionis was angry about the custody fight for his daughter Anastasia, and had 
made some threats regarding Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is conceivable that the attorney's testimony indeed made the difference" 
and that Gionis might not have been convicted without it, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, however, directed its harshest comments toward former Orange County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, whose conduct as a prosecutor has been 
called into question before. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices criticized Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" 
on Bruce Cutler, who gained national notoriety for his defense of accused 
mobster John Gotti in New York, during the prosecution's final arguments to the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson quoted Charles Dickens, playwrights Jean Geraudoux and William 
Shakespeare and Danish proverbs to maintain that it is an attorney's "duty to 
lie, conceal, distort, and slander everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's words alone, the court ruled, were enough to warrant a reversal in 
the case, which was based, the justices concluded, on weak circumstantial 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the court's criticism of his conduct, Robinson said: "I did the 
best job that I could do. I think the man got a fair trial. Maybe my faith in 
the jury system is unfounded, but I think these jurors made their decision on 
the evidence, not on the basis of the rhetoric of a couple of lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 William Kopeny, a Santa Ana defense attorney who handled Gionis' appeal, said 
he was "very grateful the opinion was unanimous. These (justices) do not rush 
to reverse. I am very grateful they found the case weak enough to say the 
prosecution's error was enough to be prejudicial." Gionis, 40, whose medical 
practice was in Pomona, could not be reached for comment. Kopeny said he 
advised his client not to talk with the news media until the case is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Aissa Wayne called the ruling "appalling, incredibly appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Orange County district attorney's office could not be 
immediately reached for comment Thursday to determine whether they will refile 
the case against Gionis, who remains free on $2-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis was accused of hiring two henchmen to attack Wayne and her boyfriend, 
Roger Luby, outside his Newport Beach estate in October, 1988. Wayne's limbs 
were bound, and she was thrown face-down onto a garage floor. The attackers 
pistol-whipped Luby and cut his Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis' first trial in 1990 ended in a deadlocked jury after a district 
attorney investigator was caught in major contradictions on the witness stand 
about what Gionis' chauffeur had told him about telephone calls Gionis had made 
shortly after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier murder case, the same appeals court scolded Robinson for his 
trial tactics and warned that in a close case his conduct could result in the 
reversal of a verdict.

 Tom Hayden's spontaneous combustion campaign for governor created an 
eleventh-hour scramble for newly minted campaign manager Duane Peterson. The 
day before what might or might not be the big announcement, Peterson hurriedly 
rented a campaign office, computers and fax machine, opened a bank account, 
ordered up some official stationery, found a site for the next day's news 
conference (and "finding a function room in the San Fernando Valley was like 
booking a ballroom in Sarajevo") and at 11 p.m. found himself standing at an 
all-night copying shop as they created a 20-foot-long "Tom Hayden for Governor" 
banner. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in the just-add-mineral-water-and-stir campaign was ready. Except 
the phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but not for nothing does Hayden come out of the counterculture. In the 
back of an alternative Sacramento weekly, Peterson found an ad for a voice mail 
service -- they answer their phone lines with your taped message. But numbers 
turn over so fast that a previous user's acquaintances hadn't gotten the word, 
and for the first few days, the Hayden for Governor campaign "was getting pimps 
and dope dealers" calling. "If I'd had more time, we could've done a great 
television splash with Tom arresting some of these people," Peterson said.

species of trees harvested from California's federal lands: 03,17,15,16 TREE

 And the dog ate everyone's homework: Having followed Bobby Inman in 
withdrawing his name from nomination (for interim state superintendent of 
public instruction, though, not for secretary of defense), corporate 
takeover-meister Sanford Sigoloff accepted an appointment from Gov. Pete Wilson 
to the newly powerful State Board of Education. However, the first meeting 
under Sigoloff's tenure went off without him. Sigoloff was off skiing -- at an 
annual family reunion he had postponed once before, for the superintendent 
confirmation hearings that never happened. He couldn't put his family through 
that again; "I'm willing to work for $1 a year," he said through a spokesman, 
"but some commitments I can't change."

 It doesn't hurt Huffington that the editor of the book is William J. Bennett, 
secretary of education and chairman of the National Endowment for the 
Humanities under Ronald Reagan -- and a Republican icon.

who was recently fined $50 for violating the city's noise ordinance after a 
neighbor in the next condo complained (although her husband and children have 
not).

EUROPE; A CENTURY-OLD SCANDAL HAUNTS FRANCE'S ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a century since the French army framed Alfred Dreyfus, a young 
Jewish captain, on a charge of passing secrets to the Germans, convicted him in 
a closed-door court-martial and shipped him off to Devil's Island with a life 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone involved in that shameful episode died long ago. Dreyfus himself was 
eventually exonerated and returned to active duty, fighting alongside his son 
in World War I and receiving the French Legion of Honor medal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dreyfus Affair, which polarized the country at the time, refuses to go 
away, much to the dismay of the French army and the conservative government. 
Just a few days ago, it claimed yet another military officer's career. Col. 
Paul Gaujac, a reservist who headed the army's historical service, was 
summarily fired by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and given one hour to 
clear out his desk and his government-paid apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 His offense? He published an article in the army's weekly magazine that did 
not completely accept the verdict of history; it called Dreyfus' innocence 
merely "a thesis now generally accepted by historians." 
</P>
<P>
 The article also characterized the furor over Dreyfus' being railroaded as an 
assault by leftists and radicals on the army that led to the dismantling of 
French military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was seen by many in France as evidence of persistent anti-Semitism 
in the army and a growing trend toward historical revisionism on the political 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army institutions suffer a deep ill," said Madeleine Reberioux, president 
of the League of Human Rights, which was originally created to defend Dreyfus. 
"And it is a long-lasting one." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaujac's abrupt dismissal, along with suggestions that other heads may roll, 
has been a reminder of just how sensitive any mention of the late 19th-Century 
affair remains for many in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very embarrassing for the military," said Denis Lacorne, a political 
analyst with the National Political Science Foundation. "In fact, all the 
historical evidence shows he was framed. But there are long family traditions 
in the military, and the majority are from the anti-Dreyfus camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of the mild-mannered, bespectacled Dreyfus has long haunted the 
country. Until the mid-1970s, radio and television stations were forbidden to 
discuss the affair. And, during the 1980s, the army refused to allow a bronze 
statue of Dreyfus to be displayed at the Ecole Militaire, where the captain had 
been ceremoniously stripped of his symbols of rank after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dreyfus affair occurred during a period of intense nationalism and 
anti-Semitism in France. It began when a cleaning woman, working as a spy for 
the French army, discovered some classified military secrets on a desk in the 
German Embassy. Dreyfus was implicated, mainly because of prejudice against 
him, because he was both Jewish and a native of German-speaking Alsace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the army command realized that its case against Dreyfus was weak, it 
manufactured evidence, reasoning that the honor of the army was more important 
than one man's life and career. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dreyfus began serving his sentence for treason on Devil's Island, the 
dreaded prison off the coast of French Guiana, France quickly divided into 
Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards. The most famous Dreyfusard was the writer 
Emile Zola, who fled to England after a court convicted him of slandering the 
army in his open letter, titled "J'Accuse" -- "I accuse" -- which was published 
in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 A swell of public support led to Dreyfus' release after more than four years. 
When a new army intelligence chief discovered the real culprit, Maj. Ferdinand 
Walsin-Esterhazy, Dreyfus received a presidential pardon and a court 
declaration of his innocence. But the army never reversed its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 For the anti-Dreyfusards still in France, the high-level reaction to Gaujac's 
article may have confounded any hopes of rewriting history. Leotard, the 
defense minister, recently gave permission to a French film director to use 
army locations for a documentary about Dreyfus' ordeal. It is not one that will 
please many in the military. Guilty Until Proven Innocent 
</P>
<P>
 A century after Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish captain in the French army, was 
framed, the scandal has resurfaced with accusations of lingering anti-Semitism 
in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DREYFUS CASE 
</P>
<P>
 1894 -- A cleaning woman in the German embassy, employed by the French secret 
service, finds document proving the treason of a French officer. 
</P>
<P>

of the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 15, 1894 -- Dreyfus is arrested. The army decides his writing is similar 
to that on the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 12, 1894 -- Dreyfus sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 5, 1895 -- Dreyfus is stripped of his rank in the courtyard of the Ecole 
Militaire. 
</P>
<P>
 March, 1895-June, 1899 -- Dreyfus imprisoned on Devil's Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 13, 1898 -- Emile Zola publishes "J'Accuse" in the newspaper l'Aurore. 
</P>
<P>
 June 3, 1899 -- The military court sentence is annulled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 9, 1899 -- The War Council again convicts Dreyfus, sentencing him to 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 July 12, 1906 -- The Supreme Court of Appeal annuls the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 July 13, 1906 -- Dreyfus is reintegrated into the army with the rank of 
commander.

ZULU LEADER SHUNS ELECTION COMPROMISE; SOUTH AFRICA: BUTHELEZI CALLS EFFORTS 
TOWARD APPEASEMENT 'UTTER HYPOCRISY.' TRANSITION FROM APARTHEID IS AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the most important member of a 
coalition of separatist parties opposing the terms of transition from apartheid 
to democracy, Thursday denounced a package of concessions offered to persuade 
the groups to drop their boycott of the April elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, who heads the Inkatha Freedom Party, lashed out at Nelson Mandela, 
his archrival and president of the African National Congress, for offering a 
sweeping set of constitutional amendments Wednesday to appease Buthelezi and 
his right-wing allies in the Freedom Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Mandela and the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk were 
describing as "a breakthrough" the same proposals that were rejected by the 
alliance before it broke off months of negotiations with the government and the 
ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 "What utter hypocrisy," Buthelezi said in a statement. "Mr. Mandela's 
statement amounts to no more than cheap politicking on life-and-death issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi warned that he and his followers will stay out of the April 26-28 
election, the first in which the country's black majority will be allowed to 
vote. He called the 2-month-old interim constitution "fatally flawed," adding 
that "any election under it must be rejected as undemocratic." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela and De Klerk had announced in separate news conferences that they were 
endorsing a series of proposals that appeared to meet many of the demands of 
the Freedom Alliance. De Klerk said he would call Parliament back into special 
session early next month to amend the interim constitution, whether or not the 
alliance is satisfied with the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The concessions include the use of two ballots, rather than one, so voters can 
choose different parties for the national and provincial assemblies; guarantees 
of greater provincial powers, including taxation, and recognition of the 
principle of self-determination to allow for greater local autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buthelezi insisted that he will not accept the broader democratic 
framework hammered out by 21 parties during two years of grueling negotiations. 
When the groups wrote the interim constitution, they agreed that it would be 
rewritten after a democratically elected government is in power. The ANC is 
expected to win the election in a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 "No constitution which dictates that it be replaced by another constitution, 
drawn up and piloted through a new constitution-making process by a ruling 
political party, would be accepted by any democratic people in the world," 
Buthelezi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, 65, is something of a tragic figure in South African politics. 
During Mandela's 27 years in prison, Buthelezi emerged as one of the most 
visible black leaders, working within the system to oppose the white 
supremacist policies of apartheid. He won widespread support in Washington and 
Europe for his conservative policies and his anti-Communist rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buthelezi, who long hoped that he would be the country's first black 
president, has been marginalized since Mandela was released from jail in 1990 
and began working directly with De Klerk to dismantle the apartheid regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela and Buthelezi have not met since June. Buthelezi works from Ulundi, 
the capital of the KwaZulu homeland, which was created under apartheid, where 
aides say he nurses old grudges, harangues diplomats and the press and issues 
warlike statements. 
</P>
<P>
 His support has dwindled as his public profile has faded. Although he claims a 
fervent following among the country's estimated 8 million Zulus, recent polls 
show he probably would lose to the ANC even in the area he considers his 
stronghold. Even De Klerk's ruling National Party has gained at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in Cape Town, De Klerk said he remained hopeful of a peaceful, 
all-inclusive election, despite Buthelezi's rejection of the package. "My 
impression is that the initial negative reaction may still change," he said. 
"It is not a final offer, but it is a substantial improvement from both vantage 
points. It addresses the heart and core of what was on the agenda for 
discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation has mounted that the National Party is seeking a political 
accommodation with Buthelezi and his nephew, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, to 
win support of Zulu voters in case Inkatha continues to boycott the elections. 
Polls show that the National Party otherwise is unlikely to get more than a 
tiny fraction of black votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha is the largest member of the Freedom Alliance, a fractious coalition 
of right-wing white groups, the Bophuthatswana black homeland government and 
the pro-apartheid Conservative Party. Alliance leaders are expected to meet 
this weekend to come up with a formal response to the ANC and government 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance has threatened to use violence if its demands are not met for the 
right to create ethnic and racial homelands. Despite the concessions, Mandela 
on Wednesday repeated his opposition to those demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that of a united South Africa," he said.

TATARSTAN REACHES PACT WITH MOSCOW, DROPS SOVEREIGNTY BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tatarstan, an oil-rich republic whose struggle for independence threatened to 
unravel Russia, has dropped its claim of sovereignty in exchange for a go-ahead 
from Moscow to manage and trade many of its own resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark compromise, published here Thursday, was hailed by leaders on 
both sides as a model for settling Moscow's unstable relations with the 88 
constituent parts of the giant, ethnically diverse Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet Union collapsed and split into 15 nations at the end of 1991, 
Russia, the largest of them, has lived under threat of a similar breakup as its 
regions and republics clamored for more local control. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the struggle appeared to be going the locals' way. Tatarstan 
-- a Volga River republic of 3.6 million people, nearly half of them Muslim, 
Turkic-speaking Tatars -- was one of the boldest, withholding tax revenue from 
Moscow and controlling the export of nearly one-fifth of its 25-million-ton 
annual oil output. 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point came in December when Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin won a 
nationwide referendum on a new constitution that strengthens rule from Moscow. 
Voters also gave unexpected support in parliamentary elections to 
ultranationalists bent on crushing autonomy movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that it was time for a deal, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaimiyev 
spent six weeks negotiating the treaty that he and Yeltsin signed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty recognized both Russia's constitution and one adopted by 
Tatarstan's voters in a 1992 referendum asserting self-rule. But the treaty 
itself dropped the Tatar leaders' previous claims of "sovereignty" and separate 
status. It described the republic as "united" with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Russia recognized Tatarstan's right to manage natural resources and 
state enterprises on its territory except for "objects of federal ownership" to 
be defined later. Tatarstan may also conduct foreign trade and exempt its young 
men from the Russian army draft under a program of alternative civilian 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty appears to recognize much of the economic control Tatarstan has 
seized in the last two years while giving Moscow final say over distribution of 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia yielded, let's say, the ambitions of the center to decide everything 
in Moscow, and will leave to the republic a larger sum of tax revenues," said 
Sergei M. Shakhrai, Russia's nationalities minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasily N. Likhachev, Tatarstan's vice president, said that his republic 
controls, and now expects to keep, 83% of all state-owned property on its 
territory, including a share of plants that turn out helicopters, strategic 
bombers and heavy trucks. He said Tatarstan will also press for control of a 
bigger share of its oil resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhrai said the "methodology" of the treaty -- settling specific local 
concerns rather than broad sovereignty demands -- could be applied to other 
rebellious areas within Russia, such as Chechnya, which has declared 
independence and built its own army, and Kaliningrad, which has declared itself 
a customs-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line nationalists in Moscow and Tatarstan criticized the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei N. Baburin rose in the Parliament in Moscow to ridicule the fact that 
"for the first time the state signed a treaty with part of itself." He said the 
separate deals Moscow will now have to make with each constituent territory 
will weaken Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the republic's capital, Kazan, where the mighty Tatar state fell to the 
Russian army in 1552, the nationalist Tatar Public Center called the treaty "a 
step backward from independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty paves the way for elections next month to add Tatarstan's deputies 
to the Parliament already sitting in Moscow. The republic, along with Chechnya, 
boycotted the December vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferit Agi of the Tatar-language service of Radio Liberty, based in Munich, 
Germany, said Tatar leaders felt compelled to sign a treaty with Moscow after 
Russian nationalists, including one elected from Tatarstan, gained their 
stronghold in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatars were also aware of their dependence on Russia for rubles, orders for 
their military factories and the pipeline through which they ship oil to 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia had to give a little bit to Tatarstan to help bring some other 
republics into line," Agi said. "But Tatarstan knew that Russia could close the 
pipeline at any time." 
</P>

GEORGIA CONFIRMS GAMSAKHURDIA DEATH 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Georgian government confirmed the death of ousted President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, saying his body was dug up Thursday from a shallow grave in 
western Georgia for reburial in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint commission from Georgia and Russia's Chechnya region, and accompanying 
journalists, identified the partially decomposed body, which had a gunshot 
wound through the head. "Unfortunately, I am certain that this is the body of 
Zviad Konstantinovich Gamsakhurdia," said Guram Sharidze, a member of the 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamsakhurdia, who had lived in exile in Chechnya since being overthrown in 
January, 1992, waged an unsuccessful campaign to return to power last fall. His 
widow, Manana, announced in January that he had committed suicide Dec. 31.

TOM UMBERG ENTERS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg announced his candidacy Thursday for state 
attorney general and immediately went on the attack, saying that Republican 
incumbent Dan Lungren has lost the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and the only Orange County Democrat in the 
Legislature, vowed to focus on juvenile crime to help keep first-time offenders 
from becoming revolving-door felons. 
</P>
<P>
 During a half-hour news conference, the Garden Grove Democrat repeatedly 
blasted his opponent in the June Democratic primary, San Francisco Dist. Atty. 
Arlo Smith, and Lungren. Smith narrowly lost the attorney general's race to 
Lungren in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, 38, said the attorney general has "presided over record-breaking 
violent crime" while failing to curb gangs, drug dealers and the proliferation 
of guns in public schools. He ridiculed Smith as an ineffective district 
attorney, concluding that "with a record like his, Arlo Smith should be running 
for cover, not for attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Umberg had misrepresented his record and suggested that Umberg 
lacks the statewide name identification and experience to mount a successful 
campaign. "I think I've probably handled more cases before the U.S. Supreme 
Court than he's ever brought to trial," Smith said. "He's totally lacking in 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Stabler, Lungren's campaign manager, defended the attorney general's 
record, saying that the state crime rate fell last year and that Lungren has 
worked hard to press legislation designed to combat gangs and school violence. 
She also criticized Umberg for failing to push more legislation through the 
Assembly Public Safety Committee, a traditional graveyard for tough crime 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rip van Winkle of the Public Safety Committee has finally awakened," she 
said. "He's been sitting on that committee for a long time now and hasn't put 
forth any tough crime-fighting legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's opponents also criticized him for failing early on to champion the 
"three strikes, you're out" measure proposed for the ballot. Umberg is pushing 
his own "three strikes" bill, which he calls a "good first step," and said he 
is a backer of the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to political office in 1990, Umberg has been embraced by state 
Democratic leaders as a rising star, someone whose credentials as a moderate 
legislator, former military officer and prosecutor might help expand the 
party's base. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg hopes to use a growing campaign bankroll, ties to law enforcement 
groups and a network of support from fellow Assembly Democrats to help his 
campaign.

MEXICO REBELS, OFFICIALS TO MEET MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebel and government negotiators will meet Monday at an undisclosed location 
in southern Mexico to try to negotiate an end to a 7-week-old uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's peace envoy, Manuel Camacho Solis, announced Thursday that 
the talks will be in the southern state of Chiapas but said he would not 
specify where until Sunday for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement followed Wednesday's release by the rebel Zapatista National 
Liberation Army of a former Chiapas governor who was kidnaped from his ranch 
Jan. 2, a day after the rebellion broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho said the talks, which could last for months, could center either on 
the general problems of the Mayan Indians in Chiapas or on specific agreements 
toward a peace treaty.

LEGAL RISKS BLOCK SOVIET REACTOR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leading officials of the European nuclear power industry said Thursday that 
legal liability problems are preventing Western contractors from starting 
urgently needed repairs to nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs are a vital element of Western efforts to reduce the risk to the 
region of another Chernobyl-like nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference here, Jonathan Heller, secretary general of the 
European Atomic Forum -- Foratom -- said that much of the $700 million in 
Western assistance pledged by the Group of Seven nations two years ago to 
improve safety at reactors in the former Soviet bloc had been either allocated 
or spent, but mainly on non-repair items such as design trouble-shooting, 
analysis and staff retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a further $1 billion earmarked for reactor hardware repairs and 
overhauls already available in low-interest loans from two European development 
banks has gone largely untouched because Western companies are declining 
contracts, fearing they could be held liable if an accident should occur during 
or after they complete the required work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The liability debate has been going on now for three years," Heller said. 
"We're at the point where we can't do any more" safety-related work. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in recent months there have been instances in which replacement 
components for Soviet-designed reactors have been ordered and produced, but not 
shipped to the plant for installation because of the liability question. 
</P>
<P>
 The only significant exception to this problem, he said, was a large 
twin-reactor plant at Ignalina in Lithuania, which furnished nearly 60% of the 
country's electricity demands in addition to providing power to neighboring 
Estonia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss-Swedish company ABB is now engaged in repair work at the plant, 
which has two modified Chernobyl-style reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 45 nuclear reactors operating in the former Soviet Union. 
Foratom officials estimated that making these reactors safe will require $7 
billion to $8 billion in repairs and overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
 German authorities simply closed down four Soviet-designed reactors and 
stopped construction on five others in the former East Germany after 
unification, concluding that it was not possible to bring them within existing 
national safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller and others said it was not economically or politically feasible in much 
of the former Soviet Union to simply shut down technically suspect reactors on 
safety grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Michel Lung, a technical adviser to Foratom, noted that about 40% 
of St. Petersburg's electricity is generated by nuclear power. "If you start 
closing down these stations, the result is that very many people will freeze to 
death," Heller said.

FORMER TREASURER GUILTY OF TAX EVASION; CORRUPTION: BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIAL ALSO ADMITS OBSTRUCTING FEDERAL PROBE AND CONCEALING BUSINESS LINKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, U.S. Treasurer during the George Bush 
Administration, pleaded guilty Thursday to evading federal income taxes, 
obstructing an independent counsel's corruption investigation and conspiring to 
conceal financial links with her former company. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando, whose name is still printed on paper currency, admitted that she 
committed the crimes as charged by prosecutors for the Justice Department and 
by Arlin M. Adams, the independent counsel investigating corruption at the 
Housing and Urban Development Department during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 She faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and fines of $750,000. But 
as a first-time offender, she is likely to draw substantially lighter 
punishment, particularly if she cooperates with prosecutors in their continuing 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 As Treasurer from December, 1989, until Bush left office, Villalpando oversaw 
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint and promoted the sale of 
U.S. savings bonds. As a Latina, she often was cited by Bush Administration 
officials as evidence of their commitment to elevating minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's nominee for Treasurer, Mary Ellen Withrow, will be sworn 
in March 1, a Treasury Department spokeswoman said. Withrow's name will replace 
Villalpando's on all new U.S. bills later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando displayed no emotion as she pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court 
and assured Judge Thomas F. Hogan that she understood the gravity of the 
offenses and the terms of the plea agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement she said: "While devoting all my attention and energies 
to the demands of my public office, I neglected to attend some personal matter 
with the care and immediacy they required." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing her court appearance as "a most painful and sad day for me," 
Villalpando said she accepted "full responsibility for my mistakes" and that 
her admission "marks the first step in what I understand will be a long journey 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan allowed Villalpando to remain free until sentencing, but did not set a 
date for the proceeding because of the pending HUD investigation, in which her 
cooperation is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted evading payment of $47,013 in additional federal income tax for 
1989 by failing to report $167,901 in taxable income for that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando also admitted to conspiring to conceal from the Treasury 
Department, the Office of Government Ethics, the Senate Finance Committee and 
the full Senate her receipt in 1989 and 1990 of substantial funds and benefits 
from a Georgia-based telecommunications firm where she was a senior vice 
president and director. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Communications International Inc., was awarded federal government 
contracts after being approved by the Small Business Administration as a 
minority-owned small and disadvantaged business. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts she withheld "were capable of influencing the actions and judgments 
of those departments and agencies" on her fitness for office, according to the 
conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Government employees are not allowed to receive payment or benefits from 
private companies. Her compensation included a $250,000 "severance bonus," life 
and auto insurance and payment of credit card and telephone charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando admitted that she conspired with another person beginning in 
March, 1989 -- when she was told Bush intended to nominate her for Treasurer -- 
and continued doing so until about June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the obstruction of justice charge related to Adams' investigation, 
Villalpando admitted directing the destruction of documents bearing on the 
relationship between a dissolved subsidiary of Communications International and 
Deborah Gore Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean -- the former executive assistant to Samuel R. Pierce Jr., HUD secretary 
during the Reagan Administration -- is scheduled to be sentenced by Hogan next 
week on her conviction of 12 felony counts. Her six-week trial showed her to be 
instrumental in funneling millions of federal dollars to housing projects that 
benefited politically connected Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando admitted that in July, 1992, she instructed Ernest Olivas, manager 
of Communications International's Washington office, to destroy the documents 
and records being sought by Adams' investigators.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for 11 Branch Davidians charged with murdering four federal agents 
rested their case without calling any cult members."There is no need to put 
your defendant on the witness stand unless you want to prove something," 
defense lawyer Steven Rosen said outside the San Antonio courtroom. "When you 
are accused of a crime in this country you are under no burden of proof." 
Lawyers for the Davidians claim that they were trying to defend themselves 
during the shootout. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith indicated that closing 
arguments would take place early next week. The cult members on trial could 
face up to life in prison if convicted.

 The state of New Jersey agreed to pay more than $7 million to blacks and women 
who were denied jobs as prison guards, police and sheriff's officers because of 
allegedly biased testing and hiring policies.Some 450 blacks and women who were 
rejected will be offered those jobs on a priority basis, government officials 
said. The settlement of a 1988 lawsuit by the Justice Department's civil rights 
division was the second-largest ever obtained by the federal government in a 
job bias case involving state or local government. The City of Chicago agreed 
in 1989 and 1991 to pay $10.7 million to 666 police sergeants denied promotion 
because of alleged bias.

U.S. REGULATORS CLEAR HUBBELL IN S&L PROBE; INVESTIGATION: FDIC ENDS 
CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST INQUIRY, SAYS IT WILL NOT SEEK SANCTIONS AGAINST ASSOCIATE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OR HIS FORMER LAW FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators concluded Thursday that Associate Atty. Gen. Webster 
Hubbell did not mislead them about the potential for conflicts of interest 
when, as a lawyer in private practice, he sought legal work for his firm in the 
government case against the failed Arkansas thrift that is central to the 
Whitewater land deal controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it will not seek sanctions against 
Hubbell or the Rose Law Firm, in which he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
were partners. Questions about potential conflicts arose because the firm had 
previously represented the thrift, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said the decision ends the agency's investigation 
of the firm -- although it remains one of the subjects of a separate probe by 
special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske was appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to determine whether the 
President and Hillary Clinton were guilty of any wrongdoing in connection with 
the Whitewater Development Corp. The Clintons were partners in the firm with 
James B. McDougal, owner of the failed thrift, and his then-wife, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the FDIC finding Thursday was one of several new developments 
in the tangled case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Law Firm was notified by Fiske's office that he intended to subpoena 
documents related to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater. The notice was 
accompanied by a standard admonition against destroying potentially relevant 
material, including legal files, work papers and computer records. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice followed a report in the Washington Times last week that Rose 
employees had shredded Whitewater documents -- an allegation firm officials 
have denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no destruction of any documents relating to the Whitewater 
inquiry," said Ronald M. Clark, the firm's managing partner and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers at the firm said Thursday they were gathering documents in 
anticipation of a formal subpoena from Fiske, adding that they intended to 
"cooperate fully" with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske also announced that a new charge was filed against David Hale, another 
key player in the Whitewater affair. Hale is a former Arkansas municipal judge 
and owner of a failed investment company. 
</P>
<P>
 The new charge accuses Hale -- who has already been indicted on charges of 
loan fraud and conspiracy -- of making false statements to the Small Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale is charged with diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
SBA-backed loans to Susan McDougal. Much of the money from the SBA loans 
reportedly ended up in Whitewater's bank accounts. Hale and two others were 
originally indicted last September. Their trial is scheduled to begin March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC began its probe of possible conflicts of interest at the Rose Law 
Firm late last year. Federal regulators had hired the firm in 1989 to sue 
Madison Guaranty's former accountants, Frost & Co., for negligence in auditing 
the S&L's books while McDougal was running the thrift. Ultimately, Rose 
received $400,000 in legal fees from the FDIC and settled the case against 
Frost & Co. for $1 million. The FDIC had originally sought $6 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Madison Guaranty was still in business under McDougal in 1985, Rose 
attorneys, including Hillary Clinton, represented the thrift when it sought 
state regulatory approval for a plan to sell stock and raise money to keep the 
S&L afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to raise capital received tentative approval from a state regulator 
appointed by then-Gov. Bill Clinton, but was never acted on because of the 
thrift's worsening condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a radio interview, Clinton said the Whitewater investigation 
would likely cost taxpayers millions of dollars and that "most of it has 
nothing to do with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The President contended that the Whitewater affair would turn out to be a 
"simple, straightforward" business deal that went sour and cost him and his 
wife thousands of dollars.

FIRST LADY PROMISES MORE HELP FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday pledged increased White House 
support for basic biomedical research, saying that the work of medical 
scientists goes hand-in-hand with health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of medical research could be spread to a greater number of 
Americans through reforms in the health care system, the First Lady said in a 
speech to researchers at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health security not only means guaranteeing comprehensive benefits throughout 
a person's life, it also means emphasizing early diagnosis and prevention of 
diseases," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a slap at the past two Republican administrations, she complained that 
biomedical research has been "neglected and underfunded and even unappreciated" 
for much of the past decade. Those conditions will be rectified by passage of 
President Clinton's 1995 budget and the Administration's health care reform 
plan, she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work of scientists is more important than ever," she said. "Without basic 
biomedical research, we never would have achieved the quality of health care 
that most Americans enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an overall freeze on most domestic spending, the President's 1995 
budget has proposed a 4.7% funding increase for the NIH, or $517 million, "most 
of it for basic research," the First Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
 She listed several promising areas of biomedical research that could benefit 
from the added funds, including AIDS, breast cancer and the Human Genome 
Project, an ambitious NIH program that is attempting to map all the genes in 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her speech, Clinton met with the NIH's leading scientists -- who 
briefed her on their various programs. She also met with several AIDS patients, 
including three children. 
</P>
<P>
 She also met with Ashanti DeSilva, a 7-year-old Ohio girl, who three years ago 
was one of the first patients in the world to receive pioneering gene therapy 
-- a treatment that essentially repairs or replaces a defective gene -- to cure 
a rare immune disorder called inherited severe immune deficiency disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before her treatment, her life was one of confinement and fear," the First 
Lady said in her speech. "Today she is living a full life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House on Thursday, the President continued his efforts to build 
support among the elderly for his health care reform proposals by meeting with 
leaders of senior citizens organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The brunch session, following his speech Wednesday to 2,000 elderly citizens 
in New Jersey, was part of a White House strategy to gain the backing of the 
nation's influential senior citizens lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from a dozen groups left the meeting promising to work on behalf of 
the Clinton reform plan, although the White House failed to get the endorsement 
of the powerful American Assn. of Retired People. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, said that among competing health care 
proposals, Clinton's has the greatest chance of passage and addresses two of 
his group's minimum demands: prescription-drug coverage and expanded long-term 
care. But Deets said the AARP membership needs more education about the Clinton 
proposal before the group could make any recommendation.

 President Clinton tried Thursday to clear up a widespread misconception about 
why he carpeted the bed of his old El Camino pickup truck with Astroturf: It 
was just to protect his suitcase from scratches. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with New York disc jockey Don Imus, a regular Clinton banter 
buddy, the President explained that the truck bed was metal and that "I carried 
my luggage back there -- it wasn't for what everybody thought it was for when I 
made the comment, I'll tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guilty of a lot of things," he joked to the raucous deejay, "but I didn't 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's memories of his El Camino got wide publicity after he told an 
audience of General Motors auto workers earlier this month about the "real 
Southern deal" he drove in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had Astroturf in the back -- you don't want to know why," he told them. Few 
of his listeners, who roared their approval at his story, seemed to need 
elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since first appearing on Imus' show during the 1992 New York primary, Clinton 
has gone on the air about half a dozen times with the radio host, whose 
audience is primarily young men. On this show, Imus kidded Clinton about his 
hearty eating habits and controversial investment in the Whitewater Development 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he didn't want to be "disrespectful," Imus wondered aloud how Clinton 
ever got interested in the no-frills Whitewater project. "That model home 
looked like some place that Tonya Harding's bodyguard holed up in," Imus said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton defended the development. "It was a little place where a lot of 
working people without much money were looking for a place to retire and own 
some property in a beautiful place," Clinton replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Imus wanted to know how Clinton, who says he has lost 15 pounds, could have 
eaten a "Clinton burger, a pastrami sandwich and an apple fritter the size of a 
baby's head" on a trip to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton confessed to eating the Clinton burger. He said the pastrami was in 
fact corned beef on pumpernickel and insisted, "Hey, hey, the fritter -- I had 
one bite of the apple fritter."

GROUP URGES TOUGHER GUN SAFETY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gun-control advocacy group urged Congress on Thursday to subject firearms to 
the same kind of regulatory treatment as other consumer products and called for 
a ban on the sale of any new handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based Violence Policy Center included its recommendations in a 
study of gun violence underwritten by Rolling Stone magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, the group argued that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms should be granted authority to set "safety standards for firearms 
and ammunition, recall defective products and, when necessary, ban products 
that present an unreasonable risk of injury to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Toasters, teddy bears and trucks face tougher safety standards than guns, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to hold the gun industry to the same standards we apply to 
manufacturers of lawn mowers and lawn darts," said Kirsten Rand, counsel of the 
policy center and co-author of the study. "The result would be a significant 
reduction in firearms violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the group argued that the ATF should have the same powers as 
agencies responsible for the safety of other products -- the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gardner, legislative counsel for the National Rifle Assn., Thursday 
disputed the report's assertions that firearms are under-regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate sale of firearms is banned outright, he noted, adding that unlike 
teddy bears or toasters, "firearms are sold as products that are dangerous, not 
products that are supposed to be harmless."

GRAND JURY TO INVESTIGATE SLAYING OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office, under attack by minority groups 
over its investigation into the Christmas Day shooting death of a sheriff's 
deputy, announced Thursday that it is turning the politically charged case over 
to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-member panel will begin hearing evidence March 2 to decide whether 
criminal charges should be filed against Deputy Brian J. Scanlan, 32, a 
training officer who authorities say fatally shot a fellow deputy during a 
training session behind a Lake Forest theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual move, the subject of speculation for weeks in law enforcement 
circles, allows prosecutors to distance themselves from a case that has already 
prompted a firestorm of criticism from minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence has emerged publicly to suggest that race played a part in the 
shooting of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, 30, who was black, by Scanlan, who is 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 But minority groups in Orange County have been critical of the pace and 
thoroughness of the investigation. And they suggest that a dearth of public 
information on the case, as well as the closeness between the Sheriff's 
Department and the district attorney's office, have only fueled concerns that 
Robins' race may have played a role in his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting a high political profile that has been rare in Orange County's small 
black community, local black leaders have pressed without success for federal 
and state investigations into the case. Minority representatives also met with 
members of the grand jury on the issue several weeks ago, officials said, 
urging the panel's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Jordan, publisher of a black community newspaper called Black Orange, 
said the district attorney's investigation into the case has been frustrating 
because so many questions remain unresolved in the public mind, eight weeks 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd welcome any intense investigation, any detailed investigation," he said. 
"The fact that they want to take this a step further (to the grand jury), we're 
encouraged by that." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors refused to discuss their decision, but Assistant 
Dist. Atty. John Conley acknowledged that the office has opted to send an 
officer-involved shooting to the grand jury only a handful of times in recent 
years.

RISK ESTIMATE RAISED FOR THOSE IN BREAST CANCER STUDY; MEDICINE: MOVE REVIVES 
CONTROVERSY OVER GOVERNMENT-FUNDED TRIAL OF PREVENTIVE USE OF TAMOXIFEN. BUT 
DOCTORS INVOLVED IN WORK SAY REVISIONS ARE MINOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of a highly anticipated study examining the drug tamoxifen's ability 
to prevent breast cancer say they are changing the consent form provided to the 
16,000 women enrolled in the trial because of new data that confirms the drug 
may cause other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the revisions are considered minor by most doctors involved, the move 
revives a longstanding controversy over the $68-million, government-funded 
study, called the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is one of the first to examine whether it is beneficial to give 
healthy people a potentially toxic drug to prevent disease. Outside of the 
study, tamoxifen is only given to women who have had breast cancer to thwart a 
recurrence. The new data on risks is collected from studies on breast cancer 
patients that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prevention study, which began two years ago, healthy women at high risk 
for breast cancer are randomly assigned to take either a daily 20-milligram 
dose of tamoxifen or a placebo for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Study leaders have always acknowledged that the drug may increase a woman's 
risk of developing uterine or liver cancer and blood clots but they do not know 
whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The revised consent form 
nudges estimates of those risks up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions are based on data from a long-term, nationwide study of breast 
cancer patients taking tamoxifen, said Dr. Bernard Fisher, a University of 
Pittsburgh surgeon who collected the data. Fisher, who is also a principal 
investigator in the prevention trial, said the new data will be published in 
full later this year in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But the data have already translated into a change in the consent form given 
to women in the prevention trial. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fisher, the risk of developing uterine cancer is similar to what 
was originally predicted: about two cases per 1,000 -- a rate that, while 
small, is still three times higher than that faced by women in the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, study leaders say that data on the breast cancer patients already 
taking the drug shows there have been a few deaths from uterine cancer. 
Participants in the preventive study were previously told that the cases of 
uterine cancer that have occurred were caught at an early stage and were 
thought to be curable. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of developing thrombosis or phlebitis, both of which can produce 
life-threatening blood clots, has been adjusted slightly from 1.3% to 1.5%. 
(Similar-aged women not taking tamoxifen have a 0.4% chance of developing blood 
clotting disorders.) The risk of developing liver cancer has also been changed. 
Previously, study leaders said liver cancer had been reported in rats receiving 
tamoxifen but not in humans. Now, researchers say two women in a Swedish study 
of tamoxifen have developed liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Fisher said: "I think this (potential risk) has been blown out of 
proportion. . . . In the thousands of women we've given tamoxifen, we have 
never seen liver cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Fisher said, he believes the risks are still considered to be worth 
the potential benefits. About 180,000 American women are found to have breast 
cancer each year and about 46,000 die of the disease, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The consent form revisions, Fisher said, "are part of an educational update to 
keep our investigators and patients informed. This is not a situation where we 
suddenly found something that frightened us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although study participants will be told of the changes, the revisions are not 
significant, said Dr. Patricia Ganz, who is conducting part of the study with a 
group of women at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the study say that the changes reflect a deep uncertainty about 
the risks and benefits of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a shift in the risk-benefit ratio, way into this study," 
said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the 
University of Minnesota. "It gets at the general question of, 'Is this thing 
too risky to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And in a paper published in September, Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist 
Trudy Bush predicted nearly twice the risk of uterine and liver cancer as that 
predicted by the study organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamoxifen is also known to sometimes cause less severe side effects, such as 
hot flashes, menstrual irregularities and nausea. In the new consent form, 
women are also informed that the drug may cause ovarian cysts and hair 
thinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the revised form contains a more detailed warning to women of 
child-bearing age to use effective contraceptives during the trial due to the 
risk of fetal damage if the drug is taken during pregnancy.

BORDER PATROL TURNS ON LIGHTS TO STOP CROSSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Border Patrol agents flipped the switch Thursday night on 3 1/2 miles of new 
lights designed to help halt illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-powered lights are part of a wave of new tactics, including a 14-mile 
steel border fence, more agents and high-tech equipment such as motion sensors 
and night vision video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Paso, agents have formed a blockade along the Rio Grande to prevent 
entries, but Border Patrol sector chief Gustavo de la Vina has called that 
impractical in San Diego because of rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lights stretch from the busy San Ysidro border traffic crossing along 
the Tijuana River toward the Pacific Ocean, passing through rugged canyons and 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 About one mile of lights previously had been installed along the river levee. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights cost $470,000, the Border Patrol said. They were installed by Army 
reserve engineers.

STATE REFUSES TO ACCEPT SEA LIONS FROM WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission on Thursday rejected a proposal to move 
about 60 California sea lions from Washington state to waters off Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties in an effort to reduce their preying upon steelhead 
trout in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Marine Fisheries Service had proposed moving the sea lions from 
their plentiful hunting ground near Ballard Locks, Wash., where steelhead trout 
spawn, to join sea lions already in the Santa Barbara Channel and the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coastal Commission rejected the proposal on a 5-3 vote, with one 
commissioner abstaining. Commissioners who opposed the plan argued that moving 
the sea lions to Southern California would not solve the problem because they 
would probably swim back north, said Jack Liebster, a commission spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1989 relocation experiment, six sea lions were moved from Washington to 
San Miguel Island, in the Channel Islands, and five returned within a month, 
according to a report to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The steelhead population is already depleted, and managers of fisheries in the 
Northwest fear the fish could become threatened.

COURT OVERTURNS '92 CONVICTION IN WAYNE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court on Thursday threw out the conviction of Dr. Thomas A. 
Gionis, who was accused of orchestrating an attack on his estranged wife -- the 
daughter of actor John Wayne -- and her former boyfriend during a bitter 
custody dispute five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing misconduct by a prosecutor and improper testimony by an attorney, the 
4th District Court of Appeal unanimously overturned four felony convictions 
that resulted in a five-year prison sentence for Gionis, a wealthy orthopedic 
surgeon and former husband of Aissa Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis had been found guilty in 1992 of hiring two henchmen to attack Wayne 
and her boyfriend, Roger Luby, outside Luby's Newport Beach estate on Oct. 3, 
1988. In the assault, Wayne's limbs were bound and she was thrown face down 
onto a garage floor. The attackers then pistol-whipped Luby and, in an odd coup 
de grace , cut his Achilles' tendons. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices said Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard improperly allowed the 
incriminating testimony of a family law attorney in violation of the 
attorney-client privilege, which requires all discussions between lawyer and 
client remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, lawyer John Lueck, who represented Gionis briefly, said that 
about a year and a half before the attack, Gionis told him he was angry about 
the custody fight for his daughter Anastasia, and had made some threats 
regarding Wayne. Lueck testified that Gionis told him that Wayne had no idea 
how easy it would be for Gionis to hire someone to "take care of her." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is conceivable that the attorney's testimony indeed made the difference" 
and that Gionis might not have been convicted without it, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, however, directed its harshest comments toward former Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, whose conduct as a prosecutor has been called into 
question in at least two other murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices criticized Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal 
attacks" on Bruce Cutler, Gionis' flamboyant New York attorney, during the 
prosecution's final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson quoted Charles Dickens, playwright Jean Geraudoux, William 
Shakespeare and Danish proverbs to make the point before the jury that it is an 
attorney's "duty to lie, conceal, distort, and slander everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 His words alone, the court ruled, were enough to warrant a reversal in the 
sensational case, which was based, the justices concluded, on weak 
circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, reacting to the court's criticism, said: "I did the best job that I 
could do. I think the man got a fair trial. Maybe my faith in the jury system 
is unfounded, but I think these jurors made their decision on the evidence, not 
on the basis of the rhetoric of a couple of lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 William Kopeny, a Santa Ana defense attorney who handled Gionis' appeal, said 
he was pleased the opinion was unanimous and that the court judged the strength 
of the evidence against his client. The opinion was written by Justice Thomas 
F. Crosby Jr. with Justices David G. Sills and Henry T. Moore Jr. concurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people do not rush to reverse. I am very grateful they found the case 
weak enough to say the attorney's testimony and the prosecution's error was 
enough to be prejudicial." 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis, 40, whose medical practice was in Pomona, could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. He remains free on $2-million bail. Kopeny said he advised 
his client not to talk with the news media until the case is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said Thursday his office will decide in the 
weeks ahead whether to retry the case, which has gone to trial twice since 
Gionis was arrested in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne, who lives in Newport Beach with Anastasia and her two other children, 
said she was disappointed by the ruling and still believes her former husband 
is responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it appalling, incredibly appalling," she said. "Obviously, the 
justices who were not there to see trial have selective vision where they only 
address the flaws in the prosecutor and not the flaws of Bruce Cutler. . . 
There is obviously some kind of jealousy about (Robinson's) ability. Those 
justices are not in private practice because they can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi equated the court's decision to "Monday-morning quarterbacking," 
considering that the trial was hard fought by two very experienced attorneys, 
including Cutler, whom some have called "bombastic" and "a street-fighter" 
capable of dominating a courtroom. The language used by the justices to 
criticize Robinson was "unfortunate," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis, who has been described as the overreaching and ambitious son of an 
immigrant plumber, was convicted of conspiracy to commit assault, assault with 
a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon and trespass at his second trial in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His first trial in 1991 ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked. In that 
case, a district attorney investigator was caught in major contradictions on 
the witness stand about what Gionis' chauffeur had told him about telephone 
calls Gionis made shortly after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In overturning the conviction from the second trial, the appeals court 
chastised prosecutor Robinson for his comments directed at Cutler, who gained 
national notoriety for his defense of accused mobster John Gotti in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have repeatedly condemned this particular prosecutor's tactics and had 
done so," the court noted, in another opinion only two weeks before Robinson 
made his final argument in the Gionis case. 
</P>
<P>
 "No theme permeated the prosecutor's rebuttal so much as this: Defense 
counsel's ordained purpose and deliberate goal was deception of the jury," the 
court ruled. "This accusation was an insult to the Bar in general, and slander 
of this defense attorney in particular." 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion then quoted the words of another appeals ruling regarding 
misconduct by the district attorney. "When, as here, prosecutors trample on the 
rights of the accused and cause the need for a new trial, the law-abiding 
citizen has cause for outrage. Victims must then be subjected to the 
humiliation of testifying again. The taxpayer must bear the expense of a new 
trial . . . The defendant and the taxpayers deserve better from a public 
servant than mean-spirited retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi dismissed criticism of Robinson, contending that Cutler and other 
defense lawyers did not make formal objections to the prosecutor's closing 
argument, and did not ask that his remarks be removed from the court record. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the decision, Cutler made formal objections and registered 
his concerns about Robinson to Judge Millard in chambers, where he asked that 
the prosecutor toe the line in his summation. Cutler called to the judge's 
attention an earlier appellate opinion scolding Robinson about his trial 
tactics. Millard only told the attorneys to stop the name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what," Robinson said about Cutler during the in-chambers session, 
"You're a low person." 
</P>
<P>
 "He attacked me personally as some kind of hired gun. It had nothing to do 
with the case," Cutler said Thursday. "To me it was totally improper and the 
court agreed. I have seen prosecutors like this before, but this was the worst. 
This was particularly egregious." 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier murder trial, the same appeals court scolded Robinson for his 
trial tactics and prophetically warned that in a close case his conduct could 
result in the reversal of charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Robinson's conduct was called into question again by defense 
attorneys who won a reversal in a murder case involving former Marine Lance 
Cpl. Thomas Merrill. They argued that Robinson and his investigator improperly 
withheld important evidence from the defense that pointed to Merrill's 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has denied any wrongdoing. The judge in the Merrill case granted a 
new trial after the district attorney agreed that Robinson's investigator 
withheld the evidence in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Though testimony and a sworn affidavit of a key witness indicated that 
Robinson was aware of the evidence, the judge never decided either way on the 
prosecutor's conduct. Robinson insists that the evidence would not have 
exonerated Merrill, hence he had no professional obligation to give it to the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's attorneys have now asked the 4th District Court of Appeal to throw 
out the conclusions of Merrill's preliminary hearing that bound him over for 
trial in Superior Court. A hearing is set for Feb. 22.

APPEALS PANEL REVERSES O.C. MARITAL FRAUD VERDICT

<P>
 In a unique fraud case that jurists labeled "Sex, Lies and Trust Agreements," 
an appeals court panel Thursday reversed a $242,000 damage award to an Anaheim 
banker who had persuaded a jury that his former wife duped him by concealing 
her lack of sexual passion for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are matters best left to advice columnists than to judges and juries," 
concluded three justices of the 4th District Court of Appeal, who offered some 
advice of their own to civil court judges and juries: "Stay out of the 
bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 They added that "courts should not be in the business of probing a suitor's 
state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's 31-page ruling was prompted by the stormy divorce proceedings of 
Pacific Inland Bank President Ronald Askew, 50, and his former wife, Bonnette 
Askew, 46. Using the novel strategy that his ex-wife had committed fraud, 
Ronald Askew sued in civil court after Bonnette Askew admitted during marriage 
counseling that she had hidden her lack of sexual passion for him before and 
during their 11 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a verdict that provoked worldwide publicity, an Orange County 
Superior Court jury sided with Ronald Askew, ordering Bonnette Askew to give up 
her share of four jointly owned parcels of property valued at about $242,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnette Askew left the courtroom in shock April 7, but Thursday said she had 
always believed that the damage award would fail to stand up to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that this has gone on so long is that he flat out wanted to 
destroy me. And when a person becomes obsessed, they lose all concept of 
proportion," said Bonnette Askew, who added that the legal battleground 
eventually became a high-stakes poker game. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the lawsuits in civil court and the legal skirmishes in family court, 
Bonnette Askew estimated that the couple's legal costs now approach $500,000. 
She added that this is probably not the end of the legal war of the Askews. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to retaliate some way," she said. "He's already threatened me with 
two or three lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Askew was not available for comment Thursday. His attorney, Albert M. 
Graham Jr., said he was disappointed with the appellate court ruling but needed 
more time to study the opinion before deciding on a next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said Ronald Askew could appeal the decision, seek a rehearing of the 
issue before the same panel of appeals justices or return to family court to 
settle the issue of community property. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts had predicted that the verdict -- if upheld -- could have 
spawned copycat lawsuits, reshaping the California law that property must be 
split evenly upon divorce. The case sparked debate about how far the the legal 
system should go in regulating romance. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court Thursday also raised concerns that such lawsuits could have 
played havoc with California's no-fault divorce system and its "anti-heartbalm" 
statutes. The laws, which date back to the 1930s, were passed to prevent jilted 
lovers from using the civil courts to seek damages as a "heartbalm" for the 
pain of a broken engagement or breached promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words of love, passion and sexual desire are simply unsuited to the 
cumbersome stricture of common law fraud and deceit," wrote Justice David Sills 
in a section of the opinion entitled "Sex, Lies and Trust Agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that a judge, or jury of 12 solid citizens, can arbitrate whether an 
individual's romantic declarations are true or false, or made with intent to 
deceive, seems almost ridiculously wooden," Sills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Askews, who have two children ages 14 and 11, were granted a divorce in 
1992. But in a separate civil trial, Ronald Askew claimed that four pieces of 
property the couple owned should not be included as community property in their 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the marriage, Ronald Askew said he pleaded for honesty, asking his 
bride-to-be if there was anything he should know about their relationship or 
future marriage. According to him, she said there was "nothing" he needed to 
know. In court, he testified that discussions followed about "passion, desire 
or physical attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 As the relationship started unraveling in 1991, the couple sought marriage 
counseling. Relations were so tense, Bonnette Askew remembered, that even as 
they were living together she said she would receive telephone calls from her 
husband's lawyer, notifying her to provide more toilet paper to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him on a pedestal," she said. "I catered to his every whim. When I 
started to branch out and do things on my own, I started becoming more of a 
person again. He couldn't deal with it. He couldn't deal with the fact that I 
wasn't his little woman anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1991 counseling session, Ronald Askew said, his wife revealed her 
lack of physical attraction for him. It was this admission that Ronald Askew 
used as the basis of his fraud claim, arguing that if he had known about her 
apathy he would not have married her or placed the properties in both their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 In their opinion, the justices noted that Ronald Askew tried to downplay the 
sexual nature of his fraud complaint in the appeals process. Instead, they 
said, he stressed that Bonnette Askew had also made oral promises to hold some 
of the properties in trust for him and his children from a previous marriage -- 
but that the parcels would revert to his ownership on request. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices scoffed at that "post hoc recasting" of the case, saying that the 
essence of the lawsuit still boiled down to accusations about love and sexual 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case may be gussied up as a fraud action, but it is still essentially a 
breach-of-promise suit," wrote Sills, who also noted that the state long ago 
established public policy barring litigation of affairs of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that was so, the trial judge should have dismissed the lawsuit and 
steered the dispute about community property back into a family law court, 
according to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Blumberg, a UCLA law professor, praised Thursday's appeals court 
decision. Months ago, she had publicly predicted that the damage award would be 
struck down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are absolutely right and the trial court was totally wrong," she said. 
"I felt that the jury had made the decision on the basis of feeling aggrieved 
for the husband and so they were going to punish her. This should have been 
handled in family court."

O.C. RIDES OUT HEAVY RAINS WITH RELATIVE EASE; WEATHER: MINOR FLOODING MOVES 
THROUGH LAGUNA AREA, ALTHOUGH BARREN HILLSIDES HOLD. WIND RIPS AWAY PART OF 
COSTA MESA HOME'S ROOF.

 The rains came and the winds blew -- snarling commuter traffic, setting off 
mudslides and unleashing a boulder that slammed into a woman's car -- but the 
damage from Thursday's storm was less than had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Orange County easily rode out the storm that dumped two inches of rain 
in several locations, although there was some snarled freeway traffic and minor 
wind damage, including a gust that lifted the roof off a Costa Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
 But by early afternoon the storm had swept through the county and given way to 
sunshine and patchy clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire-ravaged Laguna Beach once again escaped serious mudslides, despite 1.05 
inches of rainfall that saturated the hillsides from midnight to 4 p.m. The 
rain closed Laguna Canyon Road briefly and caused a momentary flash flood on 
Canyon Acres Drive, said Patrick Brennan, a Laguna Beach Fire Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, we were lucky," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster, Huntington Beach and upper Silverado Canyon received the most 
county rainfall, reporting 1.73, 1.69 and 1.61 inches respectively. Pacific 
Coast Highway, between Golden West Street and Warner Avenue, was closed most of 
the day because of flooding, finally opening at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rainfall totals included 1.18 inches in Costa Mesa, .91 of an inch in 
Brea, .87 in Corona del Mar, .83 in San Juan Capistrano, .79 in El Toro and .67 
of an inch in Garden Grove, according to the county's Environmental Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, the sudden gust of wind about 10:30 a.m. peeled off a huge 
chunk of roofing material from a four-bedroom bluff-top home on Gleneagles 
Terrace. The home's owner, Gale Bouk, said he was watching the Olympics on 
television when the wind gust struck his home, sounding "just like a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Fire Department arrived about five minutes later and nailed 
plastic over the home to protect its interior from the rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last week, when mud from hillsides -- which were laid bare in last 
fall's devastating fires -- surged through homes in Malibu and buried streets 
in Altadena, the barriers built of sandbags, plywood, bales of straw and sheets 
of plastic did their job this time. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an inch of wind-driven rain hammered the fragile slopes above Malibu 
early Thursday morning, but most of the runoff was manageable. By late morning, 
the rain had begun to slacken, the sun was beginning to peek through and 
residents who had fled were returning to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds of Cal State Northridge -- furrowed during the earthquake and then 
churned to dust by heavy equipment during reconstruction work -- were reduced 
to a muddy bog by the drenching rains that struck before daybreak. Students 
slogged gamely through the muck to the trailers serving as temporary 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooded intersections and vehicles skidding out of control on slippery 
pavement turned the morning commute into a tangle of stalled cars and short 
tempers. Police said a 23-year-old Woodland Hills man was killed when his car 
skidded on a curve on Topanga Canyon Road and slammed head-on into another 
vehicle. His identity was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Clogged drains backed up water 2 feet deep on La Cienega Boulevard in Baldwin 
Hills, and the California Highway Patrol said at 8:45 a.m. that traffic on most 
Los Angeles-area freeways was moving at a crawl -- if at all. Rockslides closed 
a number of streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Malibu Canyon Road, a rock the size of a stove plummeted onto the top of a 
small car driven by Michelle Faircloth, 21, collapsing the roof to the top of 
the steering wheel and fracturing her right collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Faircloth, who was pulled from the wreckage by a friend who happened to be 
driving by, was treated at Westlake Hospital and released. She said she was on 
her way to work at Pepperdine University about 7:30 a.m. when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy snow fell in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains above 6,000 
feet on Thursday, to the delight of skiers and the dismay of Caltrans crews 
attempting to keep mountain roads open. Officials said about a foot of new snow 
accumulated at higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, where Pacific Coast Highway was blocked and 25 homes below the 
charred hillsides were invaded by mud last week, residents were better prepared 
Thursday, their houses protected with sturdy, makeshift barriers that diverted 
the cascading muck into runoff channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans crews used skip-loaders to scoop water and mud from a pond that grew 
but never overflowed above PCH at the base of Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeowners stood watch during the morning for the torrent that 
never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry McManus, wearing a plastic trash bag for a raincoat, waited in front of 
his four-unit apartment building damaged by mud Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stop it this time," McManus said. "We're doing more sandbagging and 
we're going to keep the flow moving with a fire hose." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Knudsen, armed with a broom, watched and waited in front of the house on 
PCH that he had barricaded with a wall of sandbags three feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got hit pretty hard last time," Knudsen said before ducking out of sight 
to avoid a television cameraman heading his way. "I'm tired of being filmed in 
pestilence," said Knudsen, who was shown being carried to safety on a 
skip-loader during last week's floods. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 a.m. the rain tapered off and the sun began peeking through the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, the combination of heavy rain and a patchwork of 
temporary and outdoor classrooms proved chaotic, yet manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is trying to be patient," said senior Janet Toma, 22, as she waited 
inside to find out if a sociology class that had been meeting outside would be 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the campus, the dirt around the trailers had become giant pools of mud, 
which proved too much for a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "How am I supposed to get to class?" asked senior Dolores Evans, 27, surveying 
the mire that separated her from her engineering class. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the students decided to make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After an earthquake destroys literally your campus, who cares about a few 
inches of rain and a little mud?" said Michael Lee, a 19-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the forecast today called for partly cloudy skies with a 
chance of showers through tonight and a renewed chance of showers late Sunday 
and early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Thursday, 0.77 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles 
Civic Center, raising the season's total there to 4.14 inches, less than half 
the normal total for Feb. 17 of 9.71 inches. The rainfall season is measured 
from July 1 through June 30.

HARPER WILL SERVE TIME TONIGHT; PRO BASKETBALL: CLIPPERS SUSPEND GUARD FOR ONE 
GAME FOR COMMENTS "DETRIMENTAL TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE TEAM." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers might have finally found a way to silence outspoken guard Ron 
Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was suspended without pay for tonight's game against the Atlanta Hawks 
at the Sports Arena for comments he made before Wednesday night's 103-99 loss 
to the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension will cost Harper, who earns $4 million per season, $48,780.49. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made the decision to suspend Harper for what they termed 
"behavior detrimental to the best interests of the team" after consulting with 
the NBA office. However, the National Basketball Players Assn. is likely to 
file a grievance, claiming that Harper's suspension is unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, the most that Harper could 
have been fined is $300. By suspending Harper, the Clippers are effectively 
fining him $48,780 to deter future disruptive comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the Players Assn., has taken the 
matter under advisement. Grantham said he would have to study the Clipper team 
rules before commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who was benched for Tuesday night's 100-89 victory over the Lakers and 
fined $300 along with teammate Danny Manning for missing Monday's practice, 
compared playing for the Clippers to serving time in jail.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just doing my jail time," said Harper, who will be an unrestricted free 
agent at the end of the season. "In about 65 or 70 more days, my time is up and 
I'll be out on GB, good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how someone who earns $4 million a year could compare it to being 
incarcerated, Harper said: "It's still jail time. Jail time is jail time no 
matter how much you're getting, right? It's still jail time." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, the Clippers' No. 2 scorer with an average of 19.4 points per game, 
missed six of seven shots and scored only four points in 20 minutes before 
being benched in the fourth quarter against the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron's actions leave us no choice," General Manager Elgin Baylor said in a 
statement released by the club. "We would be sending the wrong message to our 
fans, all our players and everyone in the organization if we elected to 
tolerate this type of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time Harper has criticized the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disappointing loss earlier this season, Harper said in graphic terms 
that the Clippers stunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper issued an half-hearted apology the next day after meeting with Baylor.

IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL . . . ; RESILIENT MICHAEL CARBAJAL RECALLS TOUGHEST FIGHT 
BEFORE TAKING ON HUMBERTO GONZALEZ AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was over, no doubt about it. Michael Carbajal, eyes staring nowhere and 
legs dead, twisted sideways into the ring ropes, then crashed to the canvas. 
His ponytail was matted to his back, and his left arm swung between the second 
and third ropes, limply reaching for balance. 
</P>
<P>
 After four blistering rounds of absorbing Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez's 
hammering, Carbajal had to be finished 15 seconds into the fifth, and Gonzalez 
and everybody else watching the fight at the Las Vegas Hilton knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught him good," Gonzalez said, recalling the moment this week through a 
translator. "I saw he was very, very bad. I believed he would never get up." 
</P>
<P>
 At least not before referee Mills Lane counted to 10, maybe not before 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in this fight on March 13, 1993, Carbajal had gone down for the first 
time in his career, but after that second-round knockdown he was up quickly and 
not badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 On this knockdown, caught clean with back-to-back rights as the 5-foot-1 
Gonzalez charged him to open the fifth, Carbajal visibly sagged before going 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him fall and I thought, man! " said Carbajal's brother and trainer, 
Danny. 
</P>
<P>
 How could it not be over? 
</P>
<P>
 Then Michael Carbajal emerged from his daze at the count of five, slammed the 
canvas in anger, rose to his feet and carried the fight into history. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited rematch is Saturday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody else would've gotten up from that," Danny Carbajal said 
of his brother's fifth-round crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I knew is I had to get up," Michael Carbajal said. "No panic. Just, get 
up . I was still a little bit shaky. I knew where I was at, but my legs were 
still wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after taking that shot, anything else I took from him there was no 
problem. I had taken his best." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal survived Gonzalez's frenzied attempt to finish him off -- Gonzalez 
launched 20 wild home-run swings in the 10 seconds after the knockdown -- and 
came back to score with his own whistling right-hand shots in that round as 
Gonzalez tired. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight ended two rounds later, when Carbajal delivered a savage right-left 
hook combination that crumpled Gonzalez forward to the floor. Gonzalez was 
counted out, his eyes shut in agony. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by four points on all judges' cards as the fight ended, Carbajal 
leaped and nearly wept in celebration. It was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I will always think," Gonzalez said softly, "is that I already 
had him. And that I let him go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody had to go back through the videotape to know that this was one of the 
best fights in recent years, probably the best ever in the light-flyweight 
(108-pound) division. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunned roars of the crowd. The furious hugs among the Carbajal cornermen 
when it was over. The bleak look on Gonzalez's face when he crawled back to a 
sitting position and asked his corner: "Did he hit me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a year later, both fighters can remember every important moment of that 
bout -- their thoughts and their fears and their triumphs -- as if they were 
touchstones of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the rematch, the two men spoke in separate interviews with 
similar degrees of pride and eagerness, obviously hungry to go back into the 
ring another time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been waiting for this since the day I lost," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal, 25 at the time, entered their first fight with a 27-0 record and the 
International Boxing Federation light-flyweight belt. 
</P>
<P>
 But doubts had been gathering over the 1988 Olympic silver medalist from 
Phoenix -- he had only 15 knockouts in those 27 victories, a low percentage for 
such a nimble outside puncher, and he had been hit hard often. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 26 then, was considered the Mexican Mike Tyson of the lower weights, 
a brawler with a frontal attack that chewed up his opponents. He had the World 
Boxing Council belt and a 35-1 record, with 25 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez had always struggled to make weight, was having trouble with his 
managers right up to the Carbajal fight, often fought listlessly and was not 
known as a technician in the ring. He was a bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal thought he knew how to handle bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the fight would be easier than it was," Carbajal said. "When I saw 
him fight before, he threw really slow and really wide punches." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Danny Carbajal: "We had planned just to box and maybe in the later rounds 
take him out." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not happen that way, not for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who usually works from a southpaw stance, came out fighting 
right-handed in the first round and, unsurprisingly, came out bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strategy was to attack Carbajal," said Gonzalez's adviser, Rafael 
Mendoza. "The best thing was to make Carbajal respect him. Don't let Carbajal 
walk (forward). He is very good when he walks. He cannot fight backward." 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a tight round, with both fighters landing some punishing shots, 
though neither was hurt. Carbajal backed away from some of Gonzalez's charges 
but stayed inside to trade shots more often than his brother liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael came back after the first round, and I was trying to tell him, 'Don't 
stay with him right there, give me more movement,' " Danny Carbajal said. "He 
told me, 'No, no, no, Danny. He's not that strong. I'm stronger. I want to mess 
him up inside.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows better than the fighter inside the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal kept trying to fire away from tight quarters in the second round, but 
seemed to be confused when Gonzalez switched back to his southpaw style and 
began hitting Carbajal with searing combinations to the body and head. 
</P>
<P>
 About two minutes into the round, Gonzalez caught Carbajal with a solid left 
uppercut, and 30 seconds later, a wide left to the forehead put Carbajal down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lot quicker and threw a lot crisper than I thought he would be," 
Michael Carbajal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal clearly wasn't hurt by the knockdown -- he was up at the count of two 
and fighting again immediately after the eight-count -- but Gonzalez was 
setting the tempo of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the third and fourth rounds, Gonzalez swarmed over Carbajal. Although 
Carbajal was catching Gonzalez with clean right crosses and those rocket shots 
had opened up a gash over Gonzalez's left eye in the third, Gonzalez was 
winning the fight with flurries that often had Carbajal on his heels. 
</P>
<P>
 The first knockdown told Gonzalez everything he needed to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it's not going to be any problem to handle this guy," Gonzalez said. 
"He got up, he wasn't hurt. But, I thought, at the first hard punch I nailed 
him with, he went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to be mine at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth round all but won the fight for Gonzalez, then ultimately lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to shed several pounds the day before the bout to make weight, and was 
not sure he could last 12 rounds at a break-neck pace. His plan was to attack 
and get a knockout, and nothing Carbajal had done warned him away from the 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fifth opened, Gonzalez zoomed in for the kill, pinning Carbajal 
against the ropes in five seconds and firing looping rights and lefts at his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal tried answering, but couldn't get to Gonzalez, who is four inches 
shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten seconds into the Gonzalez flurry, Carbajal was hit by the second right 
hook, and went down. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, upon later reflection, sees the next five seconds as the most 
important span of time in his brother's professional career. The answer to any 
man's deepest fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to see him go down, but there has to be another fighter who goes 
in with the same competitiveness," Danny Carbajal said. "The same heart to go 
out there and test yourself against. With Gonzalez, a lot of the questions 
about Mike were answered in the fifth round." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal was on his knees by the count of five and, with the support of the 
ropes, on his feet by seven. But his eyes and legs looked as if the fight were 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him get up, I jumped on him, and I was trying to finish him," 
Gonzalez said. "I threw a lot of punches and I got tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake. Because of the problem I had with my weight, I shouldn't 
have gone after him." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fifth round was a minute old, Carbajal had already gone down 
dizzily and gotten up, and Gonzalez had relaunched his attack and punched 
himself out. Carbajal, stunningly, had recuperated, fought off Gonzalez and 
gone back to battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gonzalez's new trainer, Ignacio Beristain, who replaced Justo Sanchez: 
"He threw too many punches to see if he could nail him with one and finish the 
fight, instead of going very calm and trying to find the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you get excited and when you are worried because you don't have the 
conditioning, you say, 'I better finish him now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal took over the rest of the round and began to hit Gonzalez with his 
left hook, which would become the fateful punch of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the sixth and seventh rounds, Carbajal seemed to grow fresher and 
fresher, as Gonzalez's carefully plotted combination attack evaporated into 
pure slugging. Gonzalez was more open than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that Michael could take a shot," Danny Carbajal said. "And I knew if 
Michael landed a shot the way Gonzalez did, it was going to be over." 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:32 of the seventh, Carbajal caught Gonzalez off-balance with a short left 
hook that drove Gonzalez 10 feet back into the ropes. Although it could have 
been ruled a knockdown, Lane did not call it, and Gonzalez covered up against 
Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the first time Gonzalez had been hurt," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez recovered enough to hit Carbajal a dozen more times, but his legs 
were gone. His arms swung heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with less than 20 seconds left in the round, Carbajal pounded a right 
hand into Gonzalez's face that pushed him against the ropes, ducked two soft 
Gonzalez counters, missed with a wild right and connected with a perfect left 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not only a strong punch, it was a surprise," Gonzalez said. "And 
that was the combination that put me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez teetered for a second, his body resting briefly on Carbajal's 
shoulder. He fell hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he hit the canvas at 2:47, Lane did not officially count him out until 
one second remained in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal will earn $1 million Saturday night, as a direct result of his 
increased stature in the boxing world because of that victory last March. And 
the comparisons to Roberto Duran, his idol, have never seemed more apt as he 
prepares for the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael knows he can take whatever Gonzalez can dish out," Danny Carbajal 
said. "That doesn't mean we'll go in reckless, but he knows, 'I can take it.' 
Gonzalez has the question, 'Man, if he hits me, am I going to go out again?' 
And that he can't get rid of, no matter how long he fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gonzalez: "Carbajal says that because I got tired and I never nailed him 
again. If I nail him again good, he will go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez grew quiet when asked if he was injured by the knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not hurt," Gonzalez said. "I didn't have any pain. The only thing I 
felt was sadness." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Carbajal, asked what the moment was like, also recalled only emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember saying, 'Damn, that was a good fight.' "

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; BIG THREE OF SKATING MELT ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after winning the men's figure skating gold medal in the 1988 Winter 
Olympics, Brian Boitano became so bored with the mundane life of one-night 
stands on the ice show circuit that he crusaded for a rule so progressive -- in 
a sport that usually moves at the speed of a glacier -- that it was named for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon passage of the Boitano Rule two years ago, which allowed professionals to 
return to serious competition, he turned his attention to becoming the first 
man in the event since Dick Button 40 years before to earn a second gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty seconds into that attempt Thursday night in the Olympic Amphitheatre, 
Boitano's comeback was on its knees, and so was he, the victim of a wayward 
triple axel that cost him dearly with the judges for the technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano will skate in Saturday night's freestyle program, which counts toward 
two-thirds of the final score, but looking up from eighth place, he has 
virtually no chance to win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was any consolation to Boitano, the two men mentioned most often as his 
rivals for the gold, defending champion Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine and 
four-time world champion Kurt Browning of Canada, were in even more distressing 
situations, Petrenko in ninth and Browning in 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning was so disgusted with his performance, which included falls on two 
required jumps, that he all but quit on the spin at the end of his program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable," he muttered to himself while taking his obligatory bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was that. Now, the most likely gold-medal contenders are 
first-place Alexei Urmanov of Russia, second-place Elvis Stojko of Canada and 
third-place Philippe Candeloro of France. Fourth-place Scott Davis, who upset 
Boitano to win the U.S. championship last month, also could win if he finishes 
first in the freestyle program while Urmanov slips to third or lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Those contenders will take some getting accustomed to, considering that none 
has ever won a major international title, Stojko and Urmanov coming closest 
with their second- and third-place finishes, respectively, behind Browning in 
last year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new generation that came here ready, armed and dangerous," said 
Stojko's coach, Doug Leigh. "They can step up to the plate, too. There's more 
than one bat in this game." 
</P>
<P>
 But almost everyone else in the sport had been looking forward to a showdown 
among the sure Hall of Famers -- Boitano, Petrenko and Browning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bummed," said Paul Wylie, one of their contemporaries as the silver 
medalist in 1992 at Albertville, France. "I don't think Urmanov is 
extraordinary and I don't think Candeloro is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The extraordinary skaters all blew up under the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, Wylie allowed, was not helped by the crowd, or the lack of one, as 
only about half of the 6,000 seats were filled when the American skated onto 
the ice as the first of 25 competitors. It was the bad luck of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian opened with one of the most incredible jumps in the sport, the Tano 
Lutz, and it was met with polite applause," Wylie said. "When that happened, it 
was like he said, 'What am I doing here?' It looked like he was somewhere else. 
That's the worst feeling you can have." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boitano's coach, Linda Leaver, said he was so pumped for the triple axel 
that he jumped too high, throwing himself off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened to me," said Boitano, 30, of Sunnyvale, Calif. 
"It's like a blur now. You're like, 'This can't be happening.' It's like you're 
not really there." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the technical program, the Olympic Amphitheatre was almost 
filled because of the late arrivals, including Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, 
who reached Norway earlier Thursday and will begin practicing near Oslo today 
as the United States' first alternate in the women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So the atmosphere inside the building was much enhanced for those who skated 
later, including Misha Shmerkin, a Russian emigre who became Israel's first 
competitor in the Winter Olympics. He is in 15th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the last seven skaters landed their triple axels, which requires 3 1/2 
revolutions. Browning, who drew the enviable 25th position, was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, inexplicably, he fell on his easiest jump, a triple flip, and later 
turned his required double axel into a single, joining Boitano and Petrenko 
among the also-rans.

MIKE DOWNEY: LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; THEY GET TOGETHER, BUT STAY 
APART

<P>
 "Holy cow!" exclaimed Lee Lilly Lyoonjung, an American figure skater competing 
for South Korea, when she saw how many people had come to watch Nancy Kerrigan 
and Tonya Harding share the ice. There were more spectators than had attended 
South Korea's national championships -- and this was a practice.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan skated to Lee's side and said, "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Circling one another warily and without acknowledgment, Kerrigan and Harding 
skated together Thursday for the first time since becoming victim and 
implicated villain, respectively, in America's bizarre Skategate scandal. Usual 
security measures were quadrupled, one official said, as the two U.S. Olympic 
teammates rehearsed simultaneously for next week's competition here, which is 
attracting extraordinary interest worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither skater directly addressed a massive media turnout, but Harding did 
schedule a one-hour news conference for today at 7 a.m. Pacific time. 
</P>
<P>
 Every detail of the athletes' day drew uncommon attention, from the bouquet of 
roses sent to Harding by an anonymous admirer in Washington, D.C., to a 
good-luck telegram delivered to Kerrigan that came from quarterback Troy Aikman 
of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cool," Kerrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Harding were joined by two rivals, Lee and Bulgaria's Zvetelina 
Abrasheva, during a half-hour workout at a training rink, followed by a 
separate session on the ice of the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, 45 miles from 
Lillehammer, where the women's finals will be held Feb. 25. Because Kerrigan 
was assaulted Jan. 6 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Detroit, this 
marked her first actual appearance on the ice with Harding in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, the self-appointed "peacemaker" among the skaters, embraced Harding after 
the early practice. 
</P>
<P>
 She had said beforehand, "I don't know if (Tonya is) going to get a Nancy hug, 
but she's going to get one from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya received no Nancy hug. Although they reportedly had exchanged greetings 
the night before, Harding and Kerrigan had no visible contact at either 
practice Thursday, dressing in separate quarters and ignoring one another while 
limbering up and executing their routines. Nervous laughter filled the hall at 
one point when the two skaters narrowly missed one another, in what would have 
been a crash heard 'round the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a stampede from hundreds of reporters and photographers as well 
as curiosity-seekers inside their tiny training rink, officials from the 
Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) reinforced a balcony railing, 
having become concerned several days ago when First Daughter Chelsea Clinton 
leaned across it while attending a Kerrigan workout. A spokesman for LOOC, Ove 
Lunde, also said security was quadrupled for the occasion, particularly after 
death threats against Harding and Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian skating officials said more people attended this practice than had 
attended certain European championship events. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in attendance were skaters Scott Davis of the United States and 
Elvis Stojko of Canada, even though each had to perform in the men's singles 
competition later in the evening; U.S. Olympic Committee President Harvey 
Schiller, rarely one to attend such a practice, and figure skating TV 
consultant Eddie Einhorn, who also is co-owner of the Chicago White Sox. 
Einhorn compared interest in Thursday's activity here to that in Michael 
Jordan's participation in Florida spring training with the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place in the world to be today is here or in Sarasota," Einhorn 
said, even though no actual sporting event was being held in either place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan and Harding ran through their freestyle routines in a voluntary 
practice that began at 1:30 p.m. here, then worked on their technical 
performances in a 4 o'clock session. Kerrigan, skittish and several pounds 
thinner than she was in Detroit, broke some tension when she and Lee, sharing a 
dressing room, discovered that their all-white, lace-bodiced outfits were 
nearly identical. Kerrigan's costume was strikingly similar to the one she was 
wearing when a baton-wielding assailant changed her life with a single swing. 
</P>
<P>
 She stepped onto the ice, coincidentally, to the background music of Elton 
John's "I'm Still Standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, having practiced in Oregon until now, cut quite a contrasting figure 
in a florid leotard and black tights. She skipped the six-minute warm-up period 
altogether, then emerged from her dressing room holding hands with Haik 
Gharibians, a U.S. Olympic team physiotherapist. Her right ankle giving her 
pain, Harding nevertheless skated skillfully to music from the film "Jurassic 
Park" and attempted several triple axels, landing two of them perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughing from her asthma, Harding said to her coach during a break: "I need a 
new body. I need a younger body." 
</P>
<P>
 Her 23-year-old one appeared on front pages internationally Thursday, in 
various poses from a videotape filmed by her former husband, Jeff Gillooly, 
that he sold to American television. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding added to her coach: "No, this one has done all right for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the rink, Harding thumbs-upped the media. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Kerrigan were back at practice shortly thereafter, without incident, 
frequently gliding within a few feet of one another but avoiding one another's 
gazes at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. figure skating spokeswoman Kristin Matta said afterward: "It was 
stressful, but both of them handled it well. Better than we did."

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; MOE-HUM, ANOTHER U.S. MEDAL; ALPINE: ALASKAN 
ADDS A SILVER IN SUPER-G TO HIS GOLD IN DOWNHILL, MAKING HIM FIRST AMERICAN 
MALE TO WIN TWO SKIING MEDALS AT ONE OLYMPICS.

<P>
 American skiers aren't only gloating, they're yawning. 
</P>
<P>
 This, as Swiss stars call it quits, Austrians duck for cover and the French 
get fried. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after mining gold in the Olympic downhill, Tommy Moe struck silver 
in the men's super-giant slalom on Thursday, placing second behind Germany's 
Markus Wasmeier by eight one-hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmeier's winning time was 1 minute 32.53 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's time? Well, it has come. The crowd of 50,000 at the Kvitfjell Alpine 
Center to cheer the host-country favorite, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, had to settle 
for singing birthday wishes to an adopted son, Moe, who is of Norwegian 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 With the silver, Moe, who celebrated his 24th birthday, dispelled notions that 
his downhill victory was a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to let this opportunity pass me by just because I won the 
downhill," he said. "I knew I had just as good a chance as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 No telling what Tommy Moe might do at the Olympics if he could stay awake. 
Another big race? In the starting gate, Moe said, he yawned three or four times 
before blistering the course set by his coach, Bill Egan. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been that kind of week for the United States in Alpine. The course 
setter is determined by random draw of coaches for the top 15 skiers. The 
chance of Egan's name being drawn, then, was one in 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, who seems to be adjusting well to fame, learned he was on the cusp of 
U.S. Alpine history while pouring milk on morning cereal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at the past medal winners when I was having breakfast," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between bites, Moe noted that no U.S. male Alpine skier had ever won more than 
one medal in the same Olympics. Wouldn't it be cool to do that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Moe took care of history in almost no time, 1:32.61 to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not about to neglect his good fortune. The key to Thursday's race was 
obtaining an early starting position so he could get on the course before it 
became rutted by other skiers, leading to increasingly slower times. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can set your own tracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This Moe is no stooge. Turned out the top four finishers were among the first 
nine racers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe drew start No. 8 in the downhill and wore bib No. 3 for the super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to sit around and see people's times," Moe said. "I just want to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's hopes for double gold were quickly dashed, though. His reign atop the 
leader board lasted the time it took Wasmeier, next down the hill, to cross the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's excitement was also tempered as he awaited the times of the two race 
favorites, Aamodt, the defending Olympic champion, and Luxembourg's Marc 
Girardelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt, skiing seventh, made a run at the leaders but settled for third. 
Girardelli, skiing next, took fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The course got sloppy soon afterward, making it difficult for skiers to hold 
their lines. After the top 10 had skied, no racer posed a serious threat to the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing as how no countryman has yet claimed Alpine gold, Norwegians have taken 
to the American whose great-great grandfather hailed from Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 You might have expected fans to acknowledge the birthday of Norway's Atle 
Skaardal, who skied first and was treated in the finish corral with birthday 
song and cake. 
</P>
<P>
 But how did they know about Moe? When he crossed the finish, the crowd 
reprised "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 When he realized the song was for him, Moe waved to the crowd and blew a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of surprising," he said. "It just makes it really easy for the 
Americans to come to Norway and enjoy the whole scene. The whole atmosphere is 
just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange how one's stature can change in four days. Moe's mother, Joann 
Persons, who could not afford to make the trip from Whitefish, Mont., to 
Norway, was en route Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing that the mother of the Olympic downhill champion could not be 
with her son, citizens of Whitefish raised the money to pay her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Medals talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I have two medals," Moe said. "It just feels out of this 
world. . . . A lot of people in the world would like to be in my boots right 
now. I kind of feel like I'm in a dream. It's hard to explain how overwhelmed I 
am right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the rest of the skiing world turns green with envy. 
</P>
<P>
 With still a week of Alpine remaining, the United States already has more 
medals than ski powerhouses Austria and Switzerland combined. 
</P>
<P>
 With two gold medals and a silver, the United States has a chance to eclipse 
its best Alpine performance, at Sarajevo in 1984, when Americans won three gold 
and two silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect the United States to send flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams like the Austrians and the Swiss, they're expected to win," Paul Major, 
the U.S. Alpine director, said. "They let that get to them. It's their fault 
for letting it get to them. We get beat year in and year out and nobody cries 
for us. We're in Europe for three months, but nobody cries for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Aamodt, the finest all-around skier in the world, concedes that Americans 
are not afraid to go for the jugular in big events. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt said Norwegians, himself included, have always needed daily 
affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe has helped Norway realize that it's OK to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you do something special, you shouldn't think you're something 
special," Aamodt explained of old Norwegian thinking. "You (the United States) 
like to be No. 1. It's the American Dream. I think the American Dream is 
finally coming to Norway for the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, one of the dreamers, was disappointed that he had missed his second gold 
by .08. But if he could have chosen the man he might lose it to, it might have 
been Wasmeier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old veteran from Schliersee, who restores antique paintings and 
plays Mozart on his violin in his spare time, is the Diann Roffe-Steinrotter of 
the German team. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were tremendous longshots to win. Both won their Olympic golds this week 
in super-G. Both rebounded from serious injury. Wasmeier, as had 
Roffe-Steinrotter, won the 1985 world championship -- in giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither had done much since. Roffe-Steinrotter has not won a World Cup race 
since 1985. Wasmeier has won only one super-G since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Roffe-Steinrotter mentioned to Wasmeier the similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'You could win the super-G too,' " Wasmeier said. "It was a joke. I 
was very surprised I could win this race today." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Olympics have been full of Alpine surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe had never finished higher than third in a downhill and had never placed 
higher than third in a super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, who has never won a downhill combined, will try to do so next Friday in 
the slalom after having placed third in the downhill segment earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe can't hold Alberto Tomba's boots in slalom, but who wants to bet against 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to beat Girardelli in slalom, I'd better start training 
tomorrow," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Austria picks up the pieces after super-G finishes of ninth, 11th 
and 37th. 
</P>
<P>
 La Belle France? It had two finishers in the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland had to hang its ski cap on Marc Hangl, who finished 10th. The 
Swiss team also announced the retirement of Franz Heinzer, the great 
downhiller, at 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinzer will be remembered this week for perhaps the shortest Olympic run in 
history when he popped out of a ski just as he left the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this what Americans used to do?

DODGERS ARE LEFT WITH OLD QUESTIONS; BASEBALL: STRAWBERRY AND WORRELL COULD 
FILL THE NEED OF A LEFT-HANDED BAT AND BULLPEN STOPPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Last spring, Manager Tom Lasorda asked Darryl Strawberry to hang around the 
clubhouse so he could meet the Dodger charter plane, which was arriving from 
Los Angeles with the nucleus of players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine the looks on their faces, Darryl, when the other players see 
you there?" Lasorda asked Strawberry, anticipating their jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the only feeling Strawberry elicits is trepidation. Once again, 
he is the wild card in a Dodger lineup that needs a dominating left-handed 
hitter to break out of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the key," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda didn't meet the plane when it arrived Thursday, only the second time 
he had missed the event in 22 years. He was originally told it would arrive 
today, and had committed to a charity event in Nashville. So, while he was in 
Tennessee, he stopped by the Sisters of Mercy convent to visit some of the nuns 
and to ask for some special prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need you to find me a left-handed nun to pray that I get a left-handed 
reliever," he told them. "Then I need you to find me another nun, just to pray 
for my defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, coming off a .500 season, open spring training today in a newly 
aligned National League West, where their competition is the San Francisco 
Giants, San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies. The team improved last season, 
but the questions Lasorda has to answer in the next six weeks are the same as 
those of last spring. They begin with Strawberry, his new left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials said Strawberry's surgically repaired back is absolutely sound. 
But his tendency to find trouble off the field is still suspect. If Strawberry 
stays out of trouble, is productive and is not traded, Lasorda will use him as 
the cleanup hitter, followed by Mike Piazza and Eric Karros, and probably Raul 
Mondesi, who is the favorite for the right-field position. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Delino DeShields strengthens the lineup considerably with his 
speed and bat, but Lasorda, who spent Wednesday night here with some of his 
former players, said he still isn't sure about having him lead off. That 
prompted former Dodger second baseman Davey Lopes to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "You put Brett Butler behind DeShields, he steals, Butler bunts him over and 
you have a guy on third base with one out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman, who gained about 12 pounds while playing winter ball in the 
Dominican Republic, stole 30 bases last season (to add to Butler's 39), which 
makes Lasorda want to keep Offerman in one of the top three positions of the 
lineup. Offerman batted .308 with runners in scoring position, and drove in 62 
runs overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on Darryl in the cleanup spot," Lasorda said. "We'll get it 
figured out by the end of spring training." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach, who has drawn rave reviews for his work during the winter, is the 
incumbent at third base, and unless prospect Mike Busch emerges, there really 
isn't anybody else. Dave Hansen, who set the Dodger franchise record last 
season with 18 pinch-hits, is not considered a good enough fielder to be 
seriously considered for the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers made no progress during the off-season in filling the glaring 
bullpen deficiency that cost them games and destroyed morale on the team. They 
open camp without a left-handed stopper, which keeps them from matching up 
against teams loaded with left-handed batters, such as the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the image of Rod Nichols standing on the mound in the 20th inning against 
the Phillies continues to haunt the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 And even without Will Clark, the Giants are tough and are led by Barry Bonds, 
who warrants a left-handed stopper in the late innings. Right-hander Pedro 
Martinez helped shut down the Giants last season, and he went to Montreal in 
the trade for DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, has spent the last year looking 
for a left-hander, but says there aren't many available. As he did last spring, 
Claire has resorted to inviting several newcomers to try out, along with 
returnees Omar Daal and Steve Wilson, one of whom will probably make the roster 
by default.  
</P>
<P>
 The effectiveness of the bullpen depends greatly on injury-plagued Todd 
Worrell, who had only five saves last season. Worrell says he is sound, which 
means Jim Gott, who had 25 saves in 1993, might be able to return to the setup 
role, Martinez's former slot. Roger McDowell, who did a good job in mid-relief 
last season, returns, as does long-reliever Ricky Trlicek. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger starters -- all right-handers -- finished with the third-lowest 
earned-run average in the major leagues, but only one of the five, Pedro 
Astacio, had a winning record. Tom Candiotti pitched well, but wound up with an 
8-10 record because of poor offensive support. Orel Hershiser, Ramon Martinez 
and Kevin Gross round out the rotation.

WITH NO MORE EXCUSES, HOCH HAS HOPE; GOLF: NON-WINNER SINCE 1989 FIRES A 62 TO 
TAKE A THREE-SHOT LEAD OVER CLEARWATER AFTER TWO ROUNDS IN THE DESERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There must be something about the desert air. Apparently, anything is possible 
on the four courses used in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, especially if you 
throw a little rain into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, a day after Hal Sutton shot 63, his best round in three years, Scott 
Hoch shot his lifetime best, a 10-under-par 62 on the Palmer Course at PGA West 
to equal the record Tom Kite set last year in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch's 36-hole total of 16-under-par 128 is a Hope record, breaking the mark 
of 129 set by Craig Stadler in 1983, but falls a stroke short of the PGA Tour 
record of 17 under par set by Robert Gamez at Milwaukee in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a Keith Clearwater revival was enough to stay close to Hoch on a 
cloudy day. Clearwater, who says he has been golf's angry man for the last five 
years, was at peace at Indian Wells with a 64 that left him at 131, three 
strokes behind Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodie Mudd, who won the Players Championship in 1990 but has done little since 
because he devotes much of his time to raising thoroughbreds in his native 
Kentucky, shot a 66 at Indian Wells and is third at 132. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch was quick to put it all into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Kite set his record on the final day," Hoch said. "His was to win. We 
still have three more rounds to play. This is like being the leader after the 
first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch knows that a three-stroke lead after two rounds is less important in a 
90-hole event. He's just happy with his game. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't played well since having shoulder surgery in 1992, but no longer 
blames it on the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoulder has been fine for a while, but my game has not," Hoch said. "I 
had to mentally learn how to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch knows a little bit about mental recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a pretty stiff jolt in the 1989 Masters, where he missed a 
two-foot putt on the first playoff hole that would have given him the victory. 
Nick Faldo won it on the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch won the Las Vegas Invitational in a playoff a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 That was his last victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have used the shoulder surgery as an excuse for about a year. It 
takes a while to heal," he said. "There was some detached cartilage in there 
that had to be reattached." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch had lost some power, but has since increased his strength with daily 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have excuses now," he said. "It's nice to be playing well again." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearwater has had a different problem. He hasn't always reacted well when he 
wasn't playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times when I wouldn't have wanted to play with somebody who 
acted like me," said Clearwater, whose two tour victories came in his rookie 
season of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in his attitude occurred when he took on John Sullivan as his 
caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is absolutely great for me," Clearwater said. "He has worked for (Jack) 
Nicklaus and (Johnny) Miller, and he knows what he's doing. He told me he 
wanted to work for me because he saw some potential and wanted to help me. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he has done for me is help me concentrate on the present and to forget 
everything else. If you get mad after a bad shot, it can hurt you for several 
holes after that. And if you're playing well, sometimes you start thinking 
ahead and don't fully concentrate on each shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the only thing I focus on is my shot. And after I hit it, I chase it and 
get on with the next shot. I know it sounds simple, and it is, but it helps to 
have somebody out there to help you make the right decisions." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hoch opened his round by missing a 3 1/2-foot putt, but went on to make 
nine birdies, an eagle and one bogey. "It was as easy as a 62 could be," he 
said. "I was in danger of making only one bogey, and I made it." . . . Keith 
Clearwater had the best streak of the day. Starting at the second hole, he 
birdied five in a row, bogeyed the seventh, then birdied the next four. He had 
one more birdie, at the 15th, then finished with a bogey. . . . Hal Sutton, the 
first-round leader, followed his 63 with a 70 and is five strokes behind with 
five others at 133. . . . Defending champion Tom Kite shot a 70 at La Quinta 
and is tied with eight others at 142. . . . Los Angeles Open champion Corey 
Pavin, a two-time Hope winner, shot a 69 at La Quinta but is far behind at 140.

U.S. TEAM WILL KEEP EYE ON WORLD CUP FOE; SOCCER: AMERICANS WON'T PLAY COLOMBIA 
IN WEEKEND TOURNAMENT, BUT THEY WILL WATCH THE UNPREDICTABLE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. national soccer team will once again get a close look at one of its 
World Cup opponents, Colombia, beginning today in the Joe Robbie Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although Coach Bora Milutinovic objects to use of the word spy for the 
intense attention his coaches will give the Colombian team, the U.S. staff will 
need every available tool to analyze one of soccer's most explosive and 
unpredictable teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will play Bolivia today, after Colombia faces Sweden. The teams 
switch opponents Sunday. Both Bolivia and Sweden have qualified for the 24-team 
World Cup, to be held in the United States June 17-July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Steve Sampson, who speaks fluent Spanish, has been assigned to 
scout Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's match against Sweden, the U.S. team will have played against or 
been in the same tournament with its three World Cup Group A opponents. The 
United States tied Switzerland, 1-1, on Jan. 22, and lost, 2-1, to Romania, 
last week in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the traditional soccer taboo of facing World Cup opponents before the 
tournament, neither Swiss nor Romanian officials objected to the matches, which 
had been scheduled well before the teams were drawn into the same group in 
December.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team might have played Colombia, too, had the Colombians, considered 
the strongest unit in Group A, not asked for a schedule change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in spy ," Milutinovic said, offering observateur as the more 
appropriate word. "Anyway, they will look different in the World Cup. There is 
so much pressure (during the World Cup). We don't know how they will resolve 
this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic gave the same disclaimer when his team played Switzerland, which 
will play the United States in the first game. Partly because few national 
teams have all of their best players at their disposal at this time of year, 
coaches tend to give these games little weight as indicators of how the teams 
will fare in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some coaches may be careful not to show more than the most basic 
game plans to opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But assistant coach Timo Liekoski believes that games against World Cup 
opponents reveal much about strategy and style, even if key players are 
missing. Teams play the way they play, he said, regardless of their roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any team we will see prior to the World Cup will play any 
different strategy in the World Cup," Liekoski said. "I don't think there is 
time before a World Cup, nor would they want to. I don't think Switzerland is 
going to look so different from what we saw." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team, which is 1-1-3 this year, lost to Romania on Feb. 13 after a 
controversial penalty kick was awarded to Ilie Dumitrescu. The tie with the 
Swiss was hardly instructional, because neither team played well. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia, however, is better than either Switzerland or Romania. The team that 
beat Argentina, 5-0, in Buenos Aires features strikers Faustino Asprilla and 
Adolfo Valencia. Neither will play in this tournament, but playmaker and team 
captain Carlos Valderrama will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we will watch," Milutinovic said. "But the problem is, you watch 
one practice, beautiful. You watch the next, criminal . I prefer to watch in 
the game, in the World Cup."

DEVERS PULLS OUT OF SUNKIST RACE AFTER RUSSIAN SPRINTER IS ENTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Olympic champion Gail Devers pulled out of the 50-meter dash in Saturday's 
Sunkist track meet at the Sports Arena because new indoor world record-holder 
Irina Privalova was added to the field, said Al Franken, the event's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken said Devers' representatives, Debra and Wallace Anderson, wanted more 
money for their runner when they learned Privalova would run. 
</P>
<P>
 Devers, named 1993 U.S. women's track athlete of the year, won the women's 
100-meter dash in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona. Privalova, from Russia, set 
the world indoor 50-meter record with a time of 6.01-seconds at Madrid last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken produced a copy of the agreement signed by Debra Anderson, who also 
represents Jackie Joyner-Kersee, showing both had agreed to compete, with no 
stipulations as to their competition. Devers had agreed to run for $9,000, 
Joyner-Kersee for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Devers' coach, Bob Kersee, said "(Devers) had already agreed to run for less 
than her usual fee . . . (Franken) never said anything about Privalova." EARL

KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, THE LITTLE FELLA; PREP BASKETBALL: IT'S NOT EASY BEING THE 
SON OF A SUPERSTAR, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Camp Kareem, a Hawaiian summer getaway for high school athletes 
looking to improve their physical conditioning and skyhook. Here's our friendly 
personal trainer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  
</P>
<P>
 But wait, kids, please be aware that there is a catch: You must be a child of 
Abdul-Jabbar. And such a privilege can, at times, carry a heavy price.  
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, life is not always a slam dunk for a kid named Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about trying to meet some high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Abdul-Jabbar, the namesake and one of five children of the 
all-time leading scorer in the NBA, chose to play basketball at Brentwood High. 
</P>
<P>
 This has piqued the curiosity of many. And they all want to know one thing: 
Can he play? 
</P>
<P>
 One authority said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has good instincts," the elder Abdul-Jabbar said. "He doesn't have to 
think about what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, that source might be biased by fatherly pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Abdul-Jabbar, a 6-foot-5 senior center, leads Brentwood with averages of 
16.5 points and eight rebounds a game. Brentwood (18-6) will play host to 
Calabasas Viewpoint (9-10) in a first-round playoff game tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood, however, plays in Division V-AA, the lowest division in the state, 
and Abdul-Jabbar is not being highly recruited. Several basketball scouts have 
said that Abdul-Jabbar is no second coming of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good high school player," said David Benezra, an assistant editor for 
Bluechip Illustrated, a national scouting publication. "I don't feel he's (an 
NCAA) Division I level basketball player. He would be a nice Division II player 
for somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, a story about a miniature version of Abdul-Jabbar is too tempting for 
the media to resist; what is it like to be the son of a living legend? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not what many would imagine. Outside of one recent summer when they 
decided to hold a monthlong, father-and-son basketball "boot camp" at his dad's 
home on Kauai, there was little time spent playing basketball together at a 
back-yard hoop. What's more, until recently, there was little time spent 
getting to know each other at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there are no names on their uniforms, there was no mistaking 
Abdul-Jabbar when Brentwood took the floor for a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a shorter build than his father, but also has a remarkable likeness to 
his father's famous face, save for thick hair and no goggles. His friends even 
call him "Cap." 
</P>
<P>
 But once he shed his warm-up jacket, there was a glaring dissimilarity: 
Abdul-Jabbar wears No. 40, rather than his father's 33. 
</P>
<P>
 The school did not have a jersey with No. 33 in his size, but that did not 
really bother the younger Abdul-Jabbar -- "It's just not really my thing, I 
guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly because the elder Abdul-Jabbar has not always had lots of time to 
devote to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Abdul-Jabbar's mother is Habiba Herbert, who was married to Abdul-Jabbar 
for seven years before they were separated in 1979 and eventually divorced. 
Herbert said that Abdul-Jabbar's career took up so much of his time and energy 
that he had little left to devote to the three children that they share. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sacrifice a lot to get where he is," said Herbert, who has since 
remarried. "And he, at one point, sacrificed family. I realize now it was 
something he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it was difficult for Abdul-Jabbar to establish a relationship with his 
first three children because, since the divorce, they mostly have been with 
their mother.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult for me to know them," the elder Abdul-Jabbar said. "I 
think the divorce affected that more than playing with the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his retirement in 1989, after a record 20 years in the NBA, Abdul-Jabbar 
has tried to improve his relations with his children. He tries to watch as many 
of his son's games as he can. That can be difficult, however, because he still 
travels frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I expect him and he's not there," the younger Abdul-Jabbar said. 
"Sometimes I don't expect him and he's right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were moments when it was nice for young Abdul-Jabbar to have a 
pro basketball player for a father. 
</P>
<P>
 When he played for the Lakers, for instance, Abdul-Jabbar sometimes would 
bring Kareem and his younger, half-brother, Amir, to practices, where they 
could be found playing alongside the court. 
</P>
<P>
 After games, they were allowed to run wherever they wanted in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 As young Abdul-Jabbar stood in the locker room, waiting for his father, James 
Worthy would inevitably sneak up behind him, grab him and swing him in the air, 
tickling him breathless. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are moments, however, when it is more difficult to have a superstar 
dad. The toughest time for the younger Abdul-Jabbar was when other kids at his 
elementary school began to tease him, telling him that they didn't believe he 
was really the son of the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's your father, why doesn't he ever bring you to school?" they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the elder Abdul-Jabbar heard what his son was going through at school, he 
picked him up one day and made a point to get out of the car and meet his son's 
schoolmates, putting an end to speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Abdul-Jabbar, the most difficult thing about being his father's son is 
sharing his name. This, he said, can be confusing and inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
 He first realized this might be a problem at a young age. After all, when your 
name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, it's tough to keep your father a secret. His first 
day of grade school, some older kids approached him with pictures of his father 
and asked him to get them autographed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, a teacher reached his name when taking role and stopped and 
said, "Wait a minute, is this a joke?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Abdul-Jabbar understands people's shock when they see his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do the same thing if I saw a (student named) Bill Cosby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the nation celebrated Abdul-Jabbar's farewell tour in '89, which marked 
the end of an era in basketball, his son celebrated a new beginning -- a time 
to find out who his dad was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always been like Uncle Dad," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Abdul-Jabbar never insisted that his son play basketball, but he did 
insist that he learn martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when young Abdul-Jabbar showed an aptitude for basketball in local youth 
leagues, his father maintained a low-key attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it has always been a question of what he wanted to do, and as long as 
he is enjoying himself, I don't worry," the elder Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 What the father does worry about, however, is academics. He insisted that his 
son improve his grades at Brentwood before allowing him to join the basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Abdul-Jabbar moved in with his father in 1991 as a sophomore at 
Brentwood because his father lived closer to the school. He has since moved 
back with his mother because Abdul-Jabbar has begun to travel more. Still, 
living with his father was an eye-opening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, they lived separate lives under the same expansive roof, often 
not even eating dinner together. But each soon learned what the other was all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 The older Abdul-Jabbar was not prepared for what he discovered about his son 
-- he had a mind of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, fathe r and son learned that they are more similar than not. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a weird sense of humor," young Abdul-Jabbar said about his father. 
"He's like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, it's the other way around.

JOYNER-KERSEE IS TAKING IT SEVEN EVENTS AT A TIME; TRACK: TWO-TIME OLYMPIC 
HEPTATHLON CHAMPION IS MARCHING TOWARD ATLANTA AND THE 1996 SUMMER GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Louis should have been this good. Or the 1927 Yankees. Or Red Grange. Or 
Wilt Chamberlain.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee doesn't simply dominate her specialty, the heptathlon, 
she has reinvented it. She didn't take her game to the next level, she put it 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 And so after two Olympic gold medals in her specialty, a chain of world 
records, the six best performances of all time and the 21 best long jumps in 
U.S. history, why doesn't she try something else, such as golf? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Wait until 1996. Then it will be tee time.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee, who turns 32 next month, wants to bow out by finishing her 
Olympic gold-medal run in the 1996 Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "To finish up by winning another gold on U.S. soil -- that's very important to 
me now, and it's the focus of my training," she said recently after a workout 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 She's preparing for a 50-meter race Saturday night in the Sunkist Invitational 
indoor track meet at the Sports Arena.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee won gold medals in the heptathlon at Seoul in 1988 and Barcelona 
in '92. In Los Angeles, in '84, she missed the gold by 0.06 seconds in the 
final event, the 800 meters.  
</P>
<P>
 When she crossed the finish in the 800 at Barcelona, former U.S. men's 
decathlon gold medalist Bruce Jenner was one of the first to greet her.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have proved to the world that you are the greatest athlete who ever 
lived, male or female," he told her.  
</P>
<P>
 Many track fans agree.  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime statistician Scott Davis points out that besides posting the top 21 
U.S. women's long jump marks, Joyner-Kersee has 16 of the world's top 20 
heptathlon scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, she's the greatest female athlete ever, without question," Davis said. 
"Her only challenger is Babe Didrickson." 
</P>
<P>
 Didrickson won three gold medals in the 1932 Los Angeles Games, set world 
records in two events, and years later won the U.S. Women's Open golf 
tournament by 12 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bo Jackson and Michael Jordan, Joyner-Kersee does want to excel at 
another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 How about golf? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played golf and I've learned it's a lot harder than it looks, but it is 
something I want to do a lot of after Atlanta," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee, or JJK as she's called, doesn't like to reveal much about her 
abilities in golf, tennis, bowling and all other non-track activities. No 
scores, no names.  
</P>
<P>
 She says she never has scored below 100 in golf, but says that at times she is 
long and straight off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 She wins at tennis, she says, but is prone to occasional "home runs," adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could get pretty good at tennis. My foot movement is pretty good 
and track has given me good endurance, which is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowling was a favorite weekend pastime during her UCLA days -- when she was 
also a basketball standout -- and is a sport she also wants to explore.  
</P>
<P>
 But for now, training for Atlanta continues while she also handles a string of 
endorsement and marketing contracts. She's affiliated with companies making 
cars, sunglasses, shoes, soft drinks, insoles, bread, bottled water, 
cheeseburgers and computers.  
</P>
<P>
 And yes, she is a millionaire -- one who has directed some of the money to her 
roots, East St. Louis, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Jackie Joyner-Kersee Community Foundation annually awards $500 to $5,000 
scholarships to East St. Louis high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in poverty there, becoming a high school sports star who was 
awarded a UCLA scholarship. Her brother, Al Joyner -- who is married to 
former-sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner -- was the 1984 Olympic triple jump 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee also is a millionaire with a leaky roof and allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the Canoga Park home of Joyner-Kersee and her 
husband and coach, Bob Kersee. The overbooked contractor has not had time to 
repair it. 
</P>
<P>
 She sees an allergist regularly when her workouts are interrupted by 
asthma/allergy attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets real bad, so bad it's scary," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just the other day I was running easily around the UCLA intramural field and 
my windpipe started closing up. Then I started having hot flashes and a burning 
sensation in my throat.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm allergic to some preservative restaurants put in salads, also to MSG, 
some green vegetables, peanuts and seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My allergies have been kind of a reverse factor in most of my competitions, 
because I worry so much about an allergy attack before a meet, I don't eat 
much. That drops my blood sugar level down and it weakens me and makes me 
moody." 
</P>
<P>
 So weak she can't seem to break 8,000 points in the heptathlon. She has scored 
7,000-plus six times. Only one other woman has achieved a 7,000-point total. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder why, in this modern track and field era, women don't compete in 
their own 10-event decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Heptathlon events are the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shotput and 200 meters 
on the first day; the long jump, javelin and 800 meters on the second day.  
</P>
<P>
 The decathlon events are the 100 meters, long jump, shotput, high jump and 400 
meters on the first day; the 110-meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 
1,500 meters on the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the years ahead, maybe by 2000, I believe they'll add events to make it a 
women's decathlon," Joyner-Kersee said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They could easily add the discus, but I'm not sure if people would want to 
watch women pole vault." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kersee foresees a women's decathlon with the added events being the 100, 
discus and triple jump.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Joyner-Kersee has no serious rivals on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Her closest opponents at Barcelona were Irina Belova of Russia and Sabine 
Braun of Germany, both in their late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's questionable to me how much they'll improve in the next two years," Bob 
Kersee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie's focus now has to be to just stay healthy and keep improving. We 
don't know of any new rivals out there. We expect she'll see the same people in 
Atlanta she's competed against the past several years."

NEUHEISEL IS LATEST UCLA ASSISTANT TO LEAVE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-fourths of UCLA's offensive coaching staff have left since the end of 
the season, with receiver coach Rick Neuheisel being the latest defection. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel said Thursday that he has accepted a job coaching quarterbacks and 
receivers at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 His move follows those of offensive coordinator Homer Smith, to Alabama, and 
line coach Bob Palcic, to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone coach remaining from last season's offensive staff is Wayne Moses, 
who works with running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with some great receivers at UCLA, and I've enjoyed it, but I 
really wanted to get back to working with quarterbacks," Neuheisel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel, 32, was considered for the UCLA offensive coordinator's job after 
Smith resigned, but was passed over. Coach Terry Donahue opted for the 
experience of Bob Toledo, who had been offensive coordinator at Texas A&M and 
Oregon and head coach at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel said he was not going to Colorado because he wasn't promoted to the 
offensive coordinator's job, though he wanted it badly. Donahue had recommended 
him to Colorado Coach Bill McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel also was interviewed for the head coaching job at San Diego State, 
but Ted Tollner, a Ram assistant and former USC coach, was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel will work under Colorado offensive coordinator Elliott Uzelec and 
replaces Karl Dorrell, a former Bruin teammate who left the Buffaloes to become 
the receiver coach at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel was a walk-on quarterback who became the starter at UCLA in 1983, 
leading the Bruins to a 45-9 victory over Illinois in the '84 Rose Bowl. He 
spent two seasons in the United States Football League and brief periods with 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a Bruin volunteer assistant for one season, working with 
then-redshirt quarterback Troy Aikman, then became a full-time assistant in 
1988.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; TEAM USA STILL WINLESS, BUT NOT FOR LACK OF 
TYING; HOCKEY: MARCHANT SCORES WITH 28 SECONDS TO PLAY FOR 3-3 DRAW WITH 
CANADA. MEDAL-ROUND BERTH LOOKS MORE SECURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By taking a slash on the foot Thursday, Brian Rolston kept the U.S. Olympic 
hockey team from taking one on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a power play in the final minute when Canadian wing Fabian Joseph 
chopped Rolston's leg, the United States rallied for its third consecutive tie 
of the Winter Games and continued sidestepping toward the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Garth Snow was pulled for an extra skater with 47 seconds to go, 
and when Joseph was penalized five seconds later, the United States had a 
two-man advantage. Todd Marchant ripped a low wrist shot past Corey Hirsch with 
28 seconds to play, producing a 3-3 draw that leaves the Americans undefeated 
-- but also winless. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take one for the team. Anything for the team," said Rolston, who scored 
the first two U.S. goals. "I was hurt. I don't even want the doctor to look at 
my foot. But I can just suck it up and throw on my skates tomorrow. I made a 
sacrifice, but I think the whole team made a sacrifice tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Tim Taylor: "I didn't think I could get any grayer, but I did 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching opponents take two penalty shots against you will do that. The first 
was awarded to Petr Nedved at 12:09 of the second period when referee Bjorn 
Johansson ruled that Snow had thrown his stick at the puck to prevent Nedved 
from finishing off a three-on-two rush. Nedved slipped a backhander past Snow 
to tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't throw it, but my stick left my hand and it touched the puck, so 
that's the call," Snow said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow repelled the second penalty shot, awarded to Greg Johnson at 12:11 of the 
third period after he broke in on the net and was dragged down by Marchant. 
That prevented Canada from increasing its 3-2 lead. "I've never seen anything 
as bizarre as two penalty shots in one game," Marchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bizarre? Consider that the United States has delayed its rallies later and 
later in each game. In Sunday's tournament-opening tie with France, 6:02 
remained, and Tuesday's tie with Slovakia was forged with 4:01 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there's doubt if you can pull it out. You have to think to yourself, 
'Are we going to be able to do it again?' " U.S. captain Peter Laviolette said. 
"All you can do is ask every guy in the locker room to play as hard as he can 
until the final whistle is blown, and every guy here has done that.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on teams as young as this one that, if they were down a goal or two 
in the third period, packed it in. This team hasn't done that." 
</P>
<P>
 More of the bizarre? Consider that Snow made 29 saves, including a quick glove 
grab of Jean Yves Roy's backhander off a two-on-one break with 2:02 to play, 
but he won't start Saturday's game against Sweden (2-0-1). Although Taylor said 
before the tournament that he would stay with a hot goalie, he now plans to go 
back to Game 1 goalie Mike Dunham, based on Dunham's past success against 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Including its final two pre-Olympic contests, the United States has played 
five consecutive ties and hasn't won since defeating Sweden, 3-0, on Feb. 4 at 
Rouen, France. Still, the Americans are reasonably sure of gaining a berth in 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played suspect the first two games and I think we played all 
right tonight," Rolston said. "We still can play better and hopefully we'll be 
playing better as the tournament goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 They played well in stretches Thursday, killing four penalties in the first 
period and overcoming a 1-0 lead Canada had built on Dwayne Norris' rising 
backhander at 4:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolston ignited the U.S. offense 66 seconds into the second period when he 
flicked a wrist shot past Hirsch from the right circle, and he gave the United 
States a 2-1 lead at 9:43 off a 20-footer from the left side of the slot during 
a five-on-three power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedved's penalty shot brought Canada even, and Norris gave the Canadians a 3-2 
edge at 1:16 of the third period with a 30-foot blast past Snow's right arm. 
That held up until Marchant's desperate effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed because we feel we should have had a victory and because 
it came in the dying seconds," Norris said after Canada (2-0-1) dropped into a 
tie with Sweden for the Group B lead. "It keeps us without a loss, but it keeps 
them without a win. Still, we get the one point, which is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the United States tie every game and get to the medal round? It's 
conceivable, as long as Italy (0-3) continues to lose and France loses to 
Slovakia. But it's hardly desirable -- especially because a fourth-place finish 
would create a matchup against Finland (3-0), the Group A leader.  
</P>
<P>
 "We set goals for our team, the first of which was to get to the medal round," 
Taylor said. "But we also want to do it in the best fashion so we get the best 
draw. I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet. I think our team came to life a 
little bit today. I know the players feel a little better about themselves 
after today's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marchant: "Whenever you come back and you tie them, you feel as though 
you won the game. When they come back and tie you, it's different. Our spirits 
were really high in the locker room, because this proves we're not going to 
quit, no matter what the score is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's other games, Sweden clinched a medal-round berth with a 7-1 
victory over France (0-2-1), and Slovakia (1-0-2) scored a 10-4 decision over 
Italy (0-3).

FRASER DIES: FIRST U.S. SKIER TO WIN GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gretchen Fraser, the first American to win an Olympic gold medal for skiing, 
died Thursday of natural causes. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Sun Valley Co., said Fraser died at the Wood River 
Medical Center after being taken there late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser won the gold medal at the 1948 games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in 
what is known today as the giant slalom. She also took the silver medal in the 
combined slalom and downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 She had lived in Sun Valley with her husband Don Fraser, who was a member of 
the U.S. Alpine team in 1936 and won a gold medal in the Pan-Am games in Chile 
that year. Don Fraser died 13 months ago. He was 80.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; GOLDEN MOMENTS NOT NEW TO THEM; 
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING: PAST OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS DAEHLIE AND EGOROVA ADD TO THE 
HAUL IN NORWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A couple of express trains stayed right on schedule Thursday in Olympic 
cross-country skiing, one Norwegian, the other Russian. And in Norway's case, a 
switch engine was doing the hauling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorn Daehlie, winner of three gold medals and a silver in the 1992 
Albertville Games, and a silver in the 30-kilometer freestyle Monday, earned 
his first gold before the home folks, winning the men's 10-kilometer classical 
race in something of an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian skiers have won three of the six men's cross-country medals that 
have been awarded and figure to win a few more. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lyubov Egorova, winner of three gold medals and two silvers in '92, won 
her second consecutive gold -- and third medal here -- in the women's 
10-kilometer freestyle pursuit race. With her eight medals, Egorova is two shy 
of the Winter Games record. Raisa Smetanina, another Russian cross-country 
skier, won 10 in five Olympic appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie, who has a habit of fading in the sprints, hung in this time, beating 
not only highly regarded teammates Sture Sivertsen, the world champion at the 
distance, and Vegard Ulvang, the '92 gold medalist, but the best of the rest of 
the world as well. 
</P>
<P>
 His all-out finish -- he collapsed in a heap after crossing the line -- moved 
Daehlie into the lead. Then he watched nervously as first Marco Albarello of 
Italy, then Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan, came up short. Daehlie finally 
relaxed when Ulvang came into view with no chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie's time, 24 minutes 20.1 seconds, was more than 18 seconds better than 
silver medalist Smirnov's 24:38.3. Albarello was third in 24:42.3. Sivertsen 
was fifth, Ulvang seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had problems with the 10 kilometers, starting too hard and always being 
very tired at the end," Daehlie said. "Today, I felt I was going really fast, 
and I expected to be tired. But the last two kilometers, I thought it would be 
between Vladimir and me, and I knew I would really have to push myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic. With all the Norwegians here (probably more than 50,000 at 
the race), this is a big moment for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Egorova continued her ongoing duel with Manuela Di Centa of Italy. They had 
swapped first and second places in the first two races, Di Centa beating 
Egorova in Sunday's 15-kilometer freestyle event, then Egorova beating Di Centa 
in the five-kilometer classical event Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The times in Tuesday's race established the starting intervals for Thursday's 
pursuit race, Egorova starting first with a 19-second advantage over the 
second-starting Di Centa. It was then up to Di Centa, and the rest of the 
field, to catch Egorova.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Di Centa and bronze medalist Stefania Belmondo, also of Italy, skied the 
10k faster than Egorova, but couldn't catch her because of the differences she 
had established in the earlier race. 
</P>
<P>
 Egorova finished Thursday's race in 27:30.1 for a two-race time of 41:38.9. Di 
Centa had times of 27:18.4 and 41:46.7, and Belmondo, fastest in the 10k at 
27:17.1, totaled 42:21.1. 
</P>

 "I was worried when I looked over my shoulder and saw (Di Centa and Belmondo) 
coming, but I thought I could hold my rhythm," Egorova said.

 Slovakian center Peter Stastny planned to apologize to U.S. wing Craig Johnson 
for chipping two of Johnson's bottom teeth in the teams' 3-3 tie Tuesday. 
Johnson's damaged teeth were replaced by a dentist in the Olympic Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was touched when I read (that Johnson idolized him) and I'm going to give 
him a stick from that game, signed, and dedicate it to him," Stastny said. "It 
was so much accidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Stastny, captain of his team in its Olympic debut, recorded another first 
Thursday when he collected two goals and an assist in a 10-4 romp over Italy. 
That gave Slovakia its first victory after two ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel blessed to be here," Stastny said. "There are so many first things, so 
many historic things." 
</P>
<P>
 Stastny, who spent most of his career with the Quebec Nordiques, faces another 
historic moment Saturday when Slovakia meets Canada. "I have so many friends in 
Canada and Quebec," he said. "My kids are Canadian, but I hope they cheer for 
Slovakia. I hope they're behind daddy."

 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman met with officials of the International Olympic 
Committee and International Ice Hockey Federation to discuss making "dream 
teams" a reality in the 1998 Winter Games at Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first step is logistics -- can this be done?" Bettman said. "We're going 
to explore the options and see which, if any, makes sense. But I'm very 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Any solution is likely to involve condensing the tournament because NHL owners 
are unwilling to suspend operations for the three weeks now required for 
practice and tournament play. Under one proposal, the major hockey nations 
would automatically qualify for the Games. Then the remaining countries would 
have to earns berths through a qualifying tournament held during the first week 
of the Olympics, with the top two teams advancing to face the teams composed of 
NHL players. HELENE ELLIOTT

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; THIS DION IS PRIME 
TIME IN CRASHING EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dion Rich made it to Norway. He made it to Lillehammer. He made it to the 
opening ceremony of the XVII Winter Olympics. And he made it to The Times 
office in the main press center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Pretender has done it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich is the San Diego gadfly who gets his kicks crashing major events, most 
notably the Super Bowl. His proudest possession is a photo of former Dallas 
Coach Tom Landry being carried off the field after Super Bowl XII by Cowboy 
players and -- ta-da! -- Dion Rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich didn't make the sideline at the Super Bowl last month at Atlanta -- NFL 
security-types know him too well now, he said -- but he was able to crash 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's party the Friday before the game. That, though, 
is no test for him, because it is a gathering of several thousand merry-makers 
and security is not particularly tight. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPC here, as the main press center is called, is quite another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 If you recall what airport security was like during the Persian Gulf War, you 
have some idea of what people have to go through to get in here. Everybody 
wears a laminated credential, complete with photo, affiliation, signature and a 
bar code that is scanned every time through the doors. Briefcases, camera 
cases, backpacks and coats are radar-scanned. And even before you get that far, 
you have to have the right credential to get past the guard hut out front. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncredentialed have no chance of getting in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's my credential," he said, flashing a sweater proclaiming, "Lillehammer 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did he make it into the MPC? 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited out there (at the guard hut) until there was a crowd. Then I went 
around the (traffic-control arm) and just walked in. When I got inside, it got 
tough. Security asked for my credential and I told them I had to pick it up 
here. They didn't buy that and told me I had to go over to (the accreditation 
office). 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went out and started walking around the building, trying every door I 
came to. When I came to one that said staff only, I walked in. And here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich had warmed up for that by crashing the opening ceremony, although he had 
bought a ticket, just to be on the safe side. He showed reporters his ticket, 
though, complete with stub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody asked me for it," he said. "I just walked in." 
</P>
<P>
 Dion Rich does that a lot.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; NOTEBOOK; MUCH LIKE JANSEN, GERMAN CHAMPION 
SUCCUMBS WITH FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't happen only to Dan Jansen. 
</P>
<P>
 World champion Gunda Niemann of Germany skated over a plastic lane marker in 
the women's 3,000-meter speedskating race Thursday at Hamar and fell, missing a 
chance to repeat as Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Jansen, the top men's sprinter, fell twice in his specialties at 
Calgary in 1988, then slipped again Monday in the men's 500, which he might 
well have won otherwise. Instead, Russian Aleksandr Golubev finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Russian, Svetlana Bazhanova, took advantage of Niemann's misfortune 
and won in 4 minutes 17.43 seconds, nearly seven seconds behind Niemann's world 
record. Emese Hunyady of Austria was second and Claudia Pechstein, Niemann's 
teammate, third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock," Niemann said, crying. "But in this sport this can happen any 
day. I'm just happy to be alive. I'm a good fighter and I'll try to overcome 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fall was nasty, taking out Seiko Hashimoto of Japan, too, as Niemann slid 
across both the inside and outside lanes. Niemann got up and finished the race, 
almost a minute off her record time, but was disqualified for being in the 
wrong lane. Hashimoto later was given a re-skate and finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 German coaches protested the placement of the lane markers, but judges looked 
at videotapes and rejected the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian skier Bjorn Daehlie, who defeated Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan in 
the men's 10-kilometer classical cross-country ski race, later served cherry 
brandy to the Norwegian press, saying: "It contains no Smirnov." 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie said the brandy was made from cherries picked by him and his father at 
his home in Nannestead, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been developed in various ways, and I do not recommend it to 
athletes," Daehlie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just shows what he thinks of newspapermen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't athletes want to have fun? 
</P>
<P>
 Off-hours activities in the Olympic villages have been canceled for lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a pity that the athletes aren't taking the chance to see more of the 
surrounding country," said Gerd-Helen Kvamme, marketing consultant for the 
company in charge of the athletes' activities. "I believe their stay in Norway 
would leave a more lasting impression if they would only try a sleigh ride or a 
trip behind the dog sledge while they are here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lillehammer police are jailing Olympic tourists regularly -- giving them a 
place to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Rigmor Saether said she did not want the police station to become just 
another cheap hotel but added that those without lodging would not be turned 
away, as long as there is room. MIKE KUPPER

 About the time they hung another medal around Tommy Moe's neck, teammate AJ 
Kitt was packing for home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt's work is done in Lillehammer and he will return home today to Rochester, 
N.Y., where he plans to rest before the resumption of the World Cup circuit, 
which moves to North America after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt, before Moe's burst of fame, was America's most famous downhill racer. 
But he finished 17th in Sunday's downhill and went off course in the 
super-giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was just as well: "Better than being fourth or fifth." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt didn't even have a mountain to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very suited to me," he said of the Kvitfjell course. "Guys are just 
skiing better than me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt has never known Olympic glory. He finished ninth in the 1992 Olympic 
downhill at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 He can, however, speak of Moe's streak. Kitt, 25, has been that hot before, 
though not with so much at stake. Moe has never won a World Cup downhill. Kitt 
has. And Kitt, in '92, finished second at Kitzbuhel, Austria, the Indy 500 of 
downhills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you've got a shot every time you put the skis on," Kitt said of what 
Moe is feeling. "It's just being in a groove, being confident, being in tune 
with your skis. It's hard to explain. I wish I would have written ideas down 
when I was in the groove, maybe it would be easier to find it again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who was Kyle Rasmussen kidding? 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his line on the super-G course, the American skied between the 
two poles of a slalom gate, disqualifying himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that he kept on skiing straight through to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'Maybe nobody noticed,' " Rasmussen said. "And then it 
was like, 'Yeah, right, this is the Olympics.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's girlfriend, Megan Gerety of the U.S. women's Alpine team, did not see 
his silver-medal run. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerety, who had flu, decided to watch the super-G from the Olympic village. 
When she couldn't get the race on television, she took the first bus to 
Kvitfjell, but arrived too late. She was on the chairlift as Moe raced. CHRIS

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; MOTIVATION NO PROBLEM FOR CARBAJAL, GONZALEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two fighters, a combined 216 pounds, two motivations. 
</P>
<P>
 They will meet in the ring Saturday night at the Forum, but Michael Carbajal, 
the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council light-flyweight 
champion, and Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez have had other struggles to face. 
Other fights. A MURDER IN THE YARD 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Michael and Danny Carbajal grew up in the gang-infested Ninth Street 
neighborhood of Phoenix, where they have chosen to remain and be symbols of 
hope, not leave and be another sign of the area's hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Last New Year's Eve, however, two people celebrating outside the Carbajals' 
two houses got into a fight. One man won, the other scrambled away and got a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Mark Smith, a friend of both Carbajal brothers, was shot dead. Michael 
Celaya has been charged with the shooting and is in jail awaiting a hearing on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just two guys that got into a fight, one couldn't handle getting his 
butt whipped, came back and shot him -- and that was it," says Michael 
Carbajal, who was in the area when it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But this, the Carbajals said, has in no way changed their desire to stay in 
the neighborhood in which they grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has ever made me think about leaving," says Danny Carbajal, Michael's 
trainer. "It could've happened anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And the brothers chafe at suggestions that the killing was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the question that comes to everyone's mind," Danny Carbajal says. 
"Gangs. It had nothing to do with gangs. Nothing. It was stupid, that's what it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Since knocking out Gonzalez in their famous March 13, 1993 fight, Carbajal has 
suffered a few tragedies. In August, he lost his father Manuel to a heart 
attack. Now, he has dedicated Saturday night's fight to the man he knew as 
'Smitty.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good friend of the family," Carbajal says of Mark Smith. "It's 
something I wanted to do to show him the support that I feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very strong and I put things behind. I'm very focused on this fight and I 
look forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Carbajal says there is nothing they can do to try to prevent a repeat of 
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do? Everybody walk around with a metal detector or 
something? Somebody in here has a gun I guarantee you," Carbajal says, 
gesturing around a filled hotel ballroom during an interview. "I'll bet you. 
It's everywhere." PRIDE, POISE AND A PROMISE 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Gonzalez, the former two-time WBC light-flyweight champion, about his 
conditioning, and he immediately peels off his shirt and flexes his arms. "I 
have never been like this before," he says, pointing to his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 No flab, only a flat-voiced prediction: "I think I will win this fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who says he had to lose five pounds the day before the first fight 
and therefore wearied in the late-going of Carbajal's seventh-round knockout, 
was reported to weigh 109 before his workout Thursday, one pound over the 
light-flyweight limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The official weigh-in is tonight at 8. It was originally scheduled for earlier 
in the day, but the Carbajals apparently insisted that it be moved closer to 
the fight to make recovery from any weight loss more difficult for Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is not thinking so much about weight loss as he is about redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize I have a lot of pride," Gonzalez says through a translator. "I 
have been thinking and working to beat him. I must do this. And I recognize I 
have to control it -- because too much can be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 His new trainer, Ignacio Beristain, warns Gonzalez about being too consumed by 
revenge to fight smartly. 
</P>
<P>
 "His motivation always goes with the importance of the event and the quality 
of the opponent," Beristain says. "Now he is very high. Too motivated. There's 
a lot of motivation for this fight. And there is a dangerous situation. That's 
what worries me." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last two fights since the Carbajal knockout, Gonzalez scored easy 
decision victories, scoring huge point-advantages against journeymen fighters 
with a clever outside game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are planning to work this fight with a plan," says Beristain, who concedes 
that they cannot face Carbajal as if he were simply another journeyman. "I want 
(Gonzalez) to be motivated, but I want him to be cool. He desires too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to have revenge. And that cannot be the case. I need to tell him you 
need to win. Decision, knockout, whatever. Don't try to take revenge. Just win 
the title again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That worries me. He might lose his head and go aiiiiyyy!. He is too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, though, has found motivation in many places, including the recent 
defeat of his good friend, Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that when Julio sees that I've won, he will be motivated," Gonzalez 
says. "And I am also motivated because he lost. Because both of us have to 
prove we can come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the same kind of determination that I felt when I went for the title 
for the first time. That was a long time ago in Korea (against Yul-Woo Lee in 
1989)." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The State Athletic Commission has appointed two California referees to handle 
Saturday night's title fights. Veteran Lou Filippo will referee the Michael 
Carbajal-Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez bout, and Robert Byrd will work the 
Freddie Pendleton-Rafael Ruelas International Boxing Federation lightweight 
title match. . . . Carbajal is scheduled to receive a purse of $500,000 for the 
fight, plus a percentage of the pay-per-view gross guaranteed to be at least 
$500,000. The $1-million package is believed to be the first time anybody in a 
weight class lower than 130 pounds has broken into seven figures for one fight. 
"I'm very honored that we're making the kind of money that we are," Carbajal 
said. "I'm honored that I'm the one that opened the division up." Carbajal 
received a total of $500,000 for the first Gonzalez fight. Gonzalez is set to 
receive a purse of $250,000 plus a share of the Mexican television money that 
should add another $200,000 to his take. Gonzalez received $300,000 for the 
first fight. 
</P>
<P>
 After two screaming-match, conference-call showdowns, Pendleton and Ruelas 
kept their arguing to a minimum at Thursday's news conference, and Pendleton 
called Ruelas a "bum" only once. Ruelas reiterated his claim that Pendleton 
only took the fight because Ruelas' mandatory challenge rights as the IBF No. 1 
contender had come due. "I'm tired of talking," Pendleton said. "He's a serious 
challenge, of course. But in my estimation, he shouldn't be the No. 1 
contender. I've seen him fight. But since he has achieved that status, he will 
get knocked out Saturday night." . . . Jorge Paez, scheduled to face Andres 
Sandoval in a 10-round lightweight bout on the undercard, said he is looking 
forward to a possible big-money fight against Oscar De La Hoya. . . . Canadian 
flyweight Scotty Olson used his time on the podium to campaign for the next 
fight against Carbajal. "I've been Carbajal's greatest fan, crossing my fingers 
every time he steps in the ring, hoping that nobody beats him until I have the 
opportunity of fighting him." Olson will fight Jorge Roman on the first fight 
of the pay-per-view portion of the card. . . . Promoter Bob Arum said the PPV 
purchase rate is running about three times the volume of the first 
Carbajal-Gonzalez fight, which had 125,000 subscribers. . . . The Forum expects 
a crowd of about 12,000 to 14,000, which would be the largest since Jerry Buss 
took over the Forum fights in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 All signs are pointing toward a Michael Bentt-Riddick Bowe fight sometime in 
the early summer, assuming that the Bowe camp can extricate itself from the 
agreement to fight Francois Botha. Bowe's Feb. 5 bout against Botha was 
scrapped when Bowe suffered a cut in training. Bentt, the World Boxing 
Organization heavyweight champion, will fight Henry Hide in London in March. . 
. . Buddy Ryan, a noted dabbler in the sweet science, is set to present the 
"fighter-of-the-year" ESPY award at the ESPN presentation on Feb. 28 in New 
York.

FOOTBALL RETURNS TO BALTIMORE, BUT IT'S THE CFL, NOT THE NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On his 35th birthday, Jim Speros gave Baltimore a long-awaited gift -- a pro 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Football League Commissioner Larry Smith on Thursday formally 
introduced Baltimore as the league's 11th franchise.Speros, who worked nearly a 
year to land the team, finally saw his effort reach fruition in a ceremony 
attended by Smith, several CFL team owners and two of the league's biggest 
names, quarterbacks David Archer and Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which cost Speros $3 million, will begin its training camp under 
Coach Don Matthews in June and open its inaugural season in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the league hopes to add another team from the United States in time 
for the 1994 season and ultimately expects the league to have two divisions -- 
one consisting of teams from the United States and another of teams from 
Canada. The league has three U.S. franchises -- Sacramento, Las Vegas and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Baltimore are still trying to lure an NFL franchise and have 
spoken with the Raiders and Rams, among others.

MCSORLEY IS ALREADY READY TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Forum was empty Thursday afternoon except for a handful of reporters at 
defenseman Marty McSorley's welcome-back news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when McSorley put on the silver and black uniform for the first time in 
eight months and stepped back on the Forum ice to practice before the empty 
stands, he said: "It got my blood boiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what he'll feel tonight when one of the most popular Kings faces an 
expected sellout crowd of 16,005 as well as the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins to bring McSorley back, along with 
defenseman Jim Paek, for forwards Tomas Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern, occurred 
Tuesday after only three or four days of talks, according to King owner Bruce 
McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley will receive the same $1.8-million annual salary he was getting from 
the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aspects of his five-year, $10-million deal have been adjusted, according 
to McNall, to add marketing provisions and performance bonuses. But the total 
package has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, brought back as much for his leadership as for his defense, said 
he'll start off low-key. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say, 'I'm here. I'm a leader. You've got to listen to me,' " 
he said. "I'm not going to come in here and say a lot. It's best said on the 
ice." STEVE SPRINGER

THE MAN OF THE 'MOON'; DREAM-MAKER HENRY MANCINI THINKS THAT HE MAY INDEED BE A 
SONGWRITER 
</P>

 Here's a puzzler: For years, long after he'd knocked out such evergreens as 
"Moon River," "The Days of Wine and Roses," "Mr. Lucky" and "Charade," Henry 
Mancini didn't consider himself a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The prolific 69-year-old -- who has written hundreds of songs, scored more 
than 70 films, recorded 80 albums and been awarded four Oscars and 20 Grammys 
-- says: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I've ever written a song that wasn't on assignment . All the 
things that were successful were title or love themes from films. I've never 
gone to a singer with a song and said 'why don't you try this?' or tried to get 
a record like that. My head just wasn't there. I was always trying to be a 
quote, unquote, film composer." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, due perhaps to the sheer aesthetic weight of the tunes he has 
produced, he is finally relenting. "I guess I am getting to be a songwriter in 
my old age," he said during a recent interview -- even though he's still doing 
program music. He was on the phone from Gstaad, Switzerland, where he is 
working on a theatrical adaptation of his music from "Victor/Victoria." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini -- a Cleveland native who was raised in the small enclave of West 
Aliquippa, Pa. -- appears tonight and Saturday with the Pacific Symphony at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa as part of the orchestra's 
pops series. 
</P>
<P>
 The program consists of familiar Mancini pieces and some works from his most 
recent film, 1993's "Tom and Jerry"; there will also be a medley of tunes 
associated with Fred Astaire. Mancini will conduct the orchestra at some points 
and will play piano at others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play citified Count Basie piano," the Juilliard-trained musician said, 
tounge-in-cheek. "As few notes as possible, my left hand in my pocket, that 
kind of stuff." It's hard to have a conversation with Mancini and not bring up 
"Moon River," first heard in the 1961 Blake Edwards film "Breakfast at 
Tiffany's," sung in a whisper by Audrey Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 The number, with lyrics by the nonpareil Johnny Mercer ("Satin Doll," "Autumn 
Leaves" and hundreds of others), won a best song Oscar. Mercer and Mancini got 
another the next year for "The Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini says the great thing about "Moon River" was that it brought him 
together with Mercer. "He thought the tune was pretty, a nice little waltz, 
having no idea what would happen," Mancini recalled, referring to the song's 
blockbuster success (in addition to the Oscar, it won 1961 Grammys for record 
of the year and song of the year, and has been recorded more than 1,000 times.) 
"It spawned that nice run I had with Johnny, being in that class for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his autobiography ("Did They Mention the Music?," written with Gene Lees 
and published in 1989 by Contemporary Books), Mancini says he spent a month 
thinking about the "Moon River" tune and then wrote it in half an hour. "It's 
simple," he said. "In the key of C. You can play it all on the white keys." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that a lot of his songs have come quickly, and he says part of the 
reason is his heritage. "Being Italian didn't hurt. I grew up hearing that kind 
of melody all over. I heard it when I played piccolo in the Sons of Italy 
marching bands, playing those warhorses like selections from Verdi's 'Aida.' I 
guess it rubbed off." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite composition, he said, is his theme from Stanley Donen's 1967 film 
"Two for the Road." "A lot of jazz people have picked up on that one. I like it 
because they liked it," he said with a laugh. "It kind of starts out of 
nowhere, and then takes off from there -- a stream of consciousness piece that 
doesn't remind me of anything I've heard before." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Two for the Road" Mancini was teamed with English lyricist Leslie 
Bricusse ("What Kind of Fool Am I?," "If I Ruled the World"). They worked 
together again in 1981 on Edwards' film "Victor/Victoria," winning Mancini yet 
another Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now collaborating (after doing five tunes for "Tom and Jerry") on 18 
songs for the stage production of "Victor/Victoria," to be directed by Edwards 
and slated to open on Broadway in the fall with Julie Andrews reprising her 
leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration is a major challenge, says Mancini, noting that he hasn't 
done music for live theater before. "It's not easy. Broadway is intimidating. 
Don't think it's not. I'm learning, building on my old bones." 
</P>
<P>
 * Henry Mancini plays with the Pacific Symphony tonight and Saturday night at 
8 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. $22-$50. (714) 556-2787.

SYRACUSE'S MCCORKLE FINDS A COMFORT ZONE; BASKETBALL: EX-CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
STANDOUT, SLOWED BY INJURIES, NOW AT EASE WITH ORANGEMEN AND HIS DAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a special basketball game for Scott McCorkle, a bright moment in what 
had been a star-crossed career at Syracuse. All the injuries, the time on the 
bench and the frustration seemed to fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 He was having a superb game against Pittsburgh last month -- hitting jumpers, 
diving for loose balls and banging inside. It would be a 13-point, six-rebound 
night, with a couple of blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sideline and, over the air, ESPN analyst Dick Vitale was straining 
those overzealous vocal chords every time McCorkle did something. "It may be 
freezing outside, but he's on fire . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't why McCorkle's emotions soared to the top of the Carrier Dome 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that game is a blank to McCorkle. What comes to mind was his father, 
who was in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked him out before the game," McCorkle said. "Every time I did 
something, I looked up in the stands. He was clapping, smiling, just having a 
really good time." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Ray Lundeen, McCorkle's father, had seen his son play at 
Syracuse. McCorkle would score a basket, then point to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having him there, seeing his approval, meant so much to me," McCorkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle, a 6-foot-5 senior forward, has tried to cram four years of 
basketball into one season. Injuries, almost too numerous to recall, had slowed 
him throughout his career, so this was his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 This season has gone well. There was that broken nose during practice in 
November, but that was minor. McCorkle has found his niche with the Orangemen. 
He is averaging 7.1 points and 3.6 rebounds as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are hardly the type of numbers that made him a two-time All-Orange 
County selection at Capistrano Valley High School, but he is comfortable with 
his role. What he wasn't comfortable with was his relationship with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle's parents divorced when he was 6, and his mother remarried. McCorkle 
had a good relationship with his stepfather, Doug McCorkle. Their family was 
typical of many in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle would visit his father, who lives in Seattle, during the summer, and 
Lundeen made it to California for a few of his son's high school games. But 
McCorkle always sensed some tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was always a little embarrassed that I didn't have his last name," 
McCorkle said. "My mom had enrolled me as 'McCorkle,' when I started school. I 
think my father was a little disheartened about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Valarie McCorkle, his mother, said that, with six kids in the family, it was 
easier socially to use one last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were things I don't want to talk about, family issues," Lundeen said. 
"The name was part of it. But part of it was I didn't have a opportunity to get 
down there." 
</P>
<P>
 A gap existed, according to McCorkle, until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle re-established their relationship as a freshman. He began writing 
letters, at his grandmother's urging, which opened the lines of communication. 
Lundeen, who works in marketing, occasionally visited his son at Syracuse while 
on business trips to New York. But he had never seen him play, except on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, I would invite him to a game," McCorkle. "The beginning of each 
season, I'd send him a schedule. But he was always busy." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Lundeen made the time. He spent five days in Syracuse and went to 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some great long talks," Lundeen said. "It was the first time we'd been 
able to sit down like that in years. We were buddies." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCorkle: "We had a lot of catching up to do, even why I went by McCorkle 
instead of Lundeen. I think he understands that now. Basically, I was able to 
tell him what I've been through." 
</P>
<P>
 That must have taken some time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle has suffered through one setback after another. He has had a broken 
thumb, a bruised back, the broken nose and assorted cuts that required 
stitches. He also suffered through a bout of pneumonia as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly the list of accomplishments McCorkle had hoped to have by his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle saw some quality time as a freshman. He had two big games against 
Connecticut, scoring 13 and 12 points. He also hurt his back in one game and 
needed stitches to sew up a gash caused by an opponent's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But those things just seemed to happen to McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was on a first-name basis with the people who worked in the 
emergency room when Scott was growing up," Valarie McCorkle said. "He had a lot 
of stitches over the years, but nothing serious." 
</P>
<P>
 It got serious when McCorkle was a sophomore. He was about to score on a 
break-away against Lafayette when he was tackled from behind and suffered a 
broken thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat and watched my thumb grow right there," McCorkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim: "It was a criminal-type play. Just criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle missed four weeks. By the time he returned, freshman Lawrence Moten 
had established himself at small forward. Moten was named rookie of the year in 
the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't go much better for McCorkle the following season. A series of 
injuries limited his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott's been hurt a lot," Boeheim said. "He's just a physical player, and 
he's not very bashful about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCorkle: "The guys tease me a lot about all the injuries. When I get 
hurt, they'd ask me if I was going around looking for accidents. It's kind of 
my trademark. This year, I was going to stay healthy. This year, I was going to 
get playing time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCorkle has gotten the time and made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored a career-high 18 points against Villanova. He has scored in double 
figures in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the Pittsburgh game that stays with him. He said it was the most fun 
he'd had in game since high school. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, after scoring on a rebound and then forcing a turnover, McCorkle 
ran toward Vitale on the sideline and shouted, "Oh, baby, give me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vitale: "He's got the three E's. He's exciting, he has energy and he has 
enthusiasm . . . don't worry Scotty, we're giving you some PR."  
</P>
<P>
 But McCorkle didn't need the publicity. He had his audience in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a jumper from the side, then circled up court and pointed at me," 
Lundeen said. "The people around me picked up on that. They asked me, 'Do you 
know him?' I said, 'Yeah, that's my son.' "

MIKE PENNER: CYPRESS' JOHNSON IS FIRST ON THE LIST OF WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in his career as a basketball coach, in order to bring some order to his 
chaotic world of missed jump shots and out-of-bounds bounce passes, Don Johnson 
became a list freak. To this day, he remains an incorrigible compiler, a 
chronic chronicler, an inveterate indexer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he may roam, Johnson leaves behind a paper trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of plays to run in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of points to make in his pregame pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of things to do before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of things to do after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of his lists. And lists of those lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in his career as a basketball coach, Johnson has put together a few more 
items and put them down on paper. The other day, off the top of his head, he 
ticked them off: 
</P>
<P>
 "Landscaping. Gardening. Playing golf. Playing tennis. Walking the dog. 
Traveling. Playing with the grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
 Things to do in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly impressive list," Johnson says. He shakes his head and smiles. 
"But I don't necessarily equate keeping busy with retaining one's feeling of 
self-worth." 
</P>
<P>
 After 27 years of overseeing one of the country's most successful community 
college basketball programs at Cypress College, Don Johnson is retiring. Or 
attempting to. He tried this once before, in 1971, when doctors told him to 
quit for his health, because Johnson "was fairly close to a nervous breakdown," 
and retirement barely made it to the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife, Colette, and I went to (Cypress') first game that year," Johnson 
recalls, "and at halftime, I looked over to my wife and she was crying. I said, 
'Colette, why are you crying?' and she said, 'Those are not our kids anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the same way. I had this hollow, empty feeling. We left at halftime 
and really couldn't bear to go back very often that year." 
</P>
<P>
 By the start of the next basketball season, Johnson was back as head coach, on 
his way to a California community college-record 588 victories. Tonight, 
Johnson goes for No. 589 in Cypress' 1993-94 regular-season finale against 
Riverside Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, a good many clipboards have died for the cause of Charger 
basketball. As a form of stress management, Johnson tosses them during games, 
cracks them over his knee and slams them to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through countless," Johnson says, "definitely triple digits by now. 
I've got to average probably two or three clipboards a year." 
</P>
<P>
 After the clipboard, Johnson's folding chair was traditionally the next to 
take flight, although, since turning 60, Johnson claims to have mellowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm don't throw the chair now," he proudly reports. "I throw my coat. Which, 
I think, is showing some maturity on my part." 
</P>
<P>
 With his flinty facial features, steely eyes and salt-and-pepper mustache, 
Johnson has long borne a physical resemblance to the actor Dennis Weaver. 
Dramatically, there is a resemblance as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Weaver in "Duel," when he played a harried traveling salesman driving 
for his life with a killer 18-wheeler on his heels? 
</P>
<P>
 That was the how Johnson weathered hundreds of Cypress games -- frantic, eyes 
darting, tormented by dread, ready to melt down at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Johnson was sharing lunch with his old college coach, John 
Wooden, who told Johnson that he "always enjoyed planning practice and 
conducting practice but did not enjoy the games. That says it for me, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never enjoyed the games that much. There was always that fear of losing, 
which (Johnson grins) has guided my entire stupid life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of failure. Fear of letting people down, because you felt you were 
representing them in some way on that court. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what? The boosters here would have remained my good friends even 
if we hadn't had as many good seasons. The kids, I think, would have liked me 
even if we hadn't had this kind of success. We just get too caught up in 
winning in our society, I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the games, by and large, were good to Johnson. With them, he won State 
championships in 1977 and 1980, the latter requiring a monumental semifinal 
upset over Bill Mulligan's top-ranked Saddleback Gauchos, perhaps the greatest 
JC basketball team to play in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 That Saddleback team was led by Kevin Magee, a future All-American for 
Mulligan at UC Irvine. Cypress countered with gangly, awkward Mark Eaton, all 7 
feet 4 of him, who went on to amazing wealth with the NBA's Utah Jazz but could 
barely jump over a phone book in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson engineered a memorable victory with a defensive strategy that 
consisted basically of stationing Eaton in front of the basket and telling him 
to raise his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game, in my mind, was the most electrifying situation," Johnson says. 
"(Assistant coach) Jack Long and I remember, as our kids are warming up, how we 
couldn't even feel our feet on the ground. Literally, we were on a euphoric 
high. That stands out as the biggest game we've played here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton and Swen Nater are Johnson's legacy -- two raw seven-footers, with 
little or no basketball credentials before Cypress, who spent two years with 
Johnson and went on to lucrative careers in the NBA. Subsequently, Johnson and 
Cypress gained a reputation as an elite reclamation center for uncoordinated 
large fellows who can't keep from tripping over their shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people think that," Johnson says, "and I kind of wish it weren't so. I 
get a lot of satisfaction from the fact Swen and Mark went on and did so well 
and they are really nice, great human beings. But I wish Cypress didn't have 
the reputation of cultivating only the big guys. I think we've had a lot of 
success developing players of all levels and all positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson recites the names, reluctantly at first, because "I know I'll leave 
out three dozen really, really good players." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Quinn, Tyrone Branyan, Ron Davis, Eric Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kenney, David Baker, Dave Shutts, John Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott McIver, Alan Bruce, Stan Davis, Jud Beardsley, Paul Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven years. A lot of names. Johnson could go on, but he's got a game 
to coach this night, at Fullerton, and as usual, Johnson is fretting about it. 
</P>
<P>
 No way we can win it, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be the best Fullerton team I've seen in 27 years, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll probably get hammered, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Final score: Cypress 82, Fullerton 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another in a long list.

TITANS HIT THEIR STRIDE, AND UPSET UNLV; BASKETBALL: LAST-PLACE FULLERTON 
SUCCESSFULLY HOLDS OFF REBEL RUNS IN 84-75 VICTORY AT LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Danny Robinson's miracle, a 94-foot swish that came a split second after the 
halftime buzzer sounded and didn't count, likely will earn him air time on 
sports highlight shows across the nation today. 
</P>
<P>
 But his clutch three-pointer from a mere 21 feet with 2 minutes 24 seconds 
left did count, and though it won't make ESPN's SportsCenter, it was the shot 
that helped push last-place Fullerton to an 84-75 upset of Nevada Las Vegas in 
front of 4,204 Thursday night at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's three-pointer gave Fullerton a 68-61 lead, which the Titans (6-16, 
4-10 in the Big West Conference) held on the strength of Greg Vernon's 
outstanding play in the final 2:03. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon made seven of eight free throws and one field goal down the stretch to 
hold off the Rebels (10-11, 6-7) and lead the Titans to their first victory in 
the Thomas & Mack Center and first victory in Las Vegas. Fullerton was 0-10 in 
this building entering the game and now trails the series with UNLV, 30-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this team comes together and hits on all cylinders, we can compete with 
anyone in the conference," said Titan Coach Brad Holland, who had the flu. "It 
was a total team effort. Right now I'm running on adrenaline. I don't even feel 
like I have the flu." 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV led, 34-32, at halftime, but Fullerton opened the second half with nine 
consecutive points to take a 41-34 lead. The Rebels closed to within 49-48 with 
12:15 left, but never were able to take a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels did make several runs at the Titans, but Fullerton always had a 
response. With about six minutes left and Fullerton clinging to a two-point 
lead, Josh King made a tough, inside shot in traffic, and Vernon sank a three- 
pointer from the top of the key to make it 62-55 with 5:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Manuel's three-pointer cut it to 63-60 with 3:24 left, but Winston 
Peterson sank an inside shot to make it 65-60. Manuel's drive and basket and 
Dedan Thomas' steal and basket made it 70-67 with 1:32 left, and Rebel fans 
sensed a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas was whistled for a delay-of-game technical foul after his basket, 
and Vernon sank both free throws on the other end to make it 72-67. Damian 
Smith's three-pointer failed to hit the rim for UNLV, and Vernon sank another 
two free throws for a 74-67 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris St. Clair then got into the free-throw party, making two for a 
comfortable, 76-67 lead with 1:10 to play, but UNLV got no closer than six 
points in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon finished with 20 points, including 16 in the second half, King had 13 
points, and David Frigout and St. Clair each had 12 for the Titans. Vernon made 
12 of 14 free throws. Vernon missed his last three field goals as Fullerton 
blew a seven-point lead with 50 seconds left and lost in overtime to University 
of the Pacific on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't sunk in yet," Vernon said after the game. "I can't believe it. That 
was the most I've ever been focused. I remember what happened against Pacific, 
and I wasn't going to let that happen again."  
</P>
<P>
 Manuel finished with 19 points, Kebu Stewart had 15 points and 15 rebounds, 
and Thomas had 14 points and eight assists for UNLV, which shot only 40.7% from 
the field. The Titans shot 44.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson sat out the first game against UNLV -- a 77-66 loss in Titan Gym Jan. 
5 -- because of the flu.

NEW MEXICO STATE DOESN'T LET UP ON UC IRVINE; BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS' TOP FOUR 
SCORERS CONTRIBUTE ONLY 11 POINTS TO A 90-60 LOSS AT LAS CRUCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 UC Irvine hoped to carry the emotion and momentum from Saturday's runaway 
victory over Nevada into Thursday night's game against New Mexico State. Sure, 
the Aggies hadn't lost at home in almost two years, but the pumped-up Anteaters 
figured they could make it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as suspense goes, the only mystery in this one was whether crowd 
favorite Mike Schutz, a walk-on, was going to get into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State led by 28 points in the opening minutes of the second half 
and rolled to a 90-60 Big West victory over the deflated Anteaters in front of 
6,749 in the Pan American Center. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight minutes remaining, the crowd began to chant, "Shoootz, Shoootz," 
and with 3:20 left Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy walked down the bench, pointed at 
the junior from Wagon Mound, N.M., as if to say, 'You want him?' and the fans 
went into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schutz came in to hit a three-pointer and was fouled on the play. He made the 
free throw to equal his previous total point output of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were booing something," McCarthy said. "I asked what the heck 
they were booing and one of my assistants told me they were calling for Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, I would've put him in sooner if I had known that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of night for the Aggies (18-3 and 10-2 in conference). They 
shot 51% from the floor, 50% from three-point range and caused Irvine (6-15, 
3-10) to commit 21 turnovers. So their concern turned to making the 
bench-warmers and the crowd happy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got ahead and didn't let up," McCarthy said. "Our match-up zone is 
starting to really click. It's a hard defense to learn and we have eight new 
players, so it's a lot better now than it was a month ago, heck, two weeks 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State led by one, 19-18, and then went on a 24-8 tear to go ahead, 
43-26, at halftime. The Aggies made six of 12 first-half three-point attempts 
while the Anteaters managed only two of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had one field goal to show for its first 10 possessions of the second 
half and New Mexico State led, 57-29, with 14:43 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to the Irvine intensity that electrified the Anteaters during 
the 99-70 rout of Nevada? 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to bring it out again tonight, but people in hell want ice water, 
too," Coach Rod Baker said. "We just didn't compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who said "playing hard" was the difference in Saturday's victory, found 
a number of other factors involved in Thursday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their good players scored and our good players didn't," he said. "We couldn't 
do anything on the perimeter to open up the inside and we didn't do anything 
inside to open up the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had way too many needless turnovers. About the only thing we did right was 
keep them from rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's top four scorers -- guards Chris Brown and Lloyd Mumford, center 
DeForrest Boyer and forward Mark Odsather -- combined to score 11 points. 
Reserve Khalid Channell was the only Anteater in double figures with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State's top two scorers -- forwards D.J. Jackson and James Dockery 
-- combined to make 13 of 22 shots from the floor and score 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of those baskets, not the three-point swishes or the flying dunks, 
brought the roar of approval awarded Schutz, who was on his back when his 
three-pointer went in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just saw the hand in my face and hoped it went in," Schutz said softly. "It 
feels good to have them cheering for me, especially because I know we've got to 
be ahead by 25 before they start calling for me. And it feels good to get into 
a game and work up a sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 So how will the good folks of Wagon Mound, a town of about 300 on the original 
Santa Fe Trail, react when they hear of their favorite son's exploits? 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably won't get the news for two or three days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine fans probably won't be that fortunate.

RAM NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; DEFENSIVE END YOUNG GETS OFFER; TOP COMPENSATION 
ASSURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams extended an offer sheet to restricted free agent Robert Young for 
$649,000 Thursday, securing a first-round draft pick as compensation if another 
team signs him. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Feldman, Young's agent, said he expects the Rams to work out a multiyear 
contract with Young, a defensive end, "in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a number of other teams to take a look at Robert," Feldman said. 
"But giving up a No. 1 pick is something they would be leery of. The Rams have 
made it clear that he's a foundation player for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' offer to Young was nearly $500,000 more than what he made last 
season, his third in the league. It was the league minimum for securing a 
first-round pick as compensation; otherwise, losing Young would be worth a 
fifth-round pick, the round they took him in the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had seven sacks last season before missing 10 of the final 11 games 
because of a knee injury. Feldman said Thursday that Young "is completely 
rehabilitated and ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Young, the Rams extended offer sheets to their six other restricted 
free agents: cornerbacks Robert Bailey and Dexter Davis, fullback David Lang, 
linebacker Roman Phifer, defensive tackle David Rocker and offensive lineman 
Jeff Pahukoa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker, also a Feldman client, was extended an offer sheet of $298,000, the 
minimum for a restricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Player contracts expired Thursday. April 18 is the deadline for signing offer 
sheets for restricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President John Shaw said the Rams will entertain trade talks 
for quarterback Jim Everett, adding that he "definitely has market value." 
</P>
<P>
 The trading period opens today, although a source within the organization said 
the team doesn't expect to work out a deal for at least another week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading Everett is the best option, because the Rams would not only receive 
some form of compensation but also retain the "transition player" designation 
they placed on him last year. If they waive Everett, they lose the transition 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra transition designation would mean the Rams could maintain the right 
of first refusal on one of their young stars, such as Jerome Bettis, down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams must tender transition players a one-year contract at the average of the 
10 highest salaries of players at that position when their contracts expire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams did not retain the rights of rookie wide receiver Phillip Bobo, who 
was on injured reserve last season with a knee injury. The team held exclusive 
rights on Bobo.

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' SOCCER; VILLA PARK'S MENDEZ STARTS FAST, TEAMMATES 
FINISH OFF LA QUINTA

 Susan Mendez scored four consecutive goals in the first half, then took a seat 
in the second half and watched her teammates score four more as Villa Park 
defeated La Quinta, 9-0, in a Division II girls' soccer wild-card game Thursday 
at Villa Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (13-2-6) advanced to play Esperanza (15-4-1), ranked ninth in the 
county, on Saturday at Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez, who has a team-high 27 goals, did her scoring on the side of the field 
that ranged from coarse infield brick dust to ankle-deep rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this field," she said. "It's kind of different and it's fun to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't fun for the Aztecs (10-11-2), who gave up five goals in the first 
half, two of them in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kathy Petersen gave Villa Park a 1-0 lead, Mendez scored four times in 
22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two came on left-foot shots from the corner of the penalty box and 
the next two with the right foot from straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartan reserves were called in for the second half and scored four times, 
two by Meghan Reppe on headers and two by Cynthia King on breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans, who finished second in the Century League, kept the pressure on 
La Quinta the rest of the game. They have not allowed a goal in their last 
seven games. DAN ARRITT

RAIBON LEADS ST. MARGARET'S PAST VALLEY TORAH

 Damian Raibon scored 29 points, including 19 in the first half, to lead St. 
Margaret's to a 102-32 victory over Valley Torah in a first-round Division V-AA 
playoff game Thursday at St. Margaret's High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Raibon also had 12 rebounds and six blocked shots, Coach Rick Bauer 
was quick to point out after the game, "It wasn't a one-man show.Everyone 
contributed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartans (19-3) had five players score in double figures. Lupe Rodriguez 
had 14, Danny Gomez 12, David Tomlinson 11 and Bobby Baker 10. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's put away the Patriots early, outscoring them, 22-6, in the 
first quarter. Raibon, who scored 13 in the first quarter, sparked the offense 
with three slam-dunks in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to put them away early and our fast break was really clicking 
tonight," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Torah (9-7) was led by Steve Hami with 12 points. SCOTT JONES

 Angel starter Joe Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery last week, 
began working out Thursday and could start throwing lightly within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, whose surgery prompted the Angels to sign Frank Tanana to a triple-A 
contract Tuesday, said the inflammation in his elbow is completely gone.He is 
optimistic that he'll be able to rejoin the Angel rotation by the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard good things," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "and we're 
very, very encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels protected themselves by signing Tanana, the risk is 
minimal. Tanana will earn a base salary of $300,000, and will be paid $38,000 
for every game he starts beginning with his seventh. Magrane does not expect to 
miss more than four starts. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 On his 35th birthday, Jim Speros gave Baltimore a long-awaited gift -- a pro 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Football League Commissioner Larry Smith on Thursday formally 
introduced Baltimore as the league's 11th franchise.Speros, who worked nearly a 
year to land the team, finally saw his effort reach fruition in a ceremony 
attended by Smith, several CFL team owners and two of the league's biggest 
names, quarterbacks David Archer and Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which cost Speros $3 million, will begin its training camp under 
Coach Don Matthews in June and open its inaugural season in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the league hopes to add another team from the United States in time 
for the 1994 season and ultimately expects the league to have two divisions -- 
one consisting of teams from the United States and another of teams from 
Canada. The league has three U.S. franchises -- Sacramento, Las Vegas and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Baltimore are still trying to lure an NFL franchise and have 
spoken with the Raiders and Rams, among others.

 A pair of task forces at UC Irvine responded to an ongoing financial crisis 
Thursday by issuing a series of sweeping recommendations, including eliminating 
the university's teacher credentialing, comparative culture and physical 
education programs and reducing the number of vice chancellors by half.  
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were among dozens released Thursday by two separate campus 
task forces as part of an effort by the university to reduce spending. The 
crisis stems from the university's loss of $35 million in permanent state 
funding since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, university officials have made administrative cuts, used reserve 
funds, reduced salaries, offered early retirement and increased student fees. 
</P>
<P>
 But an additional $4 million must be cut from the 1994-95 budget, they said. 
So six months ago, the chancellor established two task forces -- one dealing 
with academic issues, the other with non-academic issues -- to begin deciding 
where the cuts will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups' other recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Combining the department of Spanish with the independent programs in 
Chicano/Latino and Latin American studies; 
</P>
<P>
 * Privatizing the Graduate School of Management, allowing it to retain its 
present enrollment but requiring it to pay for future expansions through 
agreements with private enterprise; 
</P>
<P>
 * Contracting out some programs, such as student health services, which are 
now funded by student fees. Students would then have to pay for health services 
through student insurance plans or out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reallocating some student fees to pay for such services as academic advising 
and tutoring, which now are underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's recommendation to eliminate the Department of Education 
specifically calls for the teacher credentialing program to be "transferred in 
a timely fashion to the California State University system," which already 
credentials most of the state's teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're looking into (cutting) is areas where needs are served in other 
ways," said Linda Granell, a university spokeswoman. "Certainly, there is 
extensive (teacher) credentialing" available at other universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something that would happen overnight," Granell said, adding that 
the number of students enrolled in the program dwindled from 176 in 1990 to 138 
in 1992. Should the recommendation be implemented, she said, all students at 
UCI now studying to become teachers would be allowed to complete the 
certification process. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force would also abolish the physical education department, which 
offers no degrees and attracts few students, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report recommends reducing the number of vice chancellors 
from six to three. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials were quick to point out Thursday that the recommendations 
are only preliminary and will not be implemented until after a great deal of 
campus discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 From now until April 15, they said, all segments of the university community 
-- faculty, staff, students and administrators -- will be encouraged to discuss 
the recommendations and submit their responses in writing to a committee, which 
will collect and summarize them. Then, they said, the recommendations and 
responses will be forwarded to Chancellor Laurel Wilkening, who will decide 
which ones to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the recommendations could be implemented as early as this fall, 
the officials said others could take several years to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our former assumptions of reasonably sustained growth and resources from the 
state to accommodate increasing numbers of students no longer apply," said 
Spencer Olin, the university's current dean of humanities who will soon become 
its acting executive vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCI confronts the painful dilemmas of choice, and this has led to the need to 
engage in a much more profound and fundamental reassessment of our future 
course than has characterized our behavior as a campus to date."

CATCHING CANCER EARLY ON; HEALTH: FREE MAMMOGRAMS PROVIDED THROUGH THE KOMEN 
FOUNDATION GIVE LOW-INCOME WOMEN A CHANCE TO DETECT THE DISEASE AT ITS MOST 
CURABLE STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Her older sister's brush with death drove Roberta Reed to the Oasis Senior 
Center here Thursday for a free mammogram. Her sister, who is also her 
roommate, was home in Irvine recuperating from surgery to remove a tiny cancer 
in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor said another two months and it would have spread into the lymph 
glands," said Reed, 53, as her eyes filled with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reed and her sister, Barbara Sherman, have been working part time as 
secretaries. They do not have medical insurance and cannot afford a mammogram, 
which can range from $50 to $300 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But in December, Sherman read about the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 
Foundation's free mammogram screening for low-income women 40 and older. She 
made an appointment for the test, which, followed by a sonogram and biopsy, 
detected the cancer in its earliest, and thus must curable, stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Early detection is the ultimate goal of the breast cancer screening program, 
which is entirely funded by Race for the Cure, an annual run. Hosted in Newport 
Beach by the Komen Breast Cancer Foundation for the last two years, the event 
has attracted thousands of participants, including breast cancer survivors. 
Last year it raised $271,000, a portion of which was committed to the early 
detection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dava F. Gerard, a San Clemente surgeon and founder of the Orange County 
chapter of the Komen Foundation, said that so far the program, a mobile service 
that rotates among churches and community centers, has screened 877 women. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that six confirmed cases of breast cancer have been discovered and 
that four more women whose initial screening showed a possibility of cancer are 
waiting for more definitive results from biopsies or additional X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides providing free mammograms to women who cannot afford them, Gerard 
said, the Komen Foundation will pay for follow-up procedures necessary to reach 
a firm diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a patient has a certain diagnosis of cancer, she added, Medi-Cal or the 
county's medical program for the indigent will pay for surgery and therapies 
such as chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Komen Foundation officials and volunteers said they are striving to spread the 
word about the importance of early detection in Orange County, where the breast 
cancer rate exceeds the national average, striking one in every seven women 
over their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they are having the most difficulty reaching the county's ethnic 
minorities and elderly women, who are much less likely than younger women to 
have mammograms, even though the risk of breast cancer increases sharply with 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the women who need no convincing were the 19 who braved the rain 
Thursday morning to show up at the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women had been referred by doctors, while others were motivated by 
close friends or relatives who had recently discovered cancer through 
mammography. 
</P>
<P>
 The women received breast exams by a nurse practitioner, low-radiation 
mammograms and detailed instructions on how to perform self-exams. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, like Rosario Barajas, 43, who speaks only Spanish, it was the first 
mammogram of their lives. Barajas' 19-year-old daughter drove her to the 
screening from their Westminster home and served as an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does she check her breasts every month?" the nurse practitioner asked. 
Barajas, through her daughter, said she did not. She was immediately advised to 
set up a self-exam routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Parker, director of the program and owner of Breast Health Services, a 
Carlsbad company licensed to perform mammography, noted that "nine out of 10 
women find their own lumps," although most check their breasts only 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 If women performed self-exams more thoroughly and regularly, Parker said, any 
lumps would probably be discovered when they are much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Another patient, Leonor Gomez, a 43-year-old immigrant from Guatemala who 
lives in Santa Ana, said that she does examine her breasts but wanted a 
mammogram after a friend and a relative were recently diagnosed with breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said she could not afford the $145 that a private physician quoted her. 
The housekeeper said she learned of the free screening program from one of her 
clients, who happens to work for the Komen Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gomez and other women at Thursday's screening said they were grateful 
for the service, none were more appreciative than those who, through the 
program, discovered breast cancer and were able to take steps to conquer it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm alive now because of (the program)," said Jodi Currie, 46, of San 
Clemente, a school bus driver who otherwise could not have paid for the 
mammogram that indicated a cancer larger than a golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Currie, who had a total mastectomy and is undergoing chemotherapy, to be 
followed by radiation, volunteers to help with paperwork for the Komen 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Reed said, she will talk about breast cancer detection to her 
all-women sailing club, and her sister will join the ranks of the foundation 
volunteers as soon as she is well enough. They are committed to increasing 
awareness of the program, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister told me, and we tell everybody," she said.

FRIENDS RECALL BOY'S ZEST FOR LIFE; DEATH: THOMAS SUNOO, 16, HAD VARIED 
INTERESTS. AT A SHAKEN AND SADDENED UNIVERSITY HIGH IN IRVINE, HIS PASSING 
PROMPTS RECOLLECTIONS OF A BUSY LIFESTYLE AND OF HIS POTENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thomas Sunoo loved to draw and, even though he had more than a year to go 
before graduation, he aspired to attend the California Institute of the Arts in 
Valencia on his way to becoming a professional animator. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, though, there were to be many high school days left at University 
High in Irvine, where Sunoo was a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 There was piano to learn and meetings of the Ethnic Awareness club on campus 
to attend. There were coffeehouses to visit, movies to see and bookstores to 
browse. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, his fellow students would remember it all in bittersweet fashion, 
the day after Sunoo, 16, collapsed on the high school gym floor and died of an 
apparent heart attack during physical education class. The exact cause of his 
death is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The somber announcement of Sunoo's death came over the loudspeaker at the 
beginning of the school day, followed by an invitation for students to gather 
in the campus theater to mourn. About 125 students showed up, sharing six boxes 
of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids were hurting," said Assistant Principal Sue Buttell. "I looked out 
at the sea of faces and they wanted me to tell them it wasn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors made themselves available to students in the school's college and 
career center, and school psychologist Mark Bockstahler) visited all of Sunoo's 
classes to offer support Thursday, Buttell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was shaken. One incredulous student asked Buttell to call the 
hospital where Sunoo was pronounced dead, just once more to make certain some 
mistake hadn't been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunoo's school medical records had shown no sign of health problems. And the 
coroner's office said an autopsy performed Thursday did not reveal the cause of 
death. When he collapsed face-down while playing basketball, teachers applied 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Paramedics said Sunoo appeared to be in full 
cardiac arrest. Sunoo died at Irvine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all saddened by the loss of a young person with talent and potential," 
Buttell said. "These tragedies bring us together and help us appreciate the 
value of family." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunoo moved to Irvine from Los Angeles in September, 1992, with his parents, 
Brenda and Jan and brother, David, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy really looked up to his brother. They were very close," his mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks ago, the Sunoos had a family reunion to celebrate Jan Sunoo's 
50th birthday. "He was just very upbeat" on that day, she said. "I miss him 
terribly." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunoo kept his Los Angeles-area pals while making new ones in Irvine, his 
mother said. His interests ranged from religion to piano-playing to his real 
love, pencil drawing. He often entered his work in contests. 
</P>
<P>
 An abstract drawing he called "Unfocused" was included in a calendar he gave 
his mother for Christmas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, two of Sunoo's classmates visited his family to 
reminisce. They couldn't help but shed some tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when he came (to Irvine)" said Hedi Kim, 17. "He was so cute when 
I saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim remembered having a crush on him when he first arrived at school but the 
two later became just good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the Sunoos' dining room table, she wrote her recollections of him 
in a bound notebook for the parents while she wiped away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 He never drank, smoked, or used drugs, she said. "He was totally against it. I 
don't think he did anything. He was so innocent."  
</P>
<P>
 Tina Nam, 16, another close friend, said Sunoo was at first extremely quiet 
and reserved but when she got to know him better, Nam learned he was very 
generous. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, she said, he had been exploring different churches. 
</P>
<P>
 As other family friends and students arrived to pay condolences, Kim and Nam 
departed to visit Jitters, a coffeehouse in an Irvine shopping center where 
Sunoo often spent free time. Nam said they often saw movies together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the coffeehouse was Irene Ahn, 17, another close friend of Sunoo's. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always smiling and brightening up my day," said Ahn, a senior who 
considered him her little brother. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned of his death Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone told me, but I didn't believe it," she said. "Then I heard it over 
the loudspeaker, and I ran out of the classroom. I just miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttell said there would be moments of silence at the school's next pep rally, 
and that students are planning to dedicate a page in their yearbook to his 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 His funeral will be at 11 a.m. Monday at University United Methodist Church in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions can be sent to University High School, where the Sunoos are 
setting up an art scholarship fund with the school for an aspiring artist in 
the class of 1995, the year Thomas would have graduated.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; POLICE PROPOSE CITY HIRE 5 NEW OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department on Monday proposed to hire five new officers with money 
the city will get from Proposition 172, a ballot initiative passed in November 
to give money to safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder said the city will get about $430,000 this year 
to spend on public safety from a quarter-cent state sales tax.The Police 
Department proposes to spend $345,000 on the new officers and a patrol car. It 
will take about eight months to recruit and train new officers, said Cmdr. Dick 
Greer. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council discussed the police proposal in a study session and agreed 
that the money should be disbursed quickly. The council will consider acting on 
the proposal at its Feb. 21 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department also suggested various ways to spend money on equipment 
and support services, including adding a fourth paramedic engine company at a 
cost of about $23,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also scheduled a joint meeting with the sanitary district board of 
directors for Feb. 22. Council member Peter F. Buffa said he would like the 
city to take over the district if the job of residential trash collection and 
sewer maintenance can be done without costing residents any money. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa said he is concerned because the council members are responsible for 
achieving state-mandated recycling levels, but do not have control over the 
process. The sanitary district was founded 50 years ago, 10 years before Costa 
Mesa incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wahner, who heads the sanitary district's board of directors, said the 
district already meets the recycling requirements and is committed to serving 
the city. He said the directors want to remain autonomous from the city.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FULLERTON DROPS SUIT ON REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Fullerton has dropped its suit against Anaheim over an 895-acre 
redevelopment project after Anaheim agreed that it will not try to lure large 
retail developments to the area for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Fullerton agreed to share its revenue from some of its shopping 
centers on the Anaheim border if that revenue grows faster than the general 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will usher in an era of cooperation between the cities, rather 
than competition," said Barry Eaton, Fullerton's chief planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had contended that a retail development within the project area -- 
which is just inside Anaheim's border with Fullerton -- would have adversely 
affected its traffic, pollution and sewer systems and stolen customers from 
nearby Fullerton shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim agreed that, through the year 2013, it will not give financial 
assistance to anyone wishing to build a large-scale retail development in the 
area nor will it use its power of eminent domain to acquire property for such a 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim could still lure developments that are primarily commercial in nature, 
such as office buildings, hotels or sellers of products used by other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail stores such as coffee shops and gift stores will be acceptable, 
provided they don't make up more than 10% of the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, a privately owned and developed retail center could be 
built in the redevelopment area, which is bordered by Fullerton on the north, 
La Palma Avenue on the south, Harbor Boulevard and Lemon Street on the west and 
East Street on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't think that is going to happen," Eaton said. "Your big retailers 
such as Wal-Mart won't move in anywhere without a deal" with the city. TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; HOPING TO PADDLE FOR GOLD IN '96

 Katrina Egan lifted the 18-foot-long, 25-pound kayak atop her shoulder and, 
with paddle in hand, trekked barefoot to the dock and set the craft in the 
calm, smooth waters of Newport's Back Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan slipped inside the single-seat kayak, taking care not to tip it. Sitting 
tall, she glided across the water, making flat-water kayaking look easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan, 24, a resident of both the United States and New Zealand, has her sights 
set on becoming a member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic flat-water kayak team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the fulfillment of a dream. It's something I've aspired to do, 
and it'd be fantastic to achieve that," said Egan, a Newport Beach resident who 
trains twice daily at the Newport Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of eight women who regularly train at the center, all of whom are 
seeking to compete in the Olympic Games. Egan, who was born in this country, 
moved back here nine months ago from Napier, New Zealand, where she has lived 
most of her life, to concentrate on making the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan is a world-champion surf-ski competitor. In that sport, which is similar 
to kayaking, competitors paddle from atop watercraft that resemble large 
surfboards. But the former lifeguard, who took up surf-skiing at 14, gave it up 
for kayaking to pursue her Olympic dream because surf-skiing is not an Olympic 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunities for kayaking for women in New Zealand are not very good," 
Egan said. Men still dominate the sport in her homeland, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of kayaking is to keep one's balance while paddling furiously, 
said Egan, who is working hard to lower her 500-meter race time to less than 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Egan needed a sponsor to help keep her effort afloat while training full 
time and working part time as a physical therapist, she approached her 
employer, Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Hospital 
officials agreed to absorb the cost of a new $3,000 kayak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fully support and encourage Katrina in her quest to bring home an Olympic 
medal for the United States. We are proud of her efforts," Richard E. Butler, 
the hospital's administrator, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other kayakers, Egan moved to Orange County to train at the Newport 
Aquatic Center, which is known for turning out world-class paddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best facility for paddling," Jimmy Terrell, the center's director 
for canoe and kayak training, said. "This area offers the best training and 
climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Schick, 30, of Costa Mesa, who moved from New York four years ago to 
train here, is also hoping to make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a pretty good chance," said Schick, an alternate on the 
women's kayaking team in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a goal of mine. . . . The ultimate in amateur competition is the 
Olympics," said Schick, also a physical therapist at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The two kayakers said it takes tremendous perseverance, dedication and 
motivation -- not to mention a strong upper body and physical endurance -- to 
pursue their medal aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day you have to go out there and do your best," Schick said. "After 
being an athlete for so many years, it's part of your life. You wake up and go 
to the boathouse because (kayaking) makes you feel good and feel healthy."

<P>
 Coast Community College District Chancellor William M. Vega has been appointed 
to the advisory committee of presidents for the Assn. of Community College 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee was established to ensure that community college 
leaders have a voice in evaluating the ACCT's educational programs. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY LEASES SCHOOL LAND TO BUILD WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved a lease agreement with the Fountain Valley 
School District for a piece of land at an elementary school campus to be used 
by the city to build two water wells.  
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year lease, which can be extended to a 100-year term, will allow the 
city of Newport Beach to build two wells to tap into the underground aquifers, 
said Jeff Staneart, utilities director for the city.The city will pay $22,125 
annually for use of the site at Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved 6-0 by the City Council on Monday. Council member 
John Hedges was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Newport Beach buys all of its water from the Metropolitan Water 
District, which, in turn, imports its supply from the Colorado River and the 
state water project, Staneart said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all part of a larger ground-water development project to build a total 
of four wells on two sites to be operational by 1995. It will save the city an 
estimated $2 million annually.  
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said it costs about $1 million to build each well and lay the piping 
to connect it to the city's existing water system.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY OKS 45-DAY BAN ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has temporarily stopped businesses that offer adult entertainment 
from opening here. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday unanimously passed a 45-day urgency ordinance to 
prohibit such businesses, including nude dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very delicate issue," Mayor John Collins said. "We have to balance 
constitutional rights with the general welfare of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Perea, planning services manager, said the moratorium is needed because 
the city's code does not adequately address zoning standards for adult 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, current regulations do not deal with the proximity of 
adult businesses to churches, schools or homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of appropriate development standards for adult-type entertainment 
and uses poses a threat to the public health, safety or welfare in that the use 
may create negative secondary effects for the surrounding area and the city as 
a whole," Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently got an inquiry about opening a nude dance cabaret, prompting 
officials to approve the ban so that they could have time to study the 
potential effects of adult entertainment. Currently, there are no nude or 
topless clubs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do need to do something. But cities can't prohibit (adult businesses), 
only specify where they will go," City Atty. Alan R. Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the moratorium, which can be extended by the council to two years, the 
city will study the issue to determine what locations would be appropriate for 
adult entertainment, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities are also grappling with adult entertainment ordinances. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY TO SEEK ADVICE ON ARTS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members agreed this week to meet with theater professionals from 
throughout the county to get advice on how to develop a performing arts program 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have the 178-seat Gem Theatre and the 550-seat Festival Amphitheatre 
available after debt-ridden GroveShakespeare announced earlier this month that 
it has ceased operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two great facilities that we want to be used on a regular basis for 
the benefit of the community," Mayor Frank Kessler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sad about the demise of GroveShakespeare but excited about the prospects 
for a rebirth of arts in the city. This is a great opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler and others said it will be a priority to have a number of arts groups 
putting on performances and programs at the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have multiuse, not just one group," Kessler said. "There has been 
so much down time and the theaters are not that large to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes said he envisions the two city-owned theaters forming 
the basis for a performing arts center, with a number of groups staging varied 
programs throughout the year. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RESERVISTS TO RELIEVE OFFICERS' WORKLOAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved the hiring of five new police reservists 
who will serve as support for the city's 31 sworn police officers. The 
department is also in the process of hiring two officers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to select, test and train the five reservists over the 
next few months. They should be ready for duty by April, said City Manager 
Jerry L. Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservists will perform some of the more time-consuming duties such as 
crowd control and writing accident reports, now done by officers . The new 
reservists will allow sworn officers to return to their patrols faster, 
Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve officers will wear special uniforms. Though they receive no 
salary, the city will pay them a small stipend to cover equipment and uniform 
expenses. The program is expected to cost the city about $7,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said the city hopes to recruit reservists with experience in security 
and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, reserve units will consist of retired police officers, younger 
people with other careers and (security) professionals with a real interest in 
law enforcement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five reservists will join two others who already are helping in the 
department's computers and communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also is selecting an architectural firm to draw rough plans and 
calculate a cost estimate for a proposed police substation at the Seal Beach 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have championed the project, saying the substation would add a 
police presence to the Old Town area. The city's main police station is more 
than a mile from Old Town on Seal Beach Boulevard.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; WALK IN SUPPORT OF ABDUCTED BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Rancho Santa Margarita have scheduled a flashlight walk for 5 
p.m. Sunday to call attention to the abduction of a 4-year-old boy who was 
taken last weekend from his foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 The community-walk sponsors are asking people to gather at the Rancho Santa 
Margarita Beach Club to demonstrate support for Taj Yaser Jayyusi and his 
foster mother, Susan White. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the child was taken by his biological parents just days 
before court proceedings were scheduled to enable White, 43, to adopt Taj. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses in Anaheim, where the couple lived, reported to police Wednesday 
that they saw the boy and his parents in a yellow 1980 Oldsmobile Delta near 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been concerned that Taj's father, Yaser Majed Jayyusi, a 
55-year-old Jordanian, might flee the country with the boy.MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GUEST LECTURER HAS A TOUGH AUDIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Morales stood before a classroom of teen-age gang members warming up to 
his favorite topic: life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, an ex-gang member known as a veterano , and an ex-con, drew on his 
personal history to deliver his anti-gang message Thursday at a juvenile court 
school in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other former gang members who try to scare young people out of gang 
life, Morales asked this group to think about the consequences of their 
actions, and the innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you feel if you killed a little kid (by mistake)?" Morales asked, 
painting the image of a toddler on a Big Wheel killed by a stray bullet.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be able to sleep for a long time," said one Anaheim gang member, 
squirming in his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you feel when you see your mother cry because of you?" Two gang 
members said it made them feel terrible, and the rest nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black jeans, black shirt and yellow construction boots, Morales 
continued to tell the group of high school students about his own life and what 
it's like to be a gang-banger, get stabbed eight times, go to prison -- and to 
leave that lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my experiences are anything to be proud of. I was a fool," the 
Santa Ana resident said of his membership in the F-Troop gang and of his 
cocaine addiction. He served 15 months of a two-year sentence in the California 
Rehabilitation Center for selling PCP, known as angel dust, and was released 
nearly four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the 34-year-old Rancho Santiago College liberal arts major has made it his 
career to reach out to young people. He is coordinator of the Safe Haven gang 
program in Santa Ana and conducts "gang members-only" workshops where he tells 
youths why "prison and death," are the inevitable consequences of gang 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "What George does is get them to think through and see how others will be 
impacted by their behavior," said Bill Brooks, director of juvenile supervision 
for the county Probation Department. Brooks sat through Morales' workshop for 
the first time Thursday morning at the Glassell Community School in Orange and 
said he hopes Morales will speak to more gang members throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the nine gang members in the workshop said they've heard others 
try to scare them straight, they said they believed Morales was honest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty good. He's been on the streets. There's been a lot of guys coming 
down from Los Angeles, (but) at least he's from Orange County and knows what's 
going on down here," said one Anaheim youth who preferred to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though some of the gang members agreed with Morales, they also said they 
were not ready to leave their gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of friends. It's family. That's what it's all about," said one 
four-year gang member from Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 Three of the nine said they felt stuck because of unwritten rules of the 
streets. Getting out of a gang can be a dangerous proposition, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fear of walking away," said Jose, a 17-year-old gang member from 
Santa Ana who would not give his last name. He said he would be beaten if he 
tried to leave the gang he joined eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not deal with it," he said. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; EFFICIENCY IS GOAL IN DIVIDED POLICE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a plan to reorganize the Police Department into 
two divisions, each to be headed by a captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Michael J. Skogh said the changes are needed to increase the 
department's efficiency, provide clear lines of responsibility and create a 
stronger management team. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the proposal this week in Skogh's first major act since 
taking over in January the top post in the 31-person department that includes 
25 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the reorganization, the position of commander will be changed to captain 
and a vacant lieutenant's position will be upgraded to captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Biggerstaff, who has been responsible for the day-to-day operations of 
the department, is currently designated as police commander, while the 
lieutenant position became vacant with the death of Duane Swearingen in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current structure, the police commander manages patrol shifts, 
sergeants and corporals, detectives, training, reserves and explorer programs, 
parking control and crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lieutenant handles such duties as maintaining employee and training 
records, disaster preparedness and community services. The lieutenant often 
becomes a subordinate of the commander, affecting the efficiency of the 
department, Skogh said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the reorganization, one captain will take charge of traffic, reserves, 
and other field services and the other captain will be responsible for 
investigations, training and administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Skogh said that Biggerstaff remains a captain with no change in his total 
monthly compensation of $8,000. The other captain will be hired from within the 
department if a suitable candidate is found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews and testing will be held in March, Skogh said, although he declined 
to say when the position will be filled. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PLAN TO MINIMIZE FIRE HAZARDS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is moving ahead on several fronts to minimize future fire risk, 
including a $1-million project to widen and extend the fuel breaks that rim the 
open space areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday for a package of proposals to 
minimize fire hazards, a plan that was praised by most people who spoke at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the measures will be in place by fall, while others are long-term 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a larger set of recommendations, the council gave city staff the 
green light to inspect all homes next to open space areas by Aug. 1, a project 
that could involve as many as 1,800 houses, according to Fire Chief Richard 
Dewberry, who presented the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that we won't lose some houses, but maybe we can minimize the risk so we 
won't lose so many," Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal that drew support from residents will explore ways to create 
emergency access roads in areas that are difficult to escape in an emergency, 
such as the Canyon Acres community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to build a safe, defensible community," one Canyon Acres resident 
told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the effort to minimize fire risks in this city, where more than 400 
homes burned in the October firestorm, the council will hear a staff report 
March 1 on possible changes in the city's building and fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said it will cost from $1 million to $1.3 
million to improve the fuel breaks but that the federal government may pay 75% 
of the cost. As it has in the past, the city may use goats to clear away the 
vegetation, Dewberry said, or it could employ hand crews.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; RESIDENTS ARE ASKED TO SUSPEND WATERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Water department officials are asking residents in Laguna Beach, Emerald Bay 
and north Dana Point to not water their yards from Monday through Feb. 26 
because a major supply line to the area will be under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Laguna Beach County Water District, which imports its water 
supply, said the relocation of a major pipeline in Irvine that week will leave 
its service area relying on a smaller, alternate supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we don't put too great a strain on that alternate 
supply, so we're asking people to suspend irrigating their lawns," district 
engineer Jim Nestor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting a strain on the backup supply might compromise public health or fire 
protection services, Nestor said. "We don't anticipate any problems though," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aufdencamp Transmission Main in Irvine is being relocated near the 
intersection of Sand Canyon Avenue and Alton Parkway to make way for the nearby 
construction of a hospital. That main, which runs beneath Laguna Canyon Road, 
provides Laguna Beach with a significant amount of its water. 
</P>
<P>
 Full service should be restored by noon Feb. 26, officials said. For more 
information about the construction's effects or water conservation, call the

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: AIRPORT AUTHORITY URGES EL TORO STUDY 
</P>

<P>
 An association of cities that wants the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
converted into a commercial airport called on the county Thursday to commission 
an independent study of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority said that an "unbiased 
and untainted" review is a logical way of determining how best to use the 
4,700-acre base when it is closed at the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport authority officials suggested that the county use the 
Washington-based Urban Land Institute to conduct the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute officials who attended Thursday's Orange County Regional Airport 
Authority meeting said that such a study would be carried out by a panel of 
economists, land-use planners, aviation industry officials and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
 All panelists would come from outside California, reducing the likelihood that 
conclusions would be drawn based on local political considerations, airport 
authority officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for us to get some good advice on the El Toro 
conversion," said Mark Leyes, a Garden Grove councilman and airport authority 
member. "This would be an unbiased review. (The panel) would have no vested 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 An Urban Land Institute study would cost about $100,000. Leyes suggested that 
the county and the airport authority might share the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do with El Toro has been a hot topic ever since the Pentagon announced 
last year its intentions to close the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Some South County cities oppose converting the base into an airport, fearing 
that such a move would cause traffic, noise and pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But other cities, including Garden Grove, Anaheim and Newport Beach, argue 
that building an air-cargo facility at El Toro would be a boost to the county's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has formed a nine-member board to oversee the conversion of El 
Toro. The panel is made up of five county supervisors as well as council 
members from Irvine and Lake Forest. SHELBY GRAD

MAN SLAIN IN MARKET PARKING LOT; VIOLENCE: HE'S SHOT 10 TIMES AT CLOSE RANGE AS 
A FRIEND WATCHES HELPLESSLY AND SHOPPERS SCATTER OUTSIDE THE COSTA MESA STORE. 
A SUSPECT, 28, IS ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA.

<P>
 A man was shot 10 times at close range Thursday and died face-down in a 
supermarket parking lot while a woman friend watched helplessly, witnesses and 
police said. Police arrested a suspect hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics and police responded at 2 p.m. to a call of shots fired at the 
Stater Bros. market at 2180 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa Police Investigator 
George Wilson said. The body of a man lay between two parked pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported the assailant's license plate, and a 28-year-old man later 
was arrested by police in Santa Ana, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Cotton, whose yard abuts the market parking lot, said he was watching 
television when he heard the first three shots fired. He looked out his window, 
he said, and saw a body on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard another shot and ducked. Then he counted six more reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was already laying down before the last (shots)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton said he did not see the shooter because everyone in the parking lot ran 
after the man opened fire. "People were scattering everywhere," Cotton said. "I 
didn't know who was who." When the shooting stopped, he climbed over a concrete 
wall to help the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was lying down," Cotton said. "I ran over with a blanket, hoping he was 
alive . . . but he wasn't alive." He said a woman screamed "they shot my 
boyfriend!" and cried loudly next to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman later sat in a police car while officers cordoned off the scene, 
covered the body and began to look for evidence. According to a police 
spokeswoman, the assailant threw the gun from his white Volkswagen Golf at 
Newport Boulevard and 19th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police broadcast a description of the car and license plate as it 
headed north into Santa Ana, according to Lt. Robert Helton, of the Santa Ana 
Police Department. An officer on a stakeout near the corner of Fairview and 
Willits streets saw the Volkswagen and followed it while calling for a backup 
unit. At the 1100 block of North English Street the car was forced over and the 
driver was take into custody without incident, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police were notified, and they arrested the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said police would not release the name of the suspect until further 
investigation, and the victim's name was withheld until his family was 
notified. No motive is known for the killing, Wilson said. He said it was the 
city's second killing of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 At Stater Bros. market, shopper Ruth Waller, a 40-year resident of Costa Mesa, 
said she has "shopped here since this store opened. For God's sake, who would 
believe it," she said as she watched police detectives investigate the 
shooting.

15-YEAR-OLD TO BE CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors expect to charge a 15-year-old boy today in connection with 
Wednesday's shooting of a Santa Ana police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Chavez, 45, was wounded in the right hand after chasing a suspect 
into a garage following reports of gunfire near the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown said the suspect in the shooting, whose name 
was not released because of his age, may be charged with attempted murder of a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth will be tried as a juvenile because under state law no one under 16 
can be tried as an adult, regardless of the seriousness of the crime, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men were taken into custody in connection with the gunfire that Chavez 
was investigating. But none are being held in connection with the shooting of 
the officer, according to Lt. Robert Helton. Two of them were being held for 
possible parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez was released from Western Medical Center-Santa Ana on Thursday morning 
and is home recuperating, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer will be medically evaluated next week. Helton said he anticipates 
that Chavez, a watch commander, will be out a minimum of 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he feels better, knowing Bob, he'll try to come back sooner," Helton said.

UMBERG LAUNCHES RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL; POLITICS: THE ASSEMBLYMAN ATTACKS 
INCUMBENT DAN LUNGREN AND FELLOW DEMOCRAT ARLO SMITH, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE FAILED 
TO STEM CRIME, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg launched his campaign for state attorney 
general Thursday and immediately went on the attack, saying Republican 
incumbent Dan Lungren has lost the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and the only Democrat from Orange County 
in the Legislature, vowed to focus on juvenile crime to help keep first-time 
offenders from becoming revolving-door felons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a place where a lot of people focus their attention because it's not 
that sexy," said Umberg, who was flanked by his wife, Robin, and campaign 
aides. "But unless we do, we're going to have second- and third-time offenders 
who graduate from auto theft to residential burglary to armed robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 During a half-hour press conference in a restaurant near the Capitol, Umberg 
repeatedly criticized his opponent in the June 7 Democratic primary, San 
Francisco District Atty. Arlo Smith, as well as Lungren. Smith narrowly lost 
the attorney general's race to Lungren in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arlo Smith and Dan Lungren have one thing in common -- both have failed in 
the fight to keep our neighborhoods safe," declared Umberg, who said he was 
running as a "citizen prosecutor" who could get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, 38, said the attorney general has "presided over record-breaking 
violent crime" while failing to curb gangs, drug dealers and the proliferation 
of guns in public schools. He also criticized Lungren for not using the post as 
a "bully pulpit" to push for more law enforcement funding from the Legislature 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling San Francisco "the most unsafe county in California," Umberg ridiculed 
Smith as ineffective, concluding that "with a record like his, Arlo Smith 
should be running for cover, not for attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Umberg had misrepresented his accomplishments during four terms as 
San Francisco's top prosecutor, and suggested that the assemblyman lacks the 
statewide name identification and experience to mount a successful campaign. "I 
think I've probably handled more cases before the U.S. Supreme Court than he's 
ever brought to trial," Smith said. "He's totally lacking in experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Stabler, Lungren's campaign director, said Umberg's attacks on the 
attorney general were premature because the assemblyman first must defeat Smith 
in the primary. She also defended Lungren's record, saying the state's crime 
rate fell last year, and that he has worked hard to press legislation designed 
to combat gangs and school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler criticized Umberg for failing to push more tough anti-crime 
legislation through the liberal-leaning Assembly Public Safety Committee, a 
traditional graveyard for anti-crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rip Van Winkle of the Public Safety Committee has finally awakened," she 
said. "He's been sitting on that committee for a long time now and hasn't put 
forth any tough crime-fighting legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's opponents also ripped him for failing early on to champion the 
"three-strikes-you're-out" measure now headed for the ballot. Today, Umberg is 
pushing his own "three-strikes" bill, which he calls a "good first step," and 
said he is a backer of the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Lungren and Smith enjoy better name recognition around the 
state, Umberg hopes to use a growing campaign bankroll, ties to law enforcement 
groups and strategic support from more than two dozen supporters in the 
Legislature to aid his campaign. Heading into the primary battle, Umberg has 
nearly $300,000 cash on hand compared to about $36,000 for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg is a relative newcomer to politics, getting elected to office for the 
first time in 1990 when he defeated Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle for a 
central Orange County seat. He won a second term in 1992 and has been embraced 
by Democratic leaders as a rising star, someone whose credentials as a moderate 
lawmaker -- he supports the death penalty -- might help expand the party's 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of UCLA and the University of California's Hastings College of Law 
in San Francisco, Umberg enlisted in the Army and served stints in Korea and 
Italy, gaining the rank of captain and serving as a military prosecutor. He 
left the service in 1985 and is now a major in the Army Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 After his military career, Umberg was appointed to the U.S. attorney's office 
in Santa Ana, where he spent three years prosecuting drug and gang cases, as 
well as white-collar and hate crimes. In his campaign literature, Umberg boasts 
of a 100% conviction rate on the cases he handled.

16-YEAR-OLD WAIVES HEARING IN GIRL'S SHOOTING DEATH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Dana Point boy charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 
shooting death of a teen-age girl waived his right to a preliminary hearing 
Thursday in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Seferino Naranjo, who was recently ordered by a Juvenile Court judge 
to stand trial as an adult, now faces arraignment in Orange County Superior 
Court later this month.He is being held in custody on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the 
Dec. 13 shooting death of 15-year-old Angela Lynn Wagner of San Clemente. The 
girl was shot once in the chest as she sat in a car in front of a Capistrano 
Beach apartment complex waiting for her boyfriend to run an errand. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said they believe the shooting was unintentional, the result 
of carelessness. The boy was on probation at the time of the shooting and under 
orders not to have a weapon.

MAYORS VOTE TO KEEP WEDAA ON AIR BOARD, FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's mayors Thursday voted to allow their controversial 
representative on the regional air quality board to keep his seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda Councilman Henry W. Wedaa was able to get the support of the 
required two-thirds of the county's mayors to retain his seat on the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District during the Orange County League of Cities 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for staying on the board, Wedaa submitted to the committee chairman 
a letter of resignation for his AQMD seat, dated Dec. 15, 1994, which assures 
that even if he changes his mind and runs for reelection on Yorba Linda 
council, he no longer could serve on the AQMD board after that date. Wedaa has 
said he will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tradition in our country and county to fight tough and hard before 
elections," Wedaa said after the vote. "It is an equal tradition to close ranks 
after the people or the representatives have spoken. (The mayors) have now 
spoken." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, one of Wedaa's most outspoken critics, 
said Thursday, "The League of Cities has caved in to a man who's been holding 
this seat hostage. He does not own this seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the mayors contend Wedaa's AQMD votes have been anti-business and 
anti-city. His supporters say he is the target of archconservatives who are 
opposed to any meaningful clean-air regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa has been an AQMD board member for six years and its board chairman the 
past two years. The AQMD enacts and enforces regulations that govern air 
pollution control efforts in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote ends a stalemate that threatened to leave Orange County without a 
representative on the board.  
</P>
<P>
 The mayors had to select a representative by March 1 or, under a new state 
law, the county would forfeit its seat on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County governments and private companies have been complaining 
that the AQMD's regulations have proven too costly and have driven some 
businesses out of the area. Wedaa has been the lightning rod for that 
displeasure.

<P>
 A 75-year-old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease was found in Lake Havasu 
on Wednesday evening, one day after leaving home on an errand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said Ernest William Constable had recently moved to Lake 
Forest and became confused and disoriented while searching for a hardware store 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After wandering in the Saddleback Valley area for 2 1/2 hours, Constable 
filled his car's gas tank and drove to a mobile home that he and his wife owned 
in Lake Havasu. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 6 p.m. on Wednesday, family members contacted friends in the 
mobile home park and found that Constable was safe.

STUDENT VANISHES WITHOUT A CLUE

<P>
 Police and family members are searching for a 20-year-old dean's list student 
at Cal State Fullerton who has been missing for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Torrez finished her shift at Sav-On Drugs in the 100 block of East Yorba 
Linda Boulevard at 8 p.m. Saturday, said goodby to co-workers and has not been 
seen since, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of what we can actually confirm is good," Sgt. David M. Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's purse, clothing, jewelry, makeup and belongings are all at the house 
she shared with her family, along with several un-cashed paychecks, police 
said. There has been no activity on her bank account since her disappearance, 
and Torrez's friends have not been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car, a 1990 burgundy Toyota Corolla, license plate 2RMC 785, also has not 
been seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any sign of anything really good here," Taylor said. "We're 
into five days now. I'd be very glad to know that she's not injured or dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's mother, Mary Bennett, 45, said: "It's been very devastating for all 
of us, something I wouldn't wish on anybody. It's a nightmare in itself. 
There's no day or night. We're all in limbo. The whole family is upset, nobody 
can make heads or tails of this. I can't think straight any more. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her job at Sav-On, Torrez worked as a bilingual aide at two 
Placentia public schools to help pay for college. She was an honors graduate 
from Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez has dark brown hair and is 4 feet, 10 inches tall.

BRIEFCASE: LABOR; AFFLUENT SOUTH COUNTY COMMUNITIES ENJOY LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Michael Flagg, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The affluent suburbs of South County have it all over the northern half of the 
county when it comes to unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between the two halves can be seen in figures collected recently 
by the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rates in tony South County communities such as Coto de Caza 
were minuscule compared to the rates for low-income neighborhoods of Santa Ana 
and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the 1,000-person work force of Coto de Caza -- a neighborhood 
snuggled against the foothills where residents can ride horses -- reported an 
unemployment rate of 0.4% in December, the lowest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby planned community of Rancho Santa Margarita, with a work force of 
7,500, had a relatively low unemployment rate of 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The older beach cities of San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano, with more poor 
and middle-class residents, had unemployment rates of about 4%, still well 
below December's countywide average of 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 (The state rate was 8.7% in December, while the U.S. rate was considerably 
better at 6.4%. Last year was the worst in a decade for joblessness in Orange 
County.) 
</P>
<P>
 The big North County city of Santa Ana, meanwhile, saw 15,000 of its 
160,000-person work force unemployed in December, for a rate of 9.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's rate was next-highest in the county, at 9.3%. Anaheim's was 6.1%: 
Out of a work force of 155,000 people, 9,500 were out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that the Costa Mesa Freeway is the dividing line between north and 
south, other big North County cities' unemployment rates were: Costa Mesa, 
4.6%; Huntington Beach, 4%; Orange, 5.1%; Fullerton, 5.1% and Newport Beach, 
3.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 South of the freeway, the unemployment rate in Irvine was 3.7%; Lake Forest, 
3.9% and Laguna Beach, 2%.

ABBEY HEALTHCARE POSTS PROFIT OF $14.3 MILLION FOR '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc., a provider of home medical services, said 
Thursday that it had a 1993 profit of $14.3 million, up 38% from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings, which amounted to $1.42 a share, compared to net income of $10.4 
million, or $1.28 a share, in 1992. Revenue increased 32% last year, to $329.1 
million, up from $248.7 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Timothy M. Aitkin said the record profit was the result of 
emphasizing high-profit segments of Abbey's core business, like respiratory 
therapy and infusion therapy, which each grew more than 30% over the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also completed its $195-million purchase of Torrance-based Total 
Pharmaceutical Care Inc., which Aitkin said broadened Abbey's product base. 
Total Pharmaceutical provides drugs and medical equipment for patients 
receiving home infusion therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Abbey now has all the tools to sustain its leadership position as 
a low-cost provider of health care services through an efficient, nationwide 
distribution network," Aitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, Abbey had earnings of $3.2 million, or 29 cents a 
share, on a greater number of outstanding shares than in the same quarter of 
the previous year, when the company earned $3.1 million, or 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly revenue was $100.7 million, up 39% from $72.4 million in 1992, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Thursday, Abbey stock closed at $25.75, down 75 cents. The 
price has slumped from $29 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop follows the company's announcement Feb. 8 that President Victor 
Chaltiel, who came to Abbey from Total Pharmaceutical, was replaced by Aitkin 
and an announcement Tuesday that Chaltiel had resigned from the board of 
directors and is no longer associated with the company. Record Earnings 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was a profitable one for Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. For the fiscal 
year ended Dec. 31, the company reported revenue of $329 million, up 32% from 
the previous year. Net revenue also increased, to $14 million. Figures in 
millions of dollars, except per-share data: 05,19,08,08,13,13 Fiscal Fiscal 4th

<P>
 Worked to Death: If last year's murder of a postal worker by a colleague at 
the Dana Point Post Office had you worried, you can breathe easier: You're 
about as likely to win the lottery as die on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For those few who do die at work in the Southwest, though, homicide is the 
leading cause of death, according to a recent study by the federal Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, more people were killed by colleagues at work than were 
electrocuted or fell to their death or had car accidents or crashed in 
airplanes or were poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one in every four of the 700 people killed on the job in 1992 in the 
Southwest were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 25%, of course; for the nation, the average was slightly lower, at 17%. 
(The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts the Southwest as California, Arizona, 
Hawaii and Nevada.) 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the 173 workplace murders in the Southwest that year were 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Car accidents were the second-leading cause of workplace deaths in the 
Southwest, accounting for 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, car accidents were the leading cause of workplace deaths, 
with 18% of the fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, by the way, were most likely overall to die on the job.

ALONG CAME A SPIDER; ROBOTICS: COMPUTER-DRIVEN BOX ON WIRES, BUILT BY MCDONNELL 
DOUGLAS, WILL TWIST KNOBS, READ GAUGES ON SPACE SHUTTLE.

<P>
 Charlotte, a spider-like robot named after the clever arachnid in the book 
"Charlotte's Web," will soon be scurrying about in the heavens helping space 
shuttle astronauts do their chores. 
</P>
<P>
 The robot, about the size of a microwave oven, will do work that is better 
fitted for an eight-limbed mechanical spider than two-armed astronauts -- 
things like carrying heavy payloads in shuttle experiments and shooting 
pictures in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte was hatched by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace engineers in Houston and 
was performing demonstrations at the company's Huntington Beach plant this 
week. The robot can record experiments and operate knobs, switches and buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the robot will be carried into space on a shuttle that will house 
SpaceHab, a research lab for biological and material science experiments. 
Charlotte can be used by a scientist on the ground with a laptop computer to 
remotely control experiments in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte is suspended on eight cables that are relatively easy to install and 
remove. Servomotors reel the cables, allowing Charlotte to maneuver in space 
much like a spider in its web. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas named the robot after the clever and reliable spider in 
"Charlotte's Web," a popular book by E.B. White that was made into children's 
animated film.  
</P>
<P>
 "Charlotte was always reliable in the book and had an answer whenever Wilbur 
(a pig) had a problem," said Julia MacInnes, spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although developed for extraterrestrial work, Charlotte could be used for 
light construction duty, such as placing windows on high-rise buildings, 
entertainment and "virtual reality" training on Earth, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
 So, like in the book's ending, Charlotte one day might hatch 100 baby spiders.

DISNEY REAFFIRMS ITS SUPPORT OF ANAHEIM RESORT; AMUSEMENT PARKS: BUT A 
CORPORATE EXECUTIVE WARNS THAT A FINAL DECISION ON THE $3-BILLION PROJECT IS 
MONTHS AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Amid reports that the company is wavering on its commitment to the proposed 
Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney Co. officials Thursday assured a group of 
supporters that they will continue to push ahead on the project and urged them 
to turn out for all public hearings on the resort in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make this happen for the community," said Ronald K. 
Dominguez, executive vice president of Walt Disney Attractions. "We're taking a 
very active role. . . . (But) it's still on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 100 supporters of a group called Westcot 2000 formed to 
rally behind the project and lobby city officials, Dominguez indicated that 
Disney and the city have reached tentative agreement "on most" of the project's 
development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the progress, Dominguez told the supporters gathered at the Holiday 
Inn in Anaheim that a final decision on whether to build the ambitious 
$3-billion resort is still months away. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that after negotiators reach a development agreement, the document 
will have to be reviewed at public hearings before the city's Planning 
Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need your help," said Dominguez, who encouraged the Westcot 
members to speak in support of the project at the public hearings. Those 
hearings should begin by spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we are going to have a very busy spring," added Doug Moreland, 
director of development for the Disney Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings give the project's opponents "one more bite at the apple," as 
well as another opportunity to file lawsuits challenging the development 
agreement, Moreland added. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the development agreement with Anaheim is completed, Disney 
officials said they will continue to seek state and federal assistance before 
they will build the project. So far, the state has committed $60 million in 
transportation funds to the project and the federal government has chipped in 
at least $15.5 million for a multiuse parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials also assured supporters that no part of the project is being 
scaled back. As planned, the project will include 5,000 hotel rooms, a 
5,000-seat amphitheater, a shopping and garden district ringing a six-acre lake 
and a new theme park next to Disneyland called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also calls for massive public roadway, sewage and utility 
improvements and two of the nation's largest parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, there have been signs that Disney may have lost enthusiasm for 
investing in the project, especially in light of the company's financial 
debacle at Euro Disney near Paris.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several months, Disney's Westcot project director has resigned, 
Westcot staff has been redeployed to other projects and Disney Chairman Michael 
Eisner gave his gloomiest assessment of the project's financial feasibility.

that the TakeCare board is seeking the highest bid. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare earlier this month canceled a preliminary agreement to be bought by 
FHP International Corp. in Fountain Valley for about $829 million in cash and 
securities. The cancellation came on the heels of a lawsuit filed by some 
TakeCare shareholders, who claimed a better offer was available from United 
HealthCare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer by FHP, another HMO operator, was valued at $62 a share. The suit 
filed by TakeCare shareholders contends that Minnetonka, Minn.-based United 
made a bid valued at $64.70 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the unhappy TakeCare shareholders are continuing to press ahead with their 
lawsuit -- even though Concord-based TakeCare says it's discussing mergers with 
other suitors, in addition to FHP. A hearing is scheduled for March 1 in 
Delaware Chancery Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholders are attacking an $8-million breakup fee that any acquirer of 
TakeCare would be required to pay to FHP, according to court filings. While 
TakeCare said on Feb. 8 that it had terminated its agreement in principle to be 
acquired by FHP, the breakup fee provision was maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breakup fee is still in effect," said Lanson Hyde, a spokesman for 
TakeCare. "If a company other than FHP acquires TakeCare, it is conceivable the 
fee would have to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs in the shareholder suit filed Jan. 18 contend the breakup fee will 
deter bidders such as United. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to hiking acquisition costs, the suit claims, the $8-million 
breakup fee would force a purchaser to quickly write off nearly $500 million in 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 In accounting for acquisitions, goodwill is the difference between the 
purchase price of a firm and what the assets of the operation would bring in a 
liquidation. Goodwill includes such things as the value of a business name, 
employee morale, good customer relations and other intangible assets that make 
a company worth more than the sum of its tangible assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs claim one of the most attractive features of making an 
all-stock bid for TakeCare would be the ability to avoid taking hefty charges 
against earnings to account for goodwill on TakeCare's balance sheet. Goodwill 
normally is written off over two or three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks to abolish the breakup fee, claiming it is part of a scheme by 
TakeCare Chairman Jack R. Anderson to secure cash in the transaction. The suit 
claims Anderson has gone to extraordinary lengths to favor FHP and is motivated 
by "a personal desire to convert a substantial portion of his TakeCare stock to 
cash." 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare contends the suit is without merit. In court filings the company has 
said Anderson favored an offer with a cash component, instead of an all-stock 
offer, such as United's bid, simply because it would reduce the volatility of 
the value of any such offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle pits Anderson, who owns 16% of TakeCare's outstanding shares, 
against billionaire industrialist Henry L. Hillman, who owns an 18% stake in 
TakeCare and whose Pittsburgh-based foundations are among the plaintiffs in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare has said it is talking with several suitors, in addition to FHP, but 
has declined to name them. A TakeCare-FHP merger would have created one of the 
nation's top three publicly traded HMOs.

SYLMAR CAN'T GUARD AGAINST NORTH HOLLYWOOD BACKCOURT; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
THOMPSON HOLDS HIS OWN AGAINST OLLIE, BUT JOHNSON AND LEE LEAD HUSKIES TO 86-60 
VICTORY.

 Sylmar High center Lamarr Thompson came out ahead in the statistical battle 
with North Hollywood's Damon Ollie, but guards Fantasia Johnson and Arthur Lee 
helped North Hollywood win the war Thursday with an 86-60 victory in a Valley 
Pac-8 Conference basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie, who leads the area's City Section players with averages of 20.9 points 
and 19.1 rebounds per game, collected 17 points and 12 rebounds. Thompson 
outdid Ollie by scoring 22 points and grabbing 17 rebounds, but he was a 
one-man team for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to do what I wanted," Thompson said. "But I don't feel anything 
good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (17-5, 10-0 in league play) maintained their one-game lead over 
Grant in the East Valley League and will conclude the regular season by 
visiting Grant tonight. Despite the loss, Sylmar (13-9, 8-3) clinched the 
championship of the Mid-Valley League because second-place Poly (7-5 in league 
play) also lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Lee led two spurts in the second half that put the game away for 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With North Hollywood clinging to a 35-30 lead early in the second half, Lee 
led the Huskies on an 11-0 run over the next two minutes. Ollie scored five 
points during the run and Lee had three steals as the Huskies initiated a 
full-court press, leading to several baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee finished with 22 points, 10 assists and seven steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had come out a little flat in the first half," Lee said. "I think the run 
got us going for the rest of the game and our shots began falling." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first run, the Spartans stayed with the Huskies, trailing, 60-48, 
with little more than five minutes left in the game, but the Huskies went on a 
14-0 tear to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored eight of his 20 points in the final quarter and finished with 
12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Smith-Harris came off the bench and scored seven of his 10 points in the 
first four minutes of the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood connected on 12 of its first 13 shots in the fourth quarter, 
missing only a three-pointer until the starters were pulled with little more 
than two minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the fourth quarter, the Huskies were shooting 35% from the field 
but finished at 49% (35 of 72).  
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting a tough game," North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller said. 
"They were 8-2 in the conference coming in and we hadn't seen them this season. 
We just did what it took to win in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and Johnson frustrated the Spartans in the backcourt throughout the game, 
forcing Sylmar into throwing long passes that helped lead to 17 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar shot 34%, making 20 of 59 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Farmer added 13 points for the Spartans, but didn't help Thompson 
enough when it counted -- hitting a pair of three-pointers during garbage time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only meeting of the season between the leaders of the East Valley 
League (North Hollywood) and Mid-Valley League (Sylmar).

CANYONS OFFICIALS EXONERATE HERRICK AFTER INVESTIGATION; JUNIOR COLLEGE 
BASKETBALL: PROBE FINDS NO EVIDENCE WOMEN'S COACH MADE RACIAL SLUR AGAINST 
VALLEY PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Herrick, women's basketball coach at College of the Canyons, was cleared 
Thursday by school officials of allegations he made a racial slur against 
Valley College players after a game Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-paragraph release challenged by a Valley official, Canyons 
administrators said their internal investigation yielded no evidence to 
"substantiate the allegation that Coach Herrick made a racial slur, and it is 
our conclusion that the charges are unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Hisayasu, dean of student services at Canyons who directed the 
investigation, based the decision on written statements, interviews with 
eyewitnesses available to the school and the review of videotapes from the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing in anything I checked that would indicate (the alleged 
racial slur) occurred," Hisayasu said. "This case was based on a lot of 
circumstantial evidence because we have no concrete evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick, who denied the charges, said he felt vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to be completely exonerated in this way and to be supported by 
the college," Herrick said. "I think Chuck Ferrero (Valley athletic director) 
and the Valley people should be ashamed of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach added he hasn't dismissed the possibility of legal action against 
Valley personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in the process of evaluating that," Herrick said. "But right now 
we want to put it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero criticized the results of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to them saying we are lying," Ferrero said. "Why would we go 
through all this crap if we are lying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said it was unlikely they would pursue the incident with the 
Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero and other Valley officials made the allegation against Herrick after a 
WSC game last month at Canyons. The Cougars won, 88-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coach John Taylor, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, asserted 
that Herrick uttered a racial slur as he walked past the Valley bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he was walking away, he said to me, 'You can take your (racial slur) 
home,' " Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Taylor, one of his assistants and four Valley players 
provided written statements about the incident. The statements were faxed to 
Canyons administrators, who initiated the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, according to Hisayasu, Herrick said he suggested to 
Taylor to "just take your beating, get in the van and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Hisayasu also said written statements provided by Valley contained 
discrepancies, although he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some concern about the credibility of the testimonies," Hisayasu 
said. "There was quite a bit of inconsistencies and a lot of variations in the 
statements made." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero, however, disagreed with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are absolutely no discrepancies," he said. "They all basically say the 
same thing. . . . We did it by the letter. I told the girls to write reports by 
themselves and in their own words. I told the coaches the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero also took exception to Canyons' statement that videotapes of the game 
were reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 " We gave them a copy of our videotape because they didn't have one of their 
own and they kept begging for it," Ferrero said. "The tape showed nothing and 
now it makes it sound like they found something (to support their report)." 
</P>
<P>
 A feud between the programs apparently started two years ago, when Herrick 
took over the Canyons women's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero and then-Coach Doug Michelson, now the Monarch men's coach, accused 
Herrick of illegally contacting a high school player in Valley's recruiting 
area and reported the incident to the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
 The WSC did not penalize Herrick or Canyons, and Herrick accused Valley of 
trying to damage his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Canyons defeated Valley at North Hollywood High, 67-60.  
</P>
<P>
 The game was played without incident and under close scrutiny from uniformed 
security personnel and officials from both schools. Fans were checked with 
metal detectors at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The players and coaches shook hands after the game in what apparently was a 
directive by officials from both schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hisayasu: "We asked both teams to be in absolute high conduct and that 
(shaking hands) was part of it."

RIO MESA SENDS 10 WRESTLERS TO INDIVIDUAL MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Todd Stoke had his way, he would have been coaching his Rio Mesa High 
wrestlers at the Southern Section Division I dual meet championships Wednesday 
instead of watching from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 But 10 Spartan wrestlers -- more than any area school in Division I -- 
qualified for the Southern Section individual championships that begin today. 
The championship round is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Division I wrestlers, including those from the Channel and Marmonte leagues, 
will meet at El Monte High. Wrestlers from the Golden, Mission and Frontier 
leagues will compete in the Division IV meet at Sierra Vista High in Baldwin 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the top two Channel teams qualified for the team championships, but 
third-place Rio Mesa tempered that disappointment with a strong effort last 
weekend in the league individual championships, the qualifying tournament for 
today's meet. Nine wrestlers from five-time defending league champion Ventura 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised we qualified a lot of wrestlers, but I am surprised we 
qualified more than Ventura," Stoke said. "We just had a good week of 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, ranked second in Division I, is led by Ryan Atherton (103 pounds), a 
finalist in last year's individual championships. At least four wrestlers from 
seven of the eight Marmonte schools qualified for the championships. Sophomore 
twins Ronnie (112 pounds) and Rick Peterson (119) lead a contingent of seven 
from league champion Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division IV, Golden League champion Highland, ranked No. 1, has nine 
qualifiers. Junior Roger Izzo (130 pounds) is 38-3, and six teammates won 
league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake finished in fifth place in the Mission League but the 
Saracens had six qualifiers, including four league champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three wrestlers from Alemany qualified but junior James Castenada (112) 
finished the season undefeated (29-0) and is a section champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontier League champion Santa Paula had qualifiers in 12 of the 13 classes. 
Ruben Venagas (145 pounds) leads the Cardinals with a 20-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The top five finishers in each weight class in Division I and the top two in 
Division IV qualify for the Masters meet, Feb. 26.

COACH ISN'T JUST A TITLE FOR HILLIARD; HE MAKES MOST OF TALENT AT 
HARVARD-WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, you think Greg Hilliard must be on Valium or something. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvard-Westlake High basketball coach sits quietly during games. A bad 
play by his team or questionable call by an official? He just winces and stares 
at his cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to tell him to stand up, to yell. You want to remind him coach is 
also a verb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that even if I'm standing up, my kids can't hear me sometimes," 
Hilliard says. "I think it's more of a show when a coach is up pacing the 
sideline and having all kinds of antics. I've yet to figure out how a coach 
gets the attention of his players other than distracting them from what they 
are supposed to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about. . . ?  
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, if you've ever played in a big game where the arena is noisy, 
there's no communication going on between the coach and the players anyway," he 
says. "And they're going to have to know how to function without you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bobby Knight wins and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the work takes place in practice anyway," Hilliard says. "The players 
are either ready or they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Got an answer for everything, doesn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 He ought to. He has spent 19 of the past 20 years as a high school basketball 
coach, which is exactly how he'd like to spend the next 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard, 268-154 in his career, has no interest in coaching a college team, 
or even a powerhouse high school team. There's no challenge if you just have 
great athletes season after season, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard, 44, is happiest when he's showing future computer scientists and 
neurosurgeons how to beat a full-court press. In his ninth season at Harvard, 
he's taken a team consisting of only three scorers -- 6-foot-7 freshmen Jason 
and Jarron Collins and senior shooter Scott Garson -- and molded it into the 
No. 1 team in the Southern Section's Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Wolverines (22-2) beat Workman tonight at home in the first round of 
the III-A playoffs, they will tie the school record for victories, which was 
set by a bunch of volleyball-turned-basketball players under Hilliard's 
instruction in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Three victories after that and the Wolverines will have the first Southern 
Section boys' basketball championship in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting such challenges is why Hilliard gets out of bed every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who quit his previous coaching job because he was winning too 
much. A fitness nut who stopped running marathons after he finally completed 
one in less than three hours. A guy who left law school because what he really 
wanted to do was teach Fred Smith how to throw a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was 7 years old, playing for a team Hilliard coached during his 
sophomore year of high school in Beaverton, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred couldn't throw the ball like the other kids. Wearing his glove on his 
left hand and throwing with his right, Fred couldn't throw the ball within 15 
feet of his target. Then Hilliard had an idea. He had Fred try a throw with his 
left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He picked it up with his left hand and threw me a strike," Hilliard 
remembers. "So I said, 'Fred, you're left-handed,' and he said, 'No, my mom and 
dad told me I'm right-handed.' So I had a little conversation with his mom and 
she said, 'We'd like him to be right-handed because right-handers have it lot 
easier. Could you make him right-handed?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard laughed and simply turned Fred into the team's star left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 He must have thought of Fred years later when he dropped his plans to "save 
the world, like everyone in the '60s and '70s was trying to do." A political 
science major during his basketball and tennis careers at Occidental College, 
Hilliard dropped out after two years of law school at Lewis & Clark College in 
Portland, Ore., to become a teacher and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing kids get some enjoyment out of improving and having fun out there was 
what I liked," Hilliard says. "I just loved to see them smile." 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a master's degree in history and planned to be a history teacher and 
coach. Just out of school, Hilliard was hired in 1974 by the Catlin-Gabel 
School, a private school in Portland, to coach the high school basketball team 
and teach physical education. So much for history. He's been a physical 
education teacher ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught all 13 grades at Catlin-Gabel, and even drove the bus for basketball 
games, but what he did most was win at a school that had about 180 students in 
the ninth-through-12th grades and zero basketball tradition. In 10 seasons, he 
was 134-73 at Catlin-Gabel. The highlight was 1982, when the team had a 21-2 
record, won the regional championship and finished sixth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't match up athletically with other teams, but Greg got the kids to 
believe," says John Hamilton, Hilliard's assistant and successor at 
Catlin-Gabel. "That's why they might have gone farther than some thought they 
could in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the challenges soon ran out at Catlin-Gabel. Hilliard had built the 
program to the point where it could go no higher. He returned to Southern 
California and worked for a year as a personal trainer in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When the job opened at Harvard, Hilliard saw it as the perfect new challenge. 
The school's tuition and academic standards eliminated most of the best 
basketball players.

 In Hilliard's first season with Harvard, the team was 4-16. Hilliard remembers 
one game that season against Morningside, which had Elden Campbell, now of the 
Lakers. During the first few minutes of the game, Campbell caught two Harvard 
shots out of the air. Didn't block them. Caught them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sort of summed up the first season," Hilliard says. 
</P>
<P>
 After that season, Hilliard told his players they were going to be league 
champions in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I was high on something," Hilliard says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Hilliard was right. The Wolverines were 21-6 in 1986-87, and won 
the Santa Fe League title. The team would continue to dominate that league, 
which later became the San Fernando League. Including this season, Hilliard is 
134-81 at Harvard, coaching players who have gone on to do just about 
everything but play Division I college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines won by running. Contrary to popular belief, Hilliard says, less 
talented teams win by speeding the tempo, not slowing it. After all, how good 
or tall do you have to be to make a layup on a two-on-one break? 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Hilliard's offense was conditioning, which was perfect for him. 
Hilliard has run five marathons, the last in 2 hours 57 minutes about eight 
years ago, and a mini-triathlon. He works out for three hours a day before 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting his team in shape was no problem. Finding better players? That has 
always been a problem, but not Hilliard's. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard has gone out of his way to build a reputation as a coach who stays 
within the rules. He avoids the American Roundball Corp., a Valley-based 
basketball organization that traditionally showcases the area's top pre-high 
school players. Hilliard refused to let ARC use the gym at Harvard, fearing 
even the appearance of recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Collins twins, known for years in ARC circles as top prospects, 
showed at Harvard last fall, some might have wondered how Hilliard coaxed them 
to attend an academic school with little basketball tradition. He didn't coax 
them at all. He insists he hadn't even heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Garson, this year's three-point specialist, attended Montclair Prep as a 
freshman, but then started shopping for another school. His father, Lee Garson, 
called Hilliard and asked to chat about his son playing for the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Mr. Garson, I'd love to meet you, but I can't even talk to you 
until you've made an application,' " Lee Garson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard's ideal world would be one in which high school basketball coaches 
walk into the gym at the start of practice each season and make do with whoever 
has shown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told by some fathers that I will never be successful unless I learn 
to play 'The Game,' " Hilliard says. "I don't know what game that is. I'm 
coaching basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking the new challenge of a tougher league than the San Fernando, Hilliard 
pushed for the Wolverines to move into the Mission League before the 1992-93 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The move happened to coincide with a dearth of talent at Harvard, which went 
5-20, but that's turned around this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A husband and father of 2-year-old daughter Megan, Hilliard does not let 
basketball engulf him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot of wisdom that goes on during the game," Hilliard 
says. "Every fan knows when to call a timeout, and they all know in a 45-second 
timeout you can say one to three things, and they can probably all say those 
things. The real work is the organization and planning and developing the 
players to function effectively without you." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the type of player Hilliard sees at Harvard is not likely to require 
too much redundant drilling or aggressive manhandling. Hilliard learned that 
was no way to coach when his high school football coach smashed a clipboard 
over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played for a more classy coach," Garson says. "You never see him 
ranting and raving like some other coaches. You always hear of Harvard-Westlake 
being a class team, but now we also have the reputation of being a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds J.W. Hobson, who graduated from Harvard last spring: "He treats you like 
an adult unless you prove you need to be treated otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard respects his players enough to risk the No. 1 seeding in the 
playoffs. One of his traditions at Harvard is to start the senior reserves in 
the final home game. Last week against Bishop Montgomery, the team behind 
Harvard in the standings, Hilliard was tested. A Wolverine loss would drop them 
from the top spot in the division. But Hilliard kept his promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had enough confidence in us," says Andy Yeatman, one of the reserves who 
started. "That was pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The reserves played Bishop Montgomery close -- the game was tied at halftime 
-- and the Wolverines won, 64-52. By keeping his promise, he took a risk. But 
the last thing Hilliard wants is easy victories, anyway.

HAZELTON ISN'T READY TO ACCEPT BURBANK OFFER

<P>
 Burbank Unified School District's Board of Education unanimously approved the 
hiring of John Hazelton as football coach at Burbank High on Thursday night, 
ending more than two weeks of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hazelton, who has a year of head coaching experience at Banning High 
and has served two stints as an assistant at Montclair Prep, said he is not 
ready to accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton said he wants to consult with Montclair Prep Principal Vernon Simpson 
before he makes the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hazelton brought two prospective assistant coaches with him to a meeting 
of the board -- Moorpark High and former Cal State Northridge assistant Jim 
Clausen and Montclair Prep assistant John Greaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, minus its fifth member, Denise Wilcox, met in closed session before 
announcing its decision. DANA HADDAD

YIELD CLIMBS ON A HINT OF INFLATION TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * The bond market brushed off a surprisingly tame January 
inflation report and zeroed in on a lesser economic indicator, sending 
long-term bond yields yields shooting up to 6 1/2-month highs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market seesawed to a lower level as technical forces intensified 
selling incited by rising interest rates and lingering wariness about 
inflation. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's abrupt turnabout reflected a new market psychology colored 
by the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board is inclined to raise 
short-term rates at any sign of inflationary pressure, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield spurted to 6.54%, the 
highest level seen since early August. On Wednesday, the bond closed at 6.46%. 
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, closed down 1 1/32 points, or 
$10.31 per $1,000 in face value, after initially rising 3/4 point. 
</P>
<P>
 In short-term securities, the 5% five-year note was ending 14/32 off, at 98 
2/32, to yield 5.44%, while the 4% two-year note was ending off 4/32 at 99 
3/32, to yield 4.48%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices advanced earlier, after the Labor Department reported no change in 
the consumer price index in January -- the first month in which costs failed to 
rise in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond prices began tumbling after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
issued its regional manufacturing survey, showing what many took to be signs of 
impending inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they were generally surprised by the strength of the market 
selloff, particularly following a consumer inflation report that ordinarily 
would have given the market a strong lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could understand the first couple of hours of today's trade, the uptick of 
3/4 point,"' said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S.G. Warburg & Co. "But the 
move down has me befuddled." Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The stock market was shaken by the Philadelphia Fed's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average veered within a 50-point range. After working 
its way through the wobbly session, the blue-chip indicator closed 14.63 off at 
3,922.64. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Big Board, losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the late count 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading was active. Big Board volume came 
to 338.89 million shares, up from 295.42 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial burst of stock buying in the morning subsided when the bond market 
abruptly reversed course and lost ground. Computer-guided program selling 
intensified the decline in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Valassis Communications surged 5 3/4 to 17 1/2 in unusually heavy trading. A 
competitor of Valassis is getting out of the free-standing inserts business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among groups hit by profit taking were cyclical and telecommunications 
stocks. General Motors fell 1 to 60, Alcoa dropped 7/8 to 78 3/4, AT&T dropped 
3/8 to 54 1/4 and Bell Atlantic shed 1 1/4 to 53 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive financial stocks were also weak, with insurer American 
International Group down 1 to 88 7/8 and Federal National Mortgage Assn. off 1 
3/4 to 85. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raytheon fell 3 1/2 to 62 after the Army said it selected a new Loral 
missile to upgrade the current Patriot anti-missile system over Raytheon's 
multiple-mode missile. Loral ended up 3/8 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing rose up 1 1/4 to 47 3/4. The jet manufacturer will get a substantial 
amount of new business due to Saudi Arabia's $6-billion order for commercial 
aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which rose 1 1/8 to 120. 
</P>
<P>
 * International Game Technology added 1 1/8 to 28 1/4 after Smith Barney 
raised the firm's investment rating to "buy" from "outperform." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hewlett-Packard gained 5/8 to 89 3/4 after its investment rating was raised 
to "outperform" from "neutral" by Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended 
off 120.72 points at 18,931.39 as arbitrage-linked buying kicked in at the 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 closed 7.89 points down at 2,128.72. London's 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 7.6 points to 3,425.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 4.71 points to 2,775.52 in a light 
session marked by Telefonos de Mexico losses on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar edged lower against the German mark despite an interest rate cut 
by Germany's central bank. The greenback was mixed against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.S. currency closed at 1.722 German marks, down from 
Wednesday's 1.723. It rose to 104.17 Japanese yen from 103.80 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the New York Comex, gold closed at $382.80 an ounce, off 80 cents, while 
silver fell 4.4 cents to $5.230 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures prices rebounded from a two-month low as two OPEC members 
expressed support for production cuts, but analysts doubted the cartel will 
act. Light, sweet crude oil for March delivery ended 30 cents higher on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange at $14.23 a barrel.

HEAT RAVE; THE HOT TROPIC OF CONVERSATION THIS SEASON IS THE WARMING TREND OF 
ISLE STYLES THAT ARE SIMPLE, LOOSE AND NEUTRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pleasure-seekers wanting to escape the winter rains for tropical heat need 
wardrobes that will help them adapt to the sun, sand and friendly natives. 
Island getaways require the kind of relaxed clothing designed for unwinding on 
the beach, sipping drinks festooned with paper umbrellas. When in doubt about 
what to pack, vacationers should do as the islanders do -- find clothes that 
are cool and comfortable, in fun prints that lift the spirits. Fortunately, 
spring collections that are perfect for weathering the tropical heat are just 
arriving in stores. The clothes have simple lines, loose construction and 
neutral hues that make them ideal for the islands. The shades of blue, white, 
taupe, beige and other neutrals let tourists blend in with their surroundings 
instead of standing out like, well, tourists. Sure to put one in the vacation 
mode are spring's bold ethnic, floral and tropical prints. Escada has a 
collection of blue and white tropical print separates, just the thing for 
distant shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection includes a tropical-print chiffon chemise ($760) that can tie 
at the waist to beat the heat, a silk jumpsuit ($1,000), sheer silk palazzos 
($600), a short-sleeved, double-breasted jacket in solid navy ($800) and 
relaxed silk shorts ($420). All pieces mix and match to stretch one's limited 
vacation wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tropical prints are a great vacation look. They lend themselves to casual 
dressing," says Michele Vicale, manager of Escada in South Coast Plaza, Costa 
Mesa. "It's also a theme that plays very well to the lifestyle of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the wild tropical prints of seasons past. They come in two or 
three subtler colors instead of a riot of Carmen Miranda brights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clean, very understated," Vicale says. "Marine navy replaces black 
for spring. It's neutral ground to work from." 
</P>
<P>
 Loose-fitting clothes in natural fibers, such as walking shorts made of cotton 
or linen blends, are popular travel companions, says Mary Rubenstein, co-owner 
of Mi Place in Laguna Niguel and Fullerton. Tanks, shells, lightweight fly-away 
jackets, lace skirts and flared-bottom pants in natural tones top her list of 
what to take on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the beiges, creams, khakis -- it's a big year for those colors," 
Rubenstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 En Route, a group of rayon separates in earth-toned Tahitian prints, is just 
the thing for island dressing. The collection's flowy jacket ($280), tank top 
($85), palazzos ($95) and other components all mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix-and-match separates are just the ticket for travelers with small 
suitcases. Collections that feature coordinates in the same color group but 
different prints allow vacationers to get maximum mileage from a few pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to mix patterns in the same color story," says Sylvia Rodriguez, 
owner of My Girl in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 One collection of separates by Sugar and Spice comes in a variety of prints 
that work together thanks to the brown and beige color combination. There's a 
vest-style top ($340), a jacket ($520), palazzos ($400), a sheer skirt ($300) 
and shorts ($280) that are all interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez encourages her vacation-bound customers to experiment with styles, 
wearing a skirt unbuttoned to the thigh to show some leg or a sheer blouse for 
those unwilling to bare their skin entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your vacation wardrobe should be different (from) your usual day-to-day 
wardrobe. You should be freer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the body-hugging, stretchy styles of springs past, this year's 
loose-fitting clothes flatter the figure with subtle, body-baring details such 
as skirts that slit to reveal a thigh or tunics that tie in front to expose the 
midriff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is loose-fitting, untucked, drapey chic. The styles allow for 
comfort and tastefulness. There's nothing close to the body. But there is 
bareness," says Sandy Magill Duckworth, district manager for Mondi at 
MainPlace/Santa Ana and Fashion Island Newport Beach. The pieces in Mondi's La 
Nature collection, for instance, include a wrap top that exposes the midriff 
($170) with a full slitted skirt ($230) in a brown and taupe Indian print. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slits are high, but the clothes don't fit tight," Magill Duckworth says. 
"It's a peekaboo type of thing. There are very long skirts with a slit up the 
thigh, but no hot pants." 
</P>
<P>
 Many garments, such as the loose-fitting, cocoa-colored vest ($190) and 
matching trousers ($230), come in synthetic fabrics such as microfiber or 
viscose that don't wrinkle, making them ideal for travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can put that entire outfit in your handbag," and it will come out ready 
to be worn, Duckworth says. "You could sleep in it on the airplane on your way 
to the Bahamas, and look just as stunning when you get off as when you got on."

 In the spirit of the Red Baron, Split has snowboard headgear inspired by 
bomber caps from World War I ($24). Instead of leather, the Huntington Beach 
street-wear line opted for polar fleece and flannel. "It keeps you warmer than 
a ball cap, which is what everyone wears on the slopes," says co-owner Scott 
Bailey. "It's for the individual who wants to set himself apart." The 
bull's-eye logo on the forehead further conveys the die-hard attitude of the 
sport. Cut the Phat

 Janet Jackson started it with last year's film "Poetic Justice." Now the rage 
among the teen and twentysomething set for thick Jamaican braids has been cut 
short, says stylist Lenore Smith of Hair By Lenore in Tustin. "The length to 
have is a bob." The latest influence is the sharp-tongued lawyer on Fox's 
"Living Single," played by actress Erika Alexander. Smith, who has been 
braiding for 17 years, says it's not difficult, just time-consuming. Expect to 
sit eight to 12 hours. Prices start at $150. Java Gems

 Apparently caffeine mania goes beyond a good brew. The steaming coffee cup 
pendant from Minnesota-based Torq is the accessory label's hottest piece. 
Designer Nancy Grist estimates her company has sold more than 2,000 of "Refill" 
as necklaces, chokers, key chains and zipper pulls ($9-$24). "My designs have 
always focused on what people love. I guess coffee is more than a drink," Grist 
says. Her stainless-steel pendants include burning hearts, crowns, saw blades 
and other pop symbols. Winning Style

 Dressing the CBS announcers for the Olympic Winter Games was no last-minute 
graze through the season's trends. North Hollywood-based Ward Rhobe consultant 
Richard Valenza spent a year forming a look that would capture the spirit of 
the event while balancing style with fashion. The result: a British invasion of 
Norway with classically tailored menswear that uses a mix of patterns and bold 
colors. Vests -- in fabric and colors that reflect individual personality -- 
are as mandatory as a tie. Valenza turned to French-made Faconnable, sold 
exclusively in the U.S. at Nordstrom. ROSE APODACA

 I t arrived, as we knew it eventually would: rotten weather. Or at least the 
Southern California version of rotten, which means rain.  
</P>
<P>
 It's axiomatic that Southlanders have trouble coping with wet weather (as 
opposed to, say, people from Seattle, where they run for cover like moles when 
the sun comes out), but do we redeem ourselves with foul weather fashion 
smarts? Just how do you get through the very occasional bout of wet weather 
looking good and staying dry?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I suppose I shouldn't snicker at the people I see on the streets in a 
storm who are running like ants with newspapers held over their heads and not a 
raincoat or umbrella in sight. In this corner of the world, we think of rain as 
an aberration. It always takes us by surprise. Little kids get goggle-eyed: 
"Mom! Water! From the sky!"  
</P>
<P>
 We are why the collapsible umbrella was invented. Don't want to be burdened 
with a conventional, cane-type brolly? Stick a little collapsible number in 
your purse or glove compartment or even in your hip pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for some reason, we haven't gotten the hang of this yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I have two trench coats, two raincoats, a million cheap umbrellas, a 
couple of rain bonnets -- and what did I grab when I waltzed out the door in a 
downpour last week? Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain will have stopped by the time I get to work," I told myself. Not. 
When I got to my desk, my shirt and trousers were soaked, and my hair looked 
like I'd just swum the English Channel. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, which was also rainy, I toted my big blue-and-white 
umbrella, the one I bought in Berlin the year the wall came down. There I was, 
in my usual basic-black-from-head-to-toe duds, carrying this huge, 
non-coordinating contraption. But I arrived dry. Not a hair out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Every few years I go to England on vacation, and every few years I get all 
dazzled by the spiffy wet weather gear the Brits are so good at producing. And 
I end up buying some of it. The latest purchase may be the coolest: the 
quintessential English umbrella. You walk with this one and swing it like a 
cane. It has a broad, deep canopy in classic black (you gotta save the colors 
for the golf course); the ferrule is brass, and the shaft and handle are highly 
polished Malacca cane. You could look like Quasimodo in real life, but when you 
carry that umbrella, people think you're Rex Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony: About the only time I ever use it is when I take it on vacation. To 
England. Here at home, I let a smile, and my car, be my umbrella. We must all 
be nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Truth is, in California I feel goofy in rain gear, conspicuous, sort of 
like I'm trying too hard. But I really admire someone who dons a great looking 
trench coat, boots and a colorful scarf when the skies are gray. They look 
smart. Prepared. When I'm in New York, I dress that way, rain or shine. Ditto 
London. Everybody does . Here, I buy the stuff and then mostly leave it in the 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
 But how I love to dress for those cozy moments indoors when the rain is 
hitting the windowpane like a hammer. I throw on a snug sweater, comfy slacks 
and suede boots. It's the closest we coastal types get to apres-ski wear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Eventually, though, you're probably going to have to go out in it and get 
your feet wet. And this is where women have it all over men: boots. There are 
all sorts of stylish weatherproof women's boots on the market, and it seem that 
whenever real rain threatens, every woman in a business suit is wearing them. 
And they look great. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, on the other hand, have three choices, none of them particularly good: We 
can wear running shoes to work; we can wear hacked-up dress shoes to work and 
keep a good pair in the bottom desk drawer, or we can wear galoshes over good 
dress shoes. In any case, we look silly. I vote for calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: How about wearing old tennies and bringing along an extra pair of shoes 
in your bowling bag? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Yeah, I can see it: You're a hard-charging, meat-eating young arbitrager 
clawing at every chance to make your in-office competition look foolish, and 
you show up in an Austin Reed suit and a pair of Converse All-Stars. It won't 
matter how fast you unlace them and slip into your Florentine tasseled loafers 
once you get in the front door. The harpoon will already have been sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Well, the next time a typhoon hits, picture me soaking wet. Oh, I'll 
stalk my closet for a waterproof look that will keep my powder dry. I may even 
toss on a raincoat and do a pirouette in front of the mirror before I take it 
off and throw it in the back of my car. 
</P>
<P>
 A blustery-day dresser I'm not. As a California native, about the only thing I 
wear that's waterproof is mascara.

BEHIND THE SCENES; ROMANCE AND MUSIC FILL AIR AT VALENTINE DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flowers led the way to romance at the Valentine's Dinner Dance sponsored by 
the Black Singles of Orange County. Crimson carnations were handed out to 
everyone attending Sunday's heart-beating event at Randell's Jazz Club in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 During the evening, 60 guests dined at candle-lit tables that overlooked a 
lake, then danced to the sounds of Itzafunkthang. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the men donned the ultimate in sweep-her-off-her-feet wear: a suave 
suit and bold tie. Most of the women wore cocktail dresses in colors associated 
with sweetheart's day: red and white. 
</P>
<P>
 For the women, a lot of attention was also spent on dressing their hair with 
French rolls, up 'do's, decorative hairpieces and beaded braids. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Dekine of Fountain Valley went lustrous from head to toe, wearing a 
gold two-piece after-6 suit with matching rimmed hat and shoes.

FAUX PAS REPORT: FOR THE RIGHT GRUNGE LOOK, IT'S MORE MIX THAN MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 That "Northern Exposure," Seattle grunge look has overtaken Southwestern garb 
as the in style, which may mean tossing out some of your old rules about what 
goes with what. 
</P>
<P>
 Flannel shirts are in, and lots of guys are wearing them. They're even putting 
them on over undershirts for that lumberjack look. However, many men are 
wearing brown tees with brown plaid flannels or, even worse, powder-blue 
undershirts with a navy flannel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to wear colors that don't exactly coordinate," says Pat Lueras of 
the Army-Navy Store in Orange. "And stay away from anything bright; you'll want 
to go with muted tones." 
</P>
<P>
 Wear a navy T-shirt with brown, or maybe a dark maroon with a forest-green 
flannel. Match them with some ratty jeans and black biker boots, and people 
will be asking you for directions to the Space Needle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smear campaign: Full, sensuous lips are in. Ask Cindy Crawford or Paulina. And 
many women are trying to copy them by layering double coats of lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's applied too thick, lipstick looks sloppy, not glamorous," says 
fashion designer Carol Steele of Newport Beach. "It smears at some point on 
your face, and you also risk getting it on your clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 After applying liner to frame your lips, use medium pressure to put on your 
lipstick. Touch up lightly. If it's too thick, dab it off on a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burned out: Shaving your face is fun when you're 16, but after a few years it 
becomes one of those miserable necessities. Most guys dislike shaving; maybe 
that's why so many walk around with painful-looking razor burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys want to cut 'against the grain,' which creates that 
irritation," says barber Gordon Webb of Santa Ana. "If you want to stop having 
razor burn, you've got to go against that urge." 
</P>
<P>
 Cut "with the grain" with a relatively new razor. If you go over the area and 
it hasn't been cut close enough for you, spread more cream around and try 
again.

STYLE FILE: GRIN AND BARE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blame it on vanity. Or on baby boomers with too much money and too much riding 
on first impressions, job interviews and business deals. The fact is, a growing 
dental specialty is filling people's needs for capping, covering and whitening 
their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetic dentistry works in three ways: repairing damaged teeth, preventing 
further damage and improving overall appearance. Dentists achieve this through 
bonding or with caps. A bleaching process lightens stains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aesthetic dentistry should be quiet dentistry," says Huntington Beach dentist 
Stanley Anzis. "No one should be able to tell you've had your teeth repaired or 
whitened." 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds painless, but there are some caveats. 
</P>
<P>
 Anzis suggests choosing a dentist through a referral by a friend or colleague 
who has had similar work done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capped teeth should not have dark lines at the gums," Anzis says. "Bonding 
may be slightly visible but only under a bright light." 
</P>
<P>
 Use caution when choosing over-the-counter self-bleaching kits. These 
whitening products cost far less than a trip to the dentist, but bleaching 
trays don't fit everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the peroxide mixtures in these kits are mild, any leakage could 
cause damage to the gums," Anzis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitening toothpastes may contain abrasives that are harmful to gums and could 
permanently damage enamel. Ask your dentist for suggested brands before trying 
one of these products. 
</P>
<P>
 People think teeth must be bright white to be healthy, but yellow or gray is 
the natural color for teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "No product or method will make stains disappear totally," Anzis says. What 
Stains Teeth Tooth enamel stains slowly and permanently. The most common 
surface stains come from tea, coffee or tobacco, but some stains come from the 
inside out: * Large concentrations of fluoride in drinking water may cause 
yellowing. * Calcium deficiencies cause chalky white spots, commonly called 
"headlights." * The antibiotic tetracycline can turn teeth gray. * The most 
commonly used filling material, silver amalgam, may cause a chemical reaction 
that stains surrounding teeth. * Broken teeth can turn brown from blood seeping 
into the pulp chamber. How to Get a Bright Smile BLEACHING Hydrogen peroxide is 
an anti-bacterial and cleaning chemical used in facial cleansers and bleaches. 
When applied to teeth, a mild peroxide mixture lightens enamel. Using a mixture 
too strong or too often can damage gums. Whether peroxide is applied in the 
office or at home, dentists should monitor closely for damage to gums. What to 
expect: Several treatments required; results may last less than a year. 
Estimated cost: $300-$600 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surface Bleaching Performed in dentist's office 1. Rubber dam molded over gums 
to isolate treatment area. 2. Peroxide mixture painted on surface of teeth. 
Rubber dam removed, peroxide rinsed off; teeth polished. * 
</P>
<P>
 Performed at home 1. Dentist sends patient home with peroxide kit; recommended 
peroxide mixture is swabbed inside bleaching tray. 2. Tray is inserted over 
teeth; worn for prescribed length of time only. * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside-Out Bleaching Peroxide mixture is injected into the root canal and 
seeps into the tooth. The process, called "walking bleaching," takes two to 
three weeks to lighten stains. * 
</P>
<P>
 COMPOSITE BONDING Claylike composite mixture molded to chipped tooth and held 
in place with a liquid bonding agent. * 
</P>
<P>
 What to expect: Good for chipped teeth. Better than caps for children with 
growing teeth; may last for more than five years. * 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $200-$2,000, depending on extent of damage, number of teeth involved. * 
</P>
<P>
 1. Mild acid brushed on to make chipped tooth more porous for adhesion. 2. 
Composite mixture plugged on to chipped area. 3. Mixture sculpted to match 
original tooth's shape; once hardened, bonded tooth is bleached to match other 
teeth. * 
</P>
<P>
 CAPS Hard, prefabricated shells cast of porcelain or acrylic are laminated to 
teeth. Best for teeth not used for heavy chewing. Excellent choice to repair 
severely chipped teeth or to close gaps. * 
</P>
<P>
 What to expect: Resists staining; with proper care may last up to 20 years. * 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $200-$2,000, depending on extent of damage, number of teeth involved. * 
</P>
<P>
 1. Small amount of tooth enamel scraped off both teeth. 2. Impressions taken 
for caps, sent to lab to be cast. Gapped teeth etched with acid; liquid bonding 
agent applied. 3. Caps attached, fitted for size and comfort; permanently 
affixed. Grin Quiz Celebrities are asked to do it all the time: Smile! Some 
have perfect smiles and some . . . not so perfect. For some tongue-in-cheek 
fun, match each star with his or her toothsome grin. * 
</P>
<P>
 Grin Quiz answers: 1.Julia Roberts, 2.George Bush, 3.Connie Chung, 4.Madonna, 
5.Garth Brooks, 6.Tom Hanks, 7.Whoopi Goldberg, 8.Anthony Hopkins, 9.David 
Letterman, 10.Bill Clinton, 11.Jack Nicholson, 12.Marilyn Monroe. *

BETTER CONDITIONING; ACTIVE WEAR LEAPS TO A HIGHER LEVEL AS CREATORS ADD 
PADDING AND REINFORCED SEAMS AND REDUCE BOUNCE, CHAFE AND SWEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hard-core aerobics activists apparently have been whining. They want the burn, 
but they want it while sitting on the soft, cushy seat of padding in warm, dry 
clothing that sucks in body fat and supports creaky knees. And the women would 
like a bit of cleavage showing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As equipment and training regimens become more sophisticated, so does 
clothing. The people who create workout wear have been toiling to eliminate the 
bounce, chafe, sweat and stench associated with exercise -- without sacrificing 
style. Their latest innovations include reinforced panels, extra padding and 
sophisticated fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Fibers are stronger and more elastic. Fabrics are designed not only to absorb 
and disperse moisture but also to fight bacteria. Garments are engineered to 
support muscles and protect joints. It seems the only people still wearing 
old-fashioned sweat pants are those who don't intend to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nautilus, the Independence, Va., company associated with muscle-crunching 
equipment, will begin selling its inaugural line of apparel and footwear next 
month in major sporting-goods stores. Most of the clothing items are made of 
heavy-duty Supplex, a synthetic fiber that's much thicker and stronger than 
spandex. It "gives a feeling of compression," says David Erwin, Nautilus design 
director. "People don't like the feel of body fat moving around."  
</P>
<P>
 The company's $85 multipurpose pants feature a double layer of heavyweight 
quilted Supplex at the knees, a show of extra support for aerobicizers, 
weightlifters, runners or anyone with weak joints.  
</P>
<P>
 Shorts and sports tops, $22 to $55, have strategically placed (small of the 
back, chest, underarm) panels of Aquator, a wicking (sweat dispensing) fabric. 
And the $8 socks and $75 weight-training shoes contain agents that fight that 
gym-bag aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Hind, a San Luis Obispo maker of active wear, collaborated with Cal Poly 
researchers in developing its wicking fabric, DryLete. The company, whose line 
is sold at Big 5 and Sports Chalet, is also working with cyclists to create 
more comfortable gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Its cycling unitard, $64, comes with a thick crotch padding that mimics the 
shape of the bicycle seat. The cycling pants, $70, have a padded crotch and a 
double layer of fabric in the knees, not so much for support as for warmth. And 
to prevent chaffing along the inner thigh, Hind moved seams of the garment to 
the front and back. 
</P>
<P>
 A design advance of another kind offers support and separation for women who 
like the comfort of a sports bra. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all of the uni-boob construction," avid aerobicizer Kimberly 
Mattson says of the first sports bras. "They made my chest look like a shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mattson, who lives in Los Angeles, looked into the sports-bra market, found 
a niche, ran some numbers and hooked up with a pattern maker. The result is a 
$35 underwire bra -- made of Supplex, lace and non-stretch straps -- that looks 
like fine lingerie. It is sold in sizes 32-B to 40-D under the label By 
Kimberly at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 For women whose problem area is below the waist, Carol Green has developed 
matte nylon/Lycra bike pants and leggings with satin tummy- and thigh-control 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satin makes them look tuxedo-ish, and those panels hold in everything," 
Green says. The $40 to $80 line, Aubergine, is sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Neiman Marcus.

YOUR WHEELS / RALPH VARTABEDIAN: ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SLAMMED BY INSURANCE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety sells cars. So, it's not surprising auto makers are rushing to satisfy 
consumer demand, outpacing even federal safety regulations enacted in past 
years when the industry often fought stiffer rules. 
</P>
<P>
 A device that has become the Holy Grail of auto safety is the anti-lock brake 
system, a tricky piece of technology that prevents wheels from locking on wet 
or icy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling point of these systems is that they are supposed to prevent 
motorists from losing steering control and make quicker stops in slick 
conditions. They are also touted as a benefit in emergency stops on dry 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes have become so popular that General Motors has made them 
standard equipment on virtually all its cars. But a new study suggests 
anti-lock brakes don't deliver the safety benefits consumers believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a key report based on accident data, the Insurance Institute for Highway 
Safety says anti-lock brakes do nothing to reduce fatalities and nothing to 
reduce automobile accident claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, funded by contributions from auto insurance companies, compared 
accident and insurance loss data for cars equipped with anti-lock brake systems 
to the same models with standard brakes. The findings were that claim frequency 
and the average amounts of insurance payments were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute charges that auto makers have engaged in misleading commercials 
that imply that anti-lock systems can prevent crashes because of their better 
stopping power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been marketed as an alternative to air bags," says institute 
spokesman Chuck Hurley. "People think if they have bought a small car with 
anti-lock brakes, they are protected. Well, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have attacked the study, saying that it is based on a very small 
sample of cases and that research proves anti-lock systems are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think anti-lock brake systems are a terrific feature," says Pam Kueber, a 
Ford spokeswoman. "The customer is voting with his or her dollar that they want 
anti-lock brakes. It keeps your car from spinning out when you brake. It is a 
safety feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Lechtzin, a General Motors spokesman, contends that the study was based on 
"cursory data." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes work by preventing wheels from locking, which can increase 
stopping distance and result in a loss of steering. The systems have motion 
sensors on each wheel, which report to a central computer if a wheel has 
stopped rotating. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer then instructs the hydraulic system to reduce the pressure 
momentarily to that wheel. The action is similar to pumping the brakes, but it 
is much faster and more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley says consumers should apply their money to larger cars rather than pay 
up to $500 for anti-lock brakes. The institute asserts that an accident in a 
small subcompact has double the risk of a fatal injury over a similar accident 
in a full-size car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the institute's data, there are 2.4 fatalities for every 10,000 
vehicles shorter than 95 inches in wheel base. By comparison, cars with more 
than 114 inches of wheel base have 1.1 fatalities for every 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Car companies hate to be asked about the relative merits of size over 
anti-lock brakes because under federal law, they must meet ever stricter fuel 
economy standards. They can meet those goals only by selling a larger 
proportion of small cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to get into that discussion at all," Lechtzin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safety Institute says consumers may still want to buy anti-lock brake 
systems, but that larger cars and air bags make a bigger contribution to 
safety.

to the same models with standard brakes. The findings were that claim frequency 
and the average amounts of insurance payments were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute charges that auto makers have engaged in misleading commercials 
that imply that anti-lock systems can prevent crashes because of their better 
stopping power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been marketed as an alternative to air bags," says institute 
spokesman Chuck Hurley. "People think if they have bought a small car with 
anti-lock brakes, they are protected. Well, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have attacked the study, saying that it is based on a very small 
sample of cases and that research proves anti-lock systems are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think anti-lock brake systems are a terrific feature," says Pam Kueber, a 
Ford spokeswoman. "The customer is voting with his or her dollar that they want 
anti-lock brakes. It keeps your car from spinning out when you brake. It is a 
safety feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Lechtzin, a General Motors spokesman, contends that the study was based on 
"cursory data." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes work by preventing wheels from locking, which can increase 
stopping distance and result in a loss of steering. The systems have motion 
sensors on each wheel, which report to a central computer if a wheel has 
stopped rotating. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer then instructs the hydraulic system to reduce the pressure 
momentarily to that wheel. The action is similar to pumping the brakes, but it 
is much faster and more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley says consumers should apply their money to larger cars rather than pay 
up to $500 for anti-lock brakes. The institute asserts that an accident in a 
small subcompact has double the risk of a fatal injury over a similar accident 
in a full-size car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the institute's data, there are 2.4 fatalities for every 10,000 
vehicles shorter than 95 inches in wheel base. By comparison, cars with more 
than 114 inches of wheel base have 1.1 fatalities for every 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Car companies hate to be asked about the relative merits of size over 
anti-lock brakes because under federal law, they must meet ever stricter fuel 
economy standards. They can meet those goals only by selling a larger 
proportion of small cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to get into that discussion at all," Lechtzin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safety Institute says consumers may still want to buy anti-lock brake 
systems, but that larger cars and air bags make a bigger contribution to 
safety.
