 CUP RUNNING OVER: The quadrennial World Cup soccer tournament, to many the 
ultimate spectacle in sports with a worldwide television audience of more than 
1 billion, is only six months from its first U.S. run, which will include eight 
games at Pasadena's Rose Bowl. . . . But in Orange County, playing soccer 
usually has taken precedence over watching. Participation in county youth 
leagues has grown 21% since 1988, and an adult league run by the city of 
Anaheim has more than 1,400 players. 
</P>
<P>
 FIGHTING FOR TIME: Al Alonzo, a field supervisor at Peralta Canyon Park in 
Anaheim Hills, says the soccer boom has put it in direct competition for field 
space with youth football and baseball. But the biggest conflicts are between 
soccer and the traditional outlet for aging jocks -- softball leagues. . . . 
"Softball has always been our main priority," he said, "but we've had such a 
surge of soccer teams in this area that we are having problems scheduling on 
the lighted fields." 
</P>
<P>
 HOT LEGS: Bobby Bruch (above) coaches the Marina High girls -- top-ranked in 
the county -- and also plays semiprofessionally for the Los Angeles Exiles. . . 
. The Exiles compete at an advanced level -- they have won four consecutive 
league championships -- but the team often gets less attention for its skill 
than for one of its fullbacks: Rod Stewart, the British-born rocker. "Lots of 
people come to watch when there's any rumor of Rod being on the field," Bruch 
said. "Yeah, I would call some of them groupies." 
</P>
<P>
 TONY AND ME: Riki-Ann Serrins, a freshman goalkeeper on the Santa Margarita 
High School girls' soccer team, has a notable mentor: Tony Meola, the goalie 
for the U.S. national team, which has its training headquarters in Mission 
Viejo. Serrins' family was assigned to introduce Meola to the area. . . . 
Riki-Ann participated in Meola's goalkeeping camp in New York last summer, and 
her whole family attended Meola's wedding in New Jersey. Said Serrins: "It was 
just a dream to have them come down here and train in Mission Viejo, and then 
to have Tony as a friend is just a bonus."

 SHERMAN WHAT? It's called Sherman Village, a skinny wedge of suburbia between 
Sherman Oaks and North Hollywood. Although the new area was officially 
designated in September, few people who live and work there are aware of its 
new name (B1). . . . Their confusion reflects the uncertainty of many residents 
as the Valley continues to rename various chunks of itself.

 FLYING HISTORY: Van Nuys Airport is a busy, modern aviation center, with more 
than 1,500 takeoffs and landings annually. So busy and modern, in fact, that 
it's easy to forget it was once home to barnstormers and daredevils like 
aviatrix Pancho Barnes, who later become den-mother to the record-breaking jet 
jockeys at Edwards Air Force base (B4). . . . L.A. Scene also recalls that 
plenty of movies were shot at Van Nuys Airport, including the famous farewell 
scene between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAYLE SPEECH: Former Vice President Dan Quayle, speaking at a Baptist church 
in Lancaster on Sunday, urged conservative Christians to join him in 
proclaiming the importance of family values. He also told 2,000 churchgoers 
that bias against right-wing Christians is "the only acceptable form of bigotry 
in our society" (B1). . . . Above, Quayle chats with Pastor Paul Chappell 
during the dedication.

 IGUANA ALERT: It wasn't your typical lost pet ad: The Pira family of 
Northridge described their missing iguana as being 2 1/2 pounds, four feet long 
and "friendly and green." Iggy wandered off just before Christmas, and its 
owner, 13-year-old Lena Pira, was disconsolate. Not one person called about the 
ad. But eventually, Iggy did turn up -- in an unlikely spot (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 ORPHAN STREET: Everyone agrees that Foothill Boulevard in Tujunga is badly in 
need of repairs. But it hasn't been repaved in years. Why not? Well, it seems 
there was a standoff between the city of Los Angeles and Caltrans over who 
should foot the bill. Street Smart explains all (B1).

 NATIVE PRESENCE: That controversy over construction at a possible Chumash 
graveyard in Camarillo points up the presence of thousands of Native Americans 
in Ventura County. . . . In addition to Chumash descendants, the county is home 
to members of 91 other tribes, according to the Ventura County Indian Education 
Consortium, which helps educate 780 Native American students in seven 
districts. . . . Largest local tribes: Chumash, Cherokee, Chippewa, Apache and 
Sioux.

 PANEL OVERLOAD: Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk wants a seat on the county 
budget committee (B1), but Supervisor John K. Flynn doesn't. He has more than 
enough meetings, thank you. . . . "People think that after the Tuesday board 
meeting, we go home for the week," said Flynn, who serves on the assessment 
appeals board, two airport boards, three water panels, a beach erosion 
committee, the Ventura County Organization of Governments and the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. "Believe me, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 DISASTER AID: When killer floods inundated Ventura County, they established 
radio contact with stricken areas. And when fires blackened the county last 
fall, they worked around the clock to help firefighters communicate. . . . On 
Tuesday, the 100-plus members of the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services 
will be honored by the Board of Supervisors. . . . The ham operators don't get 
in the way of police and firefighters, Undersheriff Richard Bryce said. 
"Usually, they get there first."

 AIRPORT COMING? It's been 26 years since a new commercial airport opened in 
California -- Sacramento Metropolitan. Now some Ventura County leaders want to 
bring commercial flights to the Navy's Point Mugu air strip (B1). . . . Several 
other communities -- including San Bernardino and San Diego -- are also looking 
at turning military bases into airports. . . . But the Ventura County proposal 
is furthest along, said Duane Ferguson of the state Division of Aviation. 
Problem: So far, the airlines aren't interested. Native Americans

CHANGE IN MARS OBSERVER'S FLIGHT PLAN MAY HAVE CAUSED ITS DEMISE; SPACE: 
PRESSURIZING THE $500-MILLION CRAFT'S PROPELLANT TANKS WAS DELAYED FOR 11 
MONTHS. VALVES WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR ALTERED CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seven months before the launch of NASA's Mars Observer, managers made a change 
in the flight plan that might have caused the $500-million spacecraft to vanish 
on Aug. 21, according to sources familiar with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pressurizing the craft's propellant tanks five days after the 
launch, as originally planned, NASA managers decided to delay the procedure for 
11 months -- until the Observer reached the red planet. They did so, 
ironically, to avert a potentially serious leak, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the valves had not been designed to operate under the altered conditions, 
the sources said, and the result was probably an even worse leak that caused a 
catastrophic rupture in a fuel line and spun the craft out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the change in plan was made did not come up during a press 
briefing Wednesday at NASA headquarters, where an independent investigating 
panel reported its conclusions about what happened to the spacecraft and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the program expressed surprise that mention of this 
management decision was omitted from the briefing and also from the report's 
executive summary and overview that were released to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is described, however, in at least two places deep inside the 
report's eight-inch-thick, four-volume documentation, which was not released to 
the press but was available for review at NASA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Coffey, chairman of the investigating board, was traveling and not 
available for comment, his office said. Others on the panel said they were not 
sure why the management decision to delay pressurizing the tanks was not 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance of the Observer is one of several embarrassments for the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, it launched the Hubble Space Telescope with what was later found to 
be a faulty mirror; corrective optics were installed in a spectacular spacewalk 
mission last month. And about the same time that the Observer disappeared, the 
antenna on the Galileo probe to Jupiter malfunctioned. NASA also has been 
plagued by cost overruns on its space station project. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to change the pressurization plan for the Mars probe was made in 
February, 1992, because someone reminded the team that a similar propulsion 
system used on the Viking missions to Mars in the late 1970s had run into 
leakage problems when the fuel tanks were pressurized early in the flights, 
Glenn E. Cunningham, Mars Observer project manager at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 As to why this concern developed so late in the program -- after it was too 
late to make what would have been a simple mechanical fix and still meet the 
launch date -- Cunningham said: "That's the $64 question." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to delay pressurization was not questioned by anyone at the 
contractor firm, JPL or NASA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "With benefit of 20-20 hindsight," Cunningham said, "it appears that probably 
all of us did not do as much analysis on this new condition as probably should 
have been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Controllers at JPL lost contact with the Observer late on Aug. 21, 1993, while 
trying to perform the procedure they had decided to delay: pressurizing the 
propellant tanks. The tanks have to be pressurized to fire the braking rockets, 
which would put the Observer into orbit around Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators said last Wednesday that the most likely cause of the 
spacecraft's catastrophic loss was a "massive failure in the pressurization 
side of the propulsion system." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure in the tanks was required for any major maneuvers by the spacecraft, 
but the Observer team had determined that none would be needed between Earth 
and Mars -- assuming the launch went well. (They had left a small amount of 
residual pressure stored in the tanks before launch for minor course 
corrections en route.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pressurizing the tanks involves opening previously closed valves and releasing 
high-pressure helium gas, whose function is to squeeze the hydrazine fuel and 
nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer out of separate tanks to mix and ignite in a 
controlled way. 
</P>
<P>
 If the investigators' conclusions are correct, the failure's most likely cause 
was the escape of small quantities of the oxidizer through a system of check 
valves during the spacecraft's 11-month, 450-million-mile cruise through space. 
</P>
<P>
 When JPL controllers tried to pressurize the tanks, minute amounts of 
condensed oxidizer may have been carried prematurely into contact with the 
hydrazine fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination would have ignited inside the plumbing and ruptured it, 
spewing jets of propellant into space and putting the spacecraft into a rapid, 
uncontrolled spin that rendered it useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no problem with the check valves," said a planetary engineer who 
asked not to be identified. "The valves were never intended to be operated that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Observer was designed and built, the assumption was that the valves 
would have to operate five days, not 11 months, and not in such cold 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The valves, made by two different subcontractors, were regarded as 
assembly-line items that had been proven in other spacecraft. But they had 
operated only in the relative warmth of near-Earth orbit, investigators said, 
never in the deep cold of an interplanetary voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Observer team debated the change in procedures extensively before 
it was approved, said Peter G. Wilhelm, a member of the investigating panel and 
director of the Naval Center for Space Technology. He focused on the propulsion 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was the decision prudent? That's what the debate was all about," he said, 
adding that changes so late in the game are acceptable, "assuming you make the 
right change."

JAY BLACKTON; WON OSCAR FOR 'OKLAHOMA!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Blackton, an opera conductor who segued to Broadway and Hollywood, earning 
an Academy Award for best musical score for the film version of "Oklahoma!," 
has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackton died Saturday of heart failure at Granada Hills Community Hospital, 
his family said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jay Schwartzdorf in New York City, he was educated at the Juilliard 
School in piano and conducting. Blackton began his career in opera, first as 
assistant conductor of the New York Opera Comique and from 1937 to 1942 as the 
conductor of the St. Louis Municipal Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in St. Louis that he was noticed by the Broadway musical team of 
Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, who moved him back to New York to 
score and conduct their 1943 stage hit, "Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see it at first," Blackton said, recalling his doubts about the 
innovative musical for The Times in 1983. "I was trained for the opera and had 
absolutely no instinct when we opened in New Haven that this would be anything 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackton also was behind the score and baton for the hit Broadway musicals 
"Annie Get Your Gun," "Call Me Madam," "Guys and Dolls," "Hello, Dolly!" and 
"George M." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, Blackton provided the music for such films as "The Merry Widow" 
in 1952, and the movie versions of "Guys and Dolls" and "Oklahoma!" in 1955. He 
was nominated for an Academy Award for both 1955 musicals, and defeated himself 
for "Guys and Dolls" by winning the Oscar for "Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was Blackton's task to coach the non-singing Marlon Brando for his musical 
role in "Guys and Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't a singer, you know," Blackton told The Times, "but he did try. He 
was a professional. Every time he got a tone right, I'd get so excited that 
he'd say, 'Take it easy, Jay.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Blackton worked with Irving Berlin, Fritz Loewe and Noel 
Coward. In 1948, he was part of Bob Hope's first Armed Forces Christmas tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Blackton occasionally conducted the San Fernando Valley Civic 
Light Opera and the Beverly Hills Symphony. His last public appearance was in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackton is survived by his wife, Louise; a son, Bill; a daughter, Jennie 
Philhower, and one grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 Services and burial will be in South Boston, Va.

STREET SMART: MAMMOTH PROJECT WILL INCLUDE MAGNOLIA OFF-RAMP WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Magnolia Avenue off-ramp on the northbound Santa Ana Freeway one of the 
renovation projects scheduled by Caltrans? It begins as one lane, expands to 
one and a half (a drainage channel is part of the second lane), then becomes 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Markson Fullerton Yes, but not for several years. Rebuilding of both 
north and south Magnolia Avenue off-ramps will be part of the major 
reconstruction of the Santa Ana Freeway / Riverside Freeway interchange, which 
is scheduled to begin in 1997 and end by 2001, said Caltrans spokeswoman Rose 
Orem. Because the whole project is so mammoth, however, it is impossible to 
pinpoint the start and completion dates for just the Magnolia Avenue off-ramps, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the northbound off-ramp exits the freeway as one lane and then 
widens to two lanes at the intersection with Magnolia Avenue, Orem said. When 
reconstruction is finished, the off-ramp will begin as one lane and then expand 
to three lanes at Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering if Caltrans or the City of Orange could look into the 
placement of designated left-turn signals on Taft Avenue as it intersects with 
Glassell Avenue near the Glassell /Orange-Olive Road split? For travelers on 
Glassell going north or south, and for travelers coming south on Orange-Olive 
to the Glassell bend, such lights are in place if they desire go east or west 
on Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 But, turning north or south on Glassell from Taft, whether one is traveling 
east or west on Taft, is a real problem, especially in the morning and evening 
rush.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen H. Janssen Orange Bernie Dennis, traffic engineer for Orange, said his 
department has not recognized a problem on Taft at Glassell before, but will 
study the area if you submit a written request. 
</P>
<P>
 Address your letter to him at 300 E. Chapman Ave., Orange, Calif. 92666. 
Include your name, address and phone number. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Would you please explain something about the left-turn arrow on Santiago 
Boulevard at Serrano Avenue in Orange? The arrow seems to activate very quickly 
in the later evening hours and on weekends, but during the day up to 6 p.m. or 
so, it is extremely slow. In addition, it seems to change just as the traffic, 
which is approaching from Santiago and East Meats Avenue, appears, forcing 
drivers to stop. If the arrow could change even 60 seconds earlier, the 
intersection could clear and no northbound drivers would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Heide Villa Park The lights on Santiago Boulevard are synchronized, 
and know both how heavy through-traffic is and how many cars are waiting to 
turn left. The system caters to through-traffic, said traffic engineer Bernie 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all the 1,256 traffic signals in the city, the left-turn signals on 
Santiago will activate quickly if through-traffic is light, or slowly if 
through-traffic is heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 During rush hour, the left-turn arrow won't activate as often, Dennis said. On 
weekends and before rush hours, the left-turn arrow will activate more quickly 
when cars appear in the left-turn lane, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not like left-turners have a harder road to travel, so to speak. If 
several cars are waiting to turn left, the signal will automatically extend the 
amount of green light time, Dennis said. Typically, the first vehicle turning 
on green is accorded six seconds of green time, whereas each succeeding vehicle 
gets four seconds, he said.

GEORGE RAMOS: A WASHINGTON POST FOR A WOMAN GOING PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I always knew Cathy Kissee-Sandoval was going places. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer specializing in business litigation for a Los Angeles law firm, 
Kissee-Sandoval, 32, is leaving this week to join the Clinton Administration as 
deputy director of the Federal Communications Commission's international 
division. She'll be in charge of FCC policy for Latin America and the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a high-ranking federal job is the crowning achievement of a lifetime 
for most folks, this is just another stop on an inspiring journey that began on 
the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissee-Sandoval will probably emulate her political mentor, county Supervisor 
Gloria Molina, who took a post in the Jimmy Carter Administration for several 
years before returning to L.A. and running for elective office. "I am certainly 
very interested in public service," she said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Kissee-Sandoval on a sunny late-December afternoon in 1983. She 
had just been named a Rhodes scholar, becoming the first Chicana ever accorded 
the honor of studying at Oxford, England. She was an honors student at Yale, a 
pretty difficult task for a Latino away from familiar surroundings, and those 
who knew her said the Rhodes scholarship was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the brightest person I know," one of her friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was clear enough when I went to her parents' home in Montebello to 
interview her about her Rhodes selection. Among the first things she told me 
was of being 5 years old and having a burning desire to learn how to read 
before entering kindergarten. Her father, a court stenographer, helped her 
realize that goal by spending more time reading to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've always been determined," she told me back then. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents were beaming as Cathy, the second of three daughters, answered my 
questions about her plans. I beamed listening to them. It was an affirmation of 
the commitment and pride that so many Latino parents have in education.  
</P>
<P>
 I came away very impressed with her, but there was one question she couldn't 
answer. She reminded me of it the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any heroes?" I had asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a good answer then," she recalled the other day, "but I have a 
lot of heroes. I don't think of the typical heroes. Of course, there's my mom 
and dad, my sisters, (Los Angeles lawyer and civil rights activist) Vilma 
Martinez, (federal appeals judge) Dorothy W. Nelson; Martha Chavez, who was a 
counselor of mine in college." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy and I kept in touch over the years since that first meeting, chatting 
about the big issues of the day and the small ones of everyday life. I remember 
sending her a card when her mother passed away in 1985, after battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a terrible loss that tested Cathy's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was diagnosed with cancer in my last year at Yale," she remembered. "She 
made a list of things that she wanted to happen. 'First, Cathy going to Oxford. 
Then, (sister) Barbara going to UC Santa Barbara.' She believed so much in 
education that she didn't mind sending us away from home to have better 
opportunities, even if it meant that she might pass away while we were at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother's selflessness taught me what to do with my free time." 
</P>
<P>
 Since graduating from Stanford Law School and passing the State Bar in 1990, 
Cathy has been involved in several local nonprofit organizations to help the 
disadvantaged. Among them are Comision Femenil, a professional group of Latinas 
that offers scholarships and mentoring to young women; a corporation that is 
preparing to build a 24-unit, affordable housing project for the disabled in 
East L.A.; a county commission on judicial procedures, and the Los Angeles 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also worked on behalf of several Latino candidates in recent years, 
being a strong believer in Molina's brand of grass-roots politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy isn't the only Latino from L.A. who is going to work for Clinton in 
Washington. Among the others are UCLA professor Fernando Torres-Gil, who is 
assistant Health and Human Services secretary; former South Pasadena Mayor 
Evelyn Fierro, who was appointed as a top assistant in the Department of 
Transportation, and Tony Gallegos of Pico Rivera, who is chairman of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking I have enough degrees, but I'm just getting a degree in 
government," Cathy said of her upcoming stint in the nation's capital. "I'm 
just learning the ropes about how to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 When she gets back to L.A., she'll be able to teach us a few things.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; CHIAPAS: 
'NO ONE'S SCARED OFF YET'

 A revolt in the Mexican state of Chiapas has left scores dead. We ask some Los 
Angeles area residents if they feel the action will have any economic 
ramifications in Southern California. ABRAHAM LOWENTHAL 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Center for International Studies, USC 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas uprising is unquestionably a major event, not to be brushed aside, 
but its significance for NAFTA and for California-Mexico relations should not 
be exaggerated or distorted. The guerrilla outbreak in Southern Mexico's 
poorest state does not mean that the Mexican people are repudiating NAFTA, that 
Mexico's current authorities have been cast aside or that another Mexican 
revolution is around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The true international importance of Chiapas is really similar to the 
significance of the Los Angeles violence of 1992 for U.S. foreign policy: a 
clear signal that economic deprivation, ethnic tensions and injustice are not 
being adequately addressed by local and national authorities. Our own troubles 
in 1992 were a wake-up call, making it obvious that government must focus more 
effectively on unemployment, health, security, equity and representation or 
risk undermining America's international stature and authority. That is also 
the message of Chiapas. JAVIER RODRIGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Activist, Committee in Solidarity With the Peoples of Mexico, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, Los Angeles and California house the largest population of 
Mexicans outside Mexico City. We maintain a constant flow of communication with 
our friends, towns, neighbors and relatives. We send millions of dollars by way 
of checks, money orders and so forth to our home states. And we are in tune 
with the politics and issues taking place in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The events in Chiapas are significant as most Mexicans interviewed, primarily 
by the Spanish-speaking media, have stated that the Mexican government has long 
forgotten the indigenous populations of Mexico and, in particular, this one. 
When you look at the economic and social statistics of Chiapas, you find that 
it is the poorest state in Mexico. It houses 36% of the illiterate in the 
country. The income per family of five is estimated at $26 per month. The 
Indians have a legendary reputation for suffering and also for rebelliousness.  
</P>
<P>
 It's opening the eyes of people who thought that with the approval of NAFTA 
Mexico was going to enter the First World. It's no accident that the Zapatista 
guerillas chose the same day NAFTA was implemented to denounce the government 
and speak of their plight -- the lack of democracy, the fear of losing their 
culture and their identity. FRANK DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 President, Orange County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, it's an unfortunate thing that happened in Mexico. It impacts 
some of the U.S. families that are from that general area of Mexico. But it 
seems to me that it's an isolated incident. President Salinas is concerned, I'm 
sure, with the equity of the land situation. But he's also concerned for the 
perception of Mexico by the outside world. I think he will do all he can to 
resolve this matter swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn from every incident and land reform is an indicator sometimes of the 
problems we may have from economic recessions and hard times. This is a 
reflection, a symptom of some of that. But as Mexico begins to pick up 
economically, the issues will change. I don't think it's going to have a 
negative impact, probably next to zero, on business partnerships between the 
U.S. and Mexico. TERESA SANCHEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Mexico Information Project, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Southwest, California and Mexico share a history, a transborder 
economy, society, culture and a growing population. Whatever happens in Mexico, 
politically, economically, socially, affects people in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis in Chiapas shows something that's very critical given the recent 
passage of NAFTA -- that national policies in Mexico have political 
repercussions that will affect California. One of the things mentioned by the 
Zapatista forces was that they see NAFTA as a death sentence for indigenous 
people. I think there's an indication that a lot of people here in the United 
States have been concerned that the terms of NAFTA are beneficial to large 
corporations but will be detrimental to the majority of people, particularly 
those on the lowest rung of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the lack of any public outcry or any statement by the Clinton 
Administration of concern for the human rights violations that have been taking 
place in Chiapas is quite alarming. DONALD E. STEINMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Vice president, Braemer World Travel Inc., Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the news is so new and the area really in the extreme south of 
Mexico that people are just going to take a mental note unless the unrest down 
there becomes more widespread. People aren't even really talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, there aren't any (travel) cancellations. No one's scared off. This 
time of the year, though, right after the holidays, is a little bit slower. The 
crucial time becomes spring break and the Easter and Passover holidays. That's 
when the peak travel period to Mexico will come. If this thing becomes 
prolonged, then that's something different.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Violence and racial and ethnic intolerance appear to be increasing daily. Will 
it stop? Who's got the answers, the solutions that will turn Southern 
California into a more civil place -- one that accepts all of its people? 
</P>
<P>
 So far, adults have failed to come up with solutions. So why not let the young 
people who will eventually inherit the region have a say in how we resolve our 
crises? Today, two young people who believe they have some answers get a chance 
to be heard. Writing in Youth Opinion, Jun S. Lee and Gary C. Bagby, winners of 
an essay contest sponsored by KABC-TV, The Times and the Los Angeles County and 
Los Angeles public libraries, give a hopeful outlook for the region. But will 
we adults listen and take their ideas seriously? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bruce Powell, headmaster of Stephen S. Wise Community High School in Los 
Angeles is not hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults rarely take young people seriously enough. In our school, we have a 
built-in system of empowerment where the kids write their own student handbook, 
meaning make their own rules. We listen to them, we take them seriously and by 
taking them more seriously, they become more serious." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Powell and Carol Muske-Dukes, a professor of English at USC, 
young people are generally positive and open to a variety of ideas. That 
changes, however, as they get older, Powell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have fabulous ideas and a wonderful innocence. And they are much more 
open to meeting various segments of the community," says Powell. "I speak to 
the kids around here and the seventh- and eighth-graders have a much more 
positive hopeful vision; the 11th- and 12th-graders have a little more cynical 
view. The seventh- and eighth-graders feel, 'Yes, there's hope' and the 11th 
and 12 graders feel, 'Well, maybe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Muske-Dukes says adults need to stop thinking that "connecting" with children 
means patting them on the head, pressing the cookie cutter down, superimposing 
store-bought stereotypical behavior (a la Barbie and G.I. Joe) on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Praising our essay winners, Muske-Dukes says: "The strong voices of these two 
children are honest, 'unbought' voices, not Benetton Colors or Nickelodeon 
commercials, or 'Home Alone' darling brats. Each of them is telling us how to 
'see' L.A. differently, to 're-see' what we think we see." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes courage to alter one's vision, she says. "The bravery of Jun S. Lee 
and Gary Bagby is evident, but their level of honesty might be too scary for 
most adults in this city. These kids are talking about exceeding themselves, 
going outside themselves -- how many adults do you know capable of that kind of 
leap?" 
</P>
<P>
 The openness and creativity of our young people mean nothing, according to 
Powell, unless motivated adults are there to help because kids have little 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need inspired adults with vision who can get the kids from different 
communities together so that the next generation, these kids, will know each 
other, will see each other and will be able to work together, do business 
together, not fear each other."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; LA OPINION; TURNING DOWN THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By La Opinion is a Spanish-language daily published in Los Angeles. Translated 
by Kevin Baxter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to a study by the Department of Justice, one of every eight students 
in the nation's most dangerous urban areas comes to class every day with a 
pistol. The study also revealed that students have easy access to "firearms of 
good quality and easy use," revolvers of high caliber and automatic and 
semiautomatic pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't acquired, of course, in stores. They were bought in the street or 
stolen. There are also many arms in the hands of the public acquired legally.  
</P>
<P>
 There exists, then, a gun mentality. That is to say, a society in which 
violence is frequently used to resolve conflicts or express disagreement. 
Because of that, some experts ask that crime and violence be considered a 
public health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Society has started to react against the gun culture. It will be a long 
process, but it's heading in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the laws restricting the sale of arms, we need a mechanism to 
deactivate the gun psychology in society and make unnecessary its use as a way 
to resolve individual and group conflict.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: LA INDIA JOURNAL; 
U.S. COULD FOLLOW INDIA MODEL ON GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From LA India Journal, a weekly published in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In India, no one can buy a gun unless and until he obtains a license from the 
government. And it is very difficult to get a firearms license as only the 
district magistrate/deputy commissioner is authorized to grant one and after a 
thorough police investigation and a recommendation from the superintendent of 
police.It is very rare that a person is given a license, (usually only someone) 
of high social and political status and only for self protection. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can open a shop or start a business for selling arms and ammunition in 
India without getting a license from the state government. The government 
grants only very few licenses for arms and ammunition shops and only in big 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. should follow the Indian system to restrict the sale of guns. The 
present holders of guns should be asked to surrender their guns and seek 
licenses. Those who are not considered suitable to keep guns should be 
financially compensated for the guns they surrender.

 Anahid, an Armenian girl, misses her Iranian friend, Leila, who is away on her 
honeymoon. She visits Leila's mother, Mrs. Golestani, and brings her yellow 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Golestani is pleased to see Anahid and hugs her, but as soon as she sees 
the yellow flowers the older woman's face turns red. She ushers Anahid into the 
living room, but immediately excuses herself to prepare some tea. After waiting 
what seemed like a long time, Anahid walks into the kitchen and discovers Mrs. 
Golestani crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed, Anahid asks, "What's wrong?" Before Mrs. Golestani can answer, Anahid 
notices that her flowers have been tossed on the floor in the corner of the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusingly, Mrs. Golestani says, "I didn't know you hated us so much." 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 In Iranian culture, giving someone yellow flowers means you hate them. It can 
even mean that you wish the person were dead. Anahid had to plead with Mrs. 
Golestani to reveal this information and the explanation shocked her. In 
defense, Anahid explained that to Armenians yellow flowers mean "I miss you." 
Ultimately, she convinced Mrs. Golestani of her sincerity and their 
relationship was restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: The colors of flowers have different meanings for different cultures.

 No one has a greater stake in the Southern California community than our young 
people. With that in mind, KABC-TV, The Times, The Los Angeles County Public 
Library and Los Angeles Public Library sponsored an essay contest to give young 
people a chance to present possible solutions to the problems that face us. The 
theme was "Making Our Community a Better Place; How We Can Work Together." 
Today, we publish the two grand prize winners. Each will receive a $1,000 
savings bond.  
</P>
<P>
 TOO SLICK: Yo , man!  
</P>
<P>
 TOO FAST: Wass up, T.S.!  
</P>
<P>
 T.S.: I heard we got a rumble tomorrow . 
</P>
<P>
 T.F.: You heard right . 
</P>
<P>
 T.S.: But we only got three guys. The rest of 'em got shot up in the last 
rumble.  
</P>
<P>
 T.F.: That's not gonna happen this time 'cause I'm bringing a friend this 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 T.S.: Oh yeah, what's his name?  
</P>
<P>
 T.F.: His name is 44-Magnum. Yo man! Here comes Five-O!  
</P>
<P>
 T.S.: Yo! I'll talk to you about it later. Peace, and I'm outie.  
</P>
<P>
 T.F.: Peace. Outie 5,000.  
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with this picture? Too Fast and Too Slick are too stupid to 
realize that peace is more than just a word. It's more than just two fingers. 
It's a state of mind. It's something you do. It's something you commit to. Too 
Fast and Too Slick need to get with the program before the program gets to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 What I mean by that is that T.S. and T.F. need to understand the true meaning 
of this thing we call peace. Once they figure that out, they need to apply it 
and get others to also. If they don't, they might not live to see the next day. 
If they do, who knows the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about "Stop the violence and increase the peace." Let's stop the 
violence and keep the peace. Nothing will change until we do that. 
</P>
<P>
 When I say keep the peace, I don't just mean physically; I also mean mentally. 
Mental peace is 20% of what we need to help heal our neighborhoods. The other 
80% is each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we learn to deal with each other, no matter what race, creed, color or 
sex, then we can rebuild our community. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing something good for the community helps solve all community problems. 
Taggers don't need to tag so they get recognition. All that gives them is low 
self-esteem, low self-confidence and trouble. Instead of writing on a wall, 
they can help paint them or even help rebuild them.

 I used to want to be a gangbanger until I found out what it can do to you. We 
were headed to a gang fight when we got ambushed. I hit a 16-year-old with a 
lead pipe and he pulled out a knife and stabbed me in my side. I almost died. 
</P>
<P>
 They call the gang your family, but what kind of family beats you up before 
you can become a part of it? What kind of family would put you in a situation 
where you could get seriously injured or die? Every family has its problems, 
but one of these problems almost got me killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Racism is another form of violence we need to stop. Sometimes just a funny 
look can be racist. Everybody has a point in their life where they are racist. 
I will admit that I have been racist at times and I regret it. Remember that 
there is only one race , a race that -- when put together -- can defeat any 
problem. That race is the human race.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH / OPINION; 'WE

<P>
 No one has a greater stake in the Southern California community than our young 
people. With that in mind, KABC-TV, The Times, The Los Angeles County Public 
Library and Los Angeles Public Library sponsored an essay contest to give young 
people a chance to present possible solutions to the problems that face us. The 
theme was "Making Our Community a Better Place; How We Can Work Together." 
Today, we publish the two grand prize winners. Each will receive a $1,000 
savings bond.  
</P>
<P>
 Yikes! 
</P>
<P>
 My leg muscles contracted into a sharp, painful cramp. I limped over to the 
couch and just laid there while the cramp maliciously continued to poke and 
stab at me. The funny thing about it was that the cramp felt good -- from a 
"metaphysical" point of view. It was my souvenir of a day of vigorous, 
adrenaline-charged hoops at the courts of the neighborhood park: four hours of 
running, jumping and more running, all done with total devotion and a lot of 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yikes! As the physical aspect of the cramp became more clear, I flipped on the 
TV to take my mind off the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Click: "Young girl, age 6, died this afternoon in the cross-fire of racial 
gang violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it seemed that we were all running: running from the demon of our 
society's decay; running to survive; running to avoid ending up on the 5 
o'clock news ourselves. The more than 8.5 million people in the great community 
of Los Angeles are all running. That's a lot of cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 As I continued to lie on the couch, I started to daydream about what happened 
earlier that afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 I was walking over to the park, with a basketball lodged between my arm and 
the side of my body. Suddenly, I noticed a black figure running in my 
direction. I put a tighter grip on the ball. Why? I don't know. I guess it was 
"social instinct." As the figure came closer, I realized it was Thomas. I 
greeted him with an half-hearted smile, ashamed that I was guilty of the racism 
I so much hated and experienced myself as a Korean American. Nevertheless, I 
was happy to see him, and we walked over to the park together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the courts, Thomas and I ran across several of the basketball regulars and 
a few guys we had never seen before. It didn't matter, though. Anyone was 
welcome into the game, and a few extra guys were always appreciated. It turned 
out that these guys were actually pretty good, and we had a terrific game. The 
sweat proved it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, I walked with a limp that resulted from playing too 
aggressively. Nevertheless, I was feeling good. That's what I like about 
basketball. It's not so much the sport as it is the feeling of cooperation and 
brotherhood every teammate has for each other. If even one player decides to 
act on his own, the clockwork of the team breaks down and every member becomes 
vulnerable. Every person must work together for the common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be accomplished by realizing that we are all members of the game, one 
game. One step outside the court and the game becomes the game of life. We play 
on the same team called the Human Race. Eventually, we come to recognize and 
appreciate each other's differences as we, with our unique, individual 
strengths, aid each other past our weaknesses. The court is the community and 
we -- the members -- are working together to make the community a better place. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, I noticed a Latino man walking in the opposite direction. 
Though it would have been customary, and perhaps more comfortable, for me to 
look away, I decided to take a chance. With a smile I greeted him: "Good 
afternoon." He smiled back and responded, "Good afternoon, amigo. " 
</P>
<P>
 I scored two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there is hope for the community of Los Angeles after all.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
ANN REISS LANE; 'WE CANNOT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES ANY LONGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By On Friday, 65 women's groups, ranging from the League of Women Voters to the 
YWCA, will attend an Education for Action conference to learn what they can do 
about violence and gun control. The forum is sponsored by Women Against Gun 
Violence, a new organization overseen by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner 
Ann Reiss Lane. It is funded by the California Wellness Foundation and the 
American Jewish Congress, which is handling forum questions at (213) 651-4601. 
Free-lance writer Jill Stewart talked with Lane. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: As a police commissioner, what bothered you most about guns? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Hearing the anxiety expressed by police officers about the 
proliferation of guns used against them. I thought, if these tough police 
officers are afraid, imagine what it must be like for the rest of us? With 200 
million guns out there already, if you were going to be safe by having a gun, 
America would be the safest country in the world. Instead, it's among the most 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see a sea change in attitudes toward gun violence? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely, but not only in L.A. Across the country, people are sick to 
death of violence. They're organizing in Seattle, Portland, Chicago and many 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would L.A. be different if half of all guns were removed from streets, 
homes, schools and cars in this decade? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You would reduce the crime immeasurably because the people who used to 
burglarize a house, because of all the security devices, have changed their 
mode of operation and now attack in public. And that, in most cases, requires a 
gun. But more than that, children and families now have guns. You have to stop 
focusing on traditional criminals because we have tremendous violence in the 
home, school and workplace. We have teen-age suicides, husbands shooting wives, 
workers killing co-workers and children firing guns. All that would be 
dramatically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is gun control emerging as a women's issue? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Partly because there is a major campaign to sell guns to women. The gun 
manufacturers and National Rifle Assn. did a marketing study in the 1980s and 
found that the gun market was saturated among men. Women are the other half of 
the population and the best way to market to them is to play on their fears. 
That's the most repellent part of the whole movement to sell guns to women. So 
we are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As society's traditional nurturers, can women make a difference where 
lawmakers have failed to reduce gun proliferation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have one particularly good model in Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where 
women just plain got mad and said, "This has got to stop." Women are 
persevering, caring, and they're organized already in a multitude of groups. 
That's why I'm having so much success in organizing Women Against Gun Violence, 
because this issue crosses every economic, racial and class line. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the biggest myth about America's love affair with guns? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That guns protect us, not kill us. Statistical evidence suggests that guns 
in your home are 43 times more likely to be used against a loved one, yourself 
or a friend than against an intruder. The gun sellers created the myth of 
shooting the intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the argument that criminals can always get a gun? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That doesn't stop us from any campaign. We didn't give up on the campaign 
against drunk driving simply because there will always be drunks on the road. 
Imagine if we had dropped the campaign against smoking because some people will 
always smoke. This is a 25-step process of trying to rid our communities of 
guns and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The women's movement has often been criticized as too middle class. Will 
this new effort differ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The interesting thing for me has been to find out how many 
community-based and ethnic organizations are out there. Early on, we found 
Drive-By Agony, parents who have lost their children, and a woman in Wilmington 
who founded Mothers and Men Against Gangs. There's a new organization formed by 
the mother of the student killed at Reseda High, and one in Pasadena formed by 
the mothers of the children gunned down on Halloween. These are people of every 
color and background. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a consensus that women have won the big gender battles and it's 
time to tackle larger societal issues like gun violence? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That was part of (feminist and author) Betty Friedan's thought process in 
organizing Women Against Gun Violence's first seminar last spring. She felt 
that women have to move beyond the victim stage. She sees women as the 
appropriate people to say, "We cannot live in these communities any longer." We 
do not exclude men by any means, we need them, but the easiest course is to 
organize women. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The media have begun identifying the gun manufacturer in stories about 
killing sprees. Is this part of your strategy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We haven't moved that far along, although several of the major cheap 
handgun manufacturers are right here in Southern California. There's research 
under way on where guns used in crimes are produced. One strategy might be to 
call attention to manufacturers by bringing pictures of slain children as we 
march in front of a gun factory. Things like that will be decided at our 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does Women Against Gun Violence hope to accomplish in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To change the way people think about guns. To see them as killers rather 
than protectors, to focus on prevention. The public health movement and doctors 
and nurses see it as a major public health problem. We also want to never lose 
sight of the fact that there are social causes of gun violence that need to be 
addressed.THEODORA LITSIOS / For The Times

IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO KEEP IT A SECRET; SUPREME COURT MUST NOT SUPPRESS 
IRAN-CONTRA REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The broad outline of the Iran-Contra scandal has long been clear. President 
Ronald Reagan, eager to secure the release of American hostages being held by 
terrorists in Lebanon, sought by secretly violating the U.S. embargo on arms 
sales to Iran to bribe that country into helping. Then, without Reagan's 
knowledge, his national security adviser, John M. Poindexter, and Poindexter's 
aide, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, diverted some of the profit from the arms sale 
to guerrillas seeking the overthrow of the government of Nicaragua, secretly 
violating a congressional ban on such aid. 
</P>
<P>
 When the scandal broke in 1986, Lawrence E. Walsh was appointed as independent 
counsel to prosecute and investigate the case. The law under which the 
appointment was made -- a law now expired but likely to be revived -- dates 
back to the Watergate era and was intended to guarantee that the executive 
branch of government would not be above the law or beyond public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Both goals were formally recognized under the law. The independent counsel (or 
"special prosecutor") was to be named by the judiciary rather than the 
executive and was not just to prosecute criminal wrongdoing, if any, but also 
to issue a final, air-clearing report. The final report, an exercise required 
of no conventional prosecutor, was to cover those who were not indicted as well 
as those who were, because the abuse of power is wrong even when it is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution phase of Iran-Contra is now complete. Walsh's 14 indictments 
led to 11 guilty pleas or convictions. Two convictions were overturned; five 
cases ended in pardons by President George Bush. The investigation phase of 
Iran-Contra seemed about to end on Dec. 3, 1993, when a three-judge federal 
appeals court in Washington announced that it was about to release the report, 
minus some classified material. On that day, however, unnamed parties brought 
motions, which the three judges troublingly agreed to keep secret, requesting 
that the judges reverse themselves and suppress the report either in whole or 
in part. Last Friday, the same panel, having reviewed its earlier decision, 
confirmed it but gave the unnamed parties 10 days to appeal to the Supreme 
Court, presumably with a second set of secret motions. 
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed parties, sources have told the Associated Press, are Reagan, 
North, (now a Senate candidate in Virginia) and former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese 
III. If the Supreme Court agrees to review the decision of the appeals court, 
we can only hope that it will at the very least require those requesting its 
intervention to identify themselves in court and make their arguments for the 
record. But our deeper hope is that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, whose 
role will be crucial, will recognize the immense harm that would be done to the 
credibility of government if a $35-million, tax-funded investigation should 
become an "eyes only" report for those who were themselves the objects of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush pardons placed a serious question mark at the end of the Iran-Contra 
prosecution phase. A suppression of the Walsh report at the behest of Reagan, 
Meese and North would place a disastrous question mark at the end of the 
Iran-Contra investigation as a whole.

RABBI HECHT ON 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "When Will Jews Let It Rest?" by Rabbi Eli Hecht, Commentary, 
Jan. 2: 
</P>
<P>
 As a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, a presidential appointee to the 
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Council, and one of a handful of benefactors of 
the Los Angeles Holocaust Monument in Pan Pacific Park, I believe I am 
qualified to respond to Rabbi Hecht's column.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Rabbi Hecht does not have the slightest understanding of why Jews -- 
and all people -- must understand the horrors of the Holocaust and never, ever 
forget it. The resounding message of every museum and monument which has been 
erected in memory of the Holocaust is not, as Hecht states, that "the world is 
never a safe place for Jews." The message of remembrance, rather, is that the 
world must do everything humanly possible to prevent man's inhumanity to man 
from repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, thousands of men, women and children of all races, religions, and 
nationalities visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. I am 
extremely proud that I have been a part of its creation -- not because I wear a 
number on my arm . . . and not because I need a memorial to the nearly 60 
members of my own family who perished at the hands of the Nazis. I am proud 
because of the many lessons it teaches to this generation and all future 
generations of children about ending discrimination of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rabbi Hecht cannot see the importance of these lessons of the Holocaust, 
then he has closed his eyes to the rest of the world, turning his back on the 
horrors of Cambodia, Bosnia and Somalia. He refuses to recognize the ongoing 
acts of the Ku Klux Klan, skinheads, and the many gangs who terrorize innocent 
victims and create daily versions of the Holocaust in our cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, "Schindler's List," and other movies like it, should be required 
viewing for all people. As a teacher, Rabbi Hecht should know that children 
cannot be taught tolerance without awareness.  
</P>
<P>
 As the Talmud reads (as well as the inscription on the ring presented to Oskar 
Schindler by the 1,200 Jews he saved), "He who saves one life, saves the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 NATHAN SHAPELL

</P>
<P>
 * For the life of me I cannot understand why Rabbi Hecht is so upset with 
Steven Spielberg's film "Schindler's List." In our religious schools we were 
taught that one who saves one life is saving the whole world. Schindler, for 
whatever reason, saved over a thousand Jews. For that alone he should be 
remembered. For all his moral shortcomings and the benefit he derived from 
Jewish labor, at the end he saved them.  
</P>
<P>
 I too was saved by a righteous Gentile. I never questioned his reason or 
morality. But when a Polish Catholic endangered his life and the lives of his 
children and grandchildren to save my life, then he should be remembered for 
the good he did. The last thing I recall our martyred parents, brothers and 
sisters asking of the ones who would survive was to tell the world what 
happened to them, and to remember them.  
</P>
<P>
 GEORGE LUBOW 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * It was such a pleasure to read an honest observation made by Hecht. I'm 69 
and every time I see a Holocaust movie I cry. What the rabbi was saying is on 
target. Enough of suffering! As an American I remembered the hostility. Nobody 
really ever helped. 
</P>
<P>
 JEANNE SCHULMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Carson 
</P>
<P>
 * It is true that Schindler was a member of the Nazi party, an aspiring war 
profiteer and bon vivant , but it is also true that somehow he discovered his 
humanity in the horrors of the Shoah as the rescuer of those Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Hecht's contention that Schindler's motives and actions are 
highly suspect, it might be easy to say that Schindler was a hero and leave it 
at that. But that would be dangerous. Heroes are not like other people. Heroes 
rise above what is expected of the rest of us and perform acts which are 
extraordinary. Schindler's journey from war profiteer to rescuer did not come 
suddenly. It emerged from Schindler's recognition that the Jews working for him 
as slave laborers were human beings. It was common humanity, that which linked 
Schindler to the Jews, that motivated his actions, not uncommon heroism.  
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg has given us a very precious gift in bringing Schindler's story to 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler was not a super-hero, he was a mensch , a human being. We need 
menschen , real human beings, more than heroes. That is what Schindler really 
teaches us. 
</P>
<P>
 RABBI SHELTON J. DONNELL 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Sholom, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Does Rabbi Hecht propose that, as Jews, we let Passover and Purim rest along 
with the Holocaust? For centuries we have recounted tales of the enslavement 
and subsequent rescue of our people by "righteous" souls. Only an ostrich would 
not have noticed that along with dwelling on our past, we have celebrated life. 
We never used our oppression as an excuse to sink into despair.  
</P>
<P>
 Didn't the rabbi ever hear of the admonition that "those who do not study 
history are condemned to repeat it"? Would he have attacked Picasso's painting 
of the "Guernica" because it depicted the massacre of the populace of that 
Spanish town by Franco's fascists? Would he decry our remembrance of the Civil 
War because it reminds us of the evils of slavery? The film about Schindler 
will act as a reminder for generations to come both about the depths that human 
beings can descend to and the heights they can achieve.  
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Hecht has done a grievous disservice to righteous people throughout the 
world -- whatever their religion. 
</P>
<P>
 BETTY R. PARDO 
</P>
<P>
 MURRAY S. PARDO 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Rabbi Hecht badly misses the point of "Schindler's List." Schindler was an 
imperfect hero whose motivations for rescuing hunted Jews from Nazi 
extermination remain unclear. Schindler's inexplicable heroism is precisely the 
reason the film is so compelling. Schindler was one of a small number of 
rescuers -- non-Jewish men and women -- who risked their lives and those of 
their families to help save the lives of fellow human beings. The extraordinary 
moral courage displayed by Schindler in response to the darkness of 
unaccountable horror renders him a remarkable hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht acknowledges that he doesn't "care to know" about the "moral awakening" 
that drove this man "to play G-d." Those whom Schindler saved, however, and 
those whom he inspired care a great deal. Hecht acknowledges that his concern 
is not so much with Schindler as it is with what he sees as the film's 
identification of Judaism with suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't be more wrong. Hecht's goal might be the bolstering of Jewish 
identity but "Schindler's List" has an altogether different focus. Rather than 
criticize a film that so eloquently examines man's capacity for evil and the 
noble values of an unlikely hero, Hecht should re-evaluate the moving story of 
a man who in many ways was a model -- for Jews and non-Jews.

</P>
<P>
 * What a refreshing viewpoint expressed by Hecht concerning "Schindler's 
List," and celebrating the richness of a Jewish heritage, versus the fears of 
persecution! 
</P>
<P>
 If everyone would practice celebrating the joy of his or her uniqueness, 
versus fearing for it, the world would be a much more joyful place. Too much of 
our modern life revolves around the fear and defensiveness we teach our 
children to associate with their differences in ethnicity, race, sex and 
religion. We should be teaching them the strengths that can be gained from 
these things. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Faced with the certain, inescapable death by starvation, violence or 
Auschwitz, anyone would have preferred working for Schindler. I don't believe 
anyone whose life he saved cared about the man's personal morals. It is pretty 
futile to self-righteously accuse him of profiteering and adultery when he 
spent his personal fortune on saving lives. There is an absolute need to tell 
the story of suffering, especially because of the resurgence of ethnic 
cleansing, neo-Nazi violence and the emergence of maniacs like Zhirinovsky in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hecht, as a Jew, is sick and tired of victimization -- I, as a German, am 
sick and tired of the stigma Hitler left on Germans. But I believe that those 
who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are bound to repeat them. We 
can't turn the clock back but we can try to educate and exercise tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 BIRGIT NIELSEN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * I do not write to praise Schindler or to bury him. But Schindler, the Nazi, 
saved about 1,100 men, women and children. As a Jew who lived during the Final 
Solution, each life saved was very significant. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other Nazis who profited from Jewish slave labor. Some provided 
additional bread rations, but during the final liquidation of the camps, they 
abandoned their Jewish workers to the fate of the SS, which usually meant death 
in a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 So Schindler, the Nazi, a moral war profiteer, somehow decided for whatever 
reason to save 1,100 Jews. It was a unique act in Nazi-occupied Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Hecht states that for many Jews this is a "sacred cow," just as the 
"museums of the Holocaust are considered beyond criticism." He has missed the 
point. Memory of the Holocaust cannot be erased or replaced. The attack upon 
the memory of the survivors, GIs who liberated the concentration camps and 
other eyewitnesses has been coming from the extreme right and other elements 
who deny that the Holocaust existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Holocaust museums serve to preserve memory, but also to act as educational 
centers. Our intention is not to portray Jews as victims but to educate the 
next generation that racial prejudices in whichever form may eventually lead to 
Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 I also reject Rabbi Hecht's contention that he is sick and tired of this 
generation's identifying Judaism with suffering. Does he suggest that we should 
use selective memory and provide our generation with only a richness about our 
noble religion? As one who in June, 1942, lost all members of his family and 
most of his childhood friends, I owe it to them to preserve their memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" is not Holocaust entertainment. It is an attempt to depict 
an event too horrendous to comprehend and too difficult to view, and to show us

PERSPECTIVE ON TURKEY; NO LONGINGS FOR OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TANSU CILLER, prime minister of Turkey, was interviewed in Ankara by Hugh 
Pope for The Times. Ciller, a U.S.-educated former professor of economics, will 
attend the NATO summit in Brussels this week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Are you going to the NATO summit with a feeling that there is a 
rising danger from Russia?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is change going on in Russia; a reactionary movement in the 
former Soviet Union. It probably stems from the economic conditions as well as 
the political situation. Despite what President Yeltsin may have in mind, a 
theme has come to the surface now, not exactly going back to the old borders 
(but) definitely a nationalistic attitude vis-a-vis the rest of the independent 
countries. I think Russia is more inclined to put pressure on them, trying to 
sign bilateral military agreements with them. The will is there . . . to make 
Russia the sole protector of that region against the rest of the world, 
especially against Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey wants to coexist and cooperate with Russia. When I was there and saw 
President Yeltsin, the sole theme was that we have cultural affiliations with 
some of these countries that have become independent (the mostly 
Turkic-speaking states of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan). We realize that they are going to have a 
relationship with Russia as well. Why not form a triangle? Instead of 
competition, let's cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Turkey is concerned, it has extended close to $1.5 billion to $2 
billion credit to this region, including Armenia. This shows the commitment we 
have to stability in that part of the world. We have no inclinations for the 
old Ottoman Empire. We've been over this for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You can say you will never have a military commitment in the region even if 
the Armenians go to Baku? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I never said that. We always are watching very closely. Only yesterday 
we had a summit about this, considering and reconsidering. As far as Turkey is 
concerned, we all feel that Armenia should withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, we also stood up. I am going there sometime in the future to draw 
the attention of the world one more time that this is simply a massacre. It's 
against human rights. It's a moral issue. We were there in Somalia when 
aggression took place. Of course, in Azerbaijan when the Armenian aggression 
takes place at our border we are even more concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the West is being too accommodating toward Russian policies 
for the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union? Will you be 
raising your fears of Russian expansionism at the NATO summit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, of course, for a general evaluation. There are lot of crises taking 
place in all parts of the world and especially in this part of the world. There 
is no organization that tackles these crises any more. We are just talking 
about (standing up for) values against aggression, values for human rights. 
What is a more important as a human right than the right to live? I think we 
need to evaluate what we are doing not just for the day, but for the short 
term, medium term and long term. We need to look at history. The United States 
especially should just come and take a look at this part of the world. I am 
afraid that (Western) interests in the Middle East, the independent countries 
that have separated from the Soviet Union will not only be in danger but 
stability will be threatened.  
</P>
<P>
 I feel that (President Clinton's proposed "partnership for peace" with the 
former Soviet bloc) is a realistic kind of attitude. We should be looking not 
for the separation of Europe, but for the unification of Europe. Maybe it's 
even too gradual as far as we are concerned. Maybe we should move a little 
faster than that. The least that I expect (to see) is the principles set, 
adopted and agreed upon.  
</P>
<P>
 We need to recognize what Europe is. It is not a separation of cultures. It's 
a kind of understanding of the bringing in of different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the 9-year-old rebellion by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' 
Party (PKK) guerrillas in Turkey's southeast is only a military problem? Could 
you comment on the recent disturbances involving Turks and Kurds in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's about time to take this issue up. If we are going to share the 
same values, such as democracy, protection of human rights or the fight against 
terror, we have to stand together on all those issues. We should not mix up the 
issue of the PKK with the Kurds living in Turkey and elsewhere in the world. 
About 2,000 people have been killed in Turkey in the last year. The vast 
majority of them were Kurds killed by the PKK. We are trying to protect our 
citizens no matter what (ethnic) root they are from. Babies are being 
massacred. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in (Southeast Turkey) on New Year's Day. I spent it with the people 
there. On the streets, on the balconies, in the houses; they were no different 
toward me than in any other city I have been to. There was a lot of love, a lot 
of relaxation there. People are frightened by the PKK. What they want is that 
the state protects their lives. They want employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratization is something we believe in. We are going to take giant steps 
in that. Not as a concession to the PKK. Not for that region only. But for the 
whole country. We have come a long way in democracy since the 1940s. And we are 
going to move further. The most potentially potent Cabinet members are of 
Kurdish origin; we have never thought of discriminating. 
</P>
<P>
 I am for democracy, I am for human rights. But never mix the two issues up (of 
Kurdish rights and the separatist guerrillas). There will never be a concession 
to (give up) some part of this country. There will be no minority, everybody is 
first rank. In 1994, there will be other steps we take for the whole country. 
This is the only way.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: WHAT KIND OF PARTNER IS MEXICO?; THROUGH NAFTA, THE 
U.S. IS ENTITLED -- OBLIGATED -- TO ASK ABOUT PEASANTS' HUMAN RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former national correspondent for the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his debate with Ross Perot on the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
Vice President Al Gore conceded that "Mexico is not yet a full democracy," and 
that "they do not yet have full protection for human rights." But he assured 
his audience that "they've been making tremendous progress, and the progress 
has been associated with this new relationship with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 During his December trip to Mexico to meet with President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, Gore ducked questions about rigged elections in a country that has had 
one-party rule for 60 years by telling reporters, "The question is whether or 
not we will have the ability to influence what they and their government 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, then why the deafening silence from the Clinton Administration about the 
Indian uprising in southern Mexico? Grave issues of human rights have been 
raised by reports of summary executions by the army, indiscriminate bombing of 
the countryside and the strafing of journalists. Has the President no words of 
caution on this? 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels also singled out NAFTA as potentially exacerbating their people's 
troubles, so a response from President Clinton is in order. After all, he 
promised that NAFTA would usher in a bright new day for all on both sides of 
the border; shouldn't he now respond to the fears of desperately poor people 
that their lot will only get worse?  
</P>
<P>
 The President is further obligated to speak out because the exploitation of 
indigenous people is widely recognized as a major source of human-rights 
violations worldwide. It is a cruel irony that during 1993, proclaimed as the 
Year of Indigenous Peoples, attacks on the earliest nurturers of the earth have 
accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International reports that the estimated 300 million indigenous people 
who reside in 70 countries are the "most defenseless of all the victims of 
human-rights violations." 
</P>
<P>
 These people have tended to suffer much from the rapid expansion of market 
forces, which all U.S. administrations celebrate as an unequivocal triumph of 
democracy. At best, as the Mexican case illustrates, they are left behind in 
pockets of extreme poverty; at worst, their resources are pillaged and their 
populations decimated. 
</P>
<P>
 That the destruction of indigenous peoples is a hemisphere-wide phenomenon is 
witnessed by the recent massacre of the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela, many of 
them children and women, at the hands of rapacious Brazilian gold miners.  
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, Amnesty International reports, the abuse of indigenous people is 
widespread, the government is indifferent and one-third of the tribes have 
vanished.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is not only indigenous people who are the victims of economic 
"progress" that is measured by foreign investment dollars and growth in the 
aggregate GNP rather than the distribution of wealth among the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, long the most robust economy in Latin America -- a major magnet for 
international investors and much celebrated in the world media as a free-market 
success story -- has 60 million people living in abject poverty. Anyone who has 
ventured into the shantytowns that abut the luxury hotels and gleaming new 
office towers of Rio and Sao Paulo knows that economic growth has very much 
enlarged the enormous chasm between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, it's the class struggle, stupid. Whether it be in Mexico, where 
half of the people live in misery, or Brazil, the rising tide of foreign 
investment does not lift all boats. Those stuck in the muck of poverty can 
witness the success of others and, as with the peasant guerrillas of Chiapas, 
try to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Far better the ballot than the gun. But throughout the hemisphere, political 
democracy is mocked by an ever-prosperous elite that can buy government favor 
and blot out the cries of the desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States can do something about this. As the President has belatedly 
learned in regard to Russia, an economic policy that emphasizes the private 
market while excluding the needs of those who can't effectively play in it is a 
prescription for disaster. Now the President will urge Boris Yeltsin to pay 
more attention to Russia's social safety net and indeed will offer some 
financing toward that end. Ought we not do the same for countries in our own 
back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 The revolt of the Indians of Chiapas should be a wake-up call. Like it or not, 
the passage of NAFTA tied the Administration to the politics of the ruling 
party of Mexico. On Dec. 2, Gore told a gathering of Mexican businessmen that 
NAFTA represents "a starting point for dealing with the common challenges of 
the Americas." Certainly closing the gap between rich and poor and between 
dominant and indigenous cultures should be at the top of the list.

GIVE SCHOOLS A RIDE ON THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY; MEDIA: A PC FOR EVERY STUDENT 
IS POSSIBLE IF UTILITY REGULATORS AND THE INDUSTRY COOPERATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, Richard Kahlenberg of Los Angeles, a former executive of 
the American Film Institute, is working on a book on business and the 
environment. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The entertainment trade paper Daily Variety predicts that the Academy of 
Television Arts and Sciences' all-day "Superhighway Summit" at UCLA on Tuesday 
will be "the TV industry's answer to Yalta."  
</P>
<P>
 That summit, 49 years ago, resulted in the partition of the world among the 
superpowers. And the analogy suggests that the information industry 
heavyweights like Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Rupert Murdoch and Gerald Levin 
and their new partners, the telephone utilities, have something like that in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the keynote speaker for the day, Vice President Al Gore, thinks so. 
For weeks he has been preparing and test-marketing a speech -- Albert's Epistle 
to the Hollywoodians -- warning of a world divided by the media powers into 
populations of information-age "haves" and "have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a matter of poor children in places that can't afford cable crying, 
"I want my MTV." That type of service will certainly be priced and promoted to 
sell widely. What Gore, and, by the way, some officials in Sacramento, are 
worried about is that the good stuff, real information, will not be reaching 
kids.  
</P>
<P>
 The vice president is lately fond of quoting the new head of the Federal 
Communications Commission, Reed E. Hundt, who said, "There are thousands of 
buildings in the country with millions of people in them who have no 
telephones, no cable television and no reasonable prospect of broadband 
services. They're called schools."  
</P>
<P>
 Translation: There's no on-ramp connecting public education to the information 
highway. This means that kids sit in schools where not much of consequence 
involves electronic information and go into a world of work where everything of 
consequence does. No wonder they crash and burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore is reportedly first going to tell the media leaders something they want 
to hear: He's in favor of deregulation of the industries that are buying up 
Hollywood -- the baby Bells, grownup Bells and wanna-be Bells. They can charge 
what they want, provide service whenever and wherever they want, divide the 
turf as they want. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's going to be watching them. He has warned that, "Video on demand will 
be a great thing. It will be a far greater thing to demand that our efforts 
give every child access to the educational riches we have in such abundance." 
The implied threat is that, unless the information moguls devote some 
pick-and-shovel work to connecting our schools with the information highway -- 
promptly and inexpensively -- the FCC or Congress might mandate such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Legislature is looking into a plan to create a fund, 
independently administered and overseen by the state Public Utilities 
Commission, that would combine industry contributions, ratepayer funds and 
other available money such as fines and penalties to accomplish much of this.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) last year introduced and Gov. Pete 
Wilson signed a bill calling for a study on this concept linking a regulatory 
body, industry and education. The study estimated the program would cost $150 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bipartisanship in such matters is not new. In Indiana, a succession of 
Republican school superintendents and a Democratic governor have quietly begun 
placing an information highway on-ramp -- in the form of a personal computer -- 
in the home of every child in grades four through 12. Rosenthal's plan, though 
similar, doesn't cover the home on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe each of the big information superpowers represented Tuesday should 
pledge to "take" a state in such a way. That would give the Yalta prediction a 
new meaning.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; QUIRKY DIALOGUES ON PERFORMANCE ART AND REALITY; 
CONVERSATIONS WITH SHERYL SUTTON: THE NOVEL OF A DIALOGUE, BY JANOS PILINSZKY .

<P>
 Reviewers, Lord love us, may mismatch our socks and dent our fenders like 
everyone else, but about books we're supposed to be authorities. You, the 
readers, want to know two things: What is "Conversations With Sheryl Sutton" 
about? And is it any good? It's my job to answer those questions and, if 
possible, give you something extra besides. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing looks worse in a review than a simple confession of ignorance. Yet the 
truth is: I have only a vague idea of what this experimental novel is about. 
And it may be good, but how good only a reader a lot more erudite than I (and, 
let's face it, than most of you too) would be qualified to say. 
</P>
<P>
 I could finesse this, of course. Reviewers have ways of disguising their 
intellectual inadequacy. I could talk about the author, Hungarian poet Janos 
Pilinszky (1921-81). I could dwell on the social and historical background: He 
was in prison camps during World War II; later, under Hungary's Communist 
regime, which banned his poetry for 10 years, he eked out a living as a 
columnist for Catholic publications. I could talk about the theater: Much of 
"Conversations" is a treatise on what we now call performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything but the book itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The neatest trick -- in fact, the one I'll use here -- is to talk about the 
book after all, but only about those parts of it I can understand. The idea is 
that its readership, at best, will be small and select. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilinszky's true audience will be smart enough to find it even without the aid 
of my crude finger-pointing; the rest of you won't be able to call my bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, then: Paris, 1973. A man and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Pilinszky, is in his 50s and ailing (although the bout of pneumonia 
he suffers in the novel may be just "a wry acknowledgment of his hypochondria," 
co-translator Peter Jay says). The woman, Sheryl Sutton, is another real 
person, an American actress, then 23, appearing in the Robert Wilson play 
"Deafman Glance," a work that highly impressed Pilinszky. 
</P>
<P>
 In life, Pilinszky and Sutton met briefly at a cafe and later talked for 
several hours. In the novel, they have a number of long, deeply philosophical 
conversations. Their relationship, although platonic, is intense. Sutton nurses 
Pilinszky back to health, sometimes sleeping on the floor beside his sickbed. 
She reads his works, acts out dramatic scenarios that they make up and cooks 
him his favorite potato goulash. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we expect a contrast between the world-weary European and the raw, 
primitive Yank? Whatever the real Sheryl Sutton may be like, Pilinszky's Sutton 
is fully his equal in intellect and sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dialogue, set down unadorned as in a play, is so elliptical and poetic 
that Jay admits: "There are a few passages so baffling that nobody we have 
turned to has been able to shed light on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilinszky himself puts it best: This so-called novel is "the only book of 
essays I am capable of writing." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of those essays -- of the conversations -- is what possibilities 
are left for art after the horrors of the 20th Century. The aim, Pilinszky 
says, is to become a "citizen of the universe," not merely of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Masterpieces are beyond boredom, not before it," he says. "What now disturbs 
me in modern literature is that it doesn't dare run the risk of boredom," as 
Tolstoy's novels and Bach's music did. Sutton finds in Wilson's play and in 
performance art a path around the conventions of realistic theater to a direct 
confrontation with reality, the silence and wholeness of Greek tragedy and 
religious ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, finally, a book of wonders. It's a wonder that the chance meeting 
between Pilinszky and Sutton gave rise to such a singular work. That Jay and 
Eva Major spent years translating it. That Sheep Meadow-Carcanet published it, 
with what must have been little hope of commercial gain. In short, that 
"Conversations," quirky and brave, exists at all -- waiting for the right 
readers to come along. And reviewers be damned.

TV REVIEW; BAY LIVING BEFORE THE BIG CHILL; PBS MINISERIES 'TALES OF THE CITY' 
A SEXUAL LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years from now, television may look back at PBS' groundbreaking six-hour 
"American Playhouse" series "Tales of the City" and say this is where broadcast 
television really grew up, where mainstream viewers finally welcomed diverse 
sexual behavior -- straight, gay, young and old -- in TV drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's equally probable that most viewers aren't ready for this 
spinning constellation of sexual entanglements featuring a funky group of 
characters sharing a magical Russian Hill boardinghouse in pre-AIDS, 1976 San 
Francisco. (The miniseries airs at 9 tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15.) 
</P>
<P>
 The show's sobering, onscreen cautionary signal -- "Viewer Discretion Advised" 
-- is humorously balanced by a lighter advisement -- "Leisure Suits Optional." 
And, indeed, much that follows does cast a nostalgic, satiric glow. What 
lingers, however, is the sense of a TV drama ahead of its time, too candid and 
risky for prime time (cable or network). In fact, several Hollywood companies 
turned the project down; it got on the air because of financial backing from 
Britain's Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 With Olympia Dukakis the nominal star as a warm, spirited landlady and 
marijuana-gardening mother hen to a flock of gay and straight tenants, the 
story is an arabesque of revolving dark, comic and tender couplings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Included are naked people frolicking on a beach, two gay men French kissing 
long and hard in an open convertible stopped in the middle of a street, and a 
hilarious female panel discussion called "Rap About Rape," in which the arch 
hostess asks the women to "share an experience where your person was violated." 
One nervous respondent (Barbara Garrick), embarrassed because she has never 
been assaulted, concocts a story about being raped in her kitchen by the 
grocery boy, to accompanying gasps. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventively adapted by "thirtysomething" writer-producer Richard Kramer and 
directed with panache by Alastair Reid, the material originally appeared as 
fictional stories in a San Francisco newspaper column written by Armistead 
Maupin (and later turned into an internationally popular sextet of novels 
titled "Tales of the City"). 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, TV's re-creation is fascinating social history, a brilliant 
evocation of a time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who deeply inhaled the by-now-blurry '70s (characters smoke pot 
throughout the movie), the episodes sweep you back to a time that seems half a 
century ago -- when macrame and bell-bottoms, bathhouses and unsafe sex framed 
what seemed the last unfettered sexual holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the overall effect of these tales recalls an earlier generation 
re-entering another flamboyant era that also shattered its fathers' values: the 
Jazz Age. Dukakis even quotes a line from Fitzgerald's Jazz Age classic "The 
Great Gatsby": "She was a woman who was meant to be kissed on the eyes." 
Kramer's script is full of such surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchoring much of the plot, which might be likened to an unflinching, adult 
version of "Melrose Place," is a sweet, naive hayseed from the Midwest 
(demurely played by Laura Linney). Serving as the moral counterpoint to the 
amoral characters orbiting about her, the very centered Linney catches the 
excitement of moving to the big city and the cool reality of momentarily 
succumbing to a married cad (Thomas Gibson) who is a closet gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the homosexual activity in the stories, essentially off camera, 
is portrayed as a casual given and, most refreshingly, is free of doom and 
gloom. Gay and lesbian characters (the latter represented by Chloe Webb and 
Cynda Williams) do predominate, but a gay lifestyle is not what "Tales of the 
City" is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Life surges through this story abetted by a great phantasmagoria of a 
boardinghouse set (from designer Victoria Paul) where figures converse on 
angular, rickety stairways and in a verdant courtyard where Dukakis curiously 
gardens by night. The singularly moving love affair is reserved for Dukakis' 
aging, worldly landlady and her most unlikely suitor, a buttoned-down 
advertising executive (Donald Moffat), lamentably stuck with a brainless wife 
(Nina Foch). 
</P>
<P>
 The other relationships are metallic affairs typified by a loveless but 
cheerful young gay (the winning Marcus D'Amico), a cruising gay gynecologist 
(William Campbell) and a womanizing waiter (Paul Gross) who tills with ease the 
city's fields of unattached females. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been said that Maupin's story is brushed with a touch of magic realism 
and that's true. Most of the characters, not the least of which is that 
shingled boardinghouse, are not what they seem and the mysteries are 
dramatically unraveled in Wednesday's final hour.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; REALITY IN 'PELICAN BRIEF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Felipa R. Richland (" 'Pelican' Grief!" Dec. 27) would do well to heed her own 
advice to "get out in the real world." Julia Roberts' portrayal of a young law 
student whose life suddenly is invaded by massive acts of violence is probably 
closer to reality than either the book's character or Richland's fantasy image. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' character was rightfully traumatized. Women, unlike men, are 
generally not brought up to experience physical violence on a regular basis. 
Traditionally, males physically fight among themselves from a young age to 
establish hierarchy. Thank God most women do not experience fistfights, 
football, lacrosse, water polo, wrestling or other forms of regular violence 
that men consider normal "sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Given this difference in growth experience, I found the Roberts character's 
reaction to her boyfriend's car-bombing death and the violent death of so many 
around her to be very credible.

 A 24-year-old woman (or man, for that matter) who exhibited more courage, 
resourcefulness and ingenuity would have been -- like Supergirl or Superman -- 
totally unbelievable. As a 53-year-old man, I found the Roberts character to be 
more brave -- although a bit more naive, as well -- than I would have been at 
age 24 under similar circumstances. Knowing what I know now, I would not even 
have attempted what she did. Furthermore, in the real world it is doubtful that 
she would have survived.

 If you want to see not only smart and attractive but courageous and sensitive, 
go to your video rental store and rent "Terminator 2, Judgment Day," "Alien" 
and "Aliens." Forget that they are science fiction and concentrate on the 
remarkable performances of Linda Hamilton and Sigourney Weaver. These two women 
are thrown into unimaginable situations but find inner strength and 
determination to deal with the problem, while never giving up their femininity.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; DEFENDING 'GYPSY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm writing in regard to the Joe Baltake Counterpunch, "There's Nothing Wrong 
With '62 'Gypsy' " (Dec. 27). At last, the voice of reason! When I heard that 
my favorite musical, "Gypsy," was being remade for television, I was very 
excited -- initially.For the next few weeks, I was bombarded by articles about 
this remake that seemed more intent on tearing down the 1962 Rosalind Russell 
film than shedding any light on the new show. By the time the show aired, I 
found myself watching the remake in a very defensive mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been lovely to sit back and enjoy yet another interpretation of 
a wonderful musical. Instead, I felt compelled to come to the defense of an old 
friend.

 Still No Doubt: 20th Century Fox's "Mrs. Doubtfire," the cross-dressing comedy 
starring Robin Williams, cleaned up over the weekend, taking in $11.4 million 
to hold on to first place in box-office sales for the fourth time in seven 
weeks, according to early industry estimates. Warner Bros.' "The Pelican Brief" 
was No. 2 with $8.4 million. "Tombstone," from Disney's Hollywood Pictures, was 
third with $6.4 million, followed by Warner Bros.' "Grumpy Old Men" with$6.2 
million. "The Air Up There," also from Hollywood Pictures, took fifth with $5.5 
million. Other box-office notables: Savoy Pictures' "Shadowlands" took in $3.8 
million for sixth place. Two films from Universal had impressive showings in 
limited release: "Schindler's List" garnered $2.5 million on 172 screens and 
"In the Name of the Father" grossed $250,00 on just 13 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards Roundup: "Schindler's List" has won yet another award: USC's sixth 
annual Scripter Award, which honors the year's best film adaptation of a book. 
Screenwriter Steven Zaillian and author Thomas Keneally will be honored at a 
dinner on Jan. 29. It's the second Scripter for Zaillian -- he won the award in 
1990 for the movie "Awakenings." . . . "Shadowlands" has won the Film Advisory 
Board's Award of Excellence. Sir Anthony Hopkins was named best actor for his 
performance in the film; he'll also receive a special career achievement award 
from the group. RADIO

 Ad Not-So-Hot: The Clinton Administration has pulled an AIDS-prevention radio 
spot featuring Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, after 
learning he had been convicted of sexual battery. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala said she was "outraged" to find out about Kiedis' 
background. In the public service ad unveiled last week, Kiedis urged radio 
audiences to use a condom: "Remember you can be naked without being exposed," 
he said. In 1990, Kiedis was convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure 
stemming from an incident after a concert at George Mason University in 
Virginia in which he touched a woman's face with his penis. The ad was 
developed by the firm Ogilvy & Mather of Atlanta. Shalala has ordered the 
company to give her a report on how it failed to take note of Kiedis' 
background. TELEVISION

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CYBORG' POWER-WALKS TO AN AGONIZINGLY SLOW END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ads are right -- "American Cyborg: Steel Warrior" (citywide) really is 
"the ultimate science-fiction battle of the new year," at least given the 
dearth of other science-fiction battles in competition since the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the quintessential "Terminator" rip-off of the new year. And, as far 
as shoestring-budgeted, Israeli-made movies with "American" in the title go, 
this one's unqualifiedly the tops since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Lara, who rose to fame as "Tarzan in Manhattan" on CBS five years ago, 
gets to wax slightly more articulate here as the wired-up warrior of the title. 
(With his beefy looks and long locks, he comes from the Fabio line of future 
social engineering, presumably.) He's first introduced drifting through stock 
post-apocalyptic shantytowns some 17 years after the world goes boom, still 
impervious -- not having watched his own dailies, apparently -- to the fact 
that he's not human. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience susses it much sooner: There must be some reason Lara's slow in 
putting the moves on heroine Nicole Hansen, who'd be high on any end-times 
dance card, since she's not only "the last fertile woman in the world" but also 
the last one bold or built enough to flaunt cleavage in the daunting face of 
radioactive fallout and acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
 These two meet up as Hansen is fleeing from John Ryan, the movie's other 
terminator -- er, American cyborg -- who just shot up everyone in her 
underground science-lab bunker. Seems she's got a test-tube baby in her 
backpack, and the evil machines that have been running what's left of the U.S. 
would just as soon have the race not propagate. (How circuit-breakers conquered 
the world isn't really explained; the spoken intro might as well include the 
disclaimer, "For further reference, cf. James Cameron.") 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to cross what looks like the Bronx and get the unborn baby to a 
European rescue vessel waiting off the coast, before the amniotic fluid 
expires, and before his shampoo or her lip gloss supplies run out. 
</P>
<P>
 This impossible quest doesn't turn out to be as hard as it sounds. Mute, blond 
baddie Ryan is supposedly a much more sophisticated model of cyborg than hero 
Lara, but for all his advancement he's the world's worst shot, even with a 
semi-automatic, and never uses a door when he could waste time punching his way 
through the nearest wall. These delaying tactics allow "American Cyborg" to 
drag on for 94 thrill-free minutes of mostly shootin' and missin' in abandoned 
Tel Aviv factories. 
</P>
<P>
 If the film consists mostly of power-walking disguised as one long chase 
scene, it does pay off in at least one unforgettable laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 As world-saviors Lara and Hansen jog their way through the ruins, with the 
menacing bag o' bolts who couldn't hit the side of a barn close behind, 
director Boaz Davidson at one point cuts improbably to a shot of the developing 
fetus in the beaker inside the contested knapsack. It's seen being jiggled up 
and down hilariously, and apparently surviving mom's sprint like one of our 
best-made Walkmans. For fleeting moments like this do bad-movie lovers live.

TV REVIEW; VIETNAM'S DEFINING EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the many qualities that seems to separate the Vietnam War story from 
previous U.S. battle histories is the lack of the indelible event that defined 
the soldier's experience. Vietnam, apparently, had no Antietam, no Battle of 
the Bulge, that encapsulated the best and worst in those who were in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 With tonight's edition of "Day One," titled "They Were Young and Brave" (8 
p.m. on ABC, Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42), that perception should be dramatically 
changed. Combining the immediacy of the best of TV's Vietnam coverage with a 
sobering narrative to match a Civil War account by Bruce Catton, this Forrest 
Sawyer-hosted account of the pivotal Battle of Ia Drang tells two powerful 
stories at once. 
</P>
<P>
 First is the montage of memories of those -- American and Vietnamese -- who 
were at Ia Drang, an area in western Vietnam near the key North Vietnamese 
supply line of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Second is the genesis of the disastrous 
U.S. military escalation, for although the eventual outcome of Ia Drang was a 
U.S. fiasco and massacre, U.S. leadership used it to justify a jungle war of 
attrition against a guerrilla force. From victory to defeat to governmental 
distortion, Ia Drang may be the symbolic event of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The air cavalry squad led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore in late 1965 became the first 
and most spectacular experiment in the U.S. attempt to defeat the North 
Vietnamese by moving ground troops by air. Moore's men unknowingly landed in 
the Ia Drang Valley next to a key North Vietnamese supply base, and were 
outnumbered 10-to-1. Despite this, the battle on Nov. 14 ultimately swayed in 
the U.S. favor, thanks to air support. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 15 was another matter. A foolish maneuver with a fresh squadron that 
included then-private and now ABC reporter Jack Smith led the group into a 
grisly ambush. Smith and his surviving buddies, including Capt. George Forrest 
(whose heroics possibly prevented a complete wipeout) return to the valley 
clearing, vividly recalling the tragedy. Smith's shattering memories include 
him playing dead and watching as napalm from U.S. planes dropped like liquid 
death on a field with dying troops on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 These former enemies, including North Vietnamese Gen. Nguyen Huu An, embrace 
at the battlefield site, aware as perhaps no one else of the significance of 
these two days. An says that his army knew from this point on that it could 
outlast the Americans; Moore and his men shudder that their own army, in a 
cynical case of disinformation, turned the bloody defeat into a "victory." 
Their faces, along with the revealing archive film and photos, tell the real 
story.

FORUM A SITE FOR SORE EYES AS LAKERS START COLD, LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever it cost Laker Coach Randy Pfund for being suspended by the NBA and 
having to stay away from the Forum on Sunday night -- the $3,000 fine and one 
game's pay for bumping an official during Friday's victory over the Clippers -- 
was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of reasons for those who came to the Forum, including the 
11,069 fans and interim Coach Bill Bertka, to be envious of Pfund getting to 
stay home. At least 25 of them -- the number of points the Lakers scored in the 
first half en route to a 95-89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fewest points the L.A. Lakers have ever scored in a half, lowering 
the mark, set Dec. 19, 1990 at Cleveland, by four. It also tied the 
third-fewest points in a half in the NBA since the advent of the shot clock in 
1954-55, five off the record set in 1975 by New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice being part of history," Bertka said, looking at the stat sheet. 
"But this is all bad history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could it have been much worse? I don't know how, unless we missed every 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Lakers missed only 27 of 37 attempts while scoring a season-low 11 
points in the first quarter and then 14 in the second. That was worth a 51-25 
deficit and a rare shower of boos from the home fans who, for the most part, 
have otherwise been sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough when we couldn't hit any shots," said Nick Van Exel, who led the 
Lakers with 19 points. "It kind of got everybody down. You could tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers finished at 38.1% and even won the second half, 64-44, making it 
their second- highest scoring half of the season. They were especially good 
when it mattered the least, the very end, when a rout became respectable in the 
box score because of three three-pointers in the final 22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They began to make some runs," San Antonio Coach John Lucas said. "We were 
perfect most of the night. We didn't turn the ball over. We executed. We got 
everything we needed, and they took some pride in who they were late in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund got in trouble for arguing a call two nights earlier. Pfund got two 
technicals within seconds from Ted Bernhardt, then followed Bernhardt out to 
midcourt to continue his argument after being ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Though any contact at this point seemed incidental, the league ruled that 
Pfund intentionally bumped Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself to be a fierce competitor, but apparently in this case the 
league feels that I overreacted," Pfund said in a statement. "I apologize. 
However, as coach of the Lakers I will always fight for my players so that they 
get the respect that they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 That put the 66-year-old Bertka in charge for a full game for the first time 
since he subbed for a flu-ridden Mike Dunleavy at the Sports Arena on Dec. 25, 
1991. Laker Notes 
</P>

 Sam Bowie attended the game, his first since undergoing arthroscopic surgery 
Wednesday, and said he has already started therapy toward rehabilitating his 
left knee. Doctors have said the soonest he could return is six weeks. "The 
good thing with this injury was that when I had them in the past people would 
always say it was career-threatening," said Bowie, who once played 25 games 
over three seasons and sat out all of 1987-88 after problems with both lower 
legs. "This is minor compared to that. I'm looking forward to getting back."

 Stand-in Laker Coach Bill Bertka was the general manager when the New Orleans 
Jazz scored 20 points on Jan. 4, 1975.

 Kurt Rambis made his first appearance since rejoining the Lakers and got an 
ovation when he entered in the third quarter. . . . Dennis Rodman, who said he

MORNING BRIEFING: MIDNIGHT MOVES INTO BALTIMORE COST A BIT MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KMPC's Mike Lamb was wondering how much it would cost for the Rams to move to 
Baltimore, so as part of an on-air bit he called the Mayflower World-Wide 
Moving office in Baltimore and a woman named Edna came on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it you want to move?" Edna asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some office equipment, some weights, actually quite a bit of stuff," Lamb 
said. "You ever moved a sports team before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Edna: "Yeah, we moved the Colts. I mean our company did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb, seeing he had a live one: "Well, now you can't tell anybody, but we're 
looking into moving the Rams to Baltimore and need to know how much it would 
cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Edna: "Sure, just fax me an inventory. You can sign it with a phony name if 
you like. Sign it Joe Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 Edna's guestimate was $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a radio conspiracy: Last week, KROQ radio morning hosts Kevin Ryder and 
Gene (Bean) Baxter sent Michael the Maintenance Man, a morning show regular, to 
the Bel-Air home of Ram owner Georgia Frontiere. He used his bullhorn to chant, 
"Georgia, sell the team," until he was stopped by a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL playoff record for most yards rushing in a 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 Same old stuff: After listening to television commentators on New Year's Day, 
Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun had a few comments about the bowl coverage. 
Among them: "You have to like the thoroughness O. J. Simpson brings to his job 
as a sideline reporter. After reporting a guy had broken his arm, Juice 
informed us, 'He will not return to the game.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The top Keith Jackson-ism of the day was 'Stick a fork in that thing (the 
pigskin), it's walking around,' " after three consecutive turnovers in the Rose 
Bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it can be told: Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden finally won his first 
national championship. But a glorious finish might never have been if things 
had gone differently at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Sentinel columnist Larry Guest writes: "When Bobby Bowden pondered 
leaving West Virginia in 1976 to start his spectacular run at Florida State, he 
held firm to his vow that he couldn't consider the move for less than $40,000 
salary. Then-prez Stanley Marshall held firm to FSU's budgeted $37,000. 
Athletic director John Bridgers broke the impasse by scraping together funds to 
add a $3,000 expense account to the Bowden package, and FSU's national title 
run was out of the gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it can be told II: Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda is known for his 
motivational speeches, but he hopes his latest talk will soon be forgotten in 
Los Angeles. Lasorda is still lamenting the pep talk he gave the University of 
Wisconsin before it beat UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Feeling as though he betrayed 
his home team, Lasorda says: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was right before Christmas and I walked into the Doubletree Hotel in 
Pasadena to speak for a fund-raiser for Cal State L.A. and two guys were 
hollering at me from the cocktail lounge. It was (Wisconsin Coach) Barry 
Alvarez and (Athletic Director) Pat Richter, and they asked me if I would speak 
to their team. I said sure, but never heard anything. Then the day before I was 
leaving for Las Vegas for New Year's, I was in the Dodger office and the 
Wisconsin SID called to arrange the speech. I said I couldn't do it because I 
was leaving town. But he said, 'Why not right now?' So I jumped into the car 
and drove to Pasadena and started giving them a pep talk, and well, there were 
a lot of reporters there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda says his record when he gives such talks is 19-2. 
</P>
<P>
 We move to basketball: Who better than Utah's Karl Malone to offer these 
thoughts on reincarnation and survival of the fittest: "I'd see myself coming 
back as a bald eagle if I came back as an animal -- something that's not 
confined. When I'm playing basketball I'm like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the strong survive. If you're weak in the jungle, somebody's going to 
eat you. When you're weak on the basketball court, everybody knows that and 
everybody takes their shots." 
</P>
<P>
 You name it: On a recent Clippers-Dallas Mavericks radio broadcast, 
play-by-play announcer Ralph Lawler was in a quandary. Finally he stopped the 
broadcast and said: "If you're a little confused right now, we certainly 
understand. Both teams have a backcourt of Harper and Jackson." The Clippers 
were playing Mark Jackson and Ron Harper, while the Mavericks had Derek Harper 
and Jimmy Jackson on the floor. Derek Harper was traded Thursday to the New 
York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Eric Dickerson of the Rams, with 248 yards against Dallas in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post, on Buddy Ryan of the Houston 
Oilers: "Yes, you can be a great coach and a complete fool. The two are not 
mutually exclusive, as anybody who has ever watched Bobby Knight can attest."

BOXING; NORRIS STOPS JIMMERSON STREAK AT 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World Boxing Assn. cruiserweight champion Orlin Norris beat Art Jimmerson on 
Sunday night when the ringside physician stopped the bout after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmerson staggered to his corner, and Dr. Robert Karns said it would have 
been unsafe for him to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris (39-3 with 22 knockouts) stunned Jimmerson (30-6) with numerous punches 
while Jimmerson was on the ropes in the middle of the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, 193 pounds, then stopped the 16-fight winning streak of Jimmerson, 
195, with another flurry of punches at the end of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris is the older brother of former WBA super-welterweight champion Terry 
Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 In scheduled 10-round bouts, Danny Romero, 112 1/2, of Albuquerque, N.M., 
knocked out Armando Diaz, 113, of Laredo, Tex., at 42 seconds of the ninth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Herrera, 130, of San Diego, knocked out Raul Cantreras, 130, of El 
Centro, Calif., at 1:25 of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 On the undercard, Anthony Brown, 154, of Phoenix fought Jeff Leggett, 150, of 
San Diego to a majority four-round draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Other results included: Roberto Garcia, 127, of Oxnard knocking out Hector 
Diaz, 127, of El Centro at 2:56 of the second round; and Alfredo Garcia of Los 
Angeles, 147 3/4, fighting Sergio Mesa, 146, of Pomona to a four-round draw.

NBA ROUNDUP; NO BARKLEY OR JOHNSON, BUT PHOENIX WINS ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Suns, playing without Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson, got 29 points and 
17 rebounds from A.C. Green in a 122-107 victory Sunday night over the Golden 
State Warriors at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, the NBA's most valuable player last season, was placed on the injured 
list earlier Sunday because of a small tendon tear in his right leg.He was 
injured during the Suns' 110-103 victory over Minnesota on Friday night, and 
underwent a MRI test Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Emerson, the Suns' doctor, said he couldn't decide how long Barkley 
would be out until he sees how the tendon responds this week. "This type of 
injury normally does not require surgery," Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Johnson filled in for injured Kevin Johnson, the Suns' No. 2 scorer, 
with 26 points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson missed his third game in a row to rest a right thigh bruise and 
ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a very proud team that forgot their adversities for two hours and 
kicked our butts," Golden State Coach Don Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle added 23 points, and Danny Ainge had 11 of his 21 points in the 
fourth quarter to help Phoenix squelch a rally and win its third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber had 18 points, and Billy Owens had 17 points and 10 rebounds for 
the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 99, Portland 85 -- Patrick Ewing scored 36 points and John Starks 
added 30 for the Knicks at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks never trailed after the first quarter, but didn't put the game away 
until the fourth. Ewing and Starks had 15 of New York's points in a 17-7 run 
that gave the Knicks a 16-point lead with four minutes to play.

NHL ROUNDUP; CAPITALS' TABARACCI IS PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michal Pivonka scored two goals and Rick Tabaracci stopped 32 shots for the 
fifth shutout of his career Sunday night to lead the Washington Capitals to a 
4-0 victory over the New Jersey Devils at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is 4-1-2 in its last seven games while winning only its fourth game 
within the Atlantic Division (4-9-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Two Devil winning streaks were broken -- four games overall and six in a row 
on home ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvain Cote and Peter Bondra also scored for Washington. It was Tabaracci's 
second shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 4, Chicago 2 -- The Oilers got power-play goals from Igor Kravchuk 
and Zdeno Ciger at Chicago. It was the Blackhawks' third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk's goal gave Edmonton, only 16th in the league on the power play 
(18.3%), a 1-0 lead, and Shjon Podein, playing in only his third game since 
Nov. 24, broke a 1-1 tie and gave the Oilers the lead for good when he scored 
his first goal since April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 5, Vancouver 3 -- Rookie Derek Plante scored his 13th and 14th goals 
for the Sabres at home, where they handed Vancouver its fifth loss in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Plante snapped a 3-3 tie 6:22 into the final period, beating goalie Kay 
Whitmore through the legs with a five-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only the second in the last six games for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 2, St. Louis 1 -- Mike McPhee scored shorthanded with 12:39 to play to 
snap a 1-1 tie, and goalie Andy Moog stopped 24 shots for the Stars at Dallas.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Making four key free throws in the final minutes enabled Glenn Robinson to 
overcome a poor shooting performance, giving 10th-ranked Purdue its best start. 
</P>
<P>
 The free throws allowed the Boilermakers (13-0) to hold off Seton Hall, 69-67, 
Sunday at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson led Purdue with 24 points, but made only two of 11 shots in the 
second half. He was eight for 23 overall after bringing a 29.9-point average 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Robinson is fabulous," Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo said. "He's 
clearly the premier player in the country. . . . He gets points so many 
different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham 67, No. 17 Cincinnati 65 -- Robert Shannon scored a 
season-high 24 points, including two on free throws with 30 seconds to play, to 
lead the Blazers in a Great Midwest Conference game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham (11-1, 1-0) squandered a 12-point second-half lead before 
rallying to end Cincinnati's 25-game home winning streak, third longest in the 
country. Cincinnati (11-3, 0-1) missed a shot to tie with less than a second to 
play. OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Barnes had 15 points and Virginia (8-3, 2-0) used runs at the start of 
each half to run its winning streak to five games with a 79-58 Atlantic Coast 
Conference victory over North Carolina State (4-8, 0-2) at Charlottesville, Va. 
. . . T.J. Honore scored 21 points to help Mississippi State (8-2, 2-0) to an

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: BRUINS GET BIG JUMP ON OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstered by its first Rose Bowl appearance in eight years, UCLA is off to a 
good start in football recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although players cannot sign letters of intent until Feb. 2, Coach Terry 
Donahue and his staff have unwritten commitments from 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, rebuilding under Coach John Robinson after several sub-par recruiting 
efforts by former coach Larry Smith and his staff, has concentrated on filling 
specific needs and adding depth to both lines by recruiting community college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which lost to Wisconsin, 21-16, in the Rose Bowl, has been actively 
recruiting out of state, especially the Midwest and Texas. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great year in California," says Dick Lascola, who runs the 
Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of this class is the skill kids -- running backs, wide receivers 
and defensive backs. There are virtually no quarterbacks, after Steve Campbell 
(Norco High) and Steve Buck (Alta Loma High), a handful of linemen and no 
linebackers. Overall, it's pretty lean." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has also been recruiting extensively in Texas, and USC and UCLA could be 
helped by the five-year NCAA probation against the Texas A&M football program 
that was handed down Wednesday. (However, the Aggies are prohibited from 
appearing on television and going to a bowl game only next season.) Texas A&M 
has been the one Southwest Conference school in recent years that has 
consistently recruited well in-state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, USC received a commitment from one of the top players in 
Texas, defensive lineman Cedric Jefferson (6-3, 270) of Ft. Worth, who also 
visited Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are hoping to sign 20 players, an increase from their previously 
stated goal of 17 or 18. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's 10 commitments: quarterback Steve Buck (6 feet 4, 180) of Alta Loma; 
defensive back-wide receiver Glenn Thompkins (5-9, 165) and offensive lineman 
Rick Austin (6-3, 300) of Rialto Eisenhower; running back-safety Shaun Williams 
(6-2, 185) of Encino Crespi; defensive lineman Danjuan Magee (6-3, 260) of Long 
Beach Poly; tight end-linebacker Mike Grieb (6-4, 220) of San Jose Oak Grove; 
tight end-defensive end Robert Arthur (6-5, 230) of Brownsboro, Tex.; defensive 
back Akil Davis (6 feet, 180) of Mesa, Ariz.; safety DuVal Hicks (6-2, 195) of 
Benicia, Calif., and punter Justin Sogoian (6-4, 195) of Orange Coast College. 
Sogoian, who attended La Quinta High, was an all-state selection who averaged 
42.7 yards per kick last season. He also visited USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Newhall Hart linebacker-tight end John McLaughlin (6-4, 220) says 
UCLA and Notre Dame are his top choices. Florida State, Arizona and Nebraska 
are also among his list of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and Notre Dame are also the top choices of talented running back Ty Goode 
(6-1, 185) of Southeast High in Lincoln, Neb. Goode rushed for 1,494 yards and 
30 touchdowns last season, but is considered an even better prospect at safety. 
So far, he has resisted pressure to stay home and commit to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest to sign with the Trojans are defensive end Marcus Bonds (6-6, 235) of 
West Los Angeles, offensive lineman Richard Beatie (6-6, 290) of Glendale and 
defensive back Mario Bradley (6-2, 180) of Cerritos. That group joins two 
earlier community college signees, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (6-4, 205) of 
West Los Angeles and linebacker Errick Herrin (6-3, 230) of Mt. San Jacinto. In 
addition, two other community college standouts have made commitments to sign 
with USC next month: offensive lineman Heath Baughman (6-7, 290) of Bakersfield 
and fullback Reggie Brown (6-1, 235) of College of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jefferson, other high school players who have reportedly made 
commitments to the Trojans include standout running back-defensive back Rodney 
Sermons (6 feet, 180) of La Puente Bishop Amat, defensive end George Perry 
(6-6, 235) of San Bernardino and offensive lineman David Caldwell (6-6, 310) of 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back-wide receiver Leon Blunt (5-10, 180) of San Fernando has a 
recruiting visit scheduled to USC on Feb. 21. Blunt made an unwritten 
commitment to Notre Dame during a recruiting visit last month, but has 
continued to make additional trips. He recently visited UCLA, but said this 
week that he still plans to attend Notre Dame. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Southland: Van Nuys Montclair Prep running back-defensive back 
Wilbert Smith (5-8, 185), the third-leading rusher in the state last season 
with 2,504 yards, has made an unwritten commitment to attend Illinois. The 
Illini also might be the leader for Rialto Eisenhower running back Marlon 
Farlow (5-11, 175). Notre Dame is among the schools recruiting Farlow. . . . 
Newhall Hart wide receiver-defensive back Soren Halladay (6-2, 185) has 
committed to Brigham Young. . . . Palos Verdes Peninsula tackle Matt Redman 
(6-7, 285) raised some eyebrows when he committed to Iowa recently after 
recruiting trips to California and Colorado. Redman's parents, grandparents, 
aunt and uncle attended Cal, which was considered the front-runner to sign him. 
Peninsula's other "twin tower," guard John Welbourn (6-6, 275), has visited Cal 
and Nebraska and has trips scheduled this month to UCLA and USC and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw High fullback-linebacker Dennis Fomond (5-11, 210) is scheduled to 
visit Cal this weekend. He also has trips planned to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Hawaii. He may also visit USC or Arizona. . . . Jefferson tight end-linebacker 
John Johnson (6-4, 210) has visited Arizona and Kansas and has trips planned to 
Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. UCLA has been recruiting him, but he reportedly 
wants to leave the Los Angeles area. . . . One of the better offensive line 
prospects in Southern California, Terry Williams (6-6, 260) of Placentia El 
Dorado is considering UCLA, USC, Cal, Arizona State and Colorado. Williams' 
brother Steve lettered at UCLA as an offensive lineman in 1981-83. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly two-way lineman Brandon Whiting (6-3, 260), the son of Poly 
co-Coach Thomas Whiting, will also visit Cal this weekend. He has taken a trip 
to Stanford and has one scheduled to Colorado. Two other Poly standouts, 
cornerbacks Kelly Malveaux (5-8, 175) and Lamont Morgan (6-1, 170), are being 
heavily recruited. The speedy Malveaux has visited Cal and Arizona and has 
trips planned to Washington, Colorado and Fresno State. Morgan is considering 
Oregon, Fresno State and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Pac-10: Cal has received a commitment from quarterback Trevor 
Thompson (6-4, 190) of Thousand Oaks. Thompson chose the Bears over Fresno 
State, New Mexico and Colorado State. Cal now has at least six commitments: 
tight end-linebacker Tony Gonzalez (6-6, 230) of Huntington Beach (who also 
plans to play basketball); safeties David Burnside (6-2, 175) of Milpitas, Mark 
Borr (6-1, 190) of Sacramento and Marquis Smith (6-1, 195) of San Diego Patrick 
Henry; fullback Rudy Mattox (6-1, 210) of Pinole Valley and community college 
offensive lineman Derrick Barton (6-8, 295) of San Bernardino Valley. In 
addition, the Bears have re-entered the picture for All-American defensive 
lineman Darrell Russell (6-5, 290) of San Diego St. Augustine, perhaps the 
premier prospect in California. Russell has canceled his trip to Miami and will 
visit Cal instead. He has been to USC and UCLA and also plans to visit Notre 
Dame and Michigan. . . . Stanford has received commitments from offensive 
linemen Brian Donahue (6-5, 250) of Albuquerque, N.M., and Geoff Wilson (6-6, 
255) of Robertsdale, Ala. Donahue chose the Cardinal over USC. Wilson was also 
recruited by Alabama, Auburn, Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and LSU. However, 
Stanford lost standout running back-defensive back Tim Dwight (5-8, 155) of 
Iowa City, Iowa, to the hometown Hawkeyes. Dwight visited Stanford last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More Pac-10: Arizona has signed community college tight end Damon Terrell 
(6-4, 235) of El Camino. Terrell, who attended Serra High in Gardena, caught 47 
passes for 588 yards last season. The Wildcats received an unwritten commitment 
from wide receiver Jim Romero (5-9, 170) of Sepulveda L.A. Baptist. Romero, who 
chose Arizona over Washington, caught 86 passes for 1,570 yards and 15 
touchdowns last season. . . . Despite the presence of a top-notch freshman 
quarterback, Jake Plummer, Arizona State has received a commitment from highly 
regarded quarterback Steve Campbell (6-7, 220) of Norco. Two of Campbell's 
teammates, offensive linemen Mike Barnes (6-4, 250) and Troy Davis (6-4, 235), 
also committed to the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which has been severely hampered by NCAA probation limiting its 
scholarship allotment and official campus recruiting visits, has concentrated 
on in-state players. The Huskies now have eight commitments: offensive linemen 
Ben Kadletz (6-4, 270) of La Canada St. Francis, running back-defensive back Ty 
Fotheringill (5-10, 170) of Kelso, Wash., wide receiver Marvin Kasim (5-9, 170) 
of Seattle, linebacker Chad Wright (6-3, 225) of Fife, Wash., offensive lineman 
Aaron Dalan (6-7, 285) of Sequim, Wash., defensive lineman Josh Smith (6-6, 
225) of Bellingham, Wash., and community college offensive linemen Matt Hicks 
(6-6, 295) and Eugene Seminavaga (6-5, 290) of Cerritos. The Huskies' 
recruiting class would be helped considerably if they could sign standout 
offensive line prospects Tony Coats (6-6, 275) and Benji Olson (6-4, 280), 
teammates from South Kitsap High in Port Orchard, Wash. Olson has already 
visited Washington, and Coats will be in Seattle this weekend. Coats is also 
considering Stanford and Notre Dame.

MICKELSON OUTLASTS COUPLES IN A PLAYOFF; GOLF: LEFT-HANDER, 23, BECOMES 
YOUNGEST TO WIN FOUR PGA EVENTS, BREAKING NICKLAUS' RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the battle between Phil Mickelson and Fred Couples for first prize in the 
regular PGA Tour portion of the $1.5-million Mercedes Championship, it became a 
case of who bogeyed last. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, the veteran, was the loser Sunday on the second extra hole at La 
Costa, failing to sink a 12-foot par putt. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mickelson, 23, it was indeed an exciting day. Not only did his family see 
the feat, but he became the youngest to win four PGA events, breaking Jack 
Nicklaus' record by three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-hander also beat Nicklaus by three shots as the regular Tour players 
put an end to the seniors' dreams of an overall victory in the simultaneous 
tournaments played from the same tees by both age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson and Couples were 12 under par at 276. Tom Kite, second last year, 
also beat the old-timers, finishing third at 278. Defending champion Davis Love 
III made a late run, but fell four shots short at 280. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson, after being six under for 15 holes on the final round, started 
hooking his drives. He bogeyed the 16th to allow Couples to pull even. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 569-yard par-five 17th, Couples, trying to lay up from the rough in the 
right, hit a two-iron. His body was well in front of his club head and the ball 
sliced into the water on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson, with a chance to go two shots ahead, pulled a 12-foot birdie putt 
and Couples bogeyed. Mickelson needed only to par 18 to win. His second shot 
was slightly below the green, 30 feet from the pin. He took a putter and 
blasted the ball 15 feet past the cup. Couples made a routine par and it was 
back to the 18th tee for the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples missed a chance to win when his 22-foot downhill putt barely curved 
around the cup. Couples, who had hit his driver far to the right into the trees 
on No. 10 during most of the tournament, went to his three-wood for the 
playoff. He hit a very slight hook, but it rolled down the hill and into the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have enough room to go for the green," Couples said. "I had to 
get it over the water and then pitch up. I left it 12 feet short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would really have been nice to win the first tournament of the year, but 
it was a fun match. It was just hard to lose. I'll get over it in about an 
hour. Phil is a fine young golfer, and he'll win many more times." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson has become tough to beat in his home San Diego area. Last spring, he 
won the San Diego Open at Torrey Pines, his favorite course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was really a thrill," he said. "It qualifies me for the World Series and 
makes certain I'll get to come back here. . . . What could be better than 
winning with my family and friends watching? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't expect to do that well. I had hardly touched a club in the 
last month. But I owe much to Dean Reinmuth, my coach. He has been helping me 
with my swing." 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was cloudy when the seniors teed up in the morning, but it turned out 
to be the fourth consecutive perfect day, with little wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples birdied the first two holes and the fourth. Meanwhile, Mickelson 
barely missed an eagle on two and also birdied three and six. Despite bogeying 
No. 5, the leaders were pulling away.

SANTA ANITA; TWO TRAINERS FIND THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neither of the trainers who won stakes at Santa Anita on Sunday is accustomed 
to seeing his name in the daily program. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Roberts, who saddled Mr. Cooperative, a 34-1 shot, for his victory in 
the $82,050 San Miguel Stakes, has a three-horse stable and started only a 
handful of horses in Southern California all last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rafael Becerra, who won the $111,800 San Gorgonio Handicap with Hero's 
Love, is Gary Jones' longtime assistant who has become head trainer through 
Jan. 20 while Jones completes a 30-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous and excited," Becerra said after Hero's Love's half- length 
victory. "We've won a lot of stakes over the years, but you get a different 
feeling when you've got your name in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who started a horse at Del Mar that tested positive for a prohibited 
medication, spent about 10 days in Texas and was at Lake Tahoe during the 
weekend. Becerra said that he and "the boss" talk daily on the phone about the 
barn's operation. Jones' son, Marty, has continued to work as a stable 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hero's Love popped an abscess (in her right hind hoof) after the Matriarch," 
Marty Jones said. "It took us some extra time to get her ready for another 
race." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Matriarch, at Hollywood Park on Nov. 28, Hero's Love was facing the 
class of the female turf division and the 6-year-old mare finished fourth, 2 
1/2 lengths behind Flawlessly. Skimble, who finished third in the Matriarch, 
also ran Sunday, but as the field straightened out for the stretch run in the 
San Gorgonio, it was Miss Turkana, Hero's Love's stablemate, who became the 
horse to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love overtook Miss Turkana, who finished third, a half-length behind 
Skimble. Hero's Love, paying $8, carried 119 pounds, one pound less than the 
high weight, Market Booster, who finished ninth in the 10-horse field. The time 
for 1 1/8 miles was 1:47 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Hero's Love in the Matriarch, started a five-day 
suspension Sunday and was replaced by Laffit Pincay, who rode his 12th winner 
of the meet to finish the day tied with Chris Antley for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra, 39, was a teen-ager when he started working for Gary Jones' father, 
Farrell, in 1970. Hero's Love gave Becerra his fourth winner of the meet, which 
ties him for the lead in the trainers' standings. No. 3 came earlier Sunday, 
when Beautiful Gem, a first-time starter, ran six furlongs in 1:09 2/5 to beat 
maiden 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Miguel winner, Mr. Cooperative, had run only once before, beating 
$50,000 maidens at Hollywood Park in the mud Dec. 12. The 3-year-old Texas-bred 
gelding gave Roberts, 35, his first stakes winner in a training career that 
started in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Cooperative, ridden by Martin Pedroza, held off Subtle Trouble by a 
half-length, with the favorite, Ramblin Guy, finishing third, another 
three-quarters of a length back. Mr. Cooperative, carrying 114 pounds, ran six 
furlongs in 1:09 2/5. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love races for Frank Stronach, who was voted owner of the year for 
Canada in 1993. . . . Alan Klein, a Marina Del Rey attorney, is the principal 
owner of Mr. Cooperative. His partners are Kanichi Ando and John Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajo broke down at the top of the stretch in the San Miguel, forcing Subtle 
Trouble's jockey, Alex Solis, to change course. . . . Another weekend winner 
for trainer Rafael Becerra was Lakeway, a 3-year-old filly who ran Saturday.

WALL STREET SUSPECTS VIACOM MIGHT REVISE PARAMOUNT BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Wall Street gave a lukewarm response to Viacom's new bid for Paramount 
Communications, many analysts and traders were expecting Viacom to revise the 
back-end, non-cash component of its offer for the movie studio and book 
publisher, perhaps by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom, the parent company of MTV and Nickelodeon, surprised investors last 
week by announcing it would acquire home video retail giant Blockbuster 
Entertainment for $8.4-billion and boost its cash offer to $105 per share for 
50.1% of Paramount's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom made the revised, two step merger-and-bid announcement literally hours 
before the deadline for a rival tender offer from home shopping channel QVC 
Network was set to close. 
</P>
<P>
 The gambit, although immediately disparaged by Wall Street traders who 
complained that the overall value of the Paramount-Blockbuster bid still fell 
short of QVC's offer, nonetheless caused enough confusion to keep Paramount 
shareholders from tendering their stock to QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts over the weekend expected QVC to launch another court battle claiming 
that Viacom had violated bidding procedures agreed to by all parties, but a 
source close to QVC cautioned against such speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Sunday said its revised offer for Paramount "fully complies with the 
bidding procedures" and that QVC also was not required to extend its tender 
offer until Jan. 21. Viacom said its sweetened bid boosts the cash component by 
more than $1.1 billion over its previous offer and by more than $800 million 
over QVC's bid. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC appeared to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that once the dust 
settled early this week shareholders would begin tendering their shares to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to QVC said that in the wake of the Viacom-Blockbuster 
announcement "the entire community froze and no one will tender their shares." 
</P>
<P>
 But the source expressed confidence "next week they'll start the process."

L.A. CONVENTION BOOKINGS UP 49% OVER 1992; TOURISM: OFFICIALS HESITATE TO 
DECLARE A TURNAROUND, THOUGH, NOTING THAT THE CITY STILL LAGS FAR BEHIND 
OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that Los Angeles' battered tourist industry is on the mend, 
convention bookings during the last half of 1993 were nearly 50% higher than in 
the final six months of 1992, according to the Los Angeles Convention & 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism officials remain cautious, however. They note that a complete 
turnaround remains a long way off and that Los Angeles lags far behind cities 
such as Anaheim, San Diego and San Francisco in attracting large conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, for example, booked more than 300 large-scale conventions and 
meetings during the last six months of 1993. Los Angeles signed up 117 future 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are encouraged, but we still haven't totally turned the corner," said 
Cheryl L. Phelps, regional manager for Hyatt Hotels in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 49% increase in Los Angeles bookings reflects in part a dismal 1992, when 
the Los Angeles-area tourist industry suffered because of the city's riots. In 
addition, many groups were waiting to see the outcome of the $500-million 
expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the . . . riots and the economic malaise, people were very reluctant 
to make a commitment" and come to Los Angeles, visitors bureau spokesman Gary 
Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the center neared completion and concerns about visiting eased, more 
groups -- ranging from the National Assn. of Broadcasters and the American 
Postal Workers -- agreed to hold their conventions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown hoteliers have already reported improved bookings this year as a 
result of the expanded center's opening in November. The Hilton and Towers said 
room bookings are running 15% ahead of last year, while Hyatt Regency Los 
Angeles reports a 41% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I think the worst is over," said Michel Tourniaire, general 
manager of the Hotel Inter-Continental Los Angeles, which was nearly sold out 
for five days in November with members of the International Assn. of Amusement 
Parks and Attractions, the first major group to meet at the expanded Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, hotel owners are concerned that business may worsen in 1995, when only 
eight major groups -- compared to 19 this year -- are scheduled to meet at the 
Convention Center. Uncertainty about the center's expansion and fears triggered 
by the Los Angeles riots -- which occurred at a time when major groups were 
booking space for 1995 -- have held down reservations for next year, center 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 14 major conventions are booked at the center in 1996, and officials 
say the figure could climb to more than 20.

REPUBLIC AIR CASE SHOWS PRICE OF CHEAP FLIGHTS; TRAVEL: THE CHARTER COMPANY, 
WHICH STARTED SELLING TICKETS LAST SUMMER, IS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING VARIOUS 
FEDERAL RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Forgotston's experience illustrates the need for consumers to be careful 
about flying with charter airlines and other companies besides major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he bought a cheap ticket to fly from Dallas to Los Angeles through a 
company he saw advertised on a billboard, Forgotston thought he was using a 
regular airline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $220 round trip he booked through Republic Air Travel of Dallas in 
October showed him that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During a long night seeking his luggage at Los Angeles International Airport 
that stretched until 4:30 a.m., "we couldn't find anybody to tell us anything," 
said Forgotston, a Dallas computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody blamed everybody else," he said. "Nobody knew what anybody was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotston is one of many passengers who have complained about Republic Air, 
which began selling cheap tickets last summer. The Department of Transportation 
has filed an enforcement complaint against the travel agency accusing it of 
violating various public charter regulations, including diverting customer 
funds for illegal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic Air did not immediately return calls seeking comment last week, but 
it has denied the accusations in the past. The company has reportedly shut its 
doors but continued to take phone reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other allegations in the complaint: That Republic Air assumed the duties of a 
charter operator and that it took out ads in major newspapers that did not tell 
readers it is not a regularly scheduled airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are supposed to be told if they are flying a public charter. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference? A tour operator charters a jet and its crew and sells 
the seats. A regular airline owns or holds long-term leases for its jets, and 
the crews are on its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In Republic Air's case, the company said it was operating a reservations 
center for Miami-based Airlift Group Inc. -- also named in the complaint -- 
which was actually selling the charter trips. Express One International Inc. of 
Dallas was flying the jets, but it said last week that it would do so only 
until this Saturday, leaving Republic without a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Express One was also named in the complaint; it has settled with the 
government while admitting no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 While travel experts say the vast majority of charter operators do a good job, 
"there are some notorious cases over the last 15 years with planeloads of 
people being stranded in Europe," said Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports 
Travel Letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Several who follow the air travel industry suggest that consumers take steps 
to protect themselves when they're looking for bargains away from the major 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents are often familiar with a little-known company's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's too good to be true, call a travel agent," said Michael Boyd, 
president of Aviation Systems Research in Golden, Colo. "Let a travel agent 
handle it. Travel agents are paid to protect people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pay with a credit card, or make checks payable to the escrow account that 
charter operators have to set up, so your money hasn't been spent before the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, customer prepayments for charter trips must go into escrow 
accounts until after the trip is made. The Transportation Department has 
accused Republic Air of using funds that were supposed to go into escrow 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 One more option: Buy trip interruption insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said the insurance -- which protects against, among other things, 
airline and operator failure -- can be purchased from virtually any travel 
agent or directly from the insurance companies.

50 MILLION INVESTORS SENT SAVINGS BONDS SALES SKYWARD; INVESTMENT: ALTHOUGH A 
BIT OF A HASSLE COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVES, SERIES EE CAN STILL BE A BETTER DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cash is trash and CDs are yesterday's news, so U.S. Savings Bonds must be 
history, right?  
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Sales of Series EE bonds set a record for the fiscal year ended Sept. 
30, with more than 50 million Americans investing $17.3 billion in them. That's 
a 28% increase over 1992, when $13.5 billion worth were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sales rate dropped dramatically in the second half of the fiscal 
year, after the guaranteed yield dropped from 6% to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 While personal finance experts say the bonds have their place, they worry that 
the bonds are being used as a substitute for long-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of anything that will make people save. It's better than going 
out and buying a fancy lunch, but if you want to do something for your kids, 
you'd probably be better off to open up a growth and income mutual fund," said 
Paul Brown, a financial planner and co-author of the book "Grow Rich Slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bonds' advantages include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Safety. The bonds guarantee the principal and a 4% return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flexibility. They can be cashed in anytime after six months, so, unlike a 
CD, investors are not locked in for another six months. If you cash the bond 
after nine months and six days, for example, you get nine months' worth of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small face value. Bonds come in denominations as small as $50 (issue price 
$25), so they are easier to give as gifts or for beginning investors to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forced savings. The bonds can be deducted automatically from many companies' 
payrolls, so they may force some people to sock away money they might otherwise 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax exemption. The interest on bonds is free of state and local taxes and, 
if the money is spent on education, federal taxes. This can make them look more 
attractive than their 4% interest rate might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds are also a good place to park cash for six or 12 months. With a 
guaranteed 4% minimum, they compare favorably to the average 2.8% rate for 
six-month certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 But as New York-based financial planner Rob Harrigan points out, that works 
out to only a $60 return on $10,000 in bonds. Add to this the hassle of not 
being able to purchase the bonds through brokers and the difficulty in 
replacing lost coupons, and many investors may not feel the difference is 
worthwhile, Harrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 4%, I would go out and buy a Treasury, which yields 3.2%. There the 
difference over six months is only $40 and you have more flexibility," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Until March 1, the guaranteed interest rate on bonds held for at least five 
years was 6%. Now the minimum is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a difference between an EE bond's guaranteed rate and its current 
market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The market rate is adjusted every six months, to 85% of the rate on five-year 
Treasuries. It is currently 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the rate was cut, sales of the bonds averaged $2 billion a month. That 
slid to $800 million a month, however, as investors turned to higher-yielding 
investments.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; DRAMARAMA'S IN CRISIS MODE, BUT WHO CAN TELL?; COACH 
HOUSE PERFORMANCES, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN THE VETERAN BAND'S LAST SHOWS, ARE 
INTENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Saturday night's performances prove to be Dramarama's last (and, like just 
about everything concerning the band right now, that is far from certain), the 
fellas gave themselves a pretty fair send-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama played two 80-minute shows at the Coach House. If this is indeed the 
end for the veteran Southern California band, then the excellent early acoustic 
set made for a highly emotional wake. The late, late electric show, while not 
exceptional, could serve nevertheless as a proper Viking funeral, set to 
thundering drums and blazing guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little in the six members' bearing to suggest that Dramarama is in 
crisis, although it is. After a wobbly eight-year march through the music 
marketplace in which excellent output has not met with commensurate commercial 
success, the band recently saw its label, Chameleon, go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 If a new record deal materializes (and right now the band is moving ahead in 
search of one), Dramarama could continue. Unless, that is, John Easdale, the 
singer and main songwriter, decides it is time for a change -- something he has 
been mulling. Easdale faces an interesting and difficult quandary: Should he 
stick with old buddies (everyone in Dramarama except drummer Clem Burke grew up 
together in Wayne, N.J.) or, in this era in which packaging can matter more 
than substance, should he opt for a gleaming new box labeled with those 
market-friendly words, "new and improved?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama didn't raise those issues on stage. When a fan asked during the 
first set if the band was breaking up, Easdale said: "That's all rumor and 
innuendoes." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bad luck and frustration that have put Dramarama in crisis are at the 
core of Easdale's songwriting, especially on the band's most recent album, 
"Hi-Fi Sci-Fi." 
</P>
<P>
 In the acoustic set, Dramarama presented weariness, frustration and frazzle in 
varied hues. Rockers built on howling desperation were retooled to reflect 
quieter desperation, starting with the opening "Work for Food," which the band 
converted into a plaintive narrative delivered in Easdale's most vulnerable 
voice.  
</P>
<P>
 They don't call it Dramarama for nothing: Easdale is expert at writing richly 
detailed, evocative character studies of people who find themselves caught in a 
vise. The acoustic setting put the focus entirely on those characters and their 
dramas (this was a far more intimate acoustic performance than Dramarama 
presented in a rather brawny "unplugged" evening at the Coach House in 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 The surroundings may have been homey and relaxed as Easdale and bassist Chris 
Carter sat on a sofa, while guitarists Peter Wood and Mark (Mr. E) Englert 
occupied a rocking chair and a stool, but the performances were intense. 
"Prayer," an explosive rocker on "Hi-Fi," was taken at a slow, smoldering pace, 
possibly influenced by Bob Dylan and The Band's "Basement Tapes" version of 
"Wheel on Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 While the players were seated, the music stayed in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Train Going Backwards," you could hear the train whistle in Wood's klaxon 
acoustic licks, while Carter's bass picked up the rumbling of the wheels. With 
"Steve & Edie," the band broke into an impressive gallop. 
</P>
<P>
 The set built to its emotional peak with "Senseless Fun," in which Easdale 
used voice and body language to tap a deep vein of utter anguish in the role of 
a rocker sucked dry by his misfortunes in the music biz. This was indeed 
funeral music, a song in which a young man's dreams are laid to rest. Englert 
capped it with a chilly threnody on his E-Bow guitar synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, Dramarama offered its familiar show-closer, "Anything, Anything 
(I'll Give You)," but in a slow, folksy reading colored by a button accordion 
played by the band's soundman. Easdale roamed the club's aisles as the song 
ended, clasping hands and patting shoulders in a touching gesture of reaching 
out to Dramarama's fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The second show couldn't match that sustained peak of feeling, although it 
featured some pretty fair blasting by the band. Burke, who had been commendably 
restrained in the acoustic set as he moved between bongos and a full kit, gave 
free reign to his Keith Moon-ish, who-says-the-drummer-can't-play-lead 
instincts. The former Blondie basher certainly can drive a band; though 
dominant, he wasn't intrusive.  
</P>
<P>
 Just a few songs were repeated from the earlier show, including "Work for 
Food," the expansive, almost-joyful love song, "Incredible," a cover of the 
Beatles' "I'm So Tired," and the inevitable "Anything, Anything" (again 
featuring accordion, but this time with the whole band playing at full blast). 
</P>
<P>
 Easdale, who hasn't always been at ease as a front man, was a tad forced at 
times, especially on "Work for Food," in which he tried to act out virtually 
every verse with some kind of gesture. As in lyric writing, where one telling 
image is better than a profusion of ones that are beside the point, inhabiting 
a song doesn't take a lot of moves, just the right ones. In the case of "Work 
for Food," the lyrical images are so strong that Easdale need only sing the 
part of its broken-down musician convincingly.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of "Where's the Manual," one of the strongest electric numbers, he 
offered a nice sight gag but partly spoiled the joke when he hammered it in 
with a spoken tag line that was the equivalent of a "did-ya-get-it?" poke in 
the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 With his acute melodic sense, Easdale is as capable of writing a hit song as 
any smart-pop artist around (not a song in the two shows lacked a memorable 
hook). It's hard to conceive of the music industry not giving him more chances 
to swing for the fences, whether with Dramarama or with other players to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
 Factory opened both shows, and its late set indicated solid progress.  
</P>
<P>
 Singer Jeff Wright was far more comfortable on stage than he had been in a 
Coach House appearance just six months ago, when he showed little presence. 
Though some of his gestures were stilted, Wright is clearly making progress 
toward being an effective focal point for the band. He even got into some Peter 
Gabriel-like body contortions during one number.  
</P>
<P>
 Musicianship is a strength of his young Orange County band, although some of 
its progressive-rock excursions are too diffuse, and its borrowing from the 
Police still too persistent. All five members are strong talents; the question 
is whether they will find the spark of inspiration that gives talent a fruitful 
direction.

JAZZ REVIEWS; MCNEIL A CLEAR WINNER OVER AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the opportunities shrink to hear jazz as it was meant to be heard, 
performed with directness and intimacy in club settings, it is unfortunate that 
some club-goers don't respect that intimacy. That was the case Saturday at the 
Cafe Lido when Dee Dee McNeil, one of Southern California's busiest and skilled 
vocalists, had her first set sullied by a dull roar from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 More's the pity. McNeil, who thinks of her voice as an instrument, continues 
to improve as a musician, singing in a way that melds rhythmic savvy, a mix of 
clear, well-pitched tones and a playful scat approach into a holistic, 
satisfying presentation. In asides and song introductions, she looks to educate 
her audience while paying respect to her artistic forebears. But that effort 
makes for a dose of bitter irony when the audience shows such little respect 
for what she's doing on the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, there were only a few tables inside the Lido that made the 
listening difficult for those truly interested in hearing McNeil and her 
supporting cast work. This current disregard for live music seems to stem from 
a notion, held by some and influenced by popular culture, that jazz is 
background music, the stuff of soundtracks and advertising. And that thinking 
is clearly born of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 What the stupid and those sitting near them missed was a strong set of blues 
and standards from the singer and her band, which included assured saxophonist 
Charles Owens and drummer Mel Lee. The band strutted its stuff on a pair of 
opening numbers, including a rhythmically powerful rendition of Horace Silver's 
"Song for My Father." Owens, playing tenor, was particularly invigorating 
through these instrumental numbers, pedaling through a series of circular 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, who's been working on-and-off at the Lido for about three years with a 
variety of able sidemen, brought her usual enthusiasm and glow to the stage, 
while mostly seeming unperturbed at the racket coming from the floor. At one 
point during her slow introduction of "Bye Bye Blackbird," she improvised on 
the lyric, gently chiding the crowd to pay attention. Then she waited, in vain, 
for quiet. So with a shrug, she jumped into an up-tempo, be-bop inspired 
delivery with the band wailing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, who rearranges most of the familiar material to her own liking, 
provides object lessons when she sings. Billie Holiday's version of "Lover 
Man," she explained, was the first time a black American woman had sung with a 
string section. Her Alberta Hunter-inspired medley of "Workin' Man Blues," 
Miles Davis' "All Blues" and Joe Williams "Every Day I Have the Blues" moved 
easily between themes with one tune melting easily into another. Her upbeat 
delivery on "Stormy Monday" turned the lament into a fun-filled romp that was 
peppered with her alliterative scat. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who's particularly adept at the blues, saved his best work for the 
soprano saxophone. On "Lover Man," he wove long, complex statements that 
expanded the mood of the melancholy lyric. On "Quiet Nights," he applied flute 
embellishments, then improvised with a light touch and dancing figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Bobby Pierce was equally impressive, stringing together long lines and 
harmonic passages while adding color from an electric keyboard set atop the 
acoustic piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Lee was especially strong during exchanges with Owens, and bassist 
Tomas Gargamo, a model of pitch and timekeeping, added upper-register 
decoration that complemented both the singer and the saxophonist.

THEATER REVIEW; THRUST OF 'THREE MUSKETEERS' IS FUN FOR ALL, ALL FOR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disney's "all for one, one for all" blockbuster isn't the only new version of 
Alexandre Dumas' sword epic around. "The Three Musketeers" are kicking up their 
heels in Little Broadway Productions' rollicking musical comedy adaptation of 
the classic. It's a hoot for the elementary school set who get to cheer the 
heroes and hiss the villains, and it has comic touches enough to amuse parents, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring show, which played Orange Coast College over the weekend, wraps up 
a three-month swing of Southland schools and community theaters at Cal State 
Northridge on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the story about young D'Artagnan (Patrick Schuster); Musketeers 
Aramis (Vajdon Sohaili), Porthos (Eddie Crew) and Athos (Joel D. Martin); and 
royal intrigue in 17th-Century France is as sketchy and abridged here as in the 
movie, events manage to stay truer to the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite its modest budget, this unpretentious show -- produced by Jill 
Shawn Adereth, adapted by Val Dunlap for grades one through eight and smoothly 
paced by director Marilyn Weitz -- manages to be eye-pleasing and professional. 
The nonprofit Little Broadway Productions has been performing 
curriculum-related theater for Southland schools for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It features versatile, good-looking set pieces (designed by Wanda Warburton 
with Ernie Gilbert) for quick scene changes, appealing costumes (by Weitz) that 
suggest the time period and above all, an engaging cast of eight adult actors 
who can sing with verve and who attack their multiple roles with humor, skill 
and unflagging enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Much clashing swordplay, carefully choreographed by Eric Margerum, is notable 
for its vigor if not technique and provides the satisfying swashbuckling 
element for action-hungry young patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The music and lyrics by Mark Monarch are well-sung, pleasant and mostly 
forgettable, and a '20s-style song-and-dance duet between the Duke of 
Buckingham (Sohaili) and the Queen (Di Burbano) overstays its welcome, but one 
fast-paced routine -- "the etching that is fetching, 'round the tummy of the 
mummy" -- strongly reminiscent of a Danny Kaye bit in "Court Jester," is a 
wordplay delight. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest audience members' attention flags here and there, but the pace is 
quick enough, and the actors deft enough to catch them again.  
</P>
<P>
 Schuster gives D'Artagnan just the right touch of brashness and wide-eyed 
naivete and rounding out the accomplished cast are Cathy Gilbert as 
D'Artagnan's comically klutzy love interest, Donna Getzinger as Milady De 
Winter and Brian Hall as De Rochefort, plotting against the throne with Crew as 
Cardinal Richelieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Three Musketeers," Cal State Northridge, Campus Theatre, 18111 Nordhoff 
St., Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., $8; (818) 885-3093, (213) 
480-3232, (805) 583-8700. One hour, 15 minutes.

JAZZ REVIEWS; ELLIOT'S 'SINGING' ON SAXOPHONE TOUCHES THE SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next to the human voice, the tenor saxophone has been the instrument of choice 
for creating rhythm-and-blues statements that touch the soul. And few have used 
the instrument as slickly for that purpose as one-time Tower of Power horn man 
Richard Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 There were any number of times Friday at the Coach House that Elliot's playing 
invited comparisons with vocalists. He could be warm and intimate in the manner 
of Lou Rawls, light and airy like Smokey Robinson or sharp and pained like 
Percy Sledge. The more involved musical possibilities of his instrument were 
secondary. Elliot had come to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 So it figures that his best efforts came on familiar tunes whose lyrics came 
to mind as the curly-haired saxophonist crooned them on his horn. He brought 
few embellishments to "When a Man Loves a Woman," letting his throaty tones 
carry the song's emotion before expanding the ballad's volume and intensity 
with harder and more insistent lines. He was reserved and thoughtful during 
"I'm Not in Love," letting the melody speak simply while adding few innovations 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, unfortunately, Elliot's 100-minute set was a wash of repetitious 
backbeat and other undemanding settings. Maybe that's why the pop numbers, like 
a lone cottonwood on an endless prairie, stood out so boldly in his set: They 
were displayed against a rhythmic landscape that contained little variation. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a patriotically colored saxophone complete with a blue-painted bell 
spotted with stars, Elliot milked each rhythmic formula of its emotion with 
considered dynamic builds, pointed, high-end exclamations and tones designed to 
imitate the human voice. That he seldom overdid these pitches to his audience, 
a claim few of his colleagues in this genre can make, was overshadowed by 
occasional stage antics that were well-received, but added little to his 
musical delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing to the crowd, he rushed from one corner of the stage to another, 
sticking the mouth of his instrument into some lucky listener's ear. He was 
down on his knees during the most plaintive passages from "When a Man Loves a 
Woman," posing like a dumbstruck lover proposing marriage even though he's been 
spurned.  
</P>
<P>
 And, in what has become the most tiresome cliche since remote microphone 
systems have come into use, Elliot roamed the aisles and played from atop a 
dinner table, an act that, while memorable on its own -- he's light and quick, 
almost athletic, in his moves -- provided little audible satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The variations that did arrive came in the form of tropical rhythms and sound 
effects. The salsa-paced "Calle Del Sol," from his seventh and most recent 
recording for the Manhattan label, seemed to inspire his playing and he 
delivered fleet, somewhat complex lines that showed him capable of moving from 
the mundane into attractively detailed passages. "Deep Blue," a piece inspired 
by a swim with dolphins, opened with sea mammal cries and the airy sounds of 
blowholes being cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 But his most soulful treatment came during the most familiar tune, "Somewhere 
Over the Rainbow," which he played in tandem with keyboardist Ron Reinhardt. 
His interpretation was clean and to the point, while hugging the melody in a 
heartfelt embrace. It was one of the few times that Elliot gave the notion that 
what he felt was real, rather than contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 His supporting quartet -- Reinhardt, his brother and drummer Dave Reinhardt, 
bassist Naoki Yanai and excellent guitarist Richard Smith -- provided 
exceptionally tight backing and the occasional sharp, but short solo. Smith was 
the standout, often upstaging his boss in complexity and sonic enthusiasm when 
featured, rifling through crisp chords in accompaniment. There were a number of 
times that the foursome was called on to provide dramatic breaks and they 
delivered as if they were a single instrument. With more ambitious material, 
this is a group that could shine. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act, Naked To the World, 1993 winners of the National Academy of 
Songwriters' Acoustic Band of the Year award, applied ambitious lyrics of some 
poetic quality to a short set of mostly waltz rhythms constructed with guitars, 
violin, quiet percussion and mandolin.  
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Kevin Fisher's delivery was suitably warm and impassioned but the 
group's brightest light was violinist Daryl S, whose fine leads and bowed 
embellishments added emotional depth and beauty to these finely crafted songs.

POP; 'LOLLAPALOOZA' REDUX OUTSHINES ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember way back to last summer's "Lollapalooza '93"? For anyone nostalgic 
for those bygone days, the experience was re-created in remarkably detailed 
miniature at the Hollywood Palladium on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the key elements were in place: the parking nightmares . . . the long 
lines . . . the security hassles . . . the sweaty crush of the crowd. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yeah, the music.  
</P>
<P>
 Four of the seven bands on this benefit show -- Alice in Chains, Primus, 
Fishbone and Tool -- were on the "Lollapalooza" lineup, while a fifth (Porno 
for Pyros) is fronted by "Lollapalooza" co-founder Perry Farrell. What's more, 
Zack de la Rocha, the singer of the last tour's most dynamic act, Rage Against 
the Machine, made a guest appearance with Tool. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something Friday that was sorely missing from "Lollapalooza": a 
sense of musical community.  
</P>
<P>
 This show was put together to pay the legal fees of Fishbone bassist Norwood 
Fisher, who was recently acquitted of charges that he had attempted to kidnap 
former Fishbone guitarist Kendall Jones. (Fisher and several of Jones' family 
members believed that Jones had suffered a nervous breakdown last year and 
intended to take him in for psychological observation.) 
</P>
<P>
 A mega-jam session planned for Fishbone's show-closing set never took place, 
but several of the night's performances featured the loose, cross-pollinating 
interaction that has never really materialized in the more formalized 
"Lollapalooza" setting. In addition to De la Rocha, Alice in Chains singer 
Layne Staley also joined Tool, while several members of Fishbone stepped out 
with Primus. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's Alice in Chains was the most somber and serious of the bunch, with 
its acoustic set bringing the mood and pace down between the other bands' 
electric momentum. But the group used the platform of this special show 
effectively, bypassing its hits in favor of previewing its upcoming EP. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fedora-sporting, bongo-beating Staley leading the unplugged quartet, 
two new songs and two older numbers sounded intriguingly like Gregorian 
interpretations of "2,000 Light Years From Home." But that was all the band 
played, leaving the crowd booing the stinginess. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointment was perhaps magnified by Alice's following a set from Porno 
for Pyros that was all the crowd could have hoped for. Porno shows -- like 
those of Farrell's previous group, Jane's Addiction -- tend to be hit or miss, 
depending largely on the leader's demeanor. Farrell was positively ebullient, 
careening around the stage with unbridled enthusiasm, exaggerating his 
naturally gawky, geeky manner. More significantly, his three bandmates have 
coalesced into an impressive unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Fishbone's set, sad to say, was the least impressive, its once-amazing melding 
of Sly, skank and slam having turned to bottom-heavy sludge. The planned jam 
would have not only provided a fitting capper for the night, but perhaps helped 
liberate Fishbone's musical spirit.

COUNTERPUNCH: THE PUBLIC GETS SHUT OUT OF 'REINVENTED' PUBLIC TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MORI and JOAN SEKLER, Mark Mori is a filmmaker and founder of the 
Coalition vs. PBS Censorship. Joan Sekler is a producer for radio station KPFK 
and a free-lance publicist.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ideas put forward by officials of the Public Broadcasting Service for 
"reinventing public television" sound more like those of bureaucrats worried 
about protecting their cushy jobs than any notion of serving the public. Talk 
of "a high-tech distribution service able to send as many as 60 video channels 
through a new satellite" without any discussion of the content of those 60 
video channels is a typical bureaucratic-corporate solution to the crisis 
facing PBS ("Public TV Boards Face High-Tech Future," Calendar, Dec. 4). It 
completely misses the key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with PBS is that it has forsworn its mandate to "help us see 
America whole, in all its diversity," serve as "a forum for controversy and 
debate" and "provide a voice for groups in the community that may otherwise be 
unheard" (the Carnegie Commission Report, 1967). Instead PBS, just like the 
commercial networks, increasingly caters to its corporate sponsors, who 
determine what is seen or not seen. One example: A program on the "Nova" series 
argued for a less critical attitude toward corporations that may have caused 
chemical and other environmental hazards. It was funded by Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate dollars (from companies such as Mobil, Pepisco, GE, AT&T and 
MetLife) sponsor specific programs. But how pledges from viewers are used is 
totally at the discretion of the system. The net effect is that the public pays 
for the overhead while corporations pick and fund the programs they want on the 
air. The public is subsidizing corporate advertising and programming on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate takeover of public television has gone largely unreported in the 
mainstream (corporate) media, even though it's obvious from the commercials 
seen every hour on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 While PBS has no regular programming from a consumer rights or working 
people's perspective, each year it airs hundreds of hours about business and 
investing including "The Nightly Business Report," "Wall Street Week" and "Adam 
Smith's Money World." A 1989 City University of New York study found that nine 
times the amount of PBS programming focused on the upper classes than 
"addressed the lives and concerns of workers as workers." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its corporate programming policy, PBS refuses to broadcast 
important shows that are critical of corporate practices or corporate-backed 
government policies. A few examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Panama Deception," 1992 Academy Award, documentary feature. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Deadly Deception: General Electric Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment," 
1991 Academy Award, documentary short. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Building Bombs," 1990 Academy Award nominee, documentary feature. (PBS said 
it "does not give adequate voice to those who are proponents of nuclear arms." 
After three years of unnecessary delays, an edited version was finally 
broadcast last August, as a result of public pressure.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Money Lenders," about the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank. (Rejected by PBS as having "a perception of bias in favor of poor people 
who claim to be adversely affected.") 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dark Circle," about the nuclear industry. (Originally rejected by PBS for 
failing to meet its "journalistic standards." When it finally aired seven years 
later, it won the national Emmy Award for outstanding individual achievement in 
news and documentary.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Rights and Wrongs," hosted by Charlayne Hunter-Gault, reports on human 
rights around the world. (PBS stated that "human rights is not a sufficient 
organizing principle for a television series.") 
</P>
<P>
 * "One on One," which Howard Rosenberg said was "some of the most stimulating 
television . . . you're denied the opportunity to see" (Calendar, Dec. 8). The 
show was submitted to KCET a year ago and remains there "for consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS continues to deny that there is any problem with its refusal to broadcast 
Academy Award-winning documentaries. In several meetings during the last year 
between the Coalition vs. PBS Censorship and Jennifer Lawson, head of PBS 
programming, all suggestions for diverse and innovative programming to reflect 
public needs were flatly rejected. This included an immediate rebuff of a 
proposal for a yearly special showcasing short and feature- length 
Oscar-nominated documentaries to coincide with the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The new PBS president, Ervin S. Duggan, recently stated, "Public broadcasting 
is the natural platform upon which any new or future national information 
infrastructure should be built." But the corporate domination of the Public 
Broadcasting Service has caused it to repudiate the "public" and "service," so 
all that remains is "broadcasting." Thus, the public is being shut out of the 
upcoming information superhighway before it even comes into existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition vs. PBS Censorship is organizing the "Banned by PBS Film 
Festival" in Los Angeles this year to present a public forum for discussion of 
these issues and to show the public what they've been missing.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'MARTIN' A SITCOM, NOT STEREOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIDLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woody Allen supposedly said: "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. And 
those who can't teach become entertainment critics." In his Dec. 15 article, 
Howard Rosenberg proved he cannot even do the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 He begins the article ("A New Low on the Taste Meter," Calendar) by saying 
"it's always dicey" for a white man to comment on perceived stereotyping in a 
black television show, then immediately ignores his own advice and forges 
ahead. I guess as a liberal white he felt it was his civic responsibility to 
protect us "po' black folk" from ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of Rosenberg's righteous indignation was a recent episode on the Fox 
show "Martin," in which our two central characters, Martin and Gina, attempt to 
prove their true love for one another by going two weeks without having sex. 
Two African Americans who have been in a monogamous relationship for two years 
abstaining from sex to prove their love? My, but the racial stereotypes abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly the core of this episode is not a new idea for television. Years 
ago, in the Shelly Long era, Sam and Diane of "Cheers" tried to test their love 
in a similar fashion. However, instead of going for two weeks, it was a matter 
of minutes before they were writhing on a couch in the back room. It was cute, 
funny and perfectly acceptable for a "white" television program. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the problem. As a young black writer, I am both dismayed by and 
tired of the double standard that is leveled against "black" television. What 
is considered acceptable behavior for sitcom whites is thought of as being 
buffoonish and stereotypical for sitcom blacks. While "Seinfeld" gets showered 
with Emmy nominations for a show about a masturbation contest, we are vilified 
for even testing the waters of sexual attraction. Once again Rosenberg has 
proven an ugly and age-old truth: There are some places that blacks, even on 
television, are not allowed to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg climbs a tree to forbid blacks from dealing with sexuality in 
television. He brings in the Anita Hill case and notes that some African 
Americans accused her of perpetuating black sexual stereotypes for alleging 
that she had been sexually harassed by then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence 
Thomas. Rosenberg might just as well have blamed rape victims who report their 
attacks for perpetuating the stereotype of men thinking with their genitalia. 
Folding the Hill-Thomas case into the article was nothing less than 
irresponsible and a slight to women who have been sexually harassed or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the episode in question was adult in nature, but it was David 
Grant's failing, as overseer of Fox's standards and practices department, for 
not compensating by airing the episode at a later time or with a parental 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The greater failing, of course, is Rosenberg's, who insists on thinking of our 
characters as blacks rather than people (his use of the adjective primitive to 
describe that episode is indicative of his opinion of African Americans). As a 
rule sitcom characters, be they black, white (and hopefully one day Latino and 
Asian), are by nature outrageous. Are the incompetent Tim Allen of "Home 
Improvement" or the excitable and hyperbolic Kelsey Grammer of "Fraiser" an 
indictment of all whites? Hardly. Why is it then that any TV black who is not a 
Cosby kid is offensive? 
</P>
<P>
 If Rosenberg insists on categorizing, our show is populated by positive 
African American role models. All of our characters are employed, educated and 
live a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. On "Martin" there are no welfare 
recipients, no single mothers, no absent fathers. What we do have -- which no 
other prime-time TV show has -- are two young, single blacks involved in a 
loving, ongoing, one-on-one relationship. That may be an urban reality that 
Rosenberg's skewed liberal sensibility cannot accept, but if it is a negative 
stereotype then it's one I wish every young black person could see more of on 
television and in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 15 article really comes as no surprise. Rosenberg has been 
anti-"Martin" from its inception, when he included our show in his list of the 
10 worst new programs for the '92-'93 television season. Two years and "Martin" 
is not only a hit but the recipient of both an NAACP Image Award and a People's 
Choice Award for best new sitcom. You were wrong then, Howard. You're still 
wrong.

COUNTERPUNCH: A FOLLOW-UP ON JOSE SANTANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an Aug. 30 Counterpunch article, veteran film, TV and stage actor Jose 
Angel Santana said he had chosen to drive a taxi in Santa Barbara rather than 
accept the "violent and negative stereotypes" he too often was asked to play as 
a black actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses to Santana's article led to several offers of auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at 8 p.m., he will return to acting with a guest appearance on 
"Beverly Hills, 90210" on Channel 11. He will portray a police officer.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; BECK KEEPS HIS 'GENIUS' UNDER WRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the triple-header on Saturday at Jabberjaw was any indication, the 
punk-rock state of the art is . . . goofiness uber alles . Not a lot of 
substance in major-label finds Beck and That Dog or the still-indie Lois, but a 
kind of cheerful, informed innocence isn't the worst thing that could infect 
the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, an L.A.-based 23-year-old, was the object of last year's most famous 
bidding war. In his opening set at Jabberjaw, it was hard to see why -- which 
was more refreshing than distressing, since Beck hasn't let his status as 
Geffen signee get in the way of many very casual gigs or even further 
independent vinyl releases while the big March album looms and KROQ plays the 
living daylights out of "Loser." 
</P>
<P>
 The coffeehouse was packed to the gills for Beck, who reciprocated with 
silliness like donning an Imperial Stormtrooper helmet while dancing along to 
the recorded tracks of "Loser." He alternated between noodling folk guitar 
songs and singing along to hip-hop tracks seasoned with distorted voices. A 
good part of his oeuvre sounds based, if anything, in the infectious absurdism 
of "Come Together." 
</P>
<P>
 That Dog is another unlikely new Geffen act -- minimalist and curiously 
modulated, leaving cause to be curious whether they're harmonically ambitious 
or naive. Since Anna Waronker only recently picked up the guitar, you might 
assume the latter; since Rachel and Petra Haden are jazzman Charlie's kids, you 
might more reasonably figure the former. The tunes are slight, but weird 
harmonies, Rachel's punky bass lines and Petra's solemn violin sidetracks added 
up to a developing bite that might be as good as its self-consciously quirky 
bark. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop-punk headliner Lois really was a jabberjaw between songs -- endearingly so 
-- and, if way too congenial to be a riot grrrl, a riot nonetheless, though the 
weak mix emphasized band over vocals. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; NIK TURNER LEADS URGENT HAWKWIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all its self-importance, little music from the much-maligned genre of 
progressive rock has actually progressed . The crowd of '70s ego-rockers 
epitomized by Yes and Genesis has mostly degenerated into sad self-parody.Who 
expected any different from Hawkwind? 
</P>
<P>
 But there was singer-saxman-flutist Nik Turner, leading his version of 
Hawkwind on Friday at Club Lingerie in a performance that was both sci-fi 
ridiculous and astonishingly urgent. Gone was the aimless excess of Hawkwind's 
early albums. A modern punk element has instead been added to the band's jazzy, 
prog-rock mode, reflecting the old Hawkwind's influence on such newer 
art-damaged acts as Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 That focus and energy owed much to Turner's band of mostly young, 
industrial-rock players, including guitarist Helios Creed and members of 
Pressurehed. Only Turner and keyboardist Del Dettmar were original members. 
(Turner and co-founder Dave Brock are fighting a UK court battle over the use 
of the Hawkwind name.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Turner and his new group were without their own spacey, apocalyptic 
visions and long instrumental wind-outs. Two hours into the band's midnight 
set, Lingerie pulled the plug, citing the late hour. Turner was left silent and 
disoriented in his "Mad Max" outfit, though the crowd seemed relieved for the 
break from a long and wearying onslaught. STEVE APPLEFORD

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; CONCORD ALL-STARS JOIN FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing unpredictable happened Saturday when the Concord Jazz All-Stars 
appeared at the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. Nothing eventful, either; on 
the other hand, nothing unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was an apparently unrehearsed session by seven musicians, most of whom 
have recorded for the Concord label. Before the program began you knew that the 
tunes would be mostly old standards, that the solos would lead to eight-bar and 
four-bar trades, that each half of the show would end with a drum solo by Frank 
Capp, and that Jack Sheldon would tell his Marcel Marceau joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon's comedy is not up to the level of his singing, which in turn is not 
the equal of his trumpet playing. If he had cut out the humor he could have 
played two or three choruses of "The Shadow of Your Smile" instead of the 
single, very lyrical chorus he did offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hamilton's tenor sax, long a symbol of neo-classicism, seldom caught 
fire. Gary Foster's alto sax and flute were even less geared to impassioned 
statements, and Dave Stone's bass came across with insufficient impact. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the evening's honors to Howard Alden, whose every guitar solo 
bespoke imagination coupled with originality, and to Jerry Wiggins, a pianist 
who has never been known to let any band down. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's title seemed like a partial misnomer, since only Hamilton and 
Alden have been recording regularly for Concord. Essentially, this was an 
ad-hoc unit in a casual nightclub mode, not ideally suited to a concert 
recital. LEONARD FEATHER

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; LUNDY GIVES UNEVEN BUT ENGAGING SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmen Lundy, heard Friday at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, is a multitalented 
artist: singer, composer, lyricist, painter. Vocally, she might best be 
characterized as a jazz contralto, with an unconventional, extrovert 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 A torrid warm-up on the standard "Star Eyes" revealed an empathetic 
interaction with her trio, led by pianist Billy Childs. With the ubiquitous 
Ralph Penland on drums and Reggie Hamilton on bass, she enjoyed buoyant support 
throughout a long and engaging set. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy's talent for songwriting was best illustrated in "Never Gonna Let You 
Go" and "You're Not in Love," both equally strong in their intelligently 
designed words and well-crafted melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Your Lover Has Gone," a half-forgotten ballad from 1931, began 
appealingly but lost power during a mood-breaking scat chorus. "The End of a 
Love Affair" included the line: "My voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd," 
which had autobiographical overtones, though Lundy's fortissimo outbursts were 
well received and sometimes appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Childs' role was more than that of an accompanist. Always sensitive in 
his collaborations with singers, he brought a special, personal element to such 
well-worn material as "Round Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 The final verdict on Carmen Lundy is not yet in. A career that has taken her 
through gospel, R&B, jazz and other phases now seems to be bringing together 
several elements from these earlier stages. She may be inconsistent but she 
never becomes a bore. LEONARD FEATHER

MUSIC REVIEWS; PASADENA SYMPHONY MEETS CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it a masterpiece sandwich: Two great works wrapped in two virtuoso 
displays -- four layers, the substance and protein within, the sugar and glitz 
without. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Jorge Mester's first Pasadena Symphony program of 1994, at its center, 
Max Bruch's often underrated G-minor Violin Concerto and Schubert's 
"Unfinished" Symphony; outside, John Adams' noisy, brief and daunting "Slow 
Ride in a Fast Machine" and Respighi's fireworks-laden, gloriously tawdry 
"Feste Romane." 
</P>
<P>
 A jolly package? Certainly. The surprise, Saturday night in Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium, was the high polish on all four works. With a long tradition of 
notoriously short rehearsal time, the orchestra played this challenging agenda 
not only with complete confidence but also without executional mishaps. Each 
work seemed to emerge in its best aural light -- at least as heard from an 
acoustically helpful location in the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Most unexpected, because it often gets short shrift on pops programs (and 
usually outdoors), Bruch's First Violin Concerto sounded on this occasion like 
the wondrous work it is. 
</P>
<P>
 That had to be due in large part to the impassioned performance, immaculate 
technique and deeply projected musicality of the soloist, French violinist 
Olivier Charlier, who brought a sense of newness to the familiar piece and had 
reconsidered every aspect of its structure and detailing. But it also reflected 
credit on Mester's -- and the orchestra's -- committed and attentive 
collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with a perfect overture, Adams' irrepressible "Slow Ride," 
its challenges nonetheless exigent for its four-minute length. It closed with 
"Feste Romane," in as showy and satisfying a symphonic romp as this auditorium 
may have heard in years: fearless, brazen and multifaceted. 
</P>
<P>
 These qualities could be all the more appreciated after Mester's restrained 
but emotional, pristine and sculpted reading of Schubert's exposing B-minor 
Symphony. Contrast works.

 Widely lavished with the imprimatur "dean of American composers," Elliott 
Carter wears his eminence softly, like a crown visible only to those who 
appreciate the composer's uncompromising, fashion-resistant brand of genius. 
Few composers have Carter's gift for devising knotty, complex, post-tonal music 
that flows so conversationally. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was brought home Saturday at the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. 
Celebrating the composer's 85th birthday (last month), the Southwest Chamber 
Society kicked off a January series of concerts around Los Angeles dedicated to 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 In this cleverly framed program, the first half belonged to a pleasantry from 
Carter's attic -- hisCoplandesque "Pastoral" from 1940 -- and Mozart's Quintet 
for Piano and Winds in E-flat, K. 452, sounding a bit labored and rough around 
the edges here. This was but a warm-up procedure for a pair of West Coast 
premieres of new music from this vital creator and thinker. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert's second half, while brief, made up for the foibles of the first. 
Clarinetist Michael Grego nimbly maneuvered the supple, monologue-like contours 
of "Gra" for solo clarinet, dedicated to another prominent octogenarian 
composer, Witold Lutoslawski. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the program to its natural climax was Carter's 1991 Quintet for piano 
and winds, inspired by Mozart's model, but with a language all its own. 
Impulsive, interactive gestures and statements, jazzy glissandos, whiffs of 
whimsy and articulate bursts of anxiety, were passed around democratically to 
three entities -- pianist Vicki Ray, hornist Jeff von der Schmidt and the wind 
unit of oboist Stuart Horn, Grego and bassoonist Leslie Lashinsky, all of whom 
performed vibrantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by a flexible rhythmic thread, now jagged, now showing a steady pulse, 
the piece rode on waves of self-generated energy and interest rather than 
relying on any discernible formal structure. After a final dissonant crescendo, 
a smattering of notes serves as a wry afterthought to an exciting work, one 
both visceral and enigmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bows, the beaming composer joined the ranks onstage. JOSEF WOODARD

VANDERKOLK SEEKS TO BE PUT BACK ON BUDGET PANEL; POLITICS: THE SUPERVISOR HAS 
REQUESTED TO BE RETURNED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT DESIGNS THE COUNTY'S FISCAL 
POLICY, A POSITION SHE WAS OUSTED FROM LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 With a year left on her term, Ventura County Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk is 
seeking reappointment to the county's powerful budget committee -- a position 
she was ousted from last year after a bitter dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who announced several weeks ago that she would not seek 
reelection, said she is determined to help craft the county's fiscal policy 
during the remainder of her tenure. She has asked board Chairwoman Vicky 
Howard, who makes appointments to county committees, to put her back on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she will decide by Tuesday's board meeting whether to grant 
VanderKolk's request. The board is expected to approve Howard's recommendations 
at its meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we have to talk over," said Howard, who plans to meet with 
VanderKolk before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who now serves on the 12-member budget panel, said she might consider 
stepping down to make room for VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly on the table," Howard said. "I'm trying to do everything as 
chairman of the board to make everyone as congenial and as cooperative as 
possible. I don't want anyone to feel that they were slighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she was removed from the committee last year, VanderKolk said, she has 
been eager to get involved again in budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disappointed when I was taken off before," said VanderKolk, who 
served on the panel for a year. "It is something I worked very hard on and 
educated myself on. I would like to be able to use that in my last year. I hope 
it comes to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee -- which includes two supervisors and 10 other ranking county 
officials -- meets once a month to formulate fiscal plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the county's policy-setting panels, the budget committee is considered the 
most influential. Previously, the group has come up with such plans as the 
county's four-day workweek and early retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors comes up with a list of 
new board appointees to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, then-Chairwoman Susan K. Lacey recommended that VanderKolk be 
removed from the committee and Supervisor Maggie Kildee be put in her place. 
Lacey also proposed that Howard, who had served on the panel for two years, be 
retained for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite VanderKolk's pleas to remain on the panel, the board voted 3 to 2 to 
go along with Lacey's recommendations. Supervisor John K. Flynn was the only 
board member to join VanderKolk in voting against the motion to oust her from 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said she simply wanted to get "fresh ideas" by bringing Kildee on board. 
She added that she wanted to leave Howard on the committee because she had more 
experience in county budget matters than VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn and VanderKolk aide Doug Johnson speculated that VanderKolk had 
"stepped on too many toes" during her stint on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she was simply too independent for some, and that was the reason," 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he believed that VanderKolk may have irked some of the county's 
officials by successfully pushing to put Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury on the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Bradbury has come under criticism by officials for spending 
beyond his budget. He has also angered some supervisors by making fervent, 
highly publicized pleas for more money for his department. However, VanderKolk 
has said she thought that Bradbury's input in development of the county's 
budget was essential. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Bradbury, the committee includes Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard Wittenberg, Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, county budget director 
Albert Bigler, Health Care Agency director Phillipp K. Wessels, Corrections 
Services Agency Director Frank C. Woodson and other ranking administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see Maria back on it," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he dislikes the idea of having a committee thrash out budget 
matters, arguing that the entire board should make fiscal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as long as we have it, we should have someone who is independent."

MERCHANTS ARE IGNORING STRICT ANTI-GRAFFITI ORDINANCE; MOORPARK: CITY HAS NOT 
BEGUN ENFORCING LAW THAT SAYS PAINTS, ETCHING MATERIALS AND MARKING PENS MUST 
BE KEPT OUT OF THE PUBLIC'S REACH. "THIS WAS OVERKILL," ONE OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Moorpark City Council decided late last year to pass a tough new 
anti-graffiti law, Councilman Scott Montgomery warned his colleagues that they 
were getting far too tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said that this ordinance may very well put a store out of business in the 
city of Moorpark," Montgomery recalled. "Just because we want to make a 
political statement, we're going to put them out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other restrictions, the local law required stores to keep paints, 
etching materials and nearly all indelible marking pens out of the reach of the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery and Chamber of Commerce President Francis Okyere cautioned against 
forcing merchants to lock away a wide array of felt-tipped markers. But other 
council members disagreed and declared that all pens with tips 1/8-inch or 
greater -- even fluorescent highlighters -- must be removed from store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was overkill," Okyere said. "We don't see liquor under lock and key, and 
it's a lot more lethal than a pen." 
</P>
<P>
 It is still too early to gauge the ordinance's impact on Moorpark merchants. 
More than a month after the ordinance went into effect, many businesses that 
sell indelible marking pens are operating in violation of the law. And, at 
least one has openly vowed not to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got over $12,000 in markers; it would be very difficult to lock that 
away and we haven't locked it away," said Susan Weatherstone, co-owner of 
Moorpark Stationers. "If the Sheriff's Department comes in and tells us to lock 
the markers down, we'll show them our inventory and ask, 'How do you expect us 
to lock this all away?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the showdown over loose marking pens has not happened yet because the city 
has not begun to enforce restrictions that even supporters of the law now 
concede may have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has only sent letters to Moorpark businesses reminding them 
that the graffiti ordinance went into effect Dec. 3 and asking them to comply. 
The letter went out Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a political statement; it's an attempt to solve a problem," Mayor 
Paul Lawrason said. "We knew this wasn't perfect when we put it into place and 
we need to work with the merchants. . . . We're not out there to shove this 
thing down anybody's throat." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what they did, shove this down everybody's throat," said 
Montgomery, the only council member to oppose the ordinance. "The reality is 
that we could have written this thing reasonably to begin with, but there was 
no desire to be reasonable. Now, out of embarrassment, it seems that they have 
to be reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said this week that the city has intentionally not enforced the law 
to give businesses time to adapt to the new requirements. He added that the 
ordinance could be changed if it is found to be burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not proactive, you're never going to contribute to solving the 
problem," Lawrason said. "So we're moving ahead, we're proactive and if we have 
a situation now that has created some sideline problems, then we need to work 
(on) it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery characterized Lawrason's flexibility -- and the city's 
unwillingness to enforce its own law -- as an admission that new policies are 
unworkable. "Maybe the whole ordinance was for show," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now four weeks after the ordinance is effective and we directed staff 
to write a letter. That's not the way we usually enforce ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the law requires that marking pens, spray-paint cans and other 
potential tools for graffiti implements be kept away from the public and only 
sold with the assistance of a store employee. Customers 18 years of age and 
under are not allowed to purchase markers, spray paints or etching tools except 
when accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants around the city say they do not object to the age restrictions and 
have told employees to check the identification of customers who look to be 
under 18 and are shopping alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But observing the new rules on where markers can be stored is a more 
complicated and costly matter, business owners say. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does City Hall want, business here or no business here?" asked Iain 
Weatherstone, co-owner of Moorpark Stationers. "I think people in City Hall 
should think about these things. They're not in business for themselves, and 
it's easy to say these things, but it's not so easy to implement them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bosch, manager of the newly openmart store on Los Angeles Avenue, has 
responded to the new law by locking all dark, wide-tipped markers in a glass 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosch said he has only recently understood the wide scope of the law, and 
many other brands of markers that are technically included under the ordinance 
are still available on his store's shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to lock up all the highlighters, you're going to basically 
have to lock up your entire stationery department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosch said he is willing to do that, and will comply with the law if the city 
informs him that he is in violation. But he said he worries that further 
isolating his stock will reduce sales in an already recessionary environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we lock something up, we can cut our sales by half; that's just 
the way it is," Bosch said. "If somebody comes in and they say, 'I think I need 
to buy a felt-tip marker,' and they don't see somebody around with a key to 
unlock the case and give it to them, they'll say, 'Oh, I really don't need that 
now. I'll get it later.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other stores with a more limited supply of markers have been able to comply 
with the law more easily by putting the markers they sell behind the counter 
and making them available only when a customer asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty Drug Store on Los Angeles Avenue has taken this approach, as has 
Discount Medicine Man pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really never had a problem with kids coming in; we sell mainly to adults," 
said Ellen Ford, a pharmacy tech at Discount Medicine Man, which has stashed 
all of its markers in a box inaccessible to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery and Okyere said they are particularly concerned about 
stationery stores and other businesses that, under the law, are required to put 
away a wide array of pens and markers. 
</P>
<P>
 Okyere in October wrote a letter to the council suggesting that merchants 
merely check the ages of customers who want to buy markers rather than stash 
away their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 The response at the time, he said, was that even having the items on the 
shelves would add to the city's graffiti problem because vandals would simply 
steal them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every product in a merchant's store is important to them and if anything is 
going to be shoplifted, they're going to be very aware of that," Okyere said. 
"The other argument I heard was that very few stores here will be impacted by 
this (ordinance). But my reaction was that you are putting on the books a law 
that is going to haunt businesses in Moorpark for years to come."

AIR BATTLE; SOME RESIDENTS ANGERED BY PROPOSED COMMERCIAL USE OF NAVAL BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1974, Bill Torrence decided that he had lived long enough in the urban 
environment of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful cement manufacturer, Torrence and his wife, Dorothy, moved from 
their comfortable Northridge home to Camarillo -- then a rural, thinly 
populated community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left because it was getting to be too much," Torrence said. "We didn't 
feel safe there and, in general, we weren't happy there any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Safely settled in their custom-made, double-wide mobile home at Camarillo 
Springs, the couple flourished in their new town -- Dorothy golfing regularly 
and Bill tending his beloved garden. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this year, the Torrences were shocked to learn that Los 
Angeles-style urbanization might be creeping over the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal in March by the U. S. Navy to share its 11,000-foot-long runway at 
the Point Mugu Naval Air Station with commercial passenger and cargo carriers 
sent shivers up Bill Torrence's spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard about the proposal, I said, 'Here goes LAX again,' " said 
Torrence, president of the 250-member Ventura County League of Homeowners. 
"I've seen a lot of change come to the county, but I honestly feel this would 
be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials made the offer because a steady decline in military flights 
left the airfield with a lot of available flight time. Military flights fell 
from more than 70,000 annually in 1989 and 1990 to fewer than 59,000 in 1992, 
after the departure of a handful of tenant squadrons and an overall reduction 
in missile testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling flight time would help the Navy defray the costs of running the base, 
but opponents fear that it could lead to development of a full-scale regional 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Camarillo lies under the base's primary flight paths, Torrence and a 
majority of City Council members believe that they will suffer increased noise 
and air pollution and incur higher safety risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Camarillo has the least to gain and the most to lose if this goes 
through," said Charlotte Craven, a member of the City Council who serves on the 
countywide committee now investigating the Navy proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those cities and those people who are pushing this obviously don't live in 
Camarillo," she said. "They don't have the concerns we do because the planes 
don't fly over their cities. It's easy to support something when you stand to 
gain all the benefits but none of the negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose and Councilmen Stan Daily, David Smith and Michael 
Morgan said they share Craven's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't care to see us become another heavily populated area," Gose said. 
"The more facilities such as this that we have, the more people will want to 
move here. The bottom line is that I don't want to see us reduce the quality of 
life that we have here. I fear that an airport such as this would do exactly 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the city from the development of a regional airport is one of 
the subjects of a $150,000 Federal Aviation Administration-funded study being 
conducted by the Southern California Assn. of Governments. The study, which is 
expected to consider the proposal's commercial viability, financing 
opportunities, compatibility with the base's military mission, and noise and 
pollution impacts, is due to be released in March, according to Tim Merwin, 
SCAG program manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this proposal doesn't make it through this first study, then it's dead," 
Merwin said. "We're really not pushing anything here. If it doesn't pencil, 
then it doesn't pencil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Fausset, a Ventura real estate developer and a director of the 
Ventura County Economic Development Assn., has a distinctly more optimistic 
view of the proposed Point Mugu project. He says opponents in Camarillo are 
short-sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize that they have some legitimate concerns," he said. "But there may 
come a time when we are mandated to provide for our own county's transportation 
needs. We may not always be able to depend upon Burbank, LAX or Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 Fausset said the commercial flights would probably not exceed the peak numbers 
of military flights of a few years ago. And unlike LAX, where expansion led to 
the destruction of whole neighborhoods, the development of a regional airport 
at Point Mugu would not ruin the areas surrounding the base -- currently 
farmland and open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regional airports haven't ruined Santa Barbara or Monterey," Fausset said. 
"The LAX example really doesn't hold up when you think about it because we have 
the chance to master-plan this thing from the start -- the ground floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fausset is part of a 70-member Navy-civilian committee formed last year to 
explore the possibilities of developing the Point Mugu facility for combined 
military and commercial use. Like Torrence and Fausset, members of the 
committee are eagerly awaiting the SCAG report to determine the proposal's 
feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Also supporting the proposal is Marshall MacKinen, who recently resigned as 
county airports administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who speak against this are not fully aware of what the real 
impacts will be," he said. "We are not going to crowd the skies. Navy takeoffs 
and landings are down 20(%) or 30% -- it would be more a matter of filling that 
void." 
</P>
<P>
 As demand for passenger service out of the county rises and cargo shipments 
increase at the Port of Hueneme, a regional airport will become a necessity 
soon, MacKinen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, I see it as an intermodal facility -- a place where sea, air, land 
and rail cargo could be processed," he said. "I've even talked to some farmers 
who said they would change the kind of crops they grow if they had a chance to 
move their produce quickly out of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent estimate by SCAG said Los Angeles-area airports are near capacity 
with 60 million passengers annually. That number was projected to increase to 
as many as 93 million passengers a year by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, another study found that 1.6 million passengers from Ventura County 
used Burbank, LAX or Santa Barbara airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, major airline operators have shown little interest in bringing 
jetliners to Ventura County. Many representatives pointed to the sagging 
economy and the airfield's physical proximity to the Los Angeles area as 
reasons for their lack of interest in the Point Mugu proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials have stayed out of the verbal sparring. Navy spokesman Alan 
Alpers said base officials stand willing to help civilian officials work out 
the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that we would like to see this happen," Alpers said. "But we 
realize there are a lot of details to be worked out. We don't want to get 
involved in the name-calling. If we have a statement, it would be that everyone 
should try to stay calm and wait for the (SCAG) report to come back so we all 
can see what we're facing with this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrence said he and the homeowner organization's board of directors are 
prepared to do battle to stop the Point Mugu proposal, preserving, they say, 
the reason they moved to Camarillo in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these people think it's a done deal, they're wrong," Torrence said. "I've 
never seen a politician yet who won't listen to a group that can deliver votes. 
We're ready to take this thing on." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 A report is due in March on whether the proposal to add civilian flights at 
the Navy's Point Mugu airfield is economically feasible. If that study finds 
merit in the proposal, a second study by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments will examine impacts on the county's economy, tourism and land 
planning. It would be completed by the end of the year.

OXNARD POLICE, FIRE MERGER PLAN IS SCALED BACK; GOVERNMENT: CITY OFFICIALS WILL 
RECOMMEND CONSOLIDATING SOME ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES. BUT THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
ELEMENT, INVOLVING CROSS-TRAINING, IS DROPPED. 
</P>

<P>
 Bombarded by protests over a proposal to merge police and fire services, 
Oxnard officials now say they will not pursue the most controversial element of 
a plan that would have had police officers fighting fires and firefighters 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Harold Hurtt is recommending that the City Council consolidate 
the administrative duties of the police and fire departments. In addition, he 
recommends that firefighters be trained to take police reports and that code 
enforcement and safety inspection responsibilities be merged. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited consolidation is expected to save the city nearly $185,000 a year. 
Council members are scheduled to consider the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that from the reaction from the community and the employees 
association that full cross-training can't be achieved for now," Hurtt said. 
"But I think there are some different levels where we can still combine 
services and still be able to benefit the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to drop the cross-training component of the merger proposal is 
largely the result of an aggressive campaign aimed at killing the idea 
altogether, Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late November, firefighters have gone door-to-door and logged thousands 
of telephone calls aimed at whipping up opposition to the consolidation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 By last week, they had persuaded nearly 2,000 residents to phone City Hall and 
send cards and letters in opposition to the proposal. Only four phone calls, 
and no letters, were received in support of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and their supporters oppose the merger of the two departments 
even at an administrative level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached thousands of people and we have not found one person yet 
that's in favor of it," said Bill Gallaher, president of the firefighters 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 As initially proposed, cross-trained public safety officers would respond to 
all police calls, fires and medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fire stations would have been staffed with a single, cross-trained 
officer who would drive equipment to a fire or emergency scene and be met by 
other officers in patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal sprang from a City Council decision in June to consolidate police 
and fire services into a single public safety department. That move was part of 
an overall city reorganization aimed at saving $584,000 a year by eliminating 
city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt visited Kalamazoo, Mich., and Sunnyvale, Calif., to study how those 
cities have successfully merged police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 He told 13 police recruits, due to join the Oxnard Police Department later 
this year, that they could possibly be required to train as firefighters when 
they concluded 22 weeks of training at the police academy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he drew up a chart that showed about 50 firefighters and nearly 80 police 
officers cross-trained by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dynamic process and it changes day to day," Hurtt said. "The bottom 
line is we are not going to do anything to jeopardize the lives of our 
residents or our employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposal argue that the merger could save the city up to 
$250,000 a year, put more officers on the street and improve the efficiency of 
police and fire operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents counter that the merger would probably not save money and that 
it would end up jeopardizing public safety by throwing ill-prepared officers 
into situations for which they were not properly trained. 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home the point, members of the Oxnard City Fire Fighters Assn. have 
participated in a campaign to generate support for their position. 
</P>
<P>
 They hired a San Diego firm to telephone residents and urge them to write or 
phone city leaders. They produced an information packet, two inches thick, and 
handed it out to council members. They produced and mailed out slick brochures 
urging residents to oppose the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in this world more important to me than the personal safety 
of the people I love -- my wife, my daughter and others," read a letter bearing 
Gallaher's signature. "We must let the City Council members know that the 
people of Oxnard believe their safety is not something to gamble with. That's 
where we need your help." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallaher and others say they oppose the merger at any level, noting a failed 
attempt in 1986 to consolidate the administrative duties of the two departments 
into a single Public Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 That department was disbanded two years later, following complaints from 
police officers and firefighters that service levels were being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried that before," said Mayor Manuel Lopez, the only councilman on record 
opposing the merger. "It didn't work then, and I don't know why it would work 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 While saying they would never do anything to jeopardize police and fire 
services, other council members say they want an opportunity to learn more 
about the merger proposal before making a decision. But regardless, some say 
they are not inclined to embark on a full cross-training program of existing 
police officers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking to make police officers out of firefighters or 
firefighters out of police officers," Councilman Andres Herrera said. "We have 
no intention whatsoever of reducing the level of either fire or police 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Councilman Tom Holden: "We have not given direction to staff to do 
anything but bring us alternatives to providing public safety. We haven't been 
given any plan or procedure that should warrant any concern at this point."

SIMI MULLS 1ST GAS STATION IN OVER A DECADE; COUNCIL: OPPONENTS SAY THE 
PROPOSAL, INCLUDING A MINI-MART AND CARWASH, WOULD LEAD TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION 
AND CRIME. SUPPORTERS CONTEND THAT SUCH CONCERNS ARE UNFOUNDED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to end a long-running debate, the Simi Valley City Council tonight 
will hold a public hearing to decide whether to approve the city's first new 
gas station in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members have said they support the proposed 24-hour Shell 
station, market and carwash, which would be built next to a McDonald's 
fast-food restaurant on Yosemite Avenue near the Simi Valley Freeway. Two 
council members have said they oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of the city's Indian Hills neighborhood have worked to block 
construction of the gas station, saying that crime and traffic have increased 
since the McDonald's opened and that the gas station would make the problems 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Shell spokesman said residents' concerns about the station are 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time and time again, we've tinkered with the project to try to make it 
better," Shell spokesman Larry S. Turner said. "We can't make everyone happy, 
but we sure have tried." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the city's Planning Commission scuttled Shell's initial proposal, 
and the company appealed to the City Council, which deadlocked 2 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Judy Mikels and Sandi Webb voted in favor of the project, and 
Mayor Greg Stratton and then-Councilman Michael W. Piper opposed it. Councilman 
Bill Davis abstained, saying he was concerned about a possible conflict of 
interest because he owned property nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Shell returned to the commission with revised plans, adding a 
sound wall and landscaping, and agreeing to help pay for a new traffic signal, 
but retaining the basic components of the plan: gas pumps, a carwash and 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 After lengthy debate and a public hearing, the commission reversed its 
position and approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton and Councilwoman Barbara Williamson, who was elected to Piper's seat, 
appealed the decision, prompting tonight's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not in favor of the McDonald's, so I'm not real excited by anything 
going in there," Stratton said. "But if the project as going to go in, my real 
objective is to get the traffic concerns taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project, led by the neighborhood group Citizens for a Safe 
and Scenic Simi Valley, said they feared that the gas station would increase 
traffic and attract large trucks at all hours, causing noise and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said the station does not plan to carry diesel fuel, so truck traffic 
should not increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said concerns on congestion and safety are unfounded. "It seems to me 
like they've met all of the city's requirements," she said. "I think it's a 
fine project." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who lives in the Indian Hills neighborhood, said he has determined that 
there is no conflict of interest and plans to vote for the project. Mikels said 
she also favors the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents questioned whether it complies with city codes that require gas 
stations to be constructed as part of a larger development, such as a shopping 
center, travel complex or auto-service center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of questions," said Eileen Gordon, founder of Citizens 
for a Safe and Scenic Simi Valley. "It's kind of hard to believe that putting a 
gas station next to a McDonald's makes it a larger development." 
</P>
<P>
 The city imposed the "larger development" rule in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the Shell station will become Simi Valley's 30th gas station, and 
the first in more than 10 years.

STREET SMART: LEFT-TURN ARROW WOULD ONLY WORSEN BUSY INTERSECTION 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Entering into the new year, one of my resolutions was to write to Street Smart 
about a problem that's been bugging me, so here goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows the Victoria Avenue-Ventura Freeway interchange is a mess, but 
a quick fix on a nearby roadway might help. 
</P>
<P>
 At the eastbound intersection of Valentine Road and Victoria, traffic always 
seems to be backed up. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main problems is that most traffic turns left, but there is no 
left-turn arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Most oncoming traffic turns right, but not everybody uses their turn signal. 
So cars sit there waiting to turn left when they could be moving if there were 
a left-turn signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing a left-turn arrow would help. Can it be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jansen, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a congestion problem at Victoria and Valentine, but a left-turn arrow 
would only make it worse, Ventura Associate Traffic Engineer Robert Yalda says. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of signal lights at Valentine and Victoria is tricky, Yalda says, 
because of heavy traffic generated by the nearby Ventura Freeway access ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura traffic regulations allow a maximum of 110 seconds each for red and 
green lights. Extra green time for a left-turn arrow on Valentine would require 
a longer red light for cars on Victoria, which would cause additional backups, 
Yalda says. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are patient, however, you will be rewarded with a completely overhauled 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a major highway improvement project, city officials are meeting 
with the state Department of Transportation to redesign the off-ramps and 
nearby roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should be underway within three years, Yalda says.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the connector between the Simi Valley and Moorpark freeways is open, 
it seems like it would be a good idea to make some improvements on the Moorpark 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, between Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, the freeway is only two 
lanes in each direction. Traffic can get pretty backed up during rush hour. Are 
there any plans to widen the freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Miller, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that there are plans to widen the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news? It probably won't happen for another 10 years, says Chris 
Stevens, spokesman for the Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 After about half a dozen years of waiting, the $19-million widening project is 
now No. 2 on the commission's list of unfunded projects -- right behind the 
plan to widen the Simi Valley Freeway from Tapo Canyon Road to the Los Angeles 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
 When it does receive funding, the Moorpark Freeway project calls for paving 
the median, which would double the number of lanes from four to eight. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart:

<P>
 My car and I have a problem with speed humps in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like there's a hump, bump or lump in the middle of every parking lot 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
 There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to these roadblocks. They come in 
all sizes. Some are painted yellow, some white. But the worst ones aren't 
painted at all. You can't see them coming, and they make for a rude surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any city laws regulating speed humps? Shouldn't drivers at least be 
warned that the humps are there? 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Johnson, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a speed hump, concrete barrier or a row of metal spikes to punch 
holes in your tires, the city has no control over what property owners put in 
their parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like the city telling you what color to paint your house," 
Traffic Engineer Bill Golubics said. "These are operations improvements that 
are up to the property owners to install and maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to city streets, however, there are strict rules on what speed 
humps should look like and where they can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has installed black-and-white-striped humps on 17 streets in Simi 
Valley, and all of them are three inches high and 12 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "These humps are gradual undulations in the pavement, not the abrupt bumps you 
find in many parking lots," Golubics said. DIAL-A-RIDE 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled Ventura County residents who want to use public transportation can 
get priority service through the county's Dial-A-Ride van program. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who qualify will receive a special card showing that they have been 
certified for the door-to-door service.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GOLF CLUBS MAY LET NON-RESIDENTS JOIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will decide whether to open the 
Men's and Women's Clubs at the Los Robles Golf Course to non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's Club President Dodie Heitmeyer asked the council to consider allowing 
non-residents to join her organization, which holds golf tournaments every 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 While non-residents who have belonged to the club for years can retain their 
membership, any woman golfer interested in joining as a new member must live in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city implemented that policy 18 months ago, the club's membership 
has dropped and officers are finding it difficult to recruit new members, 
Heitmeyer wrote in a letter to Mayor Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Lazar, a member of the city's golf course committee, 
said she sees no reason to change the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there isn't an interest in the club, there isn't an interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to require all new members to prove residency came about, Lazar 
said, because the Men's Club had been monopolizing weekend tee times and was 
causing "real concern and aggravation in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 To solve that problem, the city asked the Men's Club to reopen its doors to 
new members and to accept only city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Club was required to follow the same policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Men's Club tee times were restricted to one Saturday a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Men's Club now has about 100 members, and the Women's Club has about 50, 
Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dues for either are roughly $100 a year, she said. STEPHANIE SIMON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FAMILY FILES SUIT IN MAN'S FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of an Ohio man stabbed to death over the summer has filed a 
$500,000 claim against Ventura County, the Sheriff's Department and the city of 
Ojai, alleging that negligent officer training contributed to the man's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper Fitzgerald, 19, of Columbus was stabbed to death with an ice pick May 
14 after a weekend party in Ojai.The victim, who spent part of his boyhood in 
Ojai, was on vacation from school when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Burchell, 19, of Ojai later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case 
and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fitzgerald's father, Frank Fitzgerald of Columbus, said Thursday that his 
son would still be alive if officers responding to the party had acted 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand of the police reports, my son was killed only a few 
feet from the squad car while the officer was there," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's three or four people who say the officers were there prior to my 
son's attack," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the officer had gotten out of the car and looked in the back yard, he 
would have seen (Jasper Fitzgerald). Instead, my son laid there for 20 or 30 
minutes dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Burchell told investigators that Jasper Fitzgerald had hit him in the face, so 
Burchell stabbed him with an ice pick he had brought to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim is scheduled to be considered by supervisors within weeks, said Robi 
G. Klein, director of the county's Risk Management Agency, who said he would 
recommend that it be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council will review the claim at its meeting Tuesday. Ojai City 
Finance Director Cyndi Reynolds has also recommended that the claim be denied.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BONE MARROW DONORS SOUGHT FOR WOMAN

<P>
 Blood testing for potential bone marrow donors is scheduled Tuesday to aid a 
Westlake woman hospitalized with acute leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Cudio, 45, had a nearly perfect-match for a bone marrow transplant 
until Dec. 27, when she was informed that, for medical reasons, the donor no 
longer would be able to provide her with the bone marrow she needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Family, friends and co-workers are asking for donations and urging people to 
take the blood test. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 flyers have been distributed in Ventura County and nearly 400 
people have signed up for the blood testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The test, which will be free of charge to those taking it, will be conducted 
by staff from the National Marrow Donor Program and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Cudio, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, will probably be able to live 
a normal life span if a donor is found, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests will be given from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 1408 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those taking the test may either walk in or make appointments by calling 
495-7066. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with questions about donating bone marrow should contact Lynnette 
Chandler with the National Marrow Donor Program at 987-6935. CHRISTINA LIMA

 A series of lectures on contemporary worship services will highlight Cal 
Lutheran University's WinterBreak, an annual, two-day session in late January 
that focuses on an aspect of Lutheran theology. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining this year's event will be lecturer Gracia Grindal, a professor of 
rhetoric at Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minn.She will 
present three lectures, titled "The Way It Was," "The Mess We're In" and "Some 
Possible Ways Out." 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AD CAMPAIGN TO URGE MORE STEEL RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even avid recyclers often don't know that steel is recyclable, so Ventura 
County cities and waste haulers are getting the word out this month through an 
advertising blitz featuring prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can win one of several prizes if they most closely guess the number 
of steel cans processed each month by their local recycling center, officials 
said.Prizes include one free month of refuse service or free dump service for a 
three-cubic-yard bin. 
</P>
<P>
 Children with the closest guess can win a T-shirt or steel lunch pail, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, efforts to increase recycling have focused on getting more people 
to participate, said David Goldstein, an analyst with the Ventura County Solid 
Waste Department. But the emphasis has shifted to increasing the amount and 
types of products that each individual recycles, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steel Recycling Institute, an organization of steel producers, estimates 
that only 34% of steel cans were recycled in 1991, Goldstein said. The goal is 
to raise that figure to 66% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 All California cities have been mandated to decrease the amount of trash they 
send to landfills by 25% in 1995 and by 50% in 2000. Cities that do not meet 
those mandates could face fines of up to $10,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about entering the steel recycling contest, residents should 
call the company responsible for hauling recyclables in their area. Contacts 
are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ojai Rubbish and Rubbish Control service areas; call Dawn at 646-5577. 
</P>
<P>
 * GI Rubbish service areas; call Tony at 529-5871. 
</P>
<P>

COUNTY ISSUE / THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL AT THE FIRE STATION; A VENTURA COUNTY FIRE 
CAPTAIN HAS FILED A GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE COUNTY CHARGING THAT A SEPTEMBER 
DECISION TO BAN THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL AT FIRE STATIONS IN THE THOUSAND OAKS AREA 
HAS VIOLATED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. SHOULD FIREFIGHTERS BE ALLOWED TO WATCH 
THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL DURING THE HOURS WHEN THEY ARE IN THE STATION ON CALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Annie Muno, Probationary firefighter, Ventura Fire Department, Station 3  
</P>
<P>
 I don't have any problem with it and, if I did have a problem with it, I would 
just walk out of the room. This is a big firehouse, and there are a lot of 
places we can go and a lot of things we can do in our free time. I can go read 
a book or a magazine, or I can ask to have the channel changed if it's 
something on that bothers me. It would be different if someone took a picture 
of a naked woman and taped it to my locker or shoved it in my face. That would 
be offensive. But we have choices here. I'm not being forced to sit down in 
front of the Playboy Channel. I have other places I can go. And besides, we're 
professionals here and we've never had to deal with something like that. We 
have to work together here, and I think everybody has enough respect for each 
other that if they were watching something offensive to me and I told them, 
they would just change the channel. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 George Lund, Ventura County fire chief  
</P>
<P>
 I say no. I think that my position is clear by the action we have already 
taken. We have the union filing a grievance saying this ban is unfair, but I 
feel very strongly that it's inappropriate and shouldn't be permitted. 
Regardless of whether they have freedom of speech, I see this as an issue of 
the workplace, and I feel that we have to be able to control what goes on 
there. Let's remember, it's still a place where work is done. It's still a 
place that's shared with both sexes -- we have women and men working there. And 
it's a place where there are often juveniles present; we have a cadet program 
where young people are frequent visitors to the station house. Whether they are 
responding to an emergency or on a work cycle or just on their free time, that 
doesn't change the fact that they are in a workplace and we should have the 
right to control the activities that occur within it. 
</P>

 Ken Maffei, President, Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 My answer to that is that our issue is not with the Playboy Channel or with 
Playboy magazine. Our issue is with the idea of censorship and the First 
Amendment. What if the county said they don't want you to read the Bible in the 
fire station? We're talking about the Constitution of the United States here. 
When it's an issue of censorship of any kind, we feel that the government 
should be opposed to it and that's why we're opposed to their banning anything. 
Certainly we respect the sensitivity of some people. If this stuff is offensive 
to even one person at the station, by all means it should not be watched. We do 
recognize that this is a place of business and, of course, the firefighters' 
first priority is their work. But this is a unique place of business because 
the firefighters also have to spend their free time and leisure time there. The 
question is, then, should they be censored from watching something they want to 
watch while they are not working? While it is a public building, there are 
places in it that are private, and they should be able to use those spaces 
however they wish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Vicky Howard, Ventura County supervisor  
</P>
<P>
 I personally think that allowing the Playboy Channel in the workplace is, 
without question, totally and completely inappropriate. This is a public 
building, a county building. So I don't see the difference whether it's the day 
room of the fire station or in my office. It's simply not right to have that 
kind of thing on television in any county office. We have to be able to draw 
the line somewhere and, if we are going to draw the line, I don't think there's 
any question that the Playboy Channel would fall on the wrong side of the line. 
The thing about it is, I think we are dealing with a very professional Fire 
Department here. That's why they recognized this as a problem and dealt with 
it. I think if you went out and asked them, the vast majority of the 
firefighters would agree that it would be totally inappropriate for employees 
of the county to be watching that kind of television in a county facility.

 Charlene Pizzadili, Past coordinator, Simi Valley/Conejo chapter of the 
National Organization for Women  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know of any other job where something like that would be allowed. And 
this isn't just any job. The taxpayers are paying for the firefighters to be 
working. The whole argument that they are just on standby or that they are on 
their free time just doesn't hold water. No matter what they're doing, when 
they are on the clock, they are supposed to be professionals. What makes this 
whole thing disturbing to me is that I have to wonder, what kind of people are 
these that would fight for the Playboy Channel when they know it could make 
their co-workers uncomfortable? Why in the world can't they leave something 
like this for the privacy of their home? If I was working under that captain, I 
would be asking myself, is this somewhere where I can be treated equally as a 
woman? Do I want to be working for somebody who is insensitive to the idea that 
this is offensive? I don't see any difference between this and some firefighter 
arguing he wants to show racist films to black firefighters and expecting them 
to sit there and allow it to happen. Sexism is just as serious as racism.

MAN DIES IN FIRE, 7 SAVED; DAUGHTER CREDITS PREMONITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 82-year-old man died in an apartment fire, but his daughter said Sunday 
that a premonition helped her save other family members from perishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said Anjok Brian apparently died shortly before midnight 
Saturday of smoke inhalation in a fire blamed on an electric portable heater in 
his bedroom in an apartment on Valencia Street. The victim's daughter, her five 
children and a nephew escaped unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at a friend's apartment Sunday, Brian's daughter, Atlinda 
Clanre, credited a premonition she had and her father with saving the others in 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In a soft voice, the 37-year-old woman recounted how that night she had turned 
back while on her way to work the graveyard shift at a medical supply company 
because of something her 8-year-old son had said to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, ' You should be home with me tonight, Momma,' " she said. "Those 
words kept ringing in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 So, she drove back home and checked that her five children, who range in age 
from 3 to 17, were asleep. Then, she went into a bedroom to lie down next to 
her two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Clanre thought she heard her father "running around his 
room, saying something" unintelligible. She went to his bedroom and, upon 
opening his door, saw thick smoke, Clanre said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see anyone. I crawled on the floor, (searching) for him, but he 
wasn't there," she said. She then ran through the apartment, awakening her 
children and nephew, pushing them out of the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran after them and counted, one, two, three, four, five, making sure 
everyone got out," Clanre recalled, as she sat on the floor of her friend's 
apartment, wrapped in a multicolor wool blanket. "I think, now, that my father 
had saved our lives. If I did not hear him in his bedroom, I don't know what 
would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her nephew, Walter Clanry, 23, ran back upstairs and searched 
unsuccessfully for Brian. Undaunted, he went next door, enlisted a friend's 
help and together they returned to Brian's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened the door and the smoke was thicker and the fire was bigger," Clanry 
said. "We crawled on the floor and tried to look for him. We called his name, 
and he didn't answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian had apparently died by then, fire officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was confined to the bedroom and was contained within five to seven 
minutes, said Costa Mesa Fire Battalion Chief Jim Ellis. "Everything points to 
either bedding material or the curtains catching on fire due to the heater," 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary concern that everyone has with a heating element is that it gets 
very hot," Ellis said. "A portable heater is like an open flame, you don't want 
it near anything that's flammable." 
</P>
<P>
 Clanre said she bought the portable heater several months ago because the 
apartment's built-in heater emitted nauseous fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one always smells bad and my kids always get sick from it," she said.

SAN CLEMENTE'S POLICE SWITCH IS WINNING FAVOR; PUBLIC SAFETY: THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT HAS PUT MORE PATROLS ON THE STREET WHILE COSTING THE CITY LESS THAN 
IT DID TO RUN ITS OWN DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emotions ran high and debate raged when officers slowly lowered the San 
Clemente Police Department's blue and white flag for the last time in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the six months since the city disbanded the 65-year-old department and 
merged with the Orange County Sheriff's Department -- a move forced by budget 
problems -- the city, and even some once-vocal critics of the change, have 
generally come to embrace the new arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 More officers are on the streets these days, and emergency response times have 
improved in the seaside community of 43,000 people. City officials expect the 
merger will have saved $2.1 million when the difficult fiscal year ends June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Scott Diehl said residents are "getting more patrols, which they like, 
and there's less administration, which they have said they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jim Miranda, a local real estate agent and community activist: "For the 
most part, their presence has been well felt and greatly appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 There are clear indications the community is healing from the divisions over 
the merger. And residents, shaken by a recent spate of gang-related violence, 
have been working closer with law enforcement to make their community safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Marino, a resident and activist, said she believes the Sheriff's 
Department has responded well so far to community needs. "They are picking up 
where the Police Department left off," she said. "I view that as a good 
starting point." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of vocal opposition, the City Council voted 4 to 1 last February 
to abolish the police department and switch to a contract with the Sheriff's 
Department, effective July 2. Councilman Thomas Lorch cast the lone vote 
against the change, saying he believed the issue should go before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A group calling itself Citizens for a Better San Clemente launched a recall 
drive against the four council members who voted for the merger, but failed to 
gather enough signatures to force an election. A campaign for a ballot 
initiative to overturn the merger met the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority was always there in favor of the change," said Frank Montesinos, 
an architect and former president of the Sunrise Rotary Club. "We were not as 
vocal as the other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sensible decision," he continued. "These days you can not be too 
emotional about economic issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lusk, a volunteer with the Police Department's senior citizens patrol, 
originally fought the merger, fearing the loss of tradition, but has been won 
over so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been living here 25 years, and like anything, you get attached to 
things," Lusk said. "But law enforcement is going to be changing. Everyone's 
budget is getting thinner and thinner." 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the transition, sheriff's deputies, most of whom worked previously for 
the 75-member Police Department and switched over, have made a special effort 
to reach the public. Sheriff's deputies even temporarily opened an office 
downtown to help people learn more about the changes and seek advice on how to 
better combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have the support of the community," said Lt. Tom Davis, chief 
of police services for the city. "It's the community that pays our salaries. 
It's the community we have to stay in touch with. . . . So far, this community 
does stay involved." 
</P>
<P>
 While sheriff's officials say it's too early to tell what effect the merger is 
having on the overall crime rate, they have noticed some changes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Response times for "Priority 1" calls, involving a felony in progress, have 
improved by 30 seconds over last year to an average of about 4 to 4.5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calls for service are down about 4%, with an average of 2,000 calls per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crime reports are up by 20%, probably the result of county policy requiring 
a report for every crime call received. Before, San Clemente police had more 
discretion in deciding when to file reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic citations, both parking and moving violations, are up 60% over last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was also able this summer to resume beach patrols that had been 
eliminated in budget cuts several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Michael W. Parness described the merger as an "unqualified 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the $5.8-million annual contract with the Sheriff's Department, the city 
has increased street patrols by 20% to 56%, depending on the shift. Expanded 
services at a lower cost are possible because the Sheriff's Department has 
lower overhead than the old Police Department, and shares resources with other 
South County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit, Parness said, is that the city can draw upon a wider range of 
specialized law enforcement tools available through the larger Sheriff's 
Department, such as the Gang Enforcement Team. That team was called upon in 
November in the wake of two gang-related shootings within one week. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, however, has not worked for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three San Clemente officers rejected for employment by the Sheriff's 
Department have filed claims with the county or city, the first step in 
potential lawsuits. Officials have rejected the claims of at least one of the 
former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the San Clemente jail also remains in dispute. Some critics say 
the jail, closed since the merger, should be used, rather than having deputies 
take time to drive prisoners to Santa Ana. Others oppose reopening the jail, 
especially if it involves prisoners from other South County cities. A study on 
the jail is expected by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, deputies say they have adjusted well to the change, despite 
the controversy when the merger was proposed last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you look at change, it's going to be met with resistance," said 
Deputy Jim Greenwood. Now that the change has occurred, "it's business as 
usual."

TIDE TURNS FOR TIDE POOLS; MARINE INSTITUTE USES TOUR TO SHOW OFF SEA LIFE AND 
EXPLAIN NEW LAW PROTECTING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When ecologists at the Orange County Marine Institute began a few years ago to 
chart all the things beach-goers took home from the prized tide pool zone here, 
they were amazed at the findings: Shells, snails, mussels and myriad other 
species of marine life were all disappearing from the area -- often, it turned 
out, by the bucket-full. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everyone leaves the marine refuge with something in their hands -- in 
spite of what the signs say," said Harry Helling, the Marine Institute's 
associate executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new law that went into effect Jan. 1 is designed to deter scavengers at 
the Dana Point tide pools, barring people from taking anything from the refuge. 
And if the first ecological walk of the season through the area was any sign, 
local marine experts think the newly revamped marine-protection efforts might 
just work. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 people turned out Sunday for the Marine Institute's tour of the 
tide pools, a two-hour event that will generally run every other week through 
April. Many of Sunday's would-be marine biologists were young children, armed 
with magnifying glasses and note pads as they hopped from rock to rock on the 
shoreline with exhausted parents in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 They spied crabs and snails and urchins and starfish, all nestled calmly in 
the shallow pools of sea water between the shoreline rocks. Past expeditions 
have even found 18-inch-long, two-spotted octopuses on the shore. None showed 
up Sunday, but there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's gross! It's sick!" Amber Kilmer, 8, of Garden Grove cried out as a 
purple fluid oozed onto her hand from a California brown sea hare that she held 
in her palm. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber looked to her mother for sympathy as she washed off the mess, but Robin 
Kilmer was somewhat amused by the whole scene. "It matches her purple outfit," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Institute instructor Rick Baker explained to a group that the sea hare 
secretes the sticky purple stuff as a defense mechanism when it is frightened. 
The liquid can numb predators, he said, but it is harmless to animals as big as 
human beings -- even ones the size of Amber. Native Americans even used the 
liquid as dye for clothing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber's great-grandmother, Anne Ryder of Salt Lake City, said she saw a 
listing for the tour in the newspaper and wanted to bring the whole family out. 
(Tickets are $3 for adults and $2 for children; make reservations by calling 
(714) 496-2274.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to see a tide pool," Ryder said. "It's wonderful. I'm 76, and 
it was quite a trip to get over these rocks, but I made it." 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away, 6-year-old Shivaram Lingamneni fumbled with a hardened, 
nook-filled piece of calcium that measured a few inches. An instructor 
explained that it was home to the tube worm, but Shivaram had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like an apartment building," the youngster declared as he took his 
mother over to another pool. 
</P>
<P>
 While Marine Institute instructors wanted to show the kids a good time, they 
also had a serious point to make: that people should leave the coast the way 
they found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Helling stressed that lesson as he finished telling a group of children about 
a sea hare that he held in his hand, showing them how it breathes and protects 
itself and survives. Once he was done, he asked the children what he should do 
with the hare now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it down!" came the resounding chorus from the children. He had made his 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Jan. 1, Helling said, Dana Point's tide pool refuge -- considered one of 
the best of its kind in Southern California -- was run under the same 
restrictions as those statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers were allowed to take certain marine items home with them, as 
dictated by signs on the beach. But confusion was common, and the rules were 
often broken as people took beach items home as souvenirs, food or bait, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Institute officials, working with state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), began a push four years ago to impose tighter restrictions in the tide 
pool area. That effort ended in success last summer, when the Legislature 
approved a bill specifically designed for Dana Point that banned the removal of 
any marine items from the 3,500-foot-long area, Helling said. 
</P>
<P>
 People are also prohibited from even bringing certain "collection devices," 
such as picks, buckets and fishing rods, into the tide pool's "no-take zone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations went into effect Jan. 1, and Helling said the institute is 
starting to educate the public about the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Helling said he fears that if not for the change in policy, Sunday's young 
explorers wouldn't have much of a tide pool left to explore by the time they 
grew up, as only the toughest marine species would be able to withstand the 
constant human trampling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If left unprotected," he said, "you would find a slow destruction in the 
diversity of the animals here. I don't know what would be left here."

CITYSCAPES / CARLA HALL: SHAPING UP IN THE WEE HOURS IS NOT THE USUAL TREADMILL

 On the second floor of the health club, the woman in leotard and tights is 
conducting an aerobics class of one. In a space that could hold 40, it's just 
her, the music and the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after she bundles up her gym bag and walks out, Omari Talib walks 
into the free weights room, a bottle of water tucked under his arm. He's been 
to school (Pasadena City College), his second job (Tower Records) and now he's 
here for his hour of pumping iron. "I'm an insomniac," says the 23-year-old 
Talib, inexplicably cleareyed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 2:45 a.m. Talib has to be at school in six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, you can ride the Lifecycle 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 At least you can at Bally's Nautilus Plus in Pasadena. As most other health 
clubs are shutting off the music and the lights, and coaxing last-minute 
exercisers out the door, this plain brick building on the edge of Old Pasadena 
is just switching into night mode. On an otherwise quiet strip of Arroyo 
Parkway, the fluorescent-lit entrance beckons the buff and not-so-buff, the 
graveyard shift workers and the sleepless, anyone who believes a post-midnight 
run on a treadmill or a round of military presses, lat pulls and squats will 
help them make it through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, the club has been open 24 hours Monday through Thursday. 
(Friday, they close at 11 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 10 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that Pasadena is kind of a 24-hour place," says sales counselor 
Pierre Williams, who clocks out at 10 p.m. "A lot of people need to be told 
when they should work out. We say just stop by after work. The next question 
is: 'What time do you close?' The answer is: 'We don't.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Freed of the frenzy of club prime time (4 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.), exercisers avoid 
stray elbows in aerobics classes and bumping backsides in locker rooms. There 
are no hostile glares from people waiting for the weight machine you're using. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the harried members flinging their membership cards and problems at 
the front desk staffer. "People are rude from noon to 4 p.m.," says one 
nightside staffer bluntly. After 10 p.m., the crowd mellows; not a voice is 
raised.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of peaceful," says a woman slipping into flowered tights and a 
lilac spandex top in the locker room at 11 p.m. "I usually come even later." 
Her nails are lacquered scarlet and she reapplies lipstick before going out to 
lift weights. Under cover of night, exercisers can be anyone they want to be -- 
or at least cloak themselves in complete privacy. And this woman requests that 
neither her name nor her occupation be revealed. "I go there to work out," she 
says later, "and not really be in a meat market." 
</P>
<P>
 The night breeds its own lore. Rumor has it that one woman with a perfect 
figure is a porn star. "I don't need to know," says trainer Geary Souder, 
brushing off the gossip. "Does she need a trainer? That's all I need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Souder loves the odd hours. He arrived only a few weeks ago and dreams of 
being an independent trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't do that without clientele," he says. So here he is, roaming the 
floor, helping those who request it and gently offering suggestions to those 
who are clearly doing it wrong. You can hire him for a training session at 3 in 
the morning. Night people not only crave smaller crowds, they are usually 
devoted exercisers. "Anyone coming in at 2 a.m.," Souder says, "is committed to 
getting their workout in." 
</P>
<P>
 But in truth, the nocturnal crowd is as varied as the daytime crowd. Some are 
as lean and muscled as Carmen McMickens and her boyfriend, Anderson Mackey. "I 
can concentrate more at night," he says. "We had a fattening lunch and I felt 
guilty," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are wrestling with their weight. "I have to drop 50 pounds and be 
ready," says 25-year-old Rose Grant, a singer and songwriter who likes to work 
on her music until four or five in the morning. "I'm about to get a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The clock edges toward the wee hours. Downstairs in the free weights room 
("the iron room" one staffer dubs it), Damon Turner, a 20-year-old trainer who 
has finished his shift, has staked out a corner, lanky legs stretched out, for 
a chat with two friends. Upstairs, a mere 11 people are engrossed in the 
exercise of their choice. The cavernous room, so overrun during the day, now 
practically engulfs the exercisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your sense of space is a little different at night," says Joe Altmark, 
wearing sweats and a baseball cap embroidered with "Karate Kid III," a memento 
of his work as a stunt double on the movie.  
</P>
<P>
 At least half of the night crawlers are women. Inside, the gym, big as it is, 
feels like a cocoon of safety. But outside, the night is damp and deserted. The 
women who venture out sigh and resign themselves to a short if tense walk to 
the parking lot. "I don't know if I'd come alone," says Christy Shaw. "I 
brought my boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Eve Ferrara, 41, has just come from the movies. " 'Schindler's List.' Sad," 
says Ferrara, who is working out with her friend, Jenny Bryant, 28. "She knew 
about the gym being open 24 hours. We said, 'Let's go after the movies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They love the privacy of the night. "There's no one who gives a (hoot) how you 
look," says Ferrara with a little grin. "Usually you have to prime yourself up 
and look half decent." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant checks her watch. "It's five after midnight," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrara's face lights up with sudden recognition. "Happy birthday!" she 
exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 Night people become morning people around 5 a.m., and by 6 a.m., 40 to 50 
people are starting their day with a workout. Souder heads home, eats some 
breakfast, maybe catches up on the latest edition of Muscle and Fitness. Says 
Souder: "If you're going to make a living at it, you have to stay on top of the 
craft."

RAPE VICTIMS LEFT IN DARK ON HIV THREAT; HEALTH: LAW SHIELDS THE DISCLOSURE OF 
A SUSPECT'S STATUS. ONE MAN IS SUSPECTED OF RAPING 15 WOMEN, BUT ONLY FOUR HAVE 
LEARNED IF HE CARRIES THE AIDS VIRUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When accused serial rapist Monette Johnson goes on trial this week, the 
prosecutor will say Johnson is the man who broke into the homes of at least six 
women and raped them, and the defense lawyer will argue that he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one subject neither of them will address in the courtroom, or 
anywhere else: whether Johnson might have the human immunodeficiency virus that 
causes AIDS, and whether he could have passed on the deadly virus to his 
alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Johnson is suspected of raping as many as 15 women across the east San 
Fernando Valley, often at knifepoint in the middle of the night, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women have been notified by county health officials that they may have 
been exposed to HIV. However, the notices do not say who is suspected of 
exposing them. That is because state confidentiality laws can shield accused 
and convicted rapists from having their health status made public. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some instances in which rape victims can be told whether their 
attacker is infected with the virus, but only if criminal charges are filed and 
they obtain a court order mandating an HIV test. However, if a woman alleges 
that a man has raped her, and authorities are unable or elect not to prosecute 
-- as is the case for nine of Johnson's alleged victims -- she cannot be told 
his medical status.  
</P>
<P>
 This rankles police, prosecutors and especially rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a travesty of justice," said one woman, who is set to testify that 
Johnson, 35, raped her. "It's not right for people not to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, and three of the others Johnson has been charged with raping, 
successfully petitioned the court two years ago to force him to undergo an HIV 
test, and they now know the results. However, it remains illegal for those 
women -- or anyone else familiar with the information -- to reveal whether 
Johnson has tested positive for the virus. To do so is punishable by up to a 
$10,000 fine and a year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Some authorities say the law protects rapists at the expense of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those victims have a right to know," said Los Angeles Police Detective Gary 
Barthelmess, who said that even he is prohibited from finding out. "They're 
going to spend the rest of their lives wondering if and when they will come 
down with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The women who claim Johnson raped them have been clamoring for information, 
say some victims, police and other authorities with knowledge of the case. They 
want to know if the letters they received from the county Department of Health 
Services mean he is the one who may have exposed them, or if someone else was 
the source. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine a rape victim who gets a letter like this, and doesn't know," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Rabichow, who is prosecuting Johnson. " 'Was it 
the suspect? My husband? My boyfriend?' There is no reason to prevent law 
enforcement or the victims from knowing the results in a sexual assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a right to know if they've been exposed," Rabichow said, "and who 
exposed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, victims of rape, sodomy and certain types of sexual molestation in 
which body fluids may have been exchanged are entitled to go to court to force 
their accused attacker to undergo an HIV test if a criminal case is brought.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Finn, medical director of AIDS programs for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services, said the confidentiality law may not be perfect, 
but it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Without it, he said, people could claim that they were sexually assaulted as a 
means of determining whether a sexual partner or other person is HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can empathize with the women sitting out there with great concern," Finn 
said. "But if we move to change the law to say anyone can find out such 
results, then we're moving into the area of hearsay. And that really concerns 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some private groups that promote AIDS outreach and awareness vehemently oppose 
changing the laws. They say people would never come forward to be tested if 
there was any possibility that the results would be given to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Finn, who has the responsibility of discussing such test results with those 
entitled to get them, said only about 15 rape and molestation victims in Los 
Angeles County have asked for the results of their attackers' tests. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the women who petitioned the court in the Johnson case has 
reported testing positive for HIV. Finn said that in the vast majority of 
cases, if someone does not test positive within three months of an exchange of 
bodily fluids, that person can rest assured he or she was not infected. 
</P>
<P>
 However, authorities predict that the clash of AIDS disclosure and 
confidentiality in criminal cases will become more pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Barthelmess, a veteran sex crimes detective in North Hollywood, said many 
victims have pleaded with him and health officials to tell them whether they 
have been exposed to the virus, and by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts you in a moral dilemma, of fundamental right versus wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a resident of Lake View Terrace, is a convicted criminal with a long 
record and a list of aliases, including Monnette C. Alford Johnson. Police say 
he prowled Valley neighborhoods and raped his victims at knifepoint after 
entering their houses and apartments through unlocked doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with 28 counts of rape, burglary, robbery and other crimes for a 
series of attacks police say he committed from August, 1991, until he was 
arrested in January, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 At his trial, scheduled to begin today in Van Nuys Superior Court, prosecutors 
say they will try to convict him on the basis of witness testimony, DNA testing 
and other evidence. Property stolen from some victims was found at his 
apartment, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's lawyer, M. David Houchin, has said in court documents that such DNA 
testing is faulty. Johnson has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was 
released from parole in July, 1991, after serving nearly a year for an 
extortion conviction. Authorities allege that the rapes started soon afterward.

NO MO' BLUES; CLUB OWNER SINGS A HAPPY TUNE AFTER SONGWRITERS PAY HER DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, the legendary songwriting team whose career was 
nurtured in nightclubs and after-hours jazz and blues joints along Central 
Avenue, last week gave something back to the community that gave them their 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Mae Gross, the 73-year-old owner of Babe's and Ricky's Inn, the last 
blues nightspot in South-Central Los Angeles, was drowning in a sea of debt, 
facing a $9,000 judgment for failing to pay royalties to members of the 
American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt would have closed the popular, 30-year-old club, which has featured 
some of the greats of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber and Stoller, who were responsible for scores of 1950s and '60s rock 'n' 
roll and rhythm-and-blues hits including "Hound Dog" and "Yakety Yak," read 
about Gross' plight in a Times article last month and decided to rescue her. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Hollywood-based songwriters told ASCAP, which monitors and collects 
royalties for its members under music copyright laws, that they will pay the 
judgment and the club's annual fees to ASCAP as long as Gross stays in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber and Stoller -- neither of whom had ever set foot in the club -- said 
they were driven by their love for the blues and a sense of nostalgia: Babe's 
and Ricky's is one of the last reminders of a golden era along Central, when 
the strip was the center of African American cultural life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the roots of our beginning -- not only the music but the neighborhood," 
Stoller said Saturday night during a brief visit to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has something to do with keeping the remnants of the culture intact," 
Leiber said in a telephone interview. "Otherwise, it will turn to pinkeye or 
white bread." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said: "It's wonderful, it's wonderful. I'm so happy and thankful. This 
will help us keep the club alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross ran into trouble with ASCAP because she never took seriously the notion 
that she was obligated to pay royalties on songs because they were performed on 
her stage. It was a costly error, which escalated until the club's bank 
accounts were attached by a collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who came to her salvation were Los Angeles high school students in the 
early 1950s -- Leiber at Fairfax, Stroller at Belmont -- when they began 
venturing to Central Avenue to sample some of the after-hours joints, 
ballrooms, hotels and theaters. They soaked up the music scene -- the Ink 
Spots, the Penguins, Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they began to shape it. Many of their songs, often soaked in humor 
or poignancy, were recorded by artists who played Central Avenue clubs, and 
whose records helped build a huge audience for black artists among young 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of Leiber-Stoller hits reads like a history of the music itself: 
"Jailhouse Rock," recorded by Elvis Presley; "There Goes My Baby" and "On 
Broadway," by the Drifters; "Spanish Harlem" and "Stand by Me," by Ben E. King, 
and "Poison Ivy" and "Charlie Brown" by the Coasters.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the songwriters have worked with ASCAP to award scholarships 
to young, aspiring composers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the legal need to collect royalties, Leiber and Stoller said 
they were troubled by ASCAP's attempts to go after Gross' club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were leaning on the wrong people," Leiber said. "This is nickel and 
dimes. It's like putting poor people out of business who are trying to earn a 
living an honest way." 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt something needed to be done and we are in a position to do that," 
Stoller added. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Knittle, director of licensing for ASCAP, applauded the decision by 
Stoller and Leiber to pay Gross' debt, but defended the society's right to 
collect royalties for members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Authors, composers and publishers want their music to be performed and at the 
same time they expect royalties to be paid for their creativity," he said. "I 
don't think anyone could be asked for more." 
</P>
<P>
 At Babe's and Ricky's, the news of the bailout lifted the mood at the club 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stoller dropped by, he was warmly greeted by several in the house, 
including an old friend, Don Johnson, a former trumpet player with Johnny Otis' 
band who is now a music promoter. Johnson played tambourine on Big Mamma 
Thorton's 1953 recording of "Hound Dog."  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel damn good," Johnson said. "Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber made a mint 
off the music that was popular in this community. It's only right that they 
give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is that we did it to help save the music," he said.

WESTSIDE QUAKES RATTLE NERVES; SEISMOLOGY: TEMBLORS OF MAGNITUDE 3.7 AND 3.0 
ARE CENTERED OFFSHORE. NO MAJOR INJURIES OR DAMAGE ARE REPORTED. 
</P>

 A magnitude 3.7 earthquake centered in the Pacific Ocean two miles south of 
Santa Monica shook parts of Los Angeles on Sunday, setting off car alarms, 
rattling glasses and startling residents but causing no serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The offshore temblor, recorded at 3:01 p.m., was the strongest to shake the 
Los Angeles Basin since a 3.9-magnitude quake centered in Pasadena on June 29, 
1992, one day after the Landers earthquake, said Kate Hutton, a seismologist 
with Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents felt two quick jolts along the coast from Malibu to Manhattan Beach, 
and as far inland as Van Nuys, Silver Lake and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 An aftershock at 10:12 p.m. registered a magnitude 3.0, according to a Caltech 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists described the first jolt as "a vertical movement." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little shaky and then it went real big, for a good five seconds," 
said Gloria Schoenwetter, who was visiting her mother in a second-floor 
apartment at La Cienega and Olympic boulevards. "A lot of the car alarms went 
off on the street. It was really shaking. It felt like the floor was going to 
collapse and then it stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The basin has been experiencing a period of "seismic quiet" for several years, 
and Sunday's 3.7 temblor, designated as mild, did little to change that, 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not bring us out of that. It's a little too mild," said Caltech 
seismologist Egill Hauksson. An earthquake would have to measure "somewhere in 
the 5 to 6 range" to end the quiet period, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a number of big quakes from 1987 through June 20, 1991. Then, the 
Landers earthquake happened on June 28, 1992. Since then, things have been 
rather quiet. . . . Periods of lesser activity will come and go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Landers quake, followed by the 6.7 Big Bear Lake aftershock several hours 
later, measured at magnitudes ranging from 7.3 to 7.6. The quakes killed a 
child, injured 400 people, and damaged more than 4,000 homes and 175 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said Sunday's quake was probably on a Westwood extension of the 
Elysian Park fault system, which stretches from Whittier Narrows through 
Downtown Los Angeles and along the Santa Monica Mountains to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Starbucks coffee shop on 7th Street and Montana Avenue in Santa Monica, 
the jolt sent coffee spilling onto patio tables as customers ran into the 
street and agitated dogs whined and tugged on their leashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Young, a reservations agent for the J. Paul Getty Museum, was perched in 
his 10th-floor office in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dust was coming down from the ceiling. There were two quick, fierce jolts and 
then it was all over," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum in Malibu, engineers and security guards checked the facility 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was intact, so we didn't have to freak out too much. It's scary 
because it was a little close this time," said security officer Roger 
Balabanow.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a garbage truck banging into something. Boom!" said Monica 
Beauford, a waitress at the Firehouse in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode seven 
minutes after the temblor, sending out helicopters and fire engines to search 
for damage. They found none, said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 p.m., operations had returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the quake came in fierce jolts. Others flooded the Los Angeles Fire 
Department with 911 calls, mistaking it for an explosion, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of a flurry of quakes in the Santa Monica Bay in recent years, 
Hutton said, although most have been of lesser magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor was the strongest centered near the bay since Feb. 24, 1989, when 
a 3.9-magnitude quake centered offshore shook the region. Five weeks earlier, a 
magnitude 5.0 quake in the same region broke windows, cut off power to 100,000 
people and caused three minor injuries.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; OLD OCTA BUILDING TO BE NEW CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members recently voted to buy the Ralph B. Clark Orange County 
Transportation Authority building for $1.2 million and convert it into a new 
city hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to open late this year, the new city hall will be at 11222 Acacia 
Parkway, west of the current City Hall and across the street from the city's 
public safety building. 
</P>
<P>
 The current City Hall, at 11391 Acacia Parkway, which opened as a school 
building 70 years ago, needs significant work, officials said, and would have 
required major and costly rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The current City Hall fails to comply with the Americans With Disabilities 
Act, doesn't meet current earthquake and emergency exit requirements, would 
require new plumbing and costly asbestos mitigation in the event of remodeling 
and has unacceptable water quality, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials said, the electrical wiring system is old and the 
lighting and cooling systems are inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitating the building would cost about $2.7 million, acting Fire Chief 
Vincent Bonacker said in a report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 While purchase of the 45,000-square-foot, 15-year-old transportation building 
is set at $1.2 million, the cost for building modifications, demolition of the 
current City Hall and installation of new telephone and computer systems are 
expected to push the cost to $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The future city hall was formerly the administrative headquarters for the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, which is vacating the structure after 
consolidating administrative functions at a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's purchase is financed through a bond sale last year by the 
city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be millions of dollars cheaper than redoing the old building, and you 
still would have a 70-year-old building," said Mayor Frank Kessler. ROBERT 
BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 11 CITY WORKERS HONORED FOR SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven city workers were recently honored for service by City Manager James L. 
Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Core, a building permit assistant in the Development Services Department, 
was named general government employee of the year. Core helps residents and 
contractors process building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Core was commended by her supervisors for working overtime and Saturdays to 
process permits so builders could meet their construction schedules. She is 
also taking construction technology courses at Fullerton College to help her on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Cave, a police sergeant in the traffic bureau, was named safety employee 
of the year. Cave, 36, first worked for the city when he was 15, as a 
recreation aide for the former Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave joined the Police Department when he was 21 and said he has always wanted 
to a Fullerton police officer. He was one of the first DARE officers for the 
city and has worked as a SWAT team leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Rohr, a manager at the public library, was named manager of the year. A 
16-year library veteran, Rohr was promoted in 1990 to head adult services at 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohr has overseen the reduction of library services to save city money. She 
was commended for her ability to communicate well with library patrons and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three workers received a plaque and $350. Their names have been 
added to a trophy displayed in the lobby of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other employees were named as finalists and received certificates and 
$100. All the employees were nominated by their co-workers and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The finalists are: community services supervisor Russ Akina, water service 
worker Frank Chimzar, firefighter Ben Garrett and children's librarian Janine 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named as finalists: auto parts clerk Don Lemke, senior Police Officer 
Dave Miller, clerical assistant Pam Miller and equipment supervisor Tony 
Sambrano. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SINCE 1953, VOLUNTEER HAS BATTLED THE 
BLAZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Leonard Goodwin began fighting fires in South County, the landscape 
looked a little different. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1953 when the volunteer firefighter joined the Orange County Fire 
Department, and there was no Interstate 5 stretching to San Diego. Planned 
communities like Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita weren't even on the 
drawing board yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a volunteer firefighter, Goodwin has fought many of the major 
blazes in the area over the past four decades, including the recent disastrous 
fires in Laguna Beach and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only other fire I fought which was more intense as far as flames and 
winds was the Paseo Grande fire in 1967," said Goodwin, 65, who battled the 
Laguna Beach blaze all night. "We didn't lose as many homes in that one." 
</P>
<P>
 A 58-year resident of San Juan Capistrano, Goodwin was one of several 
volunteer firefighters who were honored recently for length of service by the 
Orange County Fire Department. The next-longest term of service was 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 683 volunteers are on call to battle fires around the clock in 
Orange County. For their tough and dangerous work, they get a small fee -- 
about $7 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not enough to compensate them for the hassle," said Orange 
County Battalion Chief Ron Blaul, who worked with Goodwin for several years in 
San Juan Capistrano. "These are people who aren't into firefighting as a career 
but do it because they love the work." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired San Clemente policeman, Goodwin works out of Station 7 in San Juan 
Capistrano, where he won the Orange County Paid Call Firefighter of the Year 
Award in 1991. He followed his father as a volunteer fireman, working with him 
in 1953-54, and eventually saw his own son become a paid-call firefighter as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuity has also been his professional specialty. Goodwin has been an 
instructor in several training sessions for new volunteers and says preparing 
the next generation of volunteer firefighters is one of the reasons he has 
stayed in fire service so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy training the young firefighters and getting them ready for action," 
Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaul said Goodwin's detailed knowledge of South County terrain has been 
invaluable to firefighters. "The first thing I did when I saw smoke off Ortega 
Highway was swing by the San Juan station and grab Leonard," he said. "Then I 
knew I could find the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've been around that long and seen so many changes, that experience 
is invaluable," Blaul said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY OKS FUNDS TO HIRE LOBBYING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week agreed to spend $24,000 to hire a consulting firm 
to help the city secure federal funds for local projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an investment," Councilman Burnie Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser disagreed, casting the lone vote against 
hiring the Ferguson Co., a decision that was approved by the council 4 to 1. 
Wiser said the city has employees who lobby for federal money as part of their 
job and called the hiring of an outside consultant to do the same work 
wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser noted that Brea belongs to the California League of Cities, the 
California Assn. of Governments and other groups that act as advocates for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we have senators and associations," she said. "They should be able 
to work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest argued that while the city does have employees who 
write grant applications, it does not have a staff member in the nation's 
capital to determine which funds are available and make personal contacts with 
heads of federal departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson Co. lobbyists, who will represent Brea in Washington, will make it 
easier to obtain those grants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulting firm will lobby for money to pay for transportation, community 
development and redevelopment projects, Benest said. MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday to approve Capt. Randall Gaston 
as the city's new police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote is expected to be a formality, because all five council members have 
said they support City Manager James D. Ruth's selection of Gaston, who would 
be sworn in immediately after the vote.He will replace Joseph T. Molloy, who 
died of a heart attack in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, 49, has worked through the ranks at the Anaheim Police Department, 
beginning as a patrol officer in 1965. He was promoted to captain in 1983 and 
most recently led the department's special operations unit, which includes the 
SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston has a bachelor's degree in criminology from Cal State Long Beach and a 
master's degree in public administration from USC. He is married to an Anaheim 
teacher, and they have four children. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LIBRARY GETS GRANT TO HELP IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Library has received a $5,000 federal grant to educate the 
city's Spanish-speaking immigrant population about topics such as citizenship, 
history and English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will be used to help immigrants adapt to American culture by 
allowing the library to offer more audiotapes and easy-to-read books on those 
subjects, library director Rob Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent is to provide materials that enable them to become productive 
citizens," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will be used to augment the library's $125,000-a-year program to 
provide such materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "our needs are much greater than that even, but our resources are 
limited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to reach Spanish-speaking immigrants is especially great because 
53% of the city's residents are foreign-born. Of those, most are Spanish 
speakers, Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said one benefit of the program is that it attracts immigrants to the 
library, where many newcomers don't realize that books can be borrowed for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, libraries offer people one of the best tools to learn about a 
new culture: novels. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; REOPENING UNOCAL PLANT STIRS DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The relentless winter storms of 1983 that flooded streets and decimated the 
city's historic pier have left a lasting mark on Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years later, the City Council will take up an unlikely byproduct of the 
storms when it decides tonight whether Unocal can reopen an industrial plant at 
Marina Drive and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old plant separates oil and water that is pumped onshore from a 
group of wells off the coast of Seal Beach. It was closed in 1983 when storms 
destroyed the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the wells have been repaired, and Unocal wants to reopen the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who live around the facility oppose the move, fearing the plant 
will flood their neighborhood with toxic emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials deny the operation will create environmental problems, and 
the Planning Commission seemed to agree last year when it approved the 
company's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents appealed the decision to the City Council, which will take up the 
issue tonight in a meeting expected to be long and heated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a heavy industrial site in the middle of a residential neighborhood," 
said John O'Neil, who lives about a block from the plant. "It just doesn't 
belong here. You can't mitigate the location no matter how high you build the 
walls." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil and other residents fear the plant will emit pollution into the air, 
perhaps the equivalent of 150 more cars daily driving through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you have zero air pollution out of the facility," he said. "No 
matter what you do, you are going to have a degradation of the air quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents want the council to at least delay a vote on the project until 
Unocal completes a full environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials said they are willing to provide more data. "Let's do an EIR. 
But let's make sure at the outset that we cover all the topics the residents 
care about," said Unocal spokeswoman Janet McClintock. "We want to be 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies have found that oil-water separation plants do not harm the 
environment, McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of a similar plant in Huntington Beach measured air quality both 
outside the facility and inside nearby homes. It found no change in air quality 
when the plant was operating, McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal held a public meeting on the issue in December, but the company has had 
little luck in convincing some residents of the plant's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't belong in this area," O'Neil said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 20 FAMILIES STAKED TO AFFORDABLE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty low-income families have begun the year house hunting, thanks to a 
$1-million first-time home buyers program administered by Jamboree Housing 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Each family will receive a loan of up to $50,000 to be used as a down payment 
for a house or condominium in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the money, most of them simply couldn't afford a home, said Lila 
Lieberthal, executive director of the nonprofit affordable housing group. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 families were among 125 to participate in a lottery last year to 
determine who would receive the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the program, families must consist of three people or more and 
include at least one child younger than 18. The combined income must be less 
than 72% of Orange County's median income, which means a family of four must 
earn less than $39,700 a year to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal said such families don't earn enough money to qualify for 
conventional home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under program rules, applicants don't have to repay the loan until they sell 
or refinance their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is then used to help another family buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a sense of community to own a home," Lieberthal said. "And once 
they sell it, they give the money back and someone else gets to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Four families already have homes in escrow and Jamboree expects all 20 
applicants to have homes by July. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1 million came from the state Department of Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Irvine recently contributed $30,000 to help Jamboree administrate 
the program and search for additional money for down payments. SHELBY GRAD

WOMEN, CHILDREN ESCAPE BLAZE AT SHELTER FOR ABUSE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already on the run from domestic violence, eight women and six children were 
recovering Sunday after another escape -- this time from a fast-moving blaze 
that ravaged their group shelter in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the accidental fire late Saturday night at the Jenesse 
Center, which has provided a haven to battered women since 1986. But residents 
are suffering the emotional pain of being displaced again, said Bernita 
Walker-Moss, the center's acting executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite traumatic for them. It can be devastating," said Walker-Moss, 
standing in the charred, muddy and waterlogged hallway of the four-bedroom 
building Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire authorities said the blaze began when a resident tossed what she thought 
was an extinguished cigarette into a cardboard packing case that had contained 
a new television set just donated to the center. The still-lit cigarette set 
the box aflame. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter officials routinely ask that its location not be revealed for fear 
that an abusive mate might try to attack the residents or attempt arson. Fire 
investigators "feel quite comfortable" that the cigarette, and not arson, was 
the cause, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross has temporarily housed the women and their children -- 
all under 3 years old -- in a Los Angeles area hotel. Shelter officials would 
not identify any women nor permit reporters to speak with them because of 
confidentiality concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker-Moss said she hopes that the group can be moved from the hotel to 
another house for at least a few weeks until other arrangements are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze began about 11:40 p.m. Saturday and it took 45 firefighters about a 
half an hour to extinguish it, Humphrey said. The one-story wood and stucco 
shelter, which had fire insurance, suffered about $100,000 in damage and 
another $25,000 in equipment was destroyed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations of cash, linens, kitchen equipment, clothing and other household 
furnishings can be mailed to or dropped off at an off-site referral office of 
the Jenesse Center for Victims of Domestic Violence, 8803 S. Broadway, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90003. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross asks that donations be given to any of its local 
chapters' disaster relief funds.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TROUPE TO MAKE TREK IN SUPPORT OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 30 young Orange County performers will soon croon and tap dance 
their way through schools across the nation to encourage students to help keep 
music education from falling prey to budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe is the Young Americans, whose members are 14 to 21. They will 
embark on their second national tour to teach students from fifth grade to 
high-school age the fundamentals of song, dance and acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the parents can see their kids up on stage and see what they can perform 
. . . and what music gives them, that's when we really reach them," said Jason 
Olthoff, 20, a Fullerton College student who has been a member of the Young 
Americans for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group leaves Feb. 4 for a 20-state tour, visiting cities as large as 
Phoenix and as small as Harbor Springs, Mich., population 1,550. 
</P>
<P>
 In each town, the Young Americans conduct a three-day workshop, teaching as 
many as 500 students 45 different songs and routines, including rock, hip hop, 
choir music and ballet, said Young Americans founder Milton Anderson. The 
students then perform a variety show together with the Young Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 They pay a $30 fee to join the workshop and are eager to begin learning music, 
but sometimes their most valuable lesson has nothing to do with song, Olthoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in Muskegon, Mich., Olthoff said, white and black students at first 
divided themselves into separate groups to learn their routines. But after 
working on a show for three days, the groups dissolved, he said: "Everyone 
mixed and . . . the barriers came right down. It's just a transformation that's 
really neat to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Young American Tyson Garner, 20, a former athlete at Garden Grove High School, 
said he also noticed that the boys in the classes began to realize that "you 
can still be masculine" even if you are singing and dancing on stage. In fact, 
"girls like that," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Music teachers also were inspired to support their music programs after seeing 
the enthusiasm of their students, said performer Becky Phelps, 18, of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of the schools, it was the last year of their music program," Phelps 
said. The teachers said they would "try harder to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson founded the Young Americans 32 years ago. In addition to promoting a 
positive image of young people, Anderson said, his mission has expanded to 
keeping music in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you end up teaching just math and science, you're going to end up with 
people who are less feeling," he said. MARY LOU PICKEL

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has become the stuff of movie mythology: A trench coat-clad Humphrey Bogart 
bidding farewell to beautiful Ingrid Bergman from the mist-enshrouded airport 
in Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Airport, where the scene of the airplane lifting off triumphantly for 
Lisbon was filmed -- and later spliced with sound-stage footage of the lovers 
saying goodby -- still exists in the heart of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1928 from 80 acres of walnut and peach groves by a group of 
businessmen, it was incorporated and named Los Angeles Metropolitan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Earhart set a new speed record after taking off from the airport in 
1929. That same year, Bobbi Trout, Earhart's friend and competitor, completed a 
12-hour record-setting solo endurance flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But within a few years, the airport's builders went broke and it passed into 
the hands of a woman named Drusilla Daily Warner in payment for a debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, it was the location for films such as "Lost Horizon" with Ronald 
Colman and Jane Wyatt, and "Test Pilot" with Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Spencer 
Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's grandson, Dean Daily, inherited the property after her death. The 
remote little airstrip with a 3,000-foot runway became home to stunt pilots in 
biplanes. One of them was aviatrix Pancho Barnes, who later became den mother 
to the record-breaking jet pilots at Edwards Air Force Base. Barnes also worked 
as a mechanic there. 
</P>
<P>
 As Barnes fought celluloid villains in the sky over Sherman Way, Daily raised 
banana squash between the runways to make ends meet. When he wasn't farming, he 
soothed the ruffled feathers of the surrounding chicken farmers, who complained 
that the noise from the planes annoyed the hens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, everything changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The airfield was seized by the Army for military use. Civilian flying was 
banned. Daily and his wife, who had flown to Palm Springs on the day of the 
raid, were stranded and had to truck their plane back to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army began buying up hundreds of surrounding acres to build Van Nuys Army 
Air Field, a training base for pilots of Lockheed's P-38 fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, the government succeeded in taking over the property, 
eventually giving Daily 50 acres of land and $200,000 in settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, the city of Los Angeles acquired the airport from the War Assets 
Administration for a token payment of $1, with the condition that it remain the 
home of a California Air National Guard unit until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the late 1940s, it was envisioned as a base for Air Force 
fighter planes to defend against a feared attack by Soviet-piloted bombers from 
Siberia. To provide the space needed by early jet fighters, a runway was 
extended south from Saticoy Street to Vanowen Street. To avoid blocking busy 
Sherman Way, the street was routed into a tunnel under the runway, which is 
still in use. But by the time hundreds of homes had been razed and the 
expansion completed, the defense role was taken over by Nike anti-aircraft 
missiles, leaving the airport with an extraordinarily long runway for a general 
aviation field, an unintended legacy of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 It was christened Van Nuys Airport in 1957, when it once again became home to 
flight schools, private aircraft and crop-dusting operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years passed, the community of Van Nuys grew and surrounded the field 
with homes. When the Guard's lease expired, the city of Los Angeles threatened 
to raise the rent from $1 a year to $1 million. The Guard moved to Point Mugu 
in April, 1990, leaving a 63-acre base -- complete with a multistory office 
building, hangars, workshops and barracks -- at the northwest corner of the 
field that remains vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 And movies still get made there, often attracted by the military look of the 
abandoned Air Guard base. The airport has been featured in "The Last Action 
Hero," "Toys," "The Bodyguard," "Forever Young," "In the Line of Fire" and "For 
the Boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Van Nuys Airport ranks as the busiest general aviation airport in the 
nation. More than 850 private aircraft call it home, and more than 1,500 
takeoffs and landings occur daily. The 725-acre airport grounds include a 
restaurant, hotel, golf course, fire station and flight schools. About 8,700 
people work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The squash fields have long since disappeared, and the chicken farmers have 
been replaced by local residents, who also complain about the noise. CECILIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; KNOTT'S IS ROOT OF ALL BOYSENBERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All of those plump, juicy, dark red boysenberries in the world can be traced 
to their roots in Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 years ago, theme park founder and farmer Walter Knott was always 
looking for crops he could grow better than other farmers, said Patsy Marshall, 
Knott's historian. 
</P>
<P>
 And the boysenberry, a cross between a loganberry, red raspberry and 
blackberry, became Knott's Berry Farm's claim to fame -- in pies, jams and 
jellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott became associated with the boysenberry back in 1932 after Rudolph 
Boysen, who was parks superintendent for Anaheim, had experimented with a new 
type of berry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the berries weren't growing well and were dying on the vine, Marshall 
said. Knott was intrigued with the new strain of berry and offered to take in 
the scraggly plants, nursing them back to health, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tribute to the berry's originator, Knott named it after Boysen. 
</P>
<P>
 Boysenberries are the largest of all berries, averaging 1 1/2 to 2 inches in 
length and 1 inch in diameter. DEBRA CANO

 Westminster Police Lt. Richard Main said Chris Maghdessian died of head 
injuries at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 His father had been backing out of the driveway in the 8100 block of 19th

CHP CLOSES LANES ON RIVERSIDE FREEWAY AFTER SLUDGE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol closed off the eastbound lanes on the Riverside 
Freeway on Sunday night between Brookhurst Road and Magnolia Avenue and 
diverted traffic to southbound Interstate 5 after a truck spilled 79,000 pounds 
of sludge. 
</P>
<P>
 The lanes were closed off at about 10 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill came about an hour after the CHP had to close off the southbound 
lanes on Interstate 5 at Camino de Estrella in San Clemente after a pedestrian 
was struck and killed. The lanes were reopened a half-hour later.

 A South-Central Los Angeles man went on an apparent drug-induced rampage 
Sunday, attacking his grandfather and biting and nearly smothering his 2 
1/2-year-old son, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said that when they arrived at the home they found Dwayne Johnson, 
24, yelling incoherently and lying on the toddler.Johnson's 73-year-old 
grandfather was stretched across the doorway with his head bleeding. 
</P>

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeff Hostetler and James Jett and Jeff Gossett

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders sure picked a good day to find a knockout punch and score more 
than 40 points in a game for the first time since 1984. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was a case of the Mountaineers -- Jeff Hostetler and James Jett from West 
Virginia -- beating the Rocky Mountaineers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you like touchdowns, passing, fights, noise and penalties, the Raiders' 
42-24 victory over the Denver Broncos was your thing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't underestimate the importance of the punting game -- the Raiders' Jeff 
Gossett was terrific, the Broncos' Tom Rouen lousy during the decisive third 
quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember when the Raiders used to fall apart after halftime? They outscored 
Denver, 41-6, in second halves and an overtime the last two weeks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that the Raiders' good fortune against the Broncos at the Coliseum 
might be ending when defensive tackle Chester McGlockton suffered a broken leg 
on Denver's first scrimmage play. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders set a playoff record with 15 penalties, but were lucky not to draw 
an unsportsmanlike-conduct call when inactive cornerback James Trapp, dressed 
in street clothes, ran onto the field and fought the Broncos' Frank Robinson in 
the second quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former USC president John Hubbard once was assessed a 15-yard penalty merely 
for protesting a call during a Trojan-Hawaii game in Honolulu. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In honor of Jeff (Hoss) Hostetler, the Raider band often played the theme from 
"Bonanza." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This was the 23rd consecutive time that the team committing the fewest number 
of turnovers won an NFL playoff game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is testimony to John Elway's scrambling abilities that he was sacked only 
once in two weeks at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those who cheered the appearance of a paraglider over the stadium during the 
first quarter must not have been in Las Vegas the night the same genius flew 
into the ropes at the Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe fight and endangered many 
lives. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Despite their biggest scoring explosion since a 45-24 victory at Miami in 
December of 1984, the Raiders (11-6) have been outscored, 350-348, this season. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dennis Green might have taken the momentum away from the Minnesota 
Vikings when he allowed the New York Giants to have the all-important wind 
advantage at the start of the third quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Attention, Al Davis: Mark Collins, the Giant cornerback from Cal State 
Fullerton who played well despite a bad knee, will become an unrestricted free 
agent and wants to leave New York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Lions ought to try a new tactic the next time a game against the 
Green Bay Packers is on the line: Cover Sterling Sharpe. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That layoff sure hurt Barry Sanders, didn't it? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with Emmitt Smith, but I would love to see what Sanders 
could do behind the Dallas Cowboys' line. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It might bode well for the Kansas City Chiefs that they were able to beat the 
Pittsburgh Steelers on an off-day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those campaigning for a return to instant-replay review should present as 
exhibit A the tape of the incomplete pass that was ruled complete and set up 
Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery's 43-yard miss late in regulation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One reason the New York Jets fired Bruce Coslet and replaced him with 
defensive coordinator Pete Carroll is that they were afraid Carroll would take 
another head coaching job. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you think the Lakers are bad, you haven't seen the Clippers lately. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 College basketball is a wonderful sport except when it is turned into 
whistleball by officials such as Richie Ballesteros, Jerry White, and Steve 
Wilson, who called 53 fouls during the USC-Oregon game on Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As demonstrated against Oregon State, UCLA is a much better team when point 
guard Tyus Edney is at full strength. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the Kings had traded Jimmy Carson earlier instead of sitting him down and 
reducing his value, they probably would have gotten more than Vancouver forward 
Dixon Ward and a draft choice in return. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This shows you what happens when the coach, Barry Melrose, and team 
executives, president Roy Mlakar and General Manager Nick Beverley, aren't 
often on the same page. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pity the Mighty Ducks, who must play 13 of their next 17 games at home. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sports person of the week: Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, who showed uncommon 
maturity by skating to a second-place finish in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships and applauding the decision to send Nancy Kerrigan, instead, to 
the Winter Olympics. Jeff Hostetler and James Jett and Jeff Gossett

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; ATTACK SHOCKING, BUT KERRIGAN SAYS THERE ARE 
WORSE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Observations, reflections and things learned during the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships that ended Saturday night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- I'm sure everyone felt sorry for Nancy Kerrigan, who arrived last week 
looking and sounding like the Olympic champion she still hopes to become next 
month in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 But I also felt sorry for Benny Napoleon, Detroit's Deputy Chief of Police, 
who showed up at the press center periodically after the assault on Kerrigan 
Thursday to assure reporters from across the nation that solving the crime was 
a high priority for new Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Detroit was No. 2 in the nation in murders per capita in 
1993, I wondered if Napoleon resented all the attention being given a woman who 
was whacked on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead sports headline in a local newspaper Saturday was "The Day After," as 
if there had been a nuclear attack on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kerrigan appeared embarrassed by it. "People are killed and robbed and 
hurt every day," she said Saturday night. "It's just that I'm in the 
spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reporters often joke about all the figure skaters who repeat, as if it were 
a mantra, "I just want to stay focused." But we're not the only ones who 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the mood of the skaters after the Kerrigan incident, event 
director Richard Dalley told the Detroit Free Press: "One would think there 
would be fear, but I'm amazed. I've been in Joe Louis Arena for virtually 24 
hours nonstop since Nancy was attacked, and it is not affecting the athletes. 
It's not the buzz behind the scene. These are very focused people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Rosenberg, the agent for 1992 Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko, 
called his client in Odessa, Ukraine, to inform him about Kerrigan. "You 
forget, Michael," Petrenko told him, "we have CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the impact of last week on Kerrigan's popularity, Rosenberg joked: "She 
went from an A-minus superstar to a spectacular superstar with one whack." 
Seriously, he said that if she wins the gold medal she will be "Dorothy Hamill, 
Peggy Fleming and Katarina Witt rolled into one." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Boitano is the world's best figure skater. If he wants to win the 
Olympic gold medal, it is time he started acting like it.  
</P>
<P>
 After talking so much about how nervous he has been since returning to 
competition at this level, he no longer is intimidating to the other skaters, 
especially Scott Davis, who upset his idol last week for the men's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Boitano so nervous about? He has the edge in maturity, experience, 
power and sophistication. He should step into the arena like he owns it. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think John Elway takes over the ball at his own one-yard line with 
less than two minutes to play and says: "I'm so nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of football, the end of the Kansas City-Pittsburgh playoff game 
was on television in the press room at the conclusion of Saturday afternoon's 
pairs competition.  
</P>
<P>
 If figure skating judges had been deciding the outcome of that game, they 
would have ruled that Nick Lowery's errant 43-yard field-goal attempt at the 
end of regulation was good because they have seen him make that kick so often 
in practice and because they think Kansas City would be a better AFC 
representative in the next round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to be the judges' rationale in awarding Karen Courtland and Todd 
Reynolds third place ahead of Natasha Kuchiki and Rocky Marval. Courtland and 
Reynolds might be better skaters, but that was not the case Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calla Urbanski, who formerly paired with Marval, announced her retirement 
at age 33 Saturday after finishing seventh with new partner Joe Mero. 
</P>
<P>
 While she and Marval were en route to two national championships and an 
Olympic berth in 1992, they became known endearingly as the waitress and the 
truck driver. But it was not a smooth ride for Marval, whose ears are still 
hurting from the not entirely constructive criticism he took from her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will never get as bad with Natasha as on my best day with Calla," he 
said. "That was a constant nightmare. When we split last July, I said, 'Let's 
part as friends.' She said, 'Why? We're just acquaintances.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carlo and Christa Fassi, who coached Fleming, Hamill and Britain's Robin 
Cousins to Olympic gold medals while headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
are returning to the United States in May after three years in their native 
Italy to tutor at Lake Arrowhead's International Ice Castles Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
 That will give the Ice Castles an imposing coaching staff. Already at Lake 
Arrowhead are Frank Carroll, who coached Linda Fratianne and Christopher 
Bowman, and Irina Rodnina, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fassis are leaving behind a son, who wants to remain in Italy, but Carlo 
wants to be closer to two married daughters who live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see my kids grow up because I was always away for competitions," 
Carlo said. "Now, I can watch my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent coaches in the same rink sometimes lock horns, but he foresees no 
problems. "I'm too old to start fighting," he said. "I hope all of our egos are 
already satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carroll coaches the up-and-coming star of U.S. figure skating, Michelle 
Kwan of Torrance, who finished second to Tonya Harding in the women's 
competition Saturday night as a 13-year-old. What do Harding and Kwan have in 
common? Both are financially supported by George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Onlookers from CBS, who will televise the Feb. 12-27 Winter Olympics from 
Norway, said they were concerned during the 1992 Games that they were 
televising too much figure skating. "Now," one said, referring to the high 
ratings for the sport, "we realize there is no such thing as too much figure 
skating."

PROMISES TO KEEP; PATTI TATE LEADS A JUSTICE CRUSADE IN THE NAME OF HER SISTER 
SHARON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patti Tate is thinking back. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the summer of '69, and she's got her hands on her sister's stomach, 
feeling the baby inside kick. She was 11 years old then and her 26-year-old 
sister, actress Sharon Tate, was two weeks away from having her first baby. But 
on a hot August night, followers of Charles Manson killed seven people, 
including Sharon Tate, who was repeatedly stabbed as she pleaded for her life 
and that of her unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister was everything to me," said Tate, 36. "She was so sweet and such a 
gentle soul. She was a movie star and beautiful, and in my eyes she was just so 
big. There wasn't anything I wouldn't have done for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years later, there still isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For her sister, Patti Tate has launched a national boycott against Geffen 
Records after Guns N' Roses, which records on the Geffen label, refused to 
remove a song written by Manson from its new album, "The Spaghetti Incident?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said the record company "is putting Manson up on a pedestal for young 
people who don't know who he is to worship like an idol." She and other members 
of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau are asking people to write and fax 
letters of protest to Geffen Records as well as to phone the record company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Rosenblatt, Geffen Records president, has told The Times that the company 
"would have preferred that the song wasn't on the album, but given our belief 
in freedom of speech as well as the clear restraints of our legal agreements 
with the band, it is not our decision to make. That decision belongs solely to 
Guns N' Roses. We genuinely regret the distress the situation has caused." 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen Records has said neither Manson nor Guns N' Roses will collect any 
money from the song, and royalties will be funneled to the son of one of 
Manson's victims and to various environmental and crime-victim organizations. 
But that doesn't satisfy Tate, who three weeks ago faced Geffen executives in a 
private meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing came out of it," she said, "but it was necessary for me to sit down 
with them, face to face and ask them, 'Do you realize what you are creating 
here?' This isn't about whether or not Manson is making money or who is making 
money. This is about Manson still profiting by becoming a cult hero, an idol to 
a lot of young kids out there who will buy the album. And that's where violence 
and crime is hitting us the worst right now, with our kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go in there and state exactly where I stood and that I would 
continue on with the boycott. I needed to touch them with my story, with my 
sister's story, with her memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her life, Tate, a friendly, soft-spoken woman, has fought to keep 
the memory of her sister alive because "you don't want people to forget what 
Manson and his cult did and what others like them are capable of doing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping Sharon's memory alive keeps this senseless tragedy alive in the minds 
of many. We can't go around thinking that 'this won't happen to me, it only 
happens to other people,' because one day it's going to hit home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that one out of every four people in California (is) going to be 
a victim of a serious crime: murder, rape, mayhem. We are all going to be 
touched by crime eventually, and it is going to get worse unless we start 
making our officials start changing some laws, like stiffer penalties for 
criminals, and laws that protect and give us, the victims, rights also." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also for her sister that Tate crusades for justice on behalf of crime 
victims, through the efforts of the nonprofit Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau 
in Sacramento. The bureau, which advocates passage of legislation for victims 
and their rights, was founded in 1992 by Doris Tate, who helped forge the crime 
victims' movement nationwide after her daughter Sharon's murder. Doris Tate 
died in July, 1992, from a brain tumor at the age of 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Tate was at her mother's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised my mom before she died that I would continue on. This got started 
because it was her dream to pull together all the victims' groups to make a 
difference in government and so that we can all stand united," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate also promised her mother that she would stay on top of any information 
regarding her sister's murderers, who also killed wealthy grocer Leno LaBianca 
and his wife, Rosemary, the night after Sharon Tate was stabbed and hanged Aug. 
9, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Patti Tate attended the hearing for Patricia Krenwinkel, a 
member of the Manson gang up for parole for the 11th time from the California 
Institution for Women in Frontera. Sitting at a small table facing Krenwinkel, 
46, convicted in seven of the Manson cult slayings, Tate told authorities why 
once again the woman should be denied her freedom. (Leslie Van Houten was up 
for parole for the 10th time, but Tate said she was not allowed to speak at 
that hearing because Van Houten was convicted only of conspiring to kill Tate, 
not of the murder.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tate directed her words to Krenwinkel's attorney, the district attorney and 
three commissioners on the state Board of Prison Terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them Krenwinkel's crime, alone, was enough for her to stay in prison 
for the rest of her life. I told them my sister will be in her grave and 
Krenwinkel and the other Manson followers should be in prison for the rest of 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said she told the group: "I knew and loved my sister. I remember her 
face. Could (Krenwinkel) remember what she looked like? I remember what my 
sister looked like in life and I've seen the pictures of what she and the 
others who were brutally murdered looked like after they got done with them. It 
was so savage. It was as if the murderers couldn't get enough. They had an 
insatiable appetite. How can you trust someone like this? We have a society 
that will not accept them. They could end up being your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women were denied parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said she will attend future parole hearings "to speak for my sister, to 
be the voice that they took away from her, to stand up for her rights, which 
she can no longer stand up for. It's hard, real hard because every emotion 
comes out of you. You're mad, sad -- everything just comes out and you have to 
sit there and listen to how well they are doing, how they've gotten their 
college degrees, how they have received all kinds of help to make them better 
people. And I just want to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that 'oh, they won't get out of jail,' when in fact they can get 
out of jail. That's why I tell people all the time that we have to know what is 
going on at the capital and what needs to be changed. We need to start paying 
attention to our elected officials and how they are voting. Are they working 
for us? Are they going to be tough on crime? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so passionate about this because I feel that people are ready to make a 
change as long as they have the means to know that they can make a difference. 
We all have to be fighters." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said she gets her fighting spirit from her mother, who took her campaign 
inside prison walls, talking to inmates about the effect that crime has on 
victims, their families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a real fighter, and she had such a voice at those parole hearings. 
But she never got over my sister's death. Over the last 24 years, I have seen 
her agony. The most painful thing for me was to watch my parents grieve, to 
watch their hurt and know their hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my mom was alive, I couldn't help her or my father with their sadness. 
As a young child, I saw all that and realized that there was so much I couldn't 
do. You want so much to help, but how do you help someone who is grieving so? 
Just by loving them. And you hope and pray and wish that nobody ever has to go 
through that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She is thinking back again to the summer of '69, remembering her excitement at 
being reunited with Sharon, who had just moved from London to Southern 
California. Patti, her sister Debbie and their mother had moved to Los Angeles 
from San Francisco to be closer to Sharon. Patti said they hadn't spent much 
time with Sharon because of the actress's busy work schedule and her life 
abroad with director Roman Polanski. Tate's father, who was in Army then, had 
remained in San Francisco to tie up the loose ends before joining his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all moved back to California so we could be together and because we 
were preparing for this child," Tate recalled. "I have fond memories of those 
days, of spending time with my sister, who I loved and adored." 
</P>
<P>
 But then came word that would devastate the Tate family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a call early in the morning that something had happened up on Benedict 
Canyon where Sharon lived. We knew that something was wrong up there, but 
everything was very vague. Then came the reality that everybody up there was 
dead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my mom saying that Sharon was dead and she collapsed on the floor. 
My dad was still up in San Francisco, and my sister (Debbie) and I had to call 
him at the Army base and tell him that Sharon was dead. He flew down and went 
straight to the house and identified the bodies. That's how that day went," she 
says, pausing for several seconds. "Hell. And hell continued for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get angry anymore," she said, adding that she just wants to fight and 
focus on making positive changes for victims and the families of victims "who 
virtually have no rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like to experience the effects of crime. Along with being a 
victim comes a lot of paranoia. Your personality changes, you become more 
skeptical, overprotective of your children and not trusting. It's a wave that 
gets bigger and bigger. The effects are passed on to the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, who lives with her family in Southern California, is guarded about 
discussing her personal and professional life. "I have to be real careful," she 
said. "I do work, but I don't want to say more than that. There is still a huge 
threat out there. My life has been threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, she forges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so strongly and my family has always felt so strongly that nothing 
will be accomplished if you just sit down and don't do anything," she said, 
which is why, as a board member of the Crime Victims Bureau, she helps monitor 
how elected officials vote on public safety and victims' rights legislation and 
brings statewide crime-victims organizations together. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is currently gathering signatures on petitions to qualify a "three 
strikes, you're out' initiative, which would mandate a life prison term without 
parole for thrice-convicted serious felons, for a statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to help each other by talking and listening," she said. "We all 
have the power to be a part of the healing process."

STRUGGLING TO STAY TOGETHER; ACTIVISM: GROUPS FORMED AFTER CHILD KIDNAPINGS AND 
MURDERS FREQUENTLY FADE AWAY AFTER A FEW YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 They are born in tragedy and nurtured on grief, frustration and anger. Their 
names are a roll call of children who have disappeared or died at the hands of 
strangers: the Kevin Collins Foundation, the Heidi Search Center, the Adam 
Walsh Center, the Jacob Wetterling Foundation, the Amber Foundation -- and now 
the Polly Klaas Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, more than a hundred such organizations have sprouted up in 
the wake of highly publicized child kidnapings and murders, and they are 
perhaps the most prolific of the so-called victims' rights groups. More are 
created every year as other children -- an estimated 3,200 to 4,600 yearly -- 
become victims of kidnaping by strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 All the groups start out in much the same way: a child disappears, and scores 
or hundreds or even thousands of volunteers turn out to help in the search. 
Because of the circumstances of the kidnaping or just plain luck, the case 
attracts extensive local, regional or -- as with the Klaas case -- national 
media attention. Sometimes the child is never found; sometimes the child is 
found dead. In the aftermath, the parents or the volunteers form a nonprofit 
group to try to "do something" about child abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much intensity put into a search that there has to be an outlet 
for it," says Rick Benningfield, operations director for the Heidi Search 
Center in San Antonio, Tex., a "child find" group named after 11-year-old Heidi 
Seeman, kidnaped in San Antonio in August, 1990, and later found dead. "Even 
after the body is found, it's emotionally difficult to call off the search. 
Then you look around and you see that there's a need for an organization to 
help deal with the problem. So you keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these organizations are formed out of personal loss," says Judi 
Sadowsky, executive director of L.A.-based Find the Children, a missing child 
assistance center founded in 1983. "When a child is missing, the frustration is 
so great that parents and families often feel the emotional need to get 
involved in starting an organization. Usually these are ordinary people who've 
been thrust into an extraordinary situation. Some can rise to it, and some 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the groups fade away after a couple of years. Although no one keeps 
track of all the child victim organizations nationwide, people in the field 
estimate that at least half the groups formed in the wake of a child 
disappearance in the past 10 years have closed their doors as the money dried 
up and volunteers moved on. Others remain as not much more than numbers for 
phones that may or may not be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the groups that survive find that usually there comes a time when the 
attention -- and thus the money and volunteers -- shifts to another tragedy 
involving a kidnaped child. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it depends on how committed the parents and the volunteers are to 
continuing the work," says Julie Cartwright of the National Center for Missing 
and Exploited Children in Arlington, Va., a national clearinghouse for 
information and programs involving missing children. "It takes all your time, 
and all your emotional energy, and every new case (of a kidnaped child) reopens 
the wound. Often it's difficult to keep up the momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some groups manage to continue long after the tragedy that created 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary French, president of the fledgling Polly Klaas Foundation, is certain 
that his organization will be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's been just more than a month since the body of 12-year-old Polly Klaas was 
found, nine weeks after she was abducted from a pajama party at her home in 
Petaluma near San Francisco. But the emotional adrenaline of the case lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Polly Klaas Foundation, a 6,000-square-foot office in a shopping center 
across the street from the Petaluma police station, the phones still ring off 
the hook, hundreds of volunteers still put in long hours, donations still pour 
in -- as much as $500,000 so far. The foundation board of directors, which 
includes Polly's parents, is formulating plans for legislative and educational 
programs to "make America safe for children." The national media still call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to taper off," French, 48, says confidently. "Of all those 
other (child victim) organizations that came before, none has had the national 
and international visibility that we have had. It gives us capabilities that 
they simply didn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some stumbles. The first head of the foundation resigned after 
it was disclosed that he had been convicted of a sex crime involving minors in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, members of other child find groups, a number of whom assisted in the 
Polly search, say privately that the unprecedented media attention in the Klaas 
case has created arrogance among some Klaas Foundation organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're walking around acting like a bunch of movie stars," says the director 
of one long-established missing child foundation, who declined to be quoted by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about arrogance on our part," French responds. "I know we're 
aware of the tremendous power and influence we have. . . . As far as all of it 
going to our heads, what's gone to our heads is the ability to make significant 
changes to benefit every kid, and every missing kid, in this country. That's 
what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, the Klaas Foundation organizers believe that their 
group will not only survive but prosper. They believe that it may even surpass 
in scope the most successful of the child victim organizations, the Adam Walsh 
Child Resource Center in Florida, which has three other regional branches, 
including one in Orange County. (The group is named after 6-year-old Adam 
Walsh, who was abducted and murdered in Florida in 1981; the case became the 
basis for the 1983 TV film "Adam.") 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years, French predicts, "I think we could be one of the premier 
providers of services to children in this country." 
</P>

<P>
 As a man committed to saving children, 54-year-old David Collins wishes the 
Polly Klaas Foundation well -- in fact, he spent many hours as a volunteer 
during the search for Polly. But he also knows that there almost certainly will 
come a time when the phones at the Polly Klaas Center won't ring as often, a 
time when the group may have to fight for funding, a time when they may be 
begging the national media for interviews instead of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins knows because he's been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month will mark 10 years since Collins' son, 10-year-old Kevin Collins, 
was abducted from a street corner near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. In 
the beginning, it was much the same as the Klaas case. Within a week almost a 
thousand volunteers had showed up to help in the search; the search center, 
situated in space donated by a local church, was frantic with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin's face was on the cover of Newsweek magazine. Donations poured in. Other 
parents of missing children started calling, and within a few months, Collins 
had set up the Kevin Collins Foundation for Missing Children, dedicated to 
preventing "stranger abductions" of children (as opposed to the far more 
prevalent "family abductions" of children by a non-custody parent). 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin was never found. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a decade later, the Kevin Collins Foundation operates out of a 
3,000-square-foot "boiler room" in the San Francisco Tenderloin District. About 
five volunteers continue to help on a weekly basis. The foundation's annual 
budget, about $95,000, is a little more than half what it once was. Collins, 
the foundation president, earns about $11,000 a year as the group's only paid 
staff member. One of the group's most recent statewide media exposures was a 
wire service report that the foundation was closing its doors -- a report 
denied by Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired, but I'm not dejected," says Collins, who is resigned to the idea 
that his son is probably dead. "(The foundation is) going to be here until 
we're not needed any more." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has accomplished a great deal. It has offered support to scores of 
parents of missing children; sent response teams to assist in numerous child 
disappearances; distributed millions of flyers of missing children -- Kevin 
included -- and pushed for laws to aggressively track and more severely punish 
child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Collins admits that sometimes it is difficult to keep up the momentum, 
both in raising funds and in attracting volunteers -- not only for his group 
but for others in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen all kinds of groups spring up in the past 10 years and then a year 
later they're gone," Collins says. "Sometimes it's hard to keep going." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Money's the real problem," says Kim Swartz, 36, of the Amber Foundation for 
Missing Children in Pinole, Calif. "I can't tell you how many times we've sat 
up at night thinking, 'Are we going to have to close our doors tomorrow?' 
Fortunately, it seems like a miracle always happens and we keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Swartz is the mother of Amber Swartz, an 8-year-old girl kidnaped in Pinole in 
June, 1988. She has not been seen since. For Swartz, whose police officer 
husband was killed in the line of duty while she was pregnant with Amber, the 
child's disappearance, and trying to keep the foundation alive, has been an 
emotional roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "For days and days after (Amber's disappearance), there were crowds of 
volunteers at the command center," Swartz recalls. "There were just hundreds of 
people, and you're at the center of it. Your whole life becomes an open book, 
and sometimes you just want to be somebody else.  
</P>
<P>
 "It brings out all kinds of people, the good and the bad. I got calls from 
people who would tell me what they were doing to my daughter right at that 
moment. The vast majority of the volunteers were wonderful, caring people, but 
some strange people show up on your doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amber Foundation, which assists in child search operations and distributes 
missing child information, operates with a small, $25,000 annual budget and a 
core group of about a dozen volunteers. There are no paid staff members. Swartz 
also is working to create the American Missing and Exploited Children 
Organization, an umbrella association for missing child foundations like hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be a way for us to all work together," Swartz says. "The way 
it is now, every time a child is missing and people want to organize a group, 
you wind up reinventing the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high rate of burnout," says Patty Wetterling, 44, a founder and 
board member of the Jacob Wetterling Foundation. "You don't have a very high 
success rate in terms of finding a child, so it's easy to become discouraged. 
And if another child is kidnaped, many of those caring people who volunteer 
move on to that one." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been more than four years since Wetterling's then-11-year-old son, Jacob, 
was kidnaped by an armed, masked man half a mile from Jerry and Patty 
Wetterling's home in St. Joseph, Minn., a small town of 3,000 about 85 miles 
northwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Despite a $200,000 reward, the efforts of 
hundreds of volunteers, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of flyers 
bearing Jacob's picture and a lot of national media attention, he has not been 
seen since. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the foundation, which emphasizes education to prevent child abductions 
and has fought for a national convicted child molester registration act, has an 
annual budget of about $188,000, a full-time staff of three -- including Patty 
Wetterling, who is not paid -- and a core of about 20 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would encourage parents (of missing children) to get involved in the issue, 
but I'm not sure I would encourage parents to start a foundation," Wetterling 
says. "It's very difficult, emotionally and organizationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she adds, "I do gain some strength from working to help other 
children. It gives me a way to put energy into something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I never give up hope that Jacob will be found."

 "Dear Diary. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping a journal can help kids explore their thoughts and feelings better 
than just cruising through each day without pausing to ponder. And, in time, 
those diaries can become treasured museums of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 These books may inspire kids to put pen to paper: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Book of Your Own: Keeping a Diary or Journal" by Carla Stevens (Clarion, 
$7.95 paper, $14.95 cloth, 100 pages, ages 9 and up) is not as how-to as it 
sounds. Stevens uses excerpts to show you can write whatever and whenever you 
want. Tucked between paragraphs by Henry David Thoreau and Anne Frank are 
journal entries by Stevens' friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Private and Personal Reading Journal," a 16-page booklet for ages 7 to 
12, can be ordered for $3.50 from publisher R.R. Bowker at (800) 521-8110. It 
gives kids plenty of space to write about books they have read -- just for fun. 
No stilted book reports, please. There are quotes and poems sprinkled 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much fun can be found in "My Pet's First Book: All About My Pet . . . by 
Me," by Shagg E. Dawg, Ph.D, edited by Peter Guren (Watermill Press, $2.50, 48 
pages, ages 6 and up). In addition to spaces for photos, drawings and an 
envelope to hold a lock of hair, some scales or a feather from a pet, there are 
places to record visits to the vet, the pet's favorite toys and "things your 
pet got in trouble for . . . add extra pages if necessary."

<P>
 The Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization started in 1992, 
is dedicated to improving public safety and helping the victims of crime and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau, with chapters in San Rafael and San Diego, opened its headquarters 
in West Sacramento in July, 1993.It is named after the late victims' rights 
crusader Doris Tate, whose daughter, Sharon, was murdered in 1969 by members of 
the Charles Manson family. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau works primarily with other crime-victims groups statewide to 
advocate passage of legislation affecting victims and their rights, says Patti 
Tate, a board member and sister of Sharon Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 Members, including the bureau's board of directors and advisory board, also 
monitor how elected officials vote on public safety and victims' rights 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau also conducts legal research on behalf of victims and their 
families, alerts citizens and elected officials to the escalating costs of 
crime and violence, and brings together crime victims groups throughout the 
state to coordinate their efforts and increase their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about the bureau may be obtained by calling (800) 784-2846.

CLINTON SEEKS MORE PRIVATE FUNDING FOR INNER CITIES; URBAN CENTERS: 
ADMINISTRATION OFFERS INCENTIVES. IT ALSO WIELDS THE THREAT OF REGULATORY 
PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasing the flow of private investment to America's inner cities is 
emerging as the cornerstone of the Clinton Administration's strategy for 
revitalizing depressed urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the government, at least half a dozen major initiatives are being 
pursued with a common objective of attracting more capital from banks, pension 
funds, insurance companies and private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is dangling several carrots for investors, including tax 
incentives for companies that invest in designated urban "empowerment zones" 
and federal seed money for a nationwide network of new community lending 
institutions. But it is also brandishing a potentially big stick in the form of 
stepped-up regulatory and legal pressure on banks and insurance companies to 
make more services available in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is incumbent that we find a way to build a bridge between the variety of 
sources of capital and the needs of our communities," said Nicolas P. Retsinas, 
assistant secretary for housing at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 This focus on attracting private capital fits several of President Clinton's 
broad policy and political goals. At a time of fiscal strain, it allows the 
Administration to supplement limited federal expenditures on cities with 
private dollars. And it reflects Clinton's priority on bottom-up development, 
which attempts to enhance inner-city stability by bolstering community 
institutions and increasing the number of homeowners and small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 While the emphasis on encouraging private investment and homeownership echoes 
the themes of Clinton's Republican predecessors, his emerging strategy 
envisions a more assertive government role. 
</P>
<P>
 That role is evident in the pressure on banks to provide capital and the 
proposed creation of complementary public initiatives on job training, 
vocational education, crime prevention and, eventually, welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like its disappointing predecessors over the last quarter of a century, 
this latest attempt at urban renewal raises the question of whether any 
combination of carrots and sticks can reverse such corrosive long-term trends 
as the decline of inner-city manufacturing jobs and the rise of out-of-wedlock 
births and violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until our streets are safe, all the capital in the world won't save our 
neighborhoods," said Paul Herdeg, executive director of the Union-Miles 
Development Corp., a group working to redevelop a low-income community in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials readily agree that private investment alone will not 
revive depressed inner-city neighborhoods. But they tend to reverse the 
equation, maintaining that all their other urban reform initiatives "will 
founder unless there is sufficient financial capital to mobilize the human 
capital and modernize the physical capital," as Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate, Clinton stressed the link between private investment and urban 
revival after touring South-Central Los Angeles with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles) after the 1992 riot. After meeting with community activists in Waters' 
home, Clinton said residents were looking for local economic development, not 
expensive new federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't enable people to borrow the money to get into business in the 
neighborhoods where they live . . . it's going to be hard to have any 
fundamental change," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton's arrival in Washington, that sentiment inspired an array of 
activities. Because many involve obscure changes in federal banking or housing 
policy, they have largely escaped notice. But experts said they represent 
efforts to tap for inner-city investment virtually every major source of 
private wealth in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key initiatives: 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones -- Under provisions of the budget bill passed last summer, 
firms that hire residents in six urban and three rural areas designated as 
"empowerment zones" will receive a 20% tax credit on the first $15,000 they pay 
in wages. The bill also establishes 65 smaller "enterprise communities" that 
can offer much more limited tax breaks. In addition, the Small Business 
Administration is slated to announce at least 10 "one-stop capital shops" that 
will attempt to substantially increase distribution of federal loans in these 
targeted communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensions -- At the Labor Department, Olena Berg, the assistant secretary who 
regulates the nation's huge private pension system, has been aggressively 
urging fund managers to invest more of their $4 trillion in assets in 
affordable housing, urban development and other economically targeted 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the flow of pension dollars into such activities has been 
limited by fund managers' fears of violating federal standards for prudent 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to make sure the community out there broadly knows, as long as 
you do this kind of investing appropriately . . . there's no reason you can't 
do it," Berg said. One pension partnership is already underway. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD has won congressional approval for a plan to attract pension funds into 
housing construction by guaranteeing a steady supply of low-income tenants with 
federal housing subsidies. The first taker in that $100-million offer will be 
the AFL-CIO pension fund, which has announced plans to invest $660 million in 
affordable housing over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Community development financial institutions -- As a candidate, Clinton 
frequently touted the experience of the South Shore Bank, which provided credit 
to help revive a Chicago neighborhood abandoned by traditional commercial 
bankers. The House has already passed Administration legislation to provide 
subsidies for the development of a nationwide network of such community 
development lending institutions. The bill has also cleared the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and is expected to be enacted into law this 
year. Community development banks could each receive as much as $5 million in 
federal aid to match capital they raise on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstering credit -- At the same time it promotes the development of 
alternative sources of credit, the Administration is intensifying pressure on 
commercial banks to lend in depressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, federal bank agencies proposed regulations to stiffen enforcement 
of the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to serve the 
communities in which they are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new rules, which are expected to become final as early as this 
spring, establish more rigorous "performance-oriented" standards that banks 
must meet in making available credit and other services in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Justice Department officials have announced stepped-up 
enforcement of the laws barring racial discrimination in bank lending. Last 
month, the Justice Department reached a consent decree with Shawmut National 
Corp., which required the New England lender to pay damages of $10,000 to 
$15,000 each to minority loan applicants unfairly denied credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very high priority of the Department of Justice," said Paul Hancock, 
chief of the housing section in the Justice Department's civil rights division. 
"There will be more cases coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the proposed new community reinvestment regulations, these 
prosecutions "probably more than any legislation we could pass gives bankers an 
indication that people are serious," said Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
chairman of a House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parallel initiative, the Administration is backing legislation by Kennedy 
that would collect data on insurance redlining -- a move that could be the 
first step toward federal efforts to require firms to make insurance more 
readily available in inner cities. However, the legislation's prospects are 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and housing developers in low-income areas often complain that they 
are unable to obtain bank credit because they cannot purchase insurance at 
reasonable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still under discussion within the Administration is an idea floated last 
spring by Treasury Undersecretary Frank N. Newman that could enormously expand 
the availability of credit in inner cities. Newman raised the possibility of 
imposing on mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions 
the community reinvestment requirement that now applies only to banks. "We're 
going to be looking at it," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an expansive mandate would generate enormous political resistance, and 
senior policy-makers such as Robert E. Rubin, director of the National Economic 
Council at the White House, are openly skeptical of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, in pursuing this urban capitalism agenda, the Administration has 
largely managed to avoid tussles with the financial industry. But commercial 
bankers warn that conflicts could develop between the pressure to provide more 
credit to low-income borrowers and banking regulators' insistence on high 
standards of prudent lending. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists generally applaud the Administration's efforts. "Across 
the spectrum . . . the focus on rebuilding communities has created a lot of 
excitement," said Robert Weissbourd, managing director of Shorebank Advisory 
Services, a subsidiary of the Shorebank Corp. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pace of change has produced some frustrations: The Administration, 
for instance, probably will not even designate the empowerment zones until 
sometime this summer at the earliest. "These are ideas that should reap some 
benefits," Waters said, "but most of our communities feel it's much too slow in 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hole in the urban capitalism strategy may be the paucity of direct 
incentives, beyond the limited empowerment-zone dollars, for large-scale job 
creation in distressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, experts said, increasing the flow of bank capital could 
encourage the development of local service businesses -- such as Laundromats or 
small groceries. But those establishments alone "won't create either the kind 
or number of jobs we need," said James H. Johnson, director of the UCLA Center 
for the Study of Urban Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult decision for the Administration may be if it should focus 
on the most economically and socially desolate neighborhoods, where previous 
efforts at revitalization have had little success. Instead, in a form of 
triage, some analysts say they believe that the Administration should direct 
limited private and public resources toward transitional working-class minority 
neighborhoods where family and community structures are more stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something people want to talk about or be upfront about," said 
Richard Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the 
State University of New York. "But the dilemma is whether this policy process 
is going to make fine distinctions. Can we act strategically to save 
neighborhoods where we have a chance?"

 President Clinton, bowing to opposition from conservatives, has decided to 
drop the controversial nomination of Morton H. Halperin as assistant secretary 
of defense for peacekeeping, officials here said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is expected to announce today that Halperin, a 55-year-old 
former National Security Council staffer and civil libertarian, has asked that 
his name be withdrawn from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the Pentagon will also eliminate the new 
peacekeeping post, which had been created by outgoing Defense Secretary Les 
Aspin when officials expected heavy U.S. participation in such operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The move had been widely anticipated since mid-December, when Aspin himself 
resigned in response to White House suggestions that Clinton wanted to replace 
him as defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although incoming Defense Secretary-designate Bobby Ray Inman had publicly 
supported the Halperin nomination, insiders said it was unlikely that the 
retired admiral would want to do battle with Capitol Hill over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Halperin could not be reached Sunday night, but Administration officials said 
there was no doubt that the nomination will not be resubmitted to Capitol Hill 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Halperin's nomination had sparked a storm of protest from conservative 
Republicans, particularly on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would 
have had to recommend the nomination for Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (D-S.C.), ranking Republican on the panel, had pronounced 
Halperin unfit for the position because he had taken "extreme and irresponsible 
positions" on key national security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans also objected to creating an assistant secretary's post to 
deal with peacekeeping and human rights affairs, contending that such matters 
should be handled by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration initially had expected peacekeeping operations to be a 
major factor in the post-Cold War world, but the U.S. experience in Somalia 
this past year has soured enthusiasm for such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Halperin, who served as a junior Pentagon staffer with Aspin in the late 1960s 
before going to the National Security Council, left his NSC job to protest the 
1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 He then sued his boss -- Henry A. Kissinger -- for wiretapping his home to 
learn whether he had leaked documents about secret American bombing in that 
country. Almost two decades later, Kissinger apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 23 years, Halperin has advocated deep cuts in nuclear weapons, 
opposed covert military operations abroad and sought leniency for Philip Agee, 
the former CIA operative who leaked the names of other agents. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also become a recognized defense expert, winning support from a parade 
of respected mainstream foreign affairs specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aspin announced his choice for the position in February, the White 
House did not formally send the nomination to Capitol Hill until early August. 
And the appointment drew vigorous conservative opposition from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics argued that Halperin acquitted himself reasonably well at a 
Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the nomination in November, 
Republicans on the panel vowed to continue their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts warned that had Halperin stayed on, Inman would have had to 
expend valuable political capital to get the nomination confirmed -- a step he 
was thought to be loathe to take so soon after taking office.

 Brown-skinned Hawaiians grumble about white-skinned bosses. Filipino laborers 
lament Japanese bureaucrats. And a popular Portuguese comedian pokes fun at 
them all -- to nightclub patrons from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have Caucasians filing race-discrimination cases, and we have Hawaiians 
filing race-discrimination cases," said Linda C. Tseu, executive director of 
the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission. "It's across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha from Honolulu, the multicolored picture of a multiracial world, a place 
with too many skin pigments, accents and attitudes to count. 
</P>
<P>
 But if life sounds like a cross-cultural melee, guess again. "There's more 
tolerance here," Tseu said. "There's more acceptance of diversity. I think it's 
much better in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 This metropolis of 836,231 people, where intermarriage is humdrum, where 
steamed rice is served alongside Portuguese sausage, where Filipino vegetable 
patches sprout next door to Japanese flower gardens, offers just one vision of 
California's future, if population trends keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Los Angeles, Honolulu is home to a great ethnic hodgepodge, with no 
single group in the majority. Yet the differences are as striking as the 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say their island contains little of the ethnic and racial hatred 
that has led to violence from Los Angeles to Sarajevo to Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Honolulu's ethnic groups long have identified with the larger 
community as well as their own. They have condoned an extraordinary rate of 
intermarriage, shared each other's customs and lived together in ethnically 
scrambled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Honolulu's economy has prospered, propelling many whose roots 
were in fields of sugar cane and pineapple, into the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as Los Angeles continues to grapple with its own identity crisis, some 
say they believe that the experience on this far-off island carries an 
important message: "Ethnic diversity does not preclude some sense of civic 
unity," said Kevin Starr, professor of planning and development at USC. "The 
model is there, and it's a powerful model." 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles, Starr added, greater unity "is absolutely essential for 
large-scale economic recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes, riots, boycotts of stores -- the entire list of racial conflicts 
that have erupted in Southern California -- are rarely suffered in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the melange of whites (known locally as haoles), Asians, Polynesians, 
Latinos and others cling to perches on the economic ladder, mingling cultures 
and blood to a degree unmatched almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's got a Japanese daughter-in-law or a Chinese son-in-law or a 
Filipino relative," said David A. Heenan, a white corporate chairman whose wife 
is from the Philippines. "It's hard to throw stones at somebody when they're in 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake: This island society, a 2,557-mile plane ride from 
Southern California, is no multicultural paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the inviting spirit of aloha , social tensions smolder as sugar cane 
fields are paved over, living costs creep ever higher and rock-bottom service 
jobs await masses of the unskilled, often native Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus some scholars warn against romanticizing this society and wonder if the 
future will prove more fractious than the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe instead of you becoming more like us, we're becoming more like you," 
said Noel J. Kent, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added, "it's hard to imagine the stuff that went on in South-Central 
Los Angeles going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other big cities, Honolulu is a place where racial and ethnic backgrounds 
can be telling clues to someone's niche in the social hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Top jobs in industry are occupied mostly by whites, though the days when 
whites alone grasped the levers of power are gone. Japanese Americans dominate 
the public sector, notably the state bureaucracy and schools. Many Chinese 
Americans have prospered in finance and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipinos are clustered down the ladder, often in hotel and blue-collar jobs. 
At the bottom are the native Hawaiians, many in low-level jobs or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Those groups make up only part of the cultural mishmash: Honolulu's island of 
Oahu is home to middle-class Korean Americans and Portuguese Americans, 
struggling immigrants from Samoa and other Pacific islands, fledgling 
entrepreneurs from Vietnam, impoverished Laotian refugees and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chop suey -- all mixed," said Lily K. Yao, the Shanghai-born president 
of Pioneer Federal, a savings bank chartered by Hawaii's last king in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Chinese. I have an executive vice president who is Japanese, and one of 
the other vice presidents is Portuguese." 
</P>
<P>
 The mixing applies to neighborhoods, customs, even popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The local version of Japanese musubi is a slab of Spam on a rice ball with 
seaweed. Affluent whites and Asians live close together in pricey beachfront 
neighborhoods, where entry is based on income, not race. That symbol of lilting 
island music, the ukulele, is a Portuguese instrument named by the Hawaiians to 
mean "jumping flea." 
</P>
<P>
 Intermarriage is the ultimate manifestation of it all. More than four out of 
10 local weddings now unite people from different backgrounds, state statistics 
show -- greater than 10 times the Mainland rate, sketchy U.S. data suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 In this climate, a recent Time magazine cover image of a young woman of mixed 
blood -- created by a computer -- tickled many Honolulu readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just laughing," said Mark H. Fukunaga, a Japanese American executive 
whose wife is white. "If you took an average kid in Hawaii, this is what she 
would look like." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed: An estimated six out of 10 Hawaiian births are now children of mixed 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Honolulu residents offer a few theories for their way of life: Native Hawaiian 
culture has stressed acceptance and hospitality, values picked up by newcomers 
for two centuries. Many immigrants are unified by a history of poverty and 
plantation toil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, some say, what choice is there? Hawaii is small and isolated, 
with few means of escape. "We have to make it work," Fukunaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that different ethnic groups treat each other too gingerly. Jokes are told 
on everyone that would not amuse the politically correct. Some groups are 
alleged to be cheap, some slow-witted, some shiftless and irresponsible. Some 
are said to be fond of dog meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank De Lima, perhaps Hawaii's most popular comedian, says his own ethnic 
humor is based on his experience in Hawaiian society and intended to be 
affectionate rather than mean. Childhood memories -- the accents of friends' 
grandparents, a Japanese radio station, Hawaiian natives singing, his own 
Portuguese community -- are all grist for humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make fun of everyone equally," said De Lima, a former divinity student 
whose ancestors came from Portugal, Spain, Hawaii, China and northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for humor," he added, "we'd be at each other's throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising opportunity has also served as glue for society's disparate parts, many 
agree, with an economy that has been fueled by tourism, agriculture and the 
military. Unemployment is typically far below the national rate, approaching an 
infinitesimal 2% range at the end of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukunaga's grandfather, for instance, got his start as a cook on a ranch in 
the early 1900s. Later, the immigrant from Hiroshima opened up a tiny garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, his business grew into Servco Pacific, a family enterprise 
that today owns Toyota and Chevrolet dealerships and sells boats, office 
equipment and home appliances, among its many operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Honolulu -- or Hawaii -- has one real contribution to make, it's in 
putting together a successful, multicultural society," said Fukunaga, 37, the 
company president. 
</P>
<P>
 The society is facing new strains, however. Job growth has stalled amid a 
stubborn recession that descended in late 1991. Tourism has been hit by the 
economic slumps in California and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oahu, there were 1.4% or 6,000 fewer payroll jobs in October than a year 
ago, according to Hawaiian bank economists. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the gulf between rich and poor has widened, albeit less sharply 
than in the nation overall, while living costs remain punishing -- up to 40% 
higher than the U.S. average. Affordable housing has long been scarce. Many 
labor at two or even three jobs to keep a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, poorly educated islanders face the same barriers to a better life 
that have-nots face in South-Central Los Angeles and the rest of urban America. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Ramos, 47, a Filipino who worked his way from the sugar cane fields to 
a $12.41-an-hour job in the "shop," will lose his job sometime this year when 
the Oahu Sugar Co. shuts down its refinery about 15 miles from downtown 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost track of how to compete outside," he said. But Ramos, who says he 
still remembers when his father drove a meat truck from camp to camp in the 
plantations, worries even more about his less-skilled counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 350 people are going to be laid off and set loose in a job market 
that requires ever-more credentials, even for tasks such as raking golf course 
sand traps and planting grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to the golf course, but they want you to have good communication 
skills, know the job and be able to read," Ramos said. "Some of the workers 
don't have that. It's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown, in a 23rd-floor office, a corporate executive also worries about the 
economy's ability to spawn an adequate supply of decent jobs for the future. 
Toss in the chronically high living costs and "it's going to create social 
tension, no question about it," said Heenan, chairman of Theo. H. Davies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 His own company, part of Hawaii's original "Big Five" corporate elite, 
illustrates some of the shifts reshaping the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, TheoDavies unloaded a sugar cane plantation, cattle ranches and 
macadamia nut orchards, and picked up 85 Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, it was Heenan's predecessors in the corporate elite who dreamed 
up the policies that led to today's ethnic stew. Business leaders, eager for a 
labor force, recruited plantation workers from China, Japan, Portugal, Puerto 
Rico, Korea and the Philippines as long ago as the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were divided by ethnic origin, housed in segregated villages and even 
paid different wage scales based on their origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, the divide-and-conquer policies sparked a backlash. 
Organized labor preached a gospel of multiracial unionism, and, by the 1940s, 
it prevailed in Hawaii's sprawling fields of sugar cane and pineapples. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told by the old-timers that they'd actually overturn elections" to ensure 
an ethnically varied union leadership, said Guy Fujimura, secretary-treasurer 
of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union Local 142. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to have one Japanese guy, one Chinese guy, one Filipino guy and 
one Hawaiian guy." 
</P>
<P>
 One result: Hawaii's cultures have had a long time to get used to each other, 
unlike Los Angeles, which is being redefined by a much more recent wave of 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Island politics, once dominated by white businessmen and the Republican Party, 
also has had time to evolve. Realpolitik, Hawaii style, has dictated 
inter-ethnic alliances since the 1950s, when Japanese American war veterans led 
a Democratic Party takeover of the state government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genius of Hawaii's politics is that nobody has 51%," said Dan Boylan, a 
political commentator and historian. "If you want to win, you have to cross 
ethnic lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's more-inclusive politics has not meant social equality for all, 
however. A hierarchy of skin shadings exists to this day, with lighter colors 
often on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Daphne Barbee-Wooten, an African American lawyer who sits on the Hawaii Civil 
Rights Commission, recalled her own experience on the jobless line in the early 
1980s: "I noticed that the people on the unemployment line were brown-skinned 
and the people behind the counter were Japanese. You could just visualize it." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparities lead to accounts of bias. "We've heard stories from people 
whose employers are Caucasian, and we've heard stories from people whose 
landlords are Japanese or Chinese or Filipino," said William T. Emmsley Jr., 
executive director of a jobs program for Samoans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, whites make up 31.6% of Oahu's population, according to the 1990 
census, a share inflated by the large, transient military community. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans are next with 23.3%, Filipinos, 14.4% and native Hawaiians 
with about 11%. African Americans, mostly in the military, make up 3%, while 
Latinos make up nearly 7%, though that figure is somewhat inflated because it 
includes many Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Hawaiians, who once showered white newcomers with hospitality, are the 
most aggrieved of all: They suffer the highest rate of infant mortality and 
poverty, the lowest life expectancy and are more likely to wind up living in 
jail or on the beach than most others. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing sense of injustice has sparked an emerging Hawaiian "sovereignty" 
movement, which demands a return of government-owned lands to native Hawaiians, 
some form of self-government and added spending on social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaiians have given a lot of aloha and hospitality to generations of people 
from other countries," said Davianna McGregor, a university professor born to a 
Hawaiian father and Portuguese mother. "Now it's time for some reciprocation 
for the Hawaiians." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of talk raises new us-and-them issues, even for many who sympathize. 
"Does it mean I get some land and you don't? I get a tax break and you don't? I 
pay for water and you don't?" asked Thomas P. Gill, an attorney and former 
Democratic member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean? You see letters coming into the newspaper, and people are 
starting to say: 'Hey, what about me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For now, at least, many with Hawaiian blood remain more concerned about 
everyday survival than separatist politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sugar refinery near downtown, Jason Sniffen is about to lose his job. The 
refinery, where he has worked for 10 years packing sugar, is going to switch 
technology and fire most of its 61 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sniffen, 27, whose ancestors were Hawaiian, German and Filipino, expresses 
no envy of more privileged residents or anxiety about newcomers competing with 
him for the limited job supply. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan, he declares on a break from the conveyor belt, is to become a diesel 
mechanic, a goal he is confident he can reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have stayed here till I died," he said, a snowy coating of sugar clinging 
to his worn black work boots. "Now I have more choices."

CLINTON PROMISES U.S. HELP TO UNITE EUROPE; DIPLOMACY: 'WE MUST NOT NOW LET THE 
IRON CURTAIN BE REPLACED WITH A VEIL OF INDIFFERENCE,' THE PRESIDENT SAYS. HE 
WARNS THAT ALLIED AID FOR FORMER EAST BLOC SATELLITES MUST COME QUICKLY. 
</P>

By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, on his first visit to Europe since entering the White House 
almost a year ago, presented his new vision for the Western Alliance in the 
post-Cold War era Sunday, pledging renewed American leadership and commitment 
to unite this economically and politically troubled continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that the allies must reach out quickly to help the nations of 
the former Soviet empire or risk seeing those countries' precarious democracies 
overwhelmed by "the grim pretenders to tyranny's dark throne" -- the 
ultranationalists who have shown alarming strength across Russia and parts of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 If America and Western Europe work as hard now to unite with their former 
adversaries as they did to contain communism, then the 21st Century can be the 
"most exciting period that Europe and the United States have ever known," 
Clinton said, speaking in the medieval town hall of this NATO headquarters city 
on the eve of his summit with allied heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Integrating the struggling former Communist Bloc countries with the rest of 
Europe will be difficult, Clinton acknowledged, especially at a time when 
European countries are experiencing economic difficulties of their own, but he 
cautioned that the opportunity to do so may be fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not now let the Iron Curtain be replaced with a veil of 
indifference," he said. "For history will judge us as it judged with scorn 
those who preached isolationism between the world wars, and as it has judged 
with praise the bold architects of the transatlantic community after World War 
II." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will formally outline his "Partnership for Peace" plan when the summit 
officially begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is designed to balance concern in Europe and the United States about 
responding too quickly to East European requests for NATO membership against 
worries that excluding the former satellites could come back to haunt the West 
if Russian nationalism should once again rear its head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace would open the door to political, military and 
economic cooperation with all of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
former adversaries, including Russia, Ukraine and the other newly independent 
states of the old Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development here, a senior Clinton aide said the United States is 
"damn close" to reaching an agreement with Ukraine to destroy its massive 
nuclear arsenal in return for a multibillion-dollar aid package for the 
collapsing Ukrainian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that the aid package might be as high as $12 billion -- 
much of it in the form of payment for enriched uranium removed from the 
warheads for use in nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton plans to visit Moscow on Thursday and Friday for a summit with Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior Clinton Administration official said that if the deal with 
Ukraine is completed before the Moscow visit ends, Clinton will go to Kiev to 
sign the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has 175 intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with more than 1,000 
nuclear warheads, and the United States has been working feverishly to reach an 
agreement to ensure their dismantlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and its allies have considered the missiles a major threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's speech, a preview of the NATO summit agenda, was delivered in 
the Gothic Room of the 15th-Century Hotel de Ville, the town hall, before an 
audience of 275 well-groomed young Europeans, many of them students from the 
College of Europe here. They listened attentively and applauded warmly at the 
end of the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who attended his mother's funeral in Hot Springs, Ark., on Saturday 
before leaving for Brussels, appeared solemn, and at times his eyes were rimmed 
with red as he went through a busy first day here. 
</P>
<P>
 His schedule before the evening speech, which had been billed as a major 
effort to reassure Europe of America's commitment to the alliance, included 
meetings with King Albert II and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, as 
well as a talk to the American Embassy staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton spoke in sober and measured tones to his young audience, 
described by his hosts as "future leaders of Europe," the 47-year-old President 
drew scattered laughter when -- in an oblique reference to his fondness for 
playing the saxophone -- he said, "For those of you who know anything about me 
personally, I . . . have a great personal debt of nearly 40 years' standing to 
this country because it was a Belgian, Adolphe Sax, who invented the 
saxophone." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to allay the concerns of European leaders who have felt that under 
Clinton the United States was shifting its focus from Europe to the Pacific 
Rim, the President said he had come to Brussels to demonstrate that Europe 
"remains central to the interests of the United States, and that we will work 
with our partners in seizing the opportunities before us all." 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States must continue to reach out to both Asia and Latin 
America, he said Europe remains "our most valued partner, not just in the cause 
of democracy and freedom, but also in the economics of trade and investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the core of U.S. security remains with Europe, he said, and thus he 
is committed to keeping about 100,000 troops stationed in Europe, consistent 
with the desire of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the end of the Cold War, he said, the continuing bloodshed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina serves as a reminder that strong military forces remain 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a senior Administration official said that despite pressure from 
France and some other countries for immediate NATO air strikes against the 
Serbian aggressors in Bosnia's war, no such action is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some critics have argued that there no longer is a military mission 
for NATO, Clinton declared that his Partnership for Peace plan will not alter 
NATO's fundamental mission of defending its 16 member countries from armed 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did not mention Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the fiery leader of Russia's 
ultranationalist right, by name, but he clearly had him in mind in declaring 
that "we cannot afford to abandon that mission while the dream of empire still 
burns in the minds of some who look longingly toward a brutal past." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton made it clear that he would like to stick to his 
plan of providing for gradual admission of such countries as Poland, Hungary 
and the Czech Republic to NATO rather than run the risk of undermining Yeltsin 
by drawing "a new line between East and West that could create a 
self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Eastern European countries have pressed for early NATO membership, but 
Yeltsin signaled to Clinton that this would isolate Russia and give it 
potential enemy status. 
</P>
<P>
 As a compromise, according to senior U.S. officials, an early draft of the 
summit's final communique declares that NATO would "expect and welcome" the 
alliance's expansion to include East European countries, but sets out no time 
schedule for their inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORIES: A6-7 The President's Itinerary 
</P>

CLINTON'S TASK: GET EUROPE'S YOUTH IN AMERICA'S CORNER; ALLIANCES: ALARM OVER 
BALKANS AIDS HIM IN WOOING YOUNG PEOPLE TO KEEP OLD TIES WITH U.S. BEING LIKED 
HELPS.

 Beneath the carved panels and ornate Gothic parapets of Brussels' Hotel de 
Ville, Bill Clinton on Sunday faced the first test of his first presidential 
trip to Europe: Could he persuade members of the Continent's next generation to 
embrace the deep-rooted bonds with America on which their parents had so long 
relied? 
</P>
<P>
 An audience of accomplished young Europeans gathered in the daunting solemnity 
of the 15th-Century town hall studied him closely and clapped politely when 
Clinton told them that it was time "for us together to revitalize our 
partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly afterward he got the warmer reaction he had been seeking when he 
ventured outside into the chilled, charged atmosphere of the historic Grand' 
Place. Jammed amid the worn facades of guild buildings from a prosperous era 
four centuries ago, the Belgians cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill! Bill!" they cried, waving tiny American flags to capture the eye of the 
flush-faced American President. 
</P>
<P>
 From the looks of them, it was clear that Clinton has a chance to win the 
support he is seeking. He has it because of the alarming new world the youth of 
Europe are seeing in the former Yugoslav federation and further east, and 
because of the surprisingly good impressions they have formed of the youngest 
American President in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 American leaders, and the young people's own parents, have long worried about 
the youth of postwar Europe. Would they take seriously the dangers of war that 
led their parents to build a long-term bond with the powerful nation across the 
Atlantic? 
</P>
<P>
 Western governments have conducted studies and sifted polls, and seemed to 
reach a worrisome conclusion: This "new generation" is not as concerned about 
future security threats as those who had seen the terrible devastation wrought 
by two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of their parents' generations, still in power in many European 
governments, knew those horrors firsthand. It colored their view of their own 
military needs, and of America's value to them. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
talks of receiving a coat in an American Care package; French President 
Francois Mitterrand escaped from a German prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The postwar generation has seen a different America. Not many of those who 
braved the chill of a January night in Brussels would be able to identify Gen. 
George Marshall, the American whose multibillion-dollar plan of relief and 
reconstruction helped rebuild their continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But they know the America of Michael Jordan, of Nike shoes, of the American 
films whose ads are plastered on billboards throughout their capital city. This 
has been a culture that they drink in, but do not always admire. To young 
Europeans, America is also the country of crime, drugs and homelessness -- of 
urban contagions they fear are spreading to their own nations. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, their first impressions of the country came during the years of the 
Vietnam War. Many in Europe considered the United States an imperialist power, 
a muscle-bound nuclear bully that showed the same moral blindness of the 
Soviets it opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, with the end of the Cold War that many young Europeans believed 
brought out America's worst side, a new perception of America has thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 With the disintegration of the Yugoslav federation, many have seen their own 
continent engulfed by a Vietnam of its own, an all-consuming war that mocks 
them from television every night. As they watch the collapse of buildings and 
the burial of civilians, they lament a war their governments seem powerless to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Europeans have faulted the Clinton Administration for its failed efforts 
to stop the three-way slaughter. But their anger and frustration at the 
Americans over Bosnia-Herzegovina have been directed more at Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher than at Clinton, and in any case are exceeded by their 
unhappiness with their own leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond this, the Continent's new generation has shown a special personal 
affinity for the new President, so far at least. Clinton's attempts to identify 
himself with John F. Kennedy may seem contrived to some Americans, but polls 
show Europeans like the vitality of the 47-year-old Arkansan that reminds them 
of the Democrat who was their favorite postwar President. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, during his first European outing as President, Clinton did not, 
perhaps, work as hard as he might have at exuding charm. 
</P>
<P>
 After his speech inside the town hall, he made his way to a podium outside to 
meet a crowd that had been gathering for hours. But he cut short his comments, 
smiling genially as he told the group: "You've heard my speech, I have really 
nothing else to say." 
</P>
<P>
 And the young Europeans in the Grand' Place were not overawed by Clinton's 
lieutenants. The crowd tittered, then burst out laughing, when the oversized TV 
screen erected in the square to show Clinton's speech panned on his overworked 
secretary of state, his eyes pressed closed, apparently dozing. 
</P>
<P>
 " Il dort (He's asleep)," a long-haired Belgian youth snickered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reviews of Clinton's speech struck a different tone. German 
television, for one, was soon lavishing praise on Clinton for his expressions 
of concern about the U.S.-European relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The same reaction was apparent even as Clinton glided to his waiting 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very nice looking," said Natasha Cleti, 24, who works in an art gallery 
just off the Grand' Place. "He's very positive and very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill!" cried a young woman in a tricolored jersey apparently made from an 
American flag. "Come hold our hands!"

BISHOP AGREES TO MEDIATE IN MEXICAN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A faint hope for peace Sunday has once again placed Samuel Ruiz, the outspoken 
bishop of this embattled diocese, at the center of a conflict over indigenous 
rights just as the Mexican government seeks to blame Roman Catholic priests for 
last week's peasant uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz was asked to mediate in the armed insurrection by a group claiming to 
represent rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army. But it was not yet 
clear whether the government, which has had an ongoing battle with the bishop, 
would accept Ruiz's mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the 69-year-old Ruiz highlights the delicate 
relationship between representatives of the Catholic Church and a government 
that only a little over a year ago began recognizing religious groups. Where 
priests have become increasingly involved in encouraging Indians to stand up 
for their rights, military and government officials have become increasingly 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, struggling to restore order after the deadliest outbreak of peasant 
violence in more than two decades, the government accused pro-left clerics and 
lay catechists of fomenting unrest by encouraging peasants to organize. 
Especially in impoverished Chiapas, the conflict had been coming to a head in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz -- a vocal advocate of liberation theology whose conduct has come under 
Vatican review -- denied the government's accusations Sunday. He said he cannot 
account for all the priests in Chiapas but vehemently denied that he personally 
has ever supported violence. What he has advocated, he said, is equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at Sunday Mass in the colonial Santo Domingo Church, exactly a week 
after rebels briefly took control of this tourist town, Ruiz said he had agreed 
to mediate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more or less firm hopes of a peaceful end," he told the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The request that Ruiz mediate was contained in a fax sent to La Jornada 
newspaper. Its authenticity could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ruiz, Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala and 
respected Mexican journalist Julio Scherer, editor of the feisty weekly 
magazine Proceso, were invited. Scherer declined, and Menchu has not commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bishop's optimism, the violence appeared to be spreading. Early 
Sunday two electrical towers north of Mexico City were attacked with explosives 
but not damaged. Late Saturday night, a stolen recreational vehicle loaded with 
dynamite exploded at the front gate of a military base at Naucalpan, also near 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chiapas, services were held in the old Santo Domingo Church because 
government troops continued to block off the main plaza where the cathedral is. 
Since the uprising, an estimated 12,000 troops have been sent to Chiapas, the 
state located on the Guatemalan border. 
</P>
<P>
 As barefoot women in traditional woolen wrap skirts and shawls quietly entered 
the old church, Ruiz made another plea for equality in the difficult time San 
Cristobal de las Casas is now suffering: 
</P>
<P>
 "On city buses these days it is common to hear, 'Rotten Indians, now I hate 
them more than ever.' These are not Christian words, and they are at the root 
of a lot of misery." 
</P>
<P>
 He has criticized the government's massive military efforts, including the 
bombing of hillsides, in going after the rebels and has scoffed at 
administration claims that Indians were duped or coerced into joining the 
guerrilla movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was tricked, nobody was forced," Ruiz said. "This was caused by a 
society structured in a way that results in a level of poverty that brings 
about an almost suicidal situation." 
</P>
<P>
 An unassuming man with a ring of graying hair and thick glasses, Ruiz has 
fought for Indian rights, often against wealthy cattle owners who generally 
blame the poverty of indigenous people here on racist stereotypes of laziness 
and drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also publicized allegations of abuses by Indian leaders, who are 
generally closely linked to the government. The hills above San Cristobal are 
filled with thousands of Indians expelled from their communities when they 
converted from their traditional religion, a mixture of Catholic and Indian 
rites, to standard Catholicism or a Protestant belief. 
</P>
<P>
 That record has not always endeared Ruiz to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any disrespect to Samuel, he is not the only one nor is his the only 
church that fights for the Indians and the poor," Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco 
Garrido, interior minister and former governor of Chiapas, said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Other church leaders concerned about Indians have gone along with the 
government's efforts to solve the state's problems, avoiding confrontations, 
said Gonzalez, who has known Ruiz for more than 30 years. Gonzalez denied that 
the government is behind a 2-month-old Vatican inquiry into Ruiz's conduct that 
could result in his removal as bishop. Ruiz is accused of errors of doctrine, 
an apparent reference to his advocacy of liberation theology, a movement within 
the church that advocates an active defense of the poor and oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has kept an increasingly tighter rein on liberation theology 
supporters in recent years, leading some of them to leave the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the threat of removal from the diocese he has led for 33 years, Ruiz 
continues to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he criticized the refusal of the army to allow journalists to travel 
to the rural areas where fighting reportedly continues to rage. Worries about 
possible human rights abuses continued to grow as the army turned back a 
caravan of human rights activists headed for Ocosingo, site of the rebellion's 
fiercest fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we understand some measures are necessary for security," he said, "we 
get the impression that there really is not activity and what they are doing is 
hiding other things." 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRESIDENT EMPLOYS FEAR TO URGE SUPPORT FOR EAST; POLICY: CLINTON 
RAISES SPECTER OF RUSSIA'S COLLAPSE TO CAUTION AMERICA. HE WARNS EUROPE CHAOS 
COULD SPREAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's appeal Sunday for a new, post-Cold War partnership between 
the United States and Europe centered on two pointed messages of fear, one 
aimed at Americans and one at Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 To Americans, Clinton issued a warning: The collapse of Russia or other East 
European democracies could draw the United States into war just as earlier 
crises pulled the nation into World War I and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 To Europeans, he cast the warning in the form of a plea: Join the United 
States in stepping up aid and trade with the nations of the East, despite the 
pain of the recession now racking Western Europe, lest Russia's chaos spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the peoples who broke communism's chains, we now see a race between 
rejuvenation and despair," Clinton warned, pitting "the heirs of the 
Enlightenment, who seek to consolidate freedom's gain . . . (against) the grim 
pretenders to tyranny's dark throne." 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he added, must continue to defend the 
West as long as "the dream of empire still burns in the minds of some who look 
longingly toward a brutal past." 
</P>
<P>
 His words were foreboding, and his tone was grim. But among the President's 
aides, there was satisfaction. After a year of uncertainty, they believe that 
they have found a convincing new mission for the U.S.-European alliance: 
holding back the tide of nationalism in the troubled East. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, they owe that new clarity in part to Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the 
ultranationalist who surprised the West -- and shook the East -- with his 
unexpected strength in Russia's parliamentary election last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the election, Clinton and his aides had worked out a proposal to 
extend NATO's defense cooperation gradually and gingerly into Eastern Europe, a 
plan they have dubbed the "Partnership for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But to bring home his concern on Sunday, Clinton appeared to have taken the 
advice given President Harry S. Truman in 1947 -- that he should "scare hell 
out of the American people" to rally support for the "containment" of the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's aides said they intended this speech to be as historic as those 
Truman gave at the opening of the Cold War. "Five years from now, we hope this 
is remembered as the day the President defined a new security framework for 
Europe," his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Clinton said, the security of Western Europe and the United States 
must be protected by making sure that Russia and its neighbors succeed in their 
political and economic reforms -- and by keeping NATO military defenses ready 
in case they fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best," a senior Clinton 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, it is a policy of "pre-containment" -- of trying to ward off the 
rise of authoritarian rule in Moscow, and working to limit its effect in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it work? For Clinton to succeed in matching Truman's achievement, he must 
struggle against three obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Europeans' preoccupation with their own economic woes and a general 
lack of leadership on a continent of weak and aging governments. Germany, for 
example, which lies closest to Eastern Europe, complains that it has already 
spent almost $90 billion in aid to Russia and could stomach little more. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obstacle is the unpredictability of day-by-day events in Russia and 
its neighbors, caught up as they are in the throes of revolutionary economic 
and political change. Clinton called Sunday for something Presidents rarely 
extol: "humility -- understanding that we cannot control every event in every 
country on every day." 
</P>
<P>
 And a third is domestic: not the support of the American people, who by 
surprisingly large margins have backed continued U.S. aid to Russia, but 
Clinton's own domestic agenda and its demands on his time and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the President has refused to commit much time to foreign policy, 
except when compelled by crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 That damaged U.S. relations with European countries in 1993. "The 
transatlantic relationship just wasn't tended the way it traditionally had 
been," said Rozanne Ridgway, a former assistant secretary of state.

PLO'S ROLE IN COLLABORATORS' EXECUTIONS HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization and its allies in the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank have carried out or condoned the torture and killing of hundreds of 
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel, a leading Israeli human 
rights organization charged Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation added to Palestinians' fears about what the legal system might 
be like when the two areas become self-governing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exhaustive report, B'Tselem, one of the most respected human rights 
groups working in the occupied territories, found that between 750 and 950 
suspected collaborators were killed in the last six years, many after being 
severely tortured; that most had no chance to defend themselves against the 
accusations against them, and that at least half were not, in fact, Israeli 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "B'Tselem considers the Palestinian political organizations whose activists 
tortured and killed suspected collaborators responsible, alongside the direct 
perpetrators themselves, for these gross violations of human rights," the group 
said. It called for an immediate halt to such acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO and its member groups, notably PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream 
Fatah, have failed to formulate a policy on Palestinians who have collaborated 
with the 26-year Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, B'Tselem 
charged, saying this was a dereliction of political responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO failed to respond to the group's questions, and it declined on Sunday 
to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even making allowance for the fact that the PLO does not have at its disposal 
enforcement mechanisms or a structured judicial system, the organization did 
not take, or even threaten to take, measures against militants who went on 
killing," B'Tselem said, asserting the PLO's culpability for what amount to 
summary executions and political murders. 
</P>
<P>
 B'Tselem, whose past reports have strongly criticized Israel for alleged 
violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, argued that 
Palestinian groups demanding political recognition, including the right to 
govern, must also adhere to international standards for the protection of human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two years in preparation, the 208-page report seemed certain to 
heighten the apprehension among Palestinians about the character of the 
Palestine National Authority that will assume power first in the Gaza Strip and 
later on the West Bank under the accord between Israel and the PLO on limited 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a survey of the past, but it raises many questions about the future 
and, indeed, of the present," said Saleh Abdel Jawad, a Palestinian political 
scientist at Birzeit University who worked with B'Tselem on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of democracy will we have, what kind of society will we be? These 
are crucial issues today, and while this study does not answer those questions, 
its findings should worry us." 
</P>
<P>
 B'Tselem officials noted that their case-by-case research into the killings 
showed that rarely was a suspected collaborator allowed to respond to charges 
against him, that torture was common and that only in 40% to 50% of the cases 
could the person be linked to Israeli forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In 20% of the cases, the victim was judged guilty of "social crimes," such as 
drug sales, prostitution, rape or homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 B'Tselem, whose name in Hebrew means "In the Image of (the Almighty)," also 
accused Israeli authorities of breaking international law to recruit 
collaborators, using them not only to collect intelligence but to break down 
Palestinian society and even involving them in the violent interrogation of 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 According to B'Tselem, Israel now has a network of about 5,000 collaborators, 
many of them blackmailed into work as informers and agents, some recruited from 
among drug dealers, prostitutes and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will happen to these 5,000 people and their families, a total of 25,000 
to 30,000 persons, is a major moral dilemma for Israel," B'Tselem Director 
Yizhar Beer said. "Israel has an obligation to them, and so far the policy is 
not at all clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "That aside, 5,000 active agents and informers and collaborators of other 
kinds gives an idea of the immense scale of the recruitment." 
</P>
<P>
 But the focus of the report was on the activities of collaborators within 
Palestinian society and the attacks on them by armed groups aligned with the 
PLO's main factions and with the rival Islamic Resistance Movement, known as 
Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, Hamas overtly supported the killing of suspected 
collaborators, B'Tselem said, while Fatah condoned the actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Palestinians themselves were distressed by the increasing attacks 
upon suspected collaborators, the PLO remained virtually silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after Israel signed an agreement with the PLO on Palestinian autonomy did 
the PLO call for a halt in the attacks on suspected collaborators. Even so, 
eight were killed in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities almost celebrated the report, notwithstanding B'Tselem's 
criticism of military intelligence and the security police, for it finally 
studied the killing of Palestinians by other Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that B'Tselem has focused on the activities of Arab 
terrorist organizations vis-a-vis the internal Arab population despite the fact 
that a significant number of the injuries and deaths among the Palestinian 
population during the intifada have been caused by other Palestinians," a 
military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to B'Tselem's figures, 1,177 Palestinians were killed by Israelis in 
Gaza and on the West Bank in the last six years, compared to 104 Israelis 
killed by Palestinians in the occupied territories. Within Israel, 74 Israelis 
and 43 Palestinians have been killed. Six foreign tourists have also died in 
the attacks.

UPRISING SHOWS DISPARITY WITHIN MEXICO; WARFARE: THOUGH THOUSANDS OF MILES 
APART, VIOLENCE IN TROPICAL CHIAPAS AFFECTS THOSE IN THE MORE URBAN BAJA 
CALIFORNIA. LEADERS OF INDIAN GROUPS ALSO STAGE PROTESTS IN SAN DIEGO.

<P>
 The Mexican states of Chiapas and Baja California could not be more different. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja, an arid region on the northwest border with the United States, is the 
Mexico that the government wants the world to see: It is urban, comparatively 
prosperous, industrial and politically pluralistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas, a tropical area on the nation's southernmost border, is another 
Mexico: a rural, feudal, violent society still dominated by landowning caciques 
(strongmen). 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day that businessmen in the northern border state toasted the 
start of NAFTA, the impoverished indigenous peasants on the Guatemalan border 
protested the trade pact with gunfire, launching an uprising Jan. 1 that has 
shaken all of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day, Baja residents have been transfixed by the images from the 
remote battleground almost 2,000 miles away -- the air raids, defiant 
boy-soldiers armed with wooden rifles, wounded rebels dying slowly in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is talking about it every day," said veteran Tijuana journalist 
Enrique Garcia Sanchez. "It is the principal issue. And many people agree that 
the battle of these people is understandable, not justifiable, but 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distance and the differences, the repercussions of the conflict 
were powerful in Baja and spilled into Southern California as well. On both 
sides of the border, the week's events served as a reminder that the explosive 
sociopolitical realities of Latin America remain uncomfortably close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at it and you say: 'What is going on? This is my country, this is 
Mexico,' " said a young government official in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very lamentable moment," said Carlos Castillo Peraza, national 
president of the opposition National Action Party (PAN), during a speaking 
engagement at UC San Diego. "It is a high cost not only in image, but in 
reality as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vast migrant communities of Tijuana and Southern California 
include thousands of members of Mexican indigenous groups, few are from 
Chiapas. But leaders of Zapotec and Mixtec Indian groups from the state of 
Oaxaca held pro-rebel demonstrations at Mexican consulates in San Jose, San 
Diego and Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe that violence is the alternative," said Algimiro Morales of 
the Binational Mixtec-Zapotec Front during a San Diego protest Thursday that 
included Chicano activists. "Nonetheless, we believe the Zapatistas have the 
legitimate right, their conditions are more than sufficient for an armed 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Indigenous groups in other rural states also suffer systematic exploitation 
and deprivation, Morales said. Tensions erupted in Chiapas because of extreme 
conditions, including abuses by the "dictatorial" regime of former state Gov. 
Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, who became Mexico's interior minister last year, 
according to Morales and other critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana anthropologist Victor Clark Alfaro, director of a trans-border human 
rights center, said: "I am sure there is much sympathy among the popular 
classes. The fact that these Mexicans have dared to take up arms merits moral 
support. . . . The conquest began 500 years ago and continues today in Chiapas. 
These people can't take it any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Many government officials and politicians disagreed vigorously with 
expressions of solidarity with the guerrillas of the Zapatista National Army of 
Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing that a political party can do is endorse violence," said 
Castillo, president of PAN, which controls Baja and two other states. "It is an 
erroneous path that has pushed other nations to paths of bloody repression. It 
is the negation of politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The press in Baja California devoted extensive space to reports and commentary 
about the violence and radio talk shows were swamped with callers. 
</P>
<P>
 But many journalists, intellectuals and professionals expressed frustration 
with Mexican television coverage. They accused the national television network, 
which is known for hewing close to the government line, of restricting and 
manipulating information. They said they are relying on newspapers, U.S. 
networks and phone calls to friends and relatives in the south for updates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lack of information," Clark said. "The (television) news is 
distorted." 
</P>
<P>
 One inevitable topic of discussion last week was the economy; the northern 
border region is a prime beneficiary of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which was approved after a concerted campaign by the treaty's 
advocates to portray Mexico as modern, stable and democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja business and community leaders expressed concern that foreign investment 
and tourism, which have been hurt by the U.S. recession, could suffer along 
with Mexico's international image. At the same time, they dismissed the revolt 
as isolated and short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The civilian population in Chiapas has been turning in rebels," said Pedro 
Ochoa Palacio, director of the Tijuana Cultural Center. "That shows you there 
is little social support. . . . It is very localized." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the political impact could be profound in a presidential election year. 
Even before Chiapas, the 60-year hegemony of the Revolutionary Institutional 
Party faced a strong challenge from the conservative PAN and the left-of-center 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD). 
</P>
<P>
 The stature of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his handpicked 
candidate for the presidency, Luis Donaldo Colosio, have been damaged and the 
opposition parties, particularly the PRD, will gain ground, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Mexico's scattered and faded guerrilla movements of the past, 
journalist Garcia said: "It was assumed that we had overcome these things 20 
years ago. This has disproved four years of official discourse by the Salinas 
administration. The government has been totally discredited." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia predicted that tensions will remain high as the election approaches, 
particularly in the impoverished, stratified south. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is another way of life there, unlike here. They know what misery is 
because they live it every day. The ashes will continue to smolder."

TOPLESS BAR OWNER ISN'T ABOUT TO SAY SHE'S SORRY; BUSINESS: SANDRA DEASE, WHO 
RUNS SANDRAELLA'S NUDIE JOINT IN ANAHEIM, VIEWS HERSELF AS JUST ANOTHER 
GRANDMOTHER MAKING A LIVING. NOT EVERYONE AGREES.

<P>
 Please pardon Mrs. Dease if she's a bit reluctant to tell people exactly what 
she's up to these days. 
</P>
<P>
 She manages her employees' United Way campaign, which is nice. She makes sure 
that Maria, her precocious 14-year-old, gets in before curfew every night. You 
know how teen-agers are. She checks in almost daily on her first grandchild, 
6-week-old Victoria Lynn. Who wouldn't? And, oh yeah, she owns and operates 
that place on South Brookhurst Street where willowy women bare their chests to 
the delight of hundreds of baying men. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, that place. Sandraella's. The nudie joint. The den of disgust. So go 
ahead. Let her have it. Tell her she's a hussy. Or worse. Say what she does is 
filthy. Vulgar. Sinful. Tell her she'll get her comeuppance. That she's 
hell-bound. It's OK. Honest. She's heard it all before. And then some. And 
she'll hear it again. That much, she knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ashamed in any way, shape or form," the 46-year-old businesswoman 
says. "People just don't understand. This isn't the type of business that 
people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever one thinks of Sandra Dease (yes, that is her real name) or her trade, 
she seems a far cry from the stereotypical silk-shirted playgirl that people 
usually associate with her line of work. At the moment, in fact, she has been 
absorbed with her teen-age daughter, who, like many kids her age, is testing 
the roiled waters of independence. Then there's the attention-grabbing 
grandchild whom Dease helped usher into the world Nov. 15 as the Lamaze coach 
for daughter Gina, 27. As for Dease, "Once you get to know her, she's like 
anybody else," says Victor Maksymenko, 40, an office machine repairman and 
close friend. "That just happens to be how she makes a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they'd just as soon see "Mrs. Dease" make her living elsewhere. "I 
don't want it in my city," says Anaheim City Council member Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dease of her critics: "They're wrong. Before they pass judgment, why 
don't they actually come in and see for themselves? Meet the people who come in 
here. Talk to the employees who work here. We're all just real people. There's 
no funny business going on here. We have strict rules. If you start a problem, 
you will be eighty-sixed. Period. We even recycle all of our glass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Dease, owning and operating places where women prance around stark naked 
or close to it is in the blood. Back in the 1950s, her mother, Judy, ran the 
Griggs Road Lounge and the Bullpen, both strip joints in Houston. In those 
days, Dease says, Texas law allowed teen-agers to work in taverns if their 
parents or legal guardians worked with them. So Dease, with her mother's 
support, dropped out of school and pulled shifts at the bars to help foot the 
family bills. 
</P>
<P>
 She regrets never having graduated from high school, but her earliest memories 
of watching women perform striptease remain fond ones, which probably helps 
explain why she eventually took up the craft herself. "You're looking at one of 
the originals," she says, modestly. "In the 1960s, when Southern California 
started going topless, I was one of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid I thought I was ugly. But these women who danced were so 
beautiful. I can remember thinking it was really an art. I didn't see anything 
filthy in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, she has always enjoyed the full backing of her mother, herself 
a onetime striptease artist. Following in her mother's footsteps, Dease bought 
Sandraella's, formerly the Wounded Knee Saloon, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the better part of the next two years entangled in a much-publicized 
legal dispute with Anaheim officials over how much flesh her dancers could 
bare. She won the freedom-of-expression case in federal court last summer, and, 
at the time, became the proud owner of the city's first topless or nude club to 
open for business in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding on her legal coattails, an all-nude club, the Sahara Theatre, opened 
shortly thereafter. Dease could have opted for all-nude dancing, too, but she 
says she stuck with topless because she thinks it has more class. "It's not 
just letting it all hang out," she says, adding that she also banned 
whipped-cream wrestling contests because she thinks they, too, border on the 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, undercover police officers lodged allegations with the 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control that Dease's dancers were showing a 
bit more of their backsides than they were allowed to. Dease vehemently denies 
the accusations, and the bureau took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 But "recently there haven't been many problems out there," says Sgt. Mike 
Patterson, head of the Anaheim Police Department's vice squad. Deputy City 
Atty. Mark Gordon, who worked on the Dease case, says the city has done all it 
can for now to restrict Sandraella's. And, no, as a matter of fact, he hasn't 
ever gone into the club to see exactly what it is he's been fighting against in 
court. "What's there to see?" Gordon says. "A 16-ounce glass of beer, and a 
woman with no shirt? I'd rather go to a Kings game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is late afternoon on a recent weekday and Sandraella's is nearly deserted. 
While dancers prepare for the night's festivities, Dease is in a back office, 
attempting to balance the books -- something of a challenge these days. While 
she says she could pull in $1,000 or more in a six-hour shift as a dancer, she 
won't say how much money the bar makes, if any. "Let's just say I'm making a 
living," she says. And the modest 5-year-old black Mazda MX-6 parked out back 
suggests as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband of eight years, Bob, an oil technician, pops his head in the door. 
"I'm going to run home to make sure the animals are fed." That would be her 
five cats, including Smudge and Purreau, a play on the name Ross Perot, whom 
she supported for president in the 1992 election. And two Great Danes, Big Boy 
and Quincy, the latter of whom is named after the television series starring 
Jack Klugman as a crime-busting coroner. It's one of Dease's favorite shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 15 dancers include, she says, "girls who work part time and go to college 
. . . girls who have day jobs and want a little extra money . . . and single 
mothers who are just trying to raise their kids, trying to eke out a living." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former dancer, Dease fiercely defends their welfare, enforcing a 
hard-and-fast rule that bans husbands and boyfriends from watching the women 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is not above on-the-job high jinks. Asked to explain a pair of huge 
plastic breasts perched atop a sinkload of dishes, she recalls the night she 
and some friends dolled up a male friend and watched as several men at the bar 
approached her . . . er, him. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, the place turns decidedly more rowdy. A dancer on stage sporting a 
come-hither look shakes, flips and twists her barely clad body to the throbbing 
pulse of a rock 'n' roll tune. The small audience, all men, showers her with 
applause, lusty hoots of approval and money, mostly small bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dease, sporting black pants, a conservative blouse and white Asics sneakers, 
seems to enjoy the fact that the men seem to enjoy themselves. She doesn't see 
it as exploitative or dirty. "It can be, but it doesn't have to be," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she would ever consider doing something else for a living, she says, 
"This is what I've done all my life." She hesitates when pressed about whether 
she'd like to see her youngest daughter carry on the business. "It's not that I 
wouldn't want my daughter to be a dancer, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But what? She shrugs. "I'm very, very proud of my girls. I've tried to give 
them the family life that I didn't have growing up; I was more or less shuffled 
between homes, you know, from pillar to post. I just want my daughters to be 
whatever they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The point appears moot, however. Although Maria, a high school freshman, 
professes to be a huge fan of her mother's, she is not necessarily a huge fan 
of what her mother does. "It's not for me," she says. "I would not get up there 
and strip. My body is mine. And when I get married, that will be between me and 
my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she minces no words in defending her mother, who, she says, 
has not had it easy. "One of my mom's friends, when she heard my mom's bar was 
going topless, told me: 'Well, I don't like that one bit.' I said: 'Leave my 
mom alone. This is how she makes a living. This is how she's taking care of the 
animals. This is how she's taking care of me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dease says Maria's mixed sentiments are a product of her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very outspoken. She's a great deal like me, which," the mother says 
with a pause, "is good . . . I guess."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WHEN YOU'RE UP AGAINST IT, PUNT THE BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the vernacular of football, Gov. Pete Wilson and Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown both punted last week in hopes of gaining better field position later. In 
fact, each hurriedly punted on first down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get it out of here," Brown told me, explaining his play. "It" was "three 
strikes and you're out," the politically potent initiative using that other 
sports idiom. The canny Speaker could visualize his fellow Democrats getting 
sacked by a powerful movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Wilson punted when he couldn't think of another play for the next 
state budget. Trying to fill a $3-billion hole, and unable politically to 
either raise taxes or cut more spending, the governor papered over the gap with 
fantasy money from Washington. Mainly, he asked for -- and penciled in -- $2.3 
billion in federal reimbursements for servicing illegal immigrants. He'll be 
lucky to get a third of that. 
</P>
<P>
 The recap: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" initiative, aimed at permanently locking up repeat felons, 
was in the Assembly as a bill. Its sponsor -- the media savvy father of Fresno 
murder victim Kimber Reynolds -- has been collecting voter signatures to 
qualify his measure for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's liberal colleagues were arguing that only violent criminals should be 
imprisoned for life. Perhaps, the Speaker said, but he didn't want to hear it. 
Most of all, he didn't want any loud, long public debate -- not with both Mike 
Reynolds and Marc Klaas, the father of murdered Polly, hustling the measure in 
interviews all over the Capitol and the governor and the GOP scoring points by 
talking tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown set up his punt in the Public Safety Committee, during a "three 
strikes" hearing packed with television crews, newspaper reporters and victims 
rights advocates. For once, the inmates rights lobbyists took a back bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, although long a liberal burial ground for Republican anti-crime 
bills, offered Mike Reynolds a rare deal: legislation placing his initiative on 
the ballot, thus saving him the time and expense of collecting signatures. The 
only condition was that it go on the June ballot, not November's. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds grabbed the offer, but later told reporters he would continue to 
collect signatures to guard against a double-cross. Some Assembly Democrats 
also will be pitching their own "three strikes" bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Speaker's punt is blocked in the Senate, which seems unlikely, it 
will take election-year pressure off Democrats who philosophically cannot 
support Reynolds' popular proposal, but are willing to place the measure on the 
ballot -- where it was virtually certain to wind up anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial thing strategically for Democrats is that the ballot will not be 
November's, where they will be competing against Republicans. At stake is voter 
turnout; more precisely, composition of the electorate. A "three strikes" 
initiative is certain to attract some conservatives and rednecks who otherwise 
would not vote. Better that these people stay at home in November, if you're a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better to get the hell out of the way of that thing," Brown said of the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's punt delayed his next big budget move until May. Then he'll know more 
about game conditions, namely tax revenues and Washington's reaction to his 
plea for immigration funds. 
</P>
<P>
 One dilemma is that Washington plays with a different time clock than 
Sacramento. The state's fiscal year begins July 1; the fed's is Oct. 1. So 
Wilson likely won't know how many federal dollars he'll be receiving until 
after the state budget deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, however, the governor and the Legislature could punt again; just 
keep penciling in the envisioned federal funds until October and worry about it 
later. After the election, there'll be a new Legislature and perhaps a new 
governor. There is no legal requirement that Wilson sign a balanced budget, 
despite myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the governor asked Washington for $1.5 billion in immigration money 
and got only $324 million. He says he's more optimistic this time. Six other 
strapped states are joining California in demanding that Washington pay for its 
policies requiring services for illegal immigrants. Florida is suing and Wilson 
says it's "a virtual certainty" California will, too. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a new bipartisan effort to extract funds from Congress. In that 
bipartisan spirit, Wilson is not blaming the Democratic White House -- 
"President Clinton didn't create this problem." He's accusing Congress of 
"stealing" the immigration money and "welshing on its obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of all this punting won't be known until at least June, about the 
time of the pro basketball playoffs. I'll spare you metaphors about slam dunks, 
free throws, six fouls and you're out. . . .

SELF-HELP KEEPS WINTER AT BAY AS POWER FAILS

 Residents and workers at Tender Heart Home Care kept warm Sunday with kerosene 
and electric heaters run by a generator. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold, melting snow and ice hampered efforts to restore power for them and 
hundreds of thousands of other residents of the Appalachians and Northeast who 
were hit by two snow and ice storms last week. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one death was attributed to the cold. The body of an off-duty 
Milwaukee police officer was found outside his home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Robert G. Olde, 50, apparently collapsed and died of hypothermia, 
police Capt. Joseph Purpero said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17,600 West Virginia customers of Monongahela Power Co. and Appalachian 
Power Co. were without electricity Sunday. Most had been without power since 
Tuesday, when as much as 30 inches of snow snapped tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most service should be restored by Tuesday or Wednesday, a spokesman for the 
two utilities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands were still without electricity Sunday in the Northeast, but 
airports, trains and highways had mostly returned to normal. "Sidewalks are in 
many cases more of a problem than the streets," said Anne Canty of the New York 
City Sanitation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But electricity wasn't the only problem for the 16 residents at Tender Heart, 
in South Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one period where the phones went all dead, the electricity was off, 
the water was off," owner Wynona Wolfe told The Charleston Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 electric crews were working 16-hour shifts to reattach downed 
power lines in the Philadelphia area. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds blew at 35 m.p.h. Sunday in parts of northern New Hampshire, making the 
wind chill 40 degrees below or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers still without power Sunday in other states included 27,000 in New 
Jersey, and 120,000 in the Philadelphia area, down from 557,000, utilities 
said.

TRIAL BEGINS FOR 11 DAVIDIANS CHARGED IN WACO MURDER CONSPIRACY; COURT: THE 
SURVIVORS ARE ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO KILL AGENTS WHO STORMED THE SECT'S TEXAS 
COMPOUND. BUT THE PROSECUTION FACES MANY PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months after the conflagration in Waco, Tex., that ended a 51-day 
standoff with members of the Branch Davidian sect, 11 surviving Davidians will 
go on trial in San Antonio this morning on charges that they conspired to 
murder the federal agents who stormed their compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, likely to last eight to 10 weeks, is expected to yield new details 
about the ill-fated raid last Feb. 28 in which four agents of the Treasury 
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were killed, along with 
six cult members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trial is fraught with problems for the prosecution, chiefly because 
government investigators themselves have criticized the raid that led to the 
long standoff as poorly conceived and executed. Investigators said in a report 
last fall that the operation should have been scrubbed after U.S. officials 
learned that the Davidians had been tipped off. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid went awry when ATF agents, with scant planning or support, attempted 
to serve search and arrest warrants on cult leader David Koresh for allegedly 
storing an arsenal of illegal weapons in the fortress-like compound he called 
Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing seven-week siege ended April 19, when FBI agents rammed the rural 
compound's main building with armored vehicles and pumped tear gas into it. The 
building erupted in flames, and Koresh and more than 80 of his followers were 
killed -- some apparently shooting themselves, others killed by fellow 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with last fall's critical report, which included charges that ATF 
officials lied about their conduct, defense attorneys are expected to attack 
the credibility of officials who will testify for prosecutors about the Branch 
Davidians' alleged murder conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the prosecution's problems, defense sources say, is that the Mt. 
Carmel compound was so thoroughly ravaged by fire that the physical evidence 
obtained from the compound is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Coker, an attorney for Sheila Martin, a surviving Branch Davidian who was 
not indicted, said the report could have a major effect on the trial's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people see that almost everybody from (former ATF director Stephen 
E.) Higgins on down has at one time or another lied about this case," Coker 
told reporters in Houston. "And if they would lie about those matters, why 
wouldn't they lie about other matters that are specific as to criminal 
charges?" 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins abruptly retired last fall. Five other ATF officials criticized in the 
report took early retirement or were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Selection of a jury is likely to take three to five days, after which 
testimony will begin, court officials said. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith 
moved the trial from Waco to San Antonio, 180 miles to the south, on grounds 
that it would be hard to find 12 jurors in the Waco area who did not already 
have opinions about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has ordered that names of prospective jurors be kept secret. They will 
be identified only by numbers to prevent them or their families from being 
harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has issued a gag order to prevent prosecutors and defense attorneys 
from discussing the case publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution is being led by the husband-and-wife team of Ray and LeRoy 
Jahn, the two assistant U.S. attorneys who obtained the 1982 conviction of 
Charles W. Harrelson for the assassination of U.S. District Judge John H. Wood 
Jr. of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge was shot in the back outside his San Antonio apartment in 1979, a 
crime that prompted a three-year, $7-million investigation by the FBI. 
Harrelson was sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Evidence indicated that 
he had been hired by a convicted drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Branch Davidian member Kathryn Schroeder will be the government's key 
witness. Initially indicted with the others, Schroeder pleaded guilty in 
September to reduced charges of "impeding federal agents with a deadly weapon" 
as part of a negotiated plea agreement. Her husband, Michael, died in 
February's raid. 
</P>
<P>
 While the nature of her testimony is not known by outside observers, Schroeder 
is expected to serve as the "inside witness" that is crucial to conspiracy 
prosecutions, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other women who left the compound soon after the siege began may be 
summoned as witnesses by the prosecution. Catherine Mattson, 75, and Margaret 
Lawson, 77, were initially jailed, but charges against them were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prosecutors are expected to play many hours of tape-recorded 
telephone conversations between cult members and federal negotiators during the 
long siege, as well as tape-recorded sounds captured by eavesdropping devices 
sent into the compound with food, videotapes and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 11 sect members on trial left the compound early in the siege, 
while others escaped during the fire. Three of the defendants are British -- 
Renos Avraam, Norman Allison and Livingston Fagan. The others, all U.S. 
citizens, are Brad Eugene Branch, Kevin Whitecliff, Clive Doyle, Jamie 
Castillo, Paul Fatta, Woodrow Kendrick, Graeme Craddock and Ruth Ottman Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indictment accuses them of conspiring "with malice aforethought" 
to kill ATF agents "on account of the performance of their duties." According 
to the charges, this conspiracy was led by Koresh, who "would and did advocate 
and encourage an armed confrontation" with the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, if convicted of conspiracy, face up to life imprisonment. 
Under federal conspiracy laws, anyone who contributes in any way to criminal 
actions by a group may be convicted. The defendants are also charged with 
lesser weapon offenses.

OIL SIPHONED FROM PUERTO RICO BARGE; SPILL: CREWS SEEK TO LIMIT CONTAMINATION. 
TOURISM OFFICIALS SEND OUT VIDEOTAPES OF UNHARMED COAST TO TRAVEL AGENTS TO 
ENHANCE THE AREA'S IMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Salvage workers continued their efforts Sunday to siphon oil from a leaking 
barge that ran aground near a major tourist area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, crews armed with skimmers and vacuum pumps worked to clean 
three miles of beachfront blackened by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the cleanup is going remarkably well for the magnitude of the 
accident," said Gov. Pedro Rossello, who added that he thought the spill had 
caused only a "temporary setback" to Puerto Rican tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the spill's effects on the image of this U. S. commonwealth, 
tourism officials are sending videotapes to media outlets and travel 
wholesalers on the Mainland, emphasizing that beachfronts of only two tourist 
hotels in San Juan were severely sullied by oil. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half of the 1.5 million gallons of fuel oil aboard the Morris J. 
Berman spilled onto the sands and lagoons in the Condado area early Friday 
after a tow line broke and the 302-foot-long barge smashed into the rocks, 
rupturing its hull. 
</P>
<P>
 To mitigate the effects on the environment, as well as to stop further 
contamination, cleanup crews quickly threw containment booms into a lagoon 
directly south of the stricken barge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of workers outfitted in white plastic suits almost immediately began 
sopping up the oil with everything from blotting mops to conveyor belts that 
pull the sludge from the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers late Saturday began pumping the remaining oil from the barge into a 
second barge towed into place nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard Cmdr. Robert Ross said 358,000 gallons of combined oil and water 
had been pumped out of the leaking barge by Sunday afternoon. The disabled 
barge should be emptied by today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny skies and balmy temperatures made the cleanup operation a popular Sunday 
attraction, with scores of residents watching workers and small boats plod 
through the thick oil. Traffic in the area was jammed as some motorists pulled 
to the sides of the road to look. 
</P>
<P>
 At sea, two westward-drifting oil slicks were being attacked just north of San 
Juan by the Coast Guard's Gulf Strike Team from Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Using special skimming equipment aboard a tug boat, the team collected some of 
the oil Saturday, but they were unable to work Sunday because of high seas, 
according to Coast Guard Petty Officer Toni Long-Gay. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the company that was operating the barge said cleanup expenses 
were running about $1 million a day. The effort to rid the shoreline of all 
traces of the spill would be a "long and costly process," said Pedro Rivera, 
general manager of the Bunker Group of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard, which is overseeing the operation, estimated a full cleanup 
would take at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commonwealth government has filed a federal lawsuit charging the Bunker 
Group and the owner of the barge, New Jersey-based New England Marine Service, 
with negligence.

GORE ASSAILS 'PANIC' OVER CLINTON OZARK INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore accused Republican leaders Sunday of exhibiting 
"political panic" by attacking President Clinton over his controversial 
investment in an ill-fated Ozark Mountain real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Gore defended the President, a prominent Senate Democrat joined 
GOP leaders in calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to 
investigate the First Family's ties to the owner of a failed Arkansas savings 
and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether some of the funds of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan were 
used during the 1980s to pay then-Gov. Clinton's political debts or were 
diverted to the Whitewater real estate partnership established by the Clintons 
and Madison Guaranty's owner, James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Presidents can't be seen to have any hesitation about any matter that 
concerns their propriety," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "Get it out -- no 
holding back. If there are things that are embarrassing, turn them over even 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," Gore said Clinton had already 
delivered "boxes and boxes" of his records on the real estate venture to 
Justice Department investigators and would turn over "every single shred" 
within a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department official in charge of the inquiry, Donald B. Mackay, is 
a career prosecutor with Republican credentials and unquestioned integrity, 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore insisted that Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had done 
nothing wrong, and that no one has made any specific allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What there has been is a series of political attacks," he said, a comment 
that appeared to be aimed at Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other 
GOP leaders who have criticized the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a little bit of political panic about the fact that 
everything is going so well (for Clinton), and so they are unleashing these 
attacks on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Gore's statements, Dole said White House blunders have created 
much of the controversy over Whitewater, and he renewed his call for 
appointment of a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President and Mrs. Clinton have done nothing wrong, which may indeed 
be the case, they deserve to have their names cleared in a manner in which the 
public will have complete confidence," Dole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, while agreeing that Clinton is an honorable man, said the danger in 
withholding information or rejecting requests for a special prosecutor is that 
the White House will appear to be stonewalling on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why isn't this all out in the open?" he asked rhetorically. "Do it. Come on. 
. . . Get some good lawyer working on that issue while we go ahead on other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting assessments came as McDougal was quoted as saying he does not 
believe that the Clintons lost as much money on the Whitewater development as 
they claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that he was relying only on his memory, McDougal told the 
Associated Press that he believed their loss on the 230-acre project was about 
$9,000, far short of the $69,000 cited by the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal insisted that the Clintons did nothing wrong, and he denied that he 
received any special benefits from his business dealings with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Madison Guaranty in 1989 cost the federal government $47 
million to pay off depositors. McDougal was acquitted in 1990 of federal 
charges that he mismanaged the thrift and arranged sham transactions to drive 
up real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Associated Press said the law firm in which Hillary 
Clinton was a partner provided state regulators with a rosy picture of the 
S&L's prospects less than a year before federal regulators warned that it was 
on the verge of going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 An audit by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in March, 1986, said some of the 
thrift's assets seemed to have been diverted improperly to McDougal, its owner 
at the time, the wire service said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank board report did not mention the Clintons or the Whitewater 
development, but it cautioned that risky land ventures and speculation in 
securities had brought the thrift to the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 This appraisal contrasted with a more optimistic evaluation of Madison 
Guaranty's future provided to state regulators in mid-1985 by the Rose Law 
Firm. Hillary Clinton had been placed on a $2,000 monthly retainer by McDougal 
to work on getting state approval for a plan to attract more capital for 
Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP said correspondence on the issue indicated that her role was limited, 
with most of the legal work for the thrift performed by an associate, Richard 
N. Massey.

 SHOULD TAXPAYERS SALUTE? A little-noticed congressional perk costs taxpayers a 
small bundle. . . . Every weekday, laborers stand on the Capitol roof and run 
hundreds of U.S. flags up and down six poles. Members of Congress mail the 
banners to constituents who request them, enclosing a certificate saying Old 
Glory was flown over the Capitol "especially for presentation" to the 
constituent -- or "in commemoration" of some birthday or other special event. 
The recipient is billed up to $17.48, depending on flag size. But taxpayers 
have to shell out more than $250,000 a year to pay for flying and handling the 
flags, which total 150,000. . . . "Sure, this is a great example of the power 
of incumbency -- a great vote-getter," confided an aide to a Southern 
California congressman. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CHECKS ON BANKS: The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, whose 
officials became known for extremely gracious living while they dealt with the 
financial troubles of rich and poor nations, are starting to pinch pennies. 
Both organizations have ordered staff to stop flying first class or staying at 
some of the world's most expensive hotels on overseas journeys. . . . The World 
Bank, jolted by cost overruns of more than $108 million on a new headquarters 
building two blocks from the White House, is reportedly planning other steps to 
improve its image before congressional critics take it to task for lavish 
spending. Although the United States now provides less than 20% of the support 
for the two international bodies, top officials fear a backlash on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BUFFING UP: Presidential hopefuls have a penchant for turning to entertainment 
television or soft magazines to repair damaged images -- i.e., Richard Nixon 
seeking to show he was hip and funny on "Laugh-In" in 1968, Bill Clinton 
riffing with saxophone and sunglasses on the "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1992. 
Now comes notoriously tough Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who wants to run in 1996. . 
. . He has told jokes on Jay Leno's "Tonight Show," appeared on "Murphy Brown" 
and most recently done a warm and fuzzy spread in People magazine. The pictures 
show Dole injured in World War II, crying in 1976 and sitting on the floor with 
his wife and their little dog, Leader. Despite his reputation "for harsh 
rhetoric," the story says, "he has been a pragmatic consensus builder." Yup, 
just a cuddly pol from small-town Kansas.

 NEXT TIME, A BULLETPROOF VEST: In the '90s, it apparently takes more than 
dressing for success to win. As things worsened for outgoing Defense Secretary 
Les Aspin, aides tried to rescue him with an image make-over. Targeted for 
annihilation: his old rumpled suits, including one sad number with brown 
checks, all of them befitting a tenured professor of dead languages better than 
the man in charge of the greatest military on Earth. . . . Aspin was told what 
kind of suits and shirts to buy -- and where to find them. Before long, he was 
sporting, among others, a rich gray suit, tab collars instead of his old frayed 
button downs and ties with made-for-TV red hues. "Only the pants were 
wrinkled," one associate said. But it wasn't enough. Within weeks, Aspin was 
out. . . . One bad sign, according to insiders: The defense chief hadn't seemed 
to realize why the new suits were necessary. PAUL HOUSTON and THOMAS B.

AMERICAN ALBUM: IT'S NOT WISE TO TRY TO DUMP ON FARMER MANNIX; VERMONT ORGANIC 
FOOD PRODUCER ENGAGES IN LEGAL CHESS GAME TO KEEP A LANDFILL FROM OPENING NEXT 
DOOR. 
</P>

 The Walker Farm is draped in folds of wind-blown snow, the greenhouse blowers 
silent, the front of the spacious vegetable store boarded up. Only the 
occasional truck or car on Route 5, passing within a few feet of the farmhouse, 
disturbs the stillness. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the 223-year-old wood-frame house, Jack Mannix and his wife, Karen, 
are busier than they would normally be in winter. The computer hums and the 
phone rings at a desk in the dining room near a hot wood stove. Buttons, bumper 
stickers and newsletters clutter a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than figuring out what new types of tomatoes they will plant in the 
spring, the Mannixes are waging a campaign to keep a landfill from opening next 
to their organic farm in this southeast corner of Vermont. They have raised 
over $10,000 from supporters, hired an engineer, enlisted an attorney and are 
now at what Mannix said is "move 10 of a 64-move chess game." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly the whole town of 1,800 residents has joined them, voting by a 10-1 
margin in a recent advisory referendum to keep the landfill away from the 
Walker Farm and out of Dummerston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried about the dust, the odor, the noise, the birds and the 
traffic," Mannix said. "And what about the perceived risk? How do people feel 
about buying food grown next to a landfill, especially organic food?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over landfills, once the bane of suburbanites, is moving to the 
country, with farmers in Upstate New York, Vermont and other rural areas 
realizing that they have become targets of municipal demand for garbage space. 
The landfill now serving Dummerston and 14 other Vermont towns is five miles 
south in Brattleboro. It also takes trash from Bennington, on the other side of 
the state, and, until recently, from towns in northeastern Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has ordered the landfill closed by October, 1995, because it does 
not have a plastic liner to prevent rainwater from filtering through the 
garbage and polluting the ground water. With such unlined landfills being 
phased out nationwide, waste officials here began looking for a new landfill 
location three years ago. Last summer, they settled on the spot next to the 
Walker Farm as the best of about 45 sites in the 350-square-mile Windham Solid 
Waste Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste district, which has only 14 employees and is hidden in a small 
office next to an aging shoe factory in Brattleboro, once enjoyed the anonymity 
of an efficient back-room bureaucracy. But the glare of publicity over the 
landfill changed all that. A few weeks ago, charges of mismanagement and 
violations of state rules brought to light by the anti-landfill effort led to 
the resignation of the district's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the waste district's undoing has been that it chose a site near the 
Walker Farm. The 65-acre enterprise has a loyal clientele for its produce and 
is also a supplier of greenhouse-grown bedding plants to dozens of area organic 
farmers every spring. In the seven months the farm is open, Mannix said, he 
sells about $250,000 in produce and plants to more than 30,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Mannix, the district did not take on a naive rustic. Now 44, he grew up 
in Connecticut, as did his wife, whom he met while attending Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 Their introduction to Vermont agriculture was a visit to Jack's grandfather at 
the farm in the summer of 1973. After two weeks of work, he and Karen decided 
to learn farming and stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the waste district, the Walker Farm location at first appeared to be a 
dream come true. Most of the region is mountains and outcrops of bedrock, but 
the 15-acre Walker parcel is nearly flat bottom land with a deep clay subsoil 
along the Connecticut River. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ballou, chairman of the agency's siting committee, said it intends to 
press forward with studies of the site to determine what might be necessary to 
mitigate possible harm to Walker Farm, an adjacent campground and a nearby 
elementary school. He said the goal all along has been to keep the trash in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that since we produce the trash, we ought to take care of it 
and not dump it in someone else's back yard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannix and his supporters don't dispute that notion, but they argue that 
there's room for a lined landfill next to the existing dump. He said the old 
landfill could be dug up and the material recycled in a process of reclamation 
and cleanup. He has hired engineers and consultants to study the issue and 
challenge the whole notion of a new landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're serious about being responsible for waste, they should clean up 
what they have," Mannix said. "We've backed away from saying they should put it 
in other areas of the county because from what we've learned, we don't want to 
wish this on anybody else."

NEWS ANALYSIS; BONN IS GIANT IN CHAINS AT NATO PARLEY; EUROPE: ECONOMICALLY

<P>
 In the uncertain thaw that has followed the end of the Cold War, the summit of 
the Western military alliance that begins here today carries a special meaning 
for one of its 16 members -- Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Soviet Union, the disappearance of its Communist empire 
during the last four years and the reunification of Germany have all combined 
to transform the Old World's political realities. Yet amid this sweeping 
change, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the fundamental 
reference point for German security policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ravings of neo-fascist Russian political figure Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, 
who last week suggested that a nuclear attack was the appropriate response to 
Germany's refusal to issue him a visa, have only underscored the fact that 
post-Cold War Europe remains anything but safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believed that these tensions, coupled with Bonn's role as NATO's richest 
and militarily strongest European member, would quickly elevate a united, fully 
sovereign Germany to a kind of "first among equals" status along with the 
United States in the task of shaping the alliance's future. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Still struggling to define its role in the world and preoccupied by domestic 
ills, Germany has failed to fill the leadership vacuum within the alliance that 
began to develop as a result of the Clinton Administration's initial focus on 
Asia and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the failure of Germany to become a beacon of vision and change in the 
new Europe is seen by many as a key reason the alliance finds itself searching 
so desperately for direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "NATO was once greater than the sum of its parts, but it's fast dissolving 
into 16 sovereign interests," said a respected German government security 
specialist who requested anonymity. "We're drifting on the high seas." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the reason for Germany's lack of influence lies in the disputed 
interpretation of its post-World War II constitution, which for decades has 
tightly limited the country's military role to actions within the territory of 
Atlantic Alliance countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to clarify or reinterpret this provision isolated Germany from 
other NATO allies during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and has left the Federal 
Constitutional Court, not Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, with the power 
to decide security matters. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the court that decided whether German military forces could be deployed 
to Somalia as part of a U.N. peacekeeping operation and whether German crew 
members could stay aboard NATO electronic surveillance aircraft deployed to 
enforce the U.N.-imposed "no-fly" zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Citing 
political rather than legal grounds, the court ruled in favor of both 
deployments.) 
</P>
<P>
 And while French and British troops provide the backbone of U.N. peacekeeping 
forces in Bosnia, both the constitutional question and a bitter history in the 
region preclude any German military involvement there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Germany remains a political dwarf on security issues central to 
its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 No one country, for example, is more eager to extend NATO's membership and its 
security guarantees eastward than Germany -- the nation on the eastern frontier 
of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire political architecture of Europe hangs on this question," declared 
Karl Lamers, a member of the German Parliament and the chief foreign affairs 
spokesman for Kohl's Christian Democrats. "We have to see this open flank and 
close it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this perceived urgency, Germany has found itself having to embrace the 
Clinton Administration's "Partnership for Peace" proposal, which goes only so 
far as to hold out the prospect of future membership for former Warsaw Pact 
nations such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not being taken seriously," the German government security specialist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hesitation to amend or reinterpret the constitution reflects an allergy 
among a cross-section of Germans to military action of any kind -- an aversion 
developed by hammering post-World War II generations about the horrors of their 
nation's earlier aggressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending the troops off to fight -- even in an honorable cause -- would win few 
political points today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet fearing that continued German reluctance to play an active role in 
European and global security matters could isolate Bonn further from its main 
alliance allies, Kohl has consistently pushed for greater involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, faced with an uphill reelection campaign later this year and saddled 
with a weak Cabinet, Kohl's chances of enhancing Germany's influence in the 
short term seem severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
 While Germany's role remains less than full-sized within the alliance, Bonn is 
expected to play a significant part in helping formulate the West's efforts to 
support reformist forces within Russia and its former European empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Germany's role as the major donor of Western assistance to 
Moscow, Kohl has managed to forge strong personal links with Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 He will emphasize those ties and his own position as one of Europe's senior 
leaders to press Germany's view of how to support reform in the former Soviet 
Bloc when he meets with President Clinton in Washington later this month.

6 KILLED, 30 HURT AS MUSLIMS, CROATS BATTLE IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim-led forces shelled the central Bosnian town of Vitez and battled 
Croatian troops in surrounding villages Sunday, killing six people and wounding 
30, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dead were three children. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. source in Vitez described the fighting as a limited offensive by the 
Bosnian army, which has surrounded a Croatian enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offensive was countered by Croatian forces, but the extent of the 
counterattack is not yet known," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, flew out of Sarajevo 
for peace talks in Bonn several hours behind schedule after a shell hit the 
center of the airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. Protection Force spokesman in the Bosnian capital blamed the shelling 
on Bosnian Serb forces surrounding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Izetbegovic told reporters that he was pessimistic about the outcome of the 
talks, attended also by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and international 
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.

2 KILLED IN S. AFRICA TOWNSHIP DURING VISIT BY ANC LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunfire erupted as a high-level African National Congress delegation toured 
this violence-plagued township Sunday. Two people, including a journalist, died 
in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Shariff, 31, a South African free-lance photographer on assignment for 
the Associated Press, was shot once and pronounced dead at Natalspruit Hospital 
in Katlehong. Witnesses said he was wounded in the back while running across a 
clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other journalists were injured, and police said they shot to death one man 
and arrested three people while confiscating four AK-47 automatic rifles. 
Township residents said at least two other people were also shot. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and Communist Party chief Joe Slovo led 
the delegation into Katlehong, one of South Africa's most violent townships, 
after recent reports that ANC supporters were attacking each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes after they started walking on a dirt road through a 
neighborhood of burned-out and damaged houses, shots rang out from the 
direction of a workers hostel dominated by Zulu supporters of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party, the ANC's main black rival. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela quickly blamed the government of President 
Frederik W. de Klerk for not cracking down on such violence, which he said is a 
daily occurrence in Katlehong, 12 miles southeast of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no excuse for the police not doing their duty. . . . The police 
should not allow any people to fire at innocent residents," he said in a 
televised interview Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial shots, gunfire crackled sporadically for 40 minutes from the 
area of the hostel and from AK-47s and handguns carried by scurrying township 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate information about the man killed by police or the other 
people wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the political fighting that killed more than 3,000 blacks last year, 
including 1,200 in Katlehong and the neighboring Thokoza township, stemmed from 
the ANC-Inkatha power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovo said he believed Inkatha supporters started the shooting, and that 
although police were present in the township, none were near where the gunfire 
occurred.

SUIT ACCUSES ACCOUNTING FIRM OF FRAUD; SECURITIES: INVESTORS FILE $1.1-BILLION 
LAWSUIT AGAINST ARTHUR ANDERSEN & CO., THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN A LONG 
FINANCIAL DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors in Prudential Securities' embattled petroleum partnerships have 
filed a $1.1-billion lawsuit in Orange County against Arthur Andersen & Co., 
the nation's largest accounting firm, in which they allege to have uncovered a 
massive accounting fraud in connection with the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, which played a 
lesser role in auditing financial statements of Prudential's Energy Income 
Funds, a series of oil-and-gas investment partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is the first time that the scandal has spread to the accounting 
industry. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said the accounting firm had done 
nothing improper, while Deloitte & Touche could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the investors were retirees or people near retirement. The Energy 
Income partnerships took in $1.44 billion from 1983 to 1990 from about 137,000 
investors, including an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 from California. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit marks the latest development in a long-running financial drama that 
has engulfed one of the nation's premier securities firms. Prudential's 
problems with these investments have already cost the securities firm dearly in 
settlements and judgments. The company is also the subject of a federal 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Prudential agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission by saying it would pay at least $371 million in penalties. 
But it neither admitted nor denied findings that it defrauded limited 
partnership investors. 
</P>
<P>
 If the claims in the latest legal action are substantiated, it could compound 
the legal woes of Chicago-based Arthur Andersen. Like other major accounting 
firms, Andersen in the last two years has been forced to make large settlements 
for allegedly negligent audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Ruane, a spokesman for Andersen, said the firm had not yet received a 
copy of the lawsuit. But, he said, "we are confident that we conducted our 
audits in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards and are unaware 
of any factual basis for a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman William J. Ahearn said the firm had not seen a copy of 
the suit and therefore didn't have any comment. The suit was filed late Friday 
in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the Orange County suit is noteworthy because it comes shortly 
before a federal judge in New Orleans is due to rule Jan. 19 on a proposed 
settlement in a separate class-action suit against Prudential involving the 
same partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Once approved, that settlement would ban most Energy Income investors from 
taking action against Prudential's accountants or other advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit in Orange County charges that Andersen, which audited the 
partnerships' books, allowed Prudential to issue false financial statements and 
prospectuses, hiding the fact that "profits" investors were receiving actually 
was their own money being paid back to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that, in effect, small investors paid substantially more than 
the true purchase price of oil and gas properties the partnerships acquired. 
The overpayments allegedly were later used to make the partnerships appear 
profitable when most were actually losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges include allegations that contracts for the purchase of oil and gas 
properties were backdated, often by months, court papers show. As much as 59% 
of the monthly profit distributions paid to investors in various partnerships 
was actually their own capital being returned to them, documents filed with the 
suit indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that Andersen, which audited the partnerships' financial 
statements, knew of the misrepresentations, but never disclosed them to 
investors. The audits were carried out by the accounting firm's office in New 
Orleans, located near the headquarters of now-defunct Graham Resources, the 
firm that managed the Energy Income partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Three senior Graham officials, including its treasurer and executive vice 
president, had previously been accountants in Andersen's New Orleans office. 
Andersen has denied that there was any improper relationship between that 
office and Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach attorney Jeff Dennis Ferentz, who joined Austin, Tex., lawyer 
Stuart C. Goldberg in filing the suit in Orange County against Andersen, said 
the $1.1 billion sought in damages represents the investors current 
out-of-pocket losses, plus 10% interest per year. (The suit was filed in 
California because so many of the investors live in the state.) 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also asks that treble damages be awarded.

TEENS FIND A HAVEN IN L.A. PROGRAM; EDUCATION: FOR GAY STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN 
HARASSED OR ISOLATED IN REGULAR SCHOOLS, EAGLES CENTER OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
DROPPING OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL and TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pleased, shy grin spreads over Christine's face as she talks about her first 
few days at the EAGLES Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flattered," she says. "They were very warm. They thought I was cute. . 
. . This is the best situation I've ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly it was a change for the 16-year-old, who says she left Theodore 
Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights after hearing rumors that someone had 
compiled a list of gay students "who were going to get bashed. . . . I didn't 
like that school no more. I got too much hassles there." 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of 35 students enrolled in EAGLES (Emphasizing Adolescent Gay, 
Lesbian Education Services), an alternative public high school program for gay 
youths started by the Los Angeles school district in 1992. Only the second of 
its kind in the nation -- the first was the Harvey Milk School in New York City 
-- EAGLES takes teen-agers who have had school problems because of their 
homosexuality. Harassed, bashed or isolated in their regular schools, some drop 
out. Others think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need a chance, a real chance," says the program's founder, Jerry Battey, 
50, a talkative, graying teacher who plays counselor, administrator and 
self-esteem booster. "But because of who they are, most people don't have the 
time or the inclination to give them that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, roughly half of the 35 showed up -- about the usual number -- 
for 4 1/2 hours of study in a program that will lead to a high school diploma. 
They gather in several rooms in a building owned by a community group. Like 
other branches of Central High School, the district's alternative high school, 
EAGLES operates away from school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The teaching assistant makes vain attempts to quiet the constant chatter. A 
few students, including Christine, work diligently at their assignments. "This 
ain't nothing compared to my old school," she shrugs. "They used to have little 
radios. At least here they don't have music on." 
</P>
<P>
 At another table sits Daisy, 17, wearing a leopard-print jumpsuit, bright 
lipstick, fingernail polish and a crucifix necklace. She used to be Andy, she 
explains, but after a sex-change operation in Mexico paid for with hustling 
money, she took a new name. At 13, she says, she was thrown out of her 
South-Central Los Angeles home by her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived at EAGLES a few weeks ago after someone on the street gave her a 
flyer about the school. For Battey, simply that she is there is a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry, 17, says he decided that it was time to "check out" of Marshall High 
School the day two gang members robbed him of $5, and then as a parting shot, 
shouted an anti-gay slur and a warning: "You better watch yourself." It was the 
fourth time in less than a year that he had dropped out because of threats of 
physical violence and constant name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 At EAGLES, he says, "I am finally comfortable coming to school. I can talk the 
way I want. Act the way I want. I don't have to pretend to be someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Battey and his principal, Beth Newman, say they have received enough inquiries 
about EAGLES from throughout the district to merit the program's expansion. 
They are proposing that the center spread to eight locations with 16 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just here to educate students according to state guidelines," Newman 
says. "If this is the only way we can educate these youngsters, we will do it."

QUAYLE CITES 'BIGOTRY' AGAINST CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle told more than 2,000 churchgoers in the 
northern Los Angeles County city of Lancaster on Sunday that they must "come 
out of the closet" to proclaim publicly the importance of religion and family 
values, despite what he termed widespread "bigotry" against conservative 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a $100-a-plate breakfast and later at a church dedication 
ceremony, Quayle also thanked President Clinton for noting recently that Quayle 
had raised a valid point in the family values campaign debate after Quayle 
criticized the TV character Murphy Brown.On Sunday, Quayle said he has "the 
greatest admiration for single mothers" and meant "all of our values." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle told the Lancaster Baptist Church gathering: "We need to come out of 
the closet and speak up for family values like responsibility, integrity, hard 
work, fidelity and compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained that fundamentalist Christians are "taught to be tolerant 
of others," but are often the objects of intolerance. "Today, the only 
acceptable form of bigotry in our society is bigotry against conservative 
Christians," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gatekeepers of our culture almost to an individual are antagonistic. And 
they have successfully characterized conservative Christians as right-wing 
fanatics, even terrorists and bombers," an apparent allusion to recent attacks 
on abortion clinics and doctors.

<P>
 Sonny Bono, the former mayor of the desert resort, said he will announce his 
candidacy for Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono said he will announce Tuesday that he is seeking the Republican 
nomination for the seat of Rep. Al McCandless."This is the best job for me," 
Bono said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless, a Republican, declared last week that he will not seek a seventh 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono, 58, made his comments during a reception at his home for actress Sophia 
Loren, who was honored during the Palm Springs International Film Festival. 
Bono helped found the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono ran for the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate in 1992 but lost the 
primary to conservative commentator Bruce Herschensohn, who was defeated by 
Democrat Barbara Boxer.

O.C. LEGISLATORS, FOR ONCE, CAN GO WITH FLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's state lawmakers have had a knack for going their own way, 
struggling in vain against the political tide in a Democrat-dominated 
Legislature. But this year the currents may be shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues ranging from crime to illegal immigration to streamlining the 
bureaucracy, members of the county delegation say they believe that some of the 
conservative ideas they've loyally espoused for years may finally be embraced 
beneath the Capitol dome. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state budget once again facing the possibility of a major deficit, 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) is optimistic that lawmakers will 
take major steps to revamp the bloated bureaucracy and slash costs. Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) hopes the state's fiscal woes will augment her 
long-running effort to enable county governments to farm out more jobs to the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Assemblymen Mickey Conroy of Orange and Bill Morrow, whose district 
includes a large swath of South County, sense that public ire over illegal 
immigration could help some of their proposals gain acceptance. And Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) feels that widespread concern over crime will 
boost his plan to sentence young offenders to terms in a militaristic, 1990s 
version of the reform school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public pressure on crime has clearly developed such a head of steam that 
those who don't want to be on board the train are at least wanting to get off 
the tracks," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton), one of several 
lawmakers pushing a "three strikes and you're out" measure to ensure that 
habitual criminals get life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from crime, the Orange County delegation's often-espoused rhetoric about 
curtailing government spending and streamlining the bureaucracy could also meet 
with more success than ever before, some Capitol insiders believe. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sacramento lobbyist noted that the Legislature seems intent this year on 
eliminating several "redundant" state agencies altogether, an idea championed 
for several years by Orange County conservatives. "They could have a lot of 
success this year," said the lobbyist, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took baby steps last year," said Joe Yocca, top Capitol aide for state 
Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove). "We feel this Legislature can continue that 
momentum and produce more reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of the measures win approval could depend to a degree on the 
caprices of electoral politics. This year, all but two members of the Orange 
County delegation will face reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year will be extremely political," Ferguson predicted. "It will be 
reflected in every bill and certainly the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bergeson, whose Senate seat is safe until 1996, is planning a campaign 
this year: She wants to return to Orange County as a county supervisor. In the 
meantime, Capitol insiders expect Ferguson and Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) to cross swords as they eye the Senate seat Bergeson would vacate. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's lone Democrat, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, 
probably will be playing politics at the statewide level. As an expected 
candidate for state attorney general, Umberg is pushing a plethora of public 
safety bills to help cement him as one of the Democratic Party's top crime 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, meanwhile, are tackling heady new responsibilities within the 
Republican Party. Hurtt has assumed the top post on the Senate Republican 
election committee, putting him in a pivotal position to steer funds to 
Republican candidates in 1994 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle, meanwhile, is the Assembly's new assistant GOP leader and will be a 
point man in upcoming budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the $55.4-billion spending plan Gov. Wilson proposed Friday, which 
includes a $3-billion deficit the governor hopes to cover with federal funds, 
could set the tone for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After the debacle of a 63-day budget stalemate in 1992, the Legislature worked 
together last year to pass a spending blueprint nearly on time. That bipartisan 
spirit spilled over into a variety of other issues, including workers 
compensation reform and a variety of other pro-business measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians have short memories, but I think everyone in the Capitol can 
remember back to 1992," Umberg said. "That was an embarrassment for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, however, predicts that Republican-blessed budgetary reforms designed 
to dramatically alter the size and shape of government will probably be put off 
once again. "I don't think the will is there," he said. "This year will be be 
the same old thing -- rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic." 
</P>
<P>
 On the home front, several lawmakers plan to introduce legislation that would 
directly benefit voters in Orange County. Bergeson's bill to contract out more 
county government jobs, an idea that has repeatedly been thwarted by labor 
unions, could gain new momentum as she scales back the plan to a pilot project, 
with Orange County one of about half a dozen jurisdictions affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson is also amending a bill to include legislation that would give Orange 
County and other Southland areas ravaged by the fall firestorms tax relief from 
the state. Ferguson plans to carry a similar bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, meanwhile, is making a statement on the fires in another way, by 
proposing tough new penalties for arsonists, an idea that was embraced by Gov. 
Pete Wilson in his State of the State address last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow is using a recent scandal at the Santa Margarita Water District to 
propel legislation that would limit gifts and perks for all elected local 
government officials to $250 a year. The district's two top managers retired 
after reports by The Times of excessive spending and gift-taking sparked a 
criminal investigation of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg will carry a bill left over from last year that would stiffen 
gift-reporting requirements for officials of special districts like the Santa 
Margarita water district. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most of the rest of the Legislature, crime is the Orange County 
contingent's top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Umberg each are carrying "three-strikes" anti-crime measures. 
Umberg also plans to push anew for legislation vetoed by Wilson last year that 
would have required wealthy prison inmates to pay the costs of their 
incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's reform school proposal would send juveniles convicted of a third 
serious offense to a "boot-camp environment" where they would be required to 
complete high school and train for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Ferguson proposal would help law enforcement officials keep better 
track of registered sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's big effort will be for improved school safety. She will sponsor three 
bills, including one to require immediate expulsion for any student found on 
campus with a weapon, another to make schools "gun-free zones" and a third to 
toughen laws against trespassing on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, meanwhile, plans to press ahead with a domestic violence bill that 
stalled last year in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow wants legislation allowing school boards to expel students who publicly 
profess membership in a street gang, an idea sure to cause fireworks with civil 
libertarians. To reduce court costs, Morrow intends to introduce a bill 
lowering the number of jurors needed in a criminal trial from the current dozen 
to 10 or 8. Finally, the assemblyman will push a measure designed to speed the 
execution of death-row inmates by ensuring that they are more quickly assigned 
attorneys to handle their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because tougher sentencing requirements are expected to flood the state's 
prisons with more inmates, Hurtt wants to focus on cutting costs in the penal 
system. He plans to introduce a bill that would make prisoners work, much as 
they do in Texas, where inmates tend cattle, grow vegetables and harvest 
cotton, providing the system with most of the raw materials it needs for food 
and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers also intend to tackle aspects of illegal immigration. Umberg 
is carrying a bill that would impose state sanctions on employers who hire 
illegal immigrants. Conroy has three immigration bills that remain from last 
year, among them legislation prohibiting illegal immigrants from attending 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow plans to introduce bills that would attempt to measure the impact of 
illegal immigrants on health, welfare, law enforcement and higher education, 
giving the state more ammunition in its fight with the federal government for 
reimbursement of the cost of supplying those services to undocumented 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulatory reform will also be a focus of the delegation. State Sen. John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange), Johnson and Pringle will continue their efforts to strip 
power from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the tough regional 
agency they contend is hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, owner of a Garden Grove manufacturing plant, wants to help free 
enterprise by easing business taxes. Morrow also proposes eliminating corporate 
taxes. Bergeson is championing the creation of a state "infrastructure bank" 
that would help finance the roads, bridges and sewers that allow for business 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson also plans a bill to ease teacher credential requirements for 
laid-off workers, particularly those from the aerospace industry. Allen wants 
to help business by continuing her efforts to streamline the California 
Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 On the education front, Lewis would allow schools to save money by contracting 
out janitorial services, cafeteria work and other jobs not associated with the 
classroom. He reasons that more money would then be available for classroom 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Lewis bill would make it easier for districts to create "charter 
schools," which would be free of many state educational requirements, allowing 
educators "to design curriculum better suited to local needs," Lewis said.

ACCOUNT FIRM ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN O.C. SUIT; COURTS: ACTION IS LATEST 
DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES' EMBATTLED PETROLEUM PARTNERSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors in Prudential Securities' embattled petroleum partnerships have 
filed a $1.1-billion lawsuit in Orange County against Arthur Andersen & Co., 
the nation's largest accounting firm, in which they allege to have uncovered a 
massive accounting fraud in connection with the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, also names the accounting 
firm of Deloitte & Touche, which played a lesser role in auditing financial 
statements of Prudential's Energy Income Funds, a series of oil-and-gas 
investment partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is the first time that the scandal has spread to the accounting 
industry. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said the accounting firm had done 
nothing improper, while Deloitte & Touche could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the investors were retirees or people near retirement. The Energy 
Income partnerships took in $1.44 billion from 1983 to 1990 from about 137,000 
investors, including an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a number of investors from Orange County," Jeff Dennis Ferentz, a 
Newport Beach attorney and co-counsel for the plaintiffs, said Sunday. "The 
target group Prudential went after were the elderly -- the retiring and the 
retired -- and these partnerships were sold as proven winners when, in fact, 
they were losers. Many of the investors are furious." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit marks the latest development in a long-running financial drama that 
has engulfed one of the nation's premier securities firms. Prudential's 
problems with these investments have already cost the securities firm dearly in 
settlements and judgments. The company is also the subject of a federal 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Prudential agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission by saying it would pay at least $371 million in penalties. 
But it neither admitted nor denied findings that it defrauded limited 
partnership investors. 
</P>
<P>
 If the claims in the latest legal action are substantiated, it could compound 
the legal woes of Chicago-based Arthur Andersen. Like other major accounting 
firms, Andersen in the last two years has been forced to make large settlements 
for allegedly negligent audits. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the accounting giant agreed to pay $82 million to settle a suit 
brought by the Resolution Trust Corp. contending that Andersen had negligently 
audited the books of Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings & Loan and another 
failed thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Ruane, a spokesman for Andersen, said the firm had not yet received a 
copy of the lawsuit. But, he said, "we are confident that we conducted our 
audits in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards and are unaware 
of any factual basis for a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman William J. Ahearn said the firm had not seen a copy of 
the suit and therefore didn't have any comment. The suit was filed late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the Orange County suit is noteworthy because it comes shortly 
before a federal judge in New Orleans is due to rule Jan. 19 on a proposed 
settlement in a separate class-action suit against Prudential involving the 
same partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Once approved, that settlement would ban most Energy Income investors from 
taking action against Prudential's accountants or other advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit in Orange County charges that Andersen, which audited the 
partnerships' books, allowed Prudential to issue false financial statements and 
prospectuses, hiding the fact that "profits" investors were receiving actually 
was their own money being paid back to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that, in effect, small investors paid substantially more than 
the true purchase price of oil and gas properties the partnerships acquired. 
The overpayments allegedly were later used to make the partnerships appear 
profitable when most were actually losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges include allegations that contracts for the purchase of oil and gas 
properties were backdated, often by months, court papers show. As much as 59% 
of the monthly profit distributions paid to investors in various partnerships 
was actually their own capital being returned to them, documents filed with the 
suit indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that Andersen, which audited the partnerships' financial 
statements, knew of the misrepresentations, but never disclosed them to 
investors. The audits were carried out by the accounting firm's office in New 
Orleans, located near the headquarters of now-defunct Graham Resources, the 
firm that managed the Energy Income partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Three senior Graham officials, including its treasurer and executive vice 
president, had previously been accountants in Andersen's New Orleans office. 
Andersen has denied that there was any improper relationship between that 
office and Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Ferentz, who joined Austin, Tex., lawyer Stuart C. Goldberg in filing 
the suit in Orange County against Andersen, said the $1.1 billion sought in 
damages represents the investors current out-of-pocket losses, plus 10% 
interest per year. (The suit was filed in California because so many of the 
investors live in the state.) 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also asks that in addition to that treble damages be awarded based on 
a provision of California law that allows damages to be multiplied in cases 
involving senior citizens or disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges in the suit center on what were called "pre-closing revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham would sign a contract to buy oil and gas properties for the 
partnerships. As with buying a house, there would be a closing later, when the 
properties actually changed hands. But because the oil and gas from the 
properties was being sold continuously, the properties continued to generate 
revenue between the time the contract was signed and the closing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the date of closing, the seller would pay Graham these "pre-closing 
revenues." Under accounting rules, this payment is supposed to be treated as a 
reduction in purchase price, not profit, but nevertheless was booked as profit 
in the partnerships financial statements, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham and sellers routinely agreed to back-date the effective dates of the 
contract -- not only to before the contract was actually signed but before 
Graham even had made a bid for the properties, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 This arrangement allegedly enabled Graham to collect more from investors than 
the properties were worth, and use the overpayments to make investors believe 
that they were receiving profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like having a prenuptial agreement effective before you even met 
the woman," Goldberg said. "It's phony."

PITCHESS JAIL FIGHT INVOLVES 600 INMATES; VIOLENCE: GUARDS FIRE RUBBER BULLETS 
TO END BRAWL FEATURING HOMEMADE KNIVES AND BROOMSTICKS. EIGHTY ARE INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 600 Latino and African American inmates battled with homemade knives 
and broomsticks in maximum-security dormitories at Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho Sunday before dozens of jail guards firing rubber bullets broke up the 
melee, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty inmates were injured, including 24 who were hospitalized with stab 
wounds, severe cuts and head injuries. No jail deputies were hurt in the 
incident, which officials described as one of the biggest brawls in recent 
years in the county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the fighting broke out simultaneously at 20 separate dormitories 
at 3:55 p.m. Inmates battled for 25 minutes with jail-made knives, broomsticks, 
"anything they could get their hands on" before deputies could subdue them, 
said Benita Hinojos, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojos said the cause of the brawl is under investigation but would not 
speculate on the possibility that the fight was prearranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation into the exact cause is ongoing and possible disciplinary, 
criminal charges and transfers are pending," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty to 75 deputies fired rubber bullets and pellets from shotguns and rifles 
and tossed grenade-like bombs containing rubber pellets to stop the fights, 
Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies at the nearby Santa Clarita station were placed on standby in the 
event that the scuffles erupted again Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the most seriously injured inmates were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, and about 20 others were taken to the 
hospital ward at the Men's Central Jail in Downtown Los Angeles, Hinojos said. 
Another 50 inmates were treated at a clinic at the Pitchess facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had problems in areas where inmates congregate, but never one with this 
many inmates actually fighting," said Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials said that although they didn't know if the fight was 
prearranged, inmates can see inside the five dorms where the brawls erupted, so 
that inmates in one dorm could join a fight that broke out in another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is visual contact between the dorms and (inmates) hear radio traffic. 
When deputies respond to a disturbance, they know it," Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial differences were identified as the primary motive in most of the 
facility's 53 reported inmate clashes in 1993, prompting some administrators to 
consider separating inmates by race. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially tinged fighting among inmates also broke out on consecutive days last 
week in the holding cell at the downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything in our power to try to prevent this kind of thing, 
short of segregating inmates," Cmdr. Ken Bayless of the sheriff's jail division 
told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "And , frankly, we've thought of that."

STREET SMART: ROAD TO A SMOOTH RIDE IS PAVED WITH BUMPY POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, you answered a question about how soon the city was going to 
repave a section of Roscoe Boulevard that was in poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the same question about a stretch of Foothill Boulevard that runs 
through Tujunga. In the 34 years I have lived in a section of La Crescenta that 
is now part of the city of Glendale, our stretch of Foothill Boulevard has been 
repaved or resurfaced four times that I can recall. 
</P>
<P>
 But next door in Tujunga, it seems to me that Foothill has never been repaved. 
The road there has lots of patches and filled-in cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 So how about it? Will this street ever get off the bottom of the repaving 
list? Is it even on that list? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Olmstead 
</P>
<P>
 La Crescenta 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 A better question is: Whose list should it appear on? Everyone agrees that 
this stretch of Foothill Boulevard needs repair. But the city won't fix it 
because the road belongs to the state. Yet the state won't fix it until the 
city agrees to take responsibility for the road after it has been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Got that? We didn't think so. Well, let's try to untangle it on this week's 
episode of "Take My Potholes -- Please!" 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Foothill Boulevard was the main state highway serving the 
northeast Valley. Then, Caltrans built the Foothill Freeway. Under state law, 
when a freeway replaces a surface street, the state can turn that street over 
to the locals if it is in good repair. 
</P>
<P>
 That last phase is the kicker. The city refused to accept a road that needed 
millions of dollars in repairs. At the same time, Caltrans did not want to dump 
lots of money into a road it planned to give away. 
</P>
<P>
 So Foothill Boulevard was neglected while the two sides haggled over what it 
would take to put the road in "good repair." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the city and Caltrans reached a tentative agreement four months 
ago. It calls for Caltrans to spend about $7 million to fix up Foothill between 
Lowell and Wheatland avenues. The project is being added to the agency's 
1996-97 budget, but the work could be done sooner if other funds are found, 
says Jack Hallin, a Caltrans deputy district director. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city approves the repairs, this section of Foothill will be handed 
over to Los Angeles for maintenance. (The city has already taken over the 
stretch between Wheatland and Paxton Street and is negotiating for the section 
between the Foothill and Antelope Valley freeways.) 
</P>
<P>
 So, be patient. And bear in mind that Foothill will probably be fixed long 
before the city and Caltrans settle their differences over that other busy 
state road, Topanga Canyon Boulevard. But that's another story. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My curiosity has been piqued by a sign that is located on Ventura Boulevard, 
one block east of Reseda Boulevard. It says, "Bus Emitter On." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm wondering: What is a bus emitter, and why does it have to be on? 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Simons 
</P>
<P>
 Encino 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Our curiosity was piqued too. We wondered how serious this warning was. Were 
buses sending out powerful signals that could disrupt your car radio, or worse, 
your pacemaker? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth turned out to be a little less dramatic. This sign was installed in 
the late 1980s, when the city and the old Southern California Rapid Transit 
District launched an experiment aimed at improving the flow of traffic on 
bustling Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some RTD buses were equipped with an "emitter," a device that sends out pulses 
of light, sort of like the remote control units that some televisions use. The 
bus emitters sent a signal to receivers on traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
 With these devices, a bus driver could keep a traffic signal green for an 
extra 10 seconds or cause a red light to end 10 seconds early, making it easier 
for the bus to get through the intersection without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 This program did cut bus travel time, but a few glitches occurred, says Brian 
Gallagher, a city transportation engineer. Even though they got through each 
intersection more quickly, some bus drivers then had to wait longer at each bus 
stop to avoid running ahead of their published schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the RTD sometimes sent the few buses equipped with emitters to other 
parts of the city, where the traffic signals had no receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, some Ventura Boulevard bus drivers forgot when to turn the emitters 
on and off. That led to the sign you saw -- it was put up to remind the bus 
drivers to turn their emitters on. 
</P>
<P>
 This program ended in late 1990, when the city switched to a new signal system 
that didn't work with these emitters. The sign is still up because the city 
plans to revive this project in the near future. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The public parkway along the west side of Vineland Avenue between Acama and 
Aqua Vista streets has become the bane of our existence. It's unplanted, 
unkempt, the site of much dumping (until recently, two sofas were sitting 
there) and is otherwise just plain ugly! 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that it obliterates the appeal of Vineland across the street from the 
Beverly Garland Hotel, perhaps the hotel -- if not the city -- would want to 
join an effort to beautify this strip. 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, this is the first impression they get of Studio City. Perhaps 
the Studio City Residents Assn. would care to help. But take my word on it: 
This parkway drags an otherwise pretty area down. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Baker 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 This is a city-owned parkway, and the city's lot cleaning division is supposed 
to keep it tidy. But because of a hiring freeze and limited resources, the 
crews only get to this parkway once every six to 12 months, says Sal 
Mangiameli, a superintendent with the division. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the most recent cleanup took place Jan. 3, shortly after your question 
came in, so maybe it looks better now. City crews will clear debris and weeds, 
but they won't do any planting or more ambitious beautification. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., lives 
near this parkway and knows how unattractive it is. He promised to help you 
organize volunteers and contact nearby businesses to get this parkway spruced 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 If a city parkway has lots of debris or constitutes a safety hazard that 
requires immediate attention, you can call the service request line run by the 
city's Bureau of Street Maintenance at (213) 485-5661.

NOT EVEN A SPECK ON THE MAP

<P>
 At its smallest point, you can throw a football from one end of the community 
to another. It's so new the local pizza delivery man wouldn't know where to 
send your pie. And if you get lost looking for it, forget about asking for 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, Sherman Village?" growled Neil Auyoub, manager of a Shell 
gas station at Magnolia Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon Avenue. "Never heard of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the lost Village of Sherman, where many people like Auyoub who live 
or work there simply, well, don't know that they live or work there. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the city is considering official borders for San Fernando 
Valley communities, the creation of Sherman Village in September illustrates 
the confusion that many Valley residents have about such boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in Valley, uh, it's Valley something. Valley View. I forget," said 
48-year-old Oscar Sabado as he scratched his head, trying to recall what he 
tells out-of-towners when they ask where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Sabado, a front desk manager at the Best Western Mikado Motel on 
Riverside Drive, needed prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Sherman Village," Sabado smiled when reminded of 
the community's new moniker. "It's very confusing, sometimes. I don't know why 
they changed it. The atmosphere is just not a village for me. It's more like a 
small city." 
</P>
<P>
 With only about 40 homes and one mailman within its boundaries, however, 
Sherman Village can challenge that point. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change was accomplished after residents petitioned City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky to remove them from the no-man's land between Sherman Oaks and 
North Hollywood after Valley Village was created in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundaries include Coldwater Canyon Avenue from the Ventura Freeway to 
Burbank Boulevard on the west, the Tujunga Wash on the east, the Ventura 
Freeway on the south and a 10-yard sliver on the north at Burbank Boulevard 
between Coldwater Canyon and the Tujunga Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just woke up one morning and realized we did not touch North Hollywood but 
were a part of it," said Mike Russell, 48, president of the Sherman Village 
Homeowners Assn., which lobbied for the name change. "It didn't make any sense 
to be a part of a community that we weren't even touching." 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be a while before the new name catches on. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two signs marking Sherman Village, both well inside the 
community's boundaries. To people heading south, Sherman Village might as well 
not exist. The only sign in this direction in Sherman Village is at Burbank and 
Coldwater. 
</P>
<P>
 And it welcomes visitors to Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 But city workers who put up the signs should not feel too bad. Even the phone 
company can't help you locate Sherman Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a city called Sherman Village," snapped Pacific Bell Operator 
746, who acknowledged North Hollywood and Chatsworth. "I'm positive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like people are rushing to find Sherman Village, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only ones who drive through here are lost and who are trying to get to 
the other side of the wash," said Diane Love, who lives on one of the three 
tiny residential streets with her husband, Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are businesses running out and buying signs to identify themselves as 
being in Sherman Village. From the lone car dealership to office buildings, 
many businesses still carry the North Hollywood name on their store windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers simply do not know they are in a village. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the street we got signs that say Sherman Oaks and one street behind us 
it says Valley Village," said a befuddled Charles Echols, shift manager of 
Pizza Hut Delivery on Coldwater as he gazed at a city map. "I don't know where 
Sherman Village is." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the label "village" -- chosen because the community is located between 
Sherman Oaks and Valley Village -- is a source of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's very quiet," Russell said. "From that standpoint, it's like a 
village." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell points to the heart of Sherman Village at La Maida Street and Bluebell 
Avenue, which is indeed reminiscent of a peaceful Midwestern enclave. American 
flags swing softly in the breeze, a mother pushes her baby in a stroller, and 
there is a noticeable absence of security fences. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents say this atmosphere is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a quaint, little village by any means," said resident Emily Kaplan, 
34, who lives there with her husband and two children. "We've been here eight 
years and have been burglarized three times and had cars stolen off the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Village does have a few draws, however. Many come for the care at 
North Hollywood Medical Center and Riverside Convalescent Hospital, both 
located on Riverside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Others come to take better care of themselves. There's a fitness center at 
Coldwater and Chandler Boulevard, near the community's only green space, a 
small park with pine trees that attracts joggers. And then there's Smokey Joe's 
restaurant, near the corner of Riverside and Coldwater, which draws the likes 
of Billy Crystal and Bob Hope for mouthwatering barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these landmarks have yet to grant Sherman Village a clear-cut 
identity that alerts the community and visitors to the name change. 
</P>
<P>
 This may come in February, when the City Council's Public Works Committee is 
expected to consider adopting an official map of the city's new community 
boundaries, including Sherman Village. If the proposal is approved, Sherman 
Village would have its place on the map and, perhaps, its identity. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents, such as Patrice Mengell, care less about knowing where 
they live than being able to afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the rent goes down, then I love Sherman Village," said Mengell, 23, who 
pays $700 a month for a two-bedroom apartment on Coldwater. "Until then, you 
can call it Sherman Whatever."

MAN, 30, SHOT TO DEATH AT SYLMAR PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old Riverside County man was shot and killed at a party in Sylmar 
this weekend, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Bailey, an unemployed custodian from the desert community of Blythe, was 
found dead at the scene of the shooting, which appears to have been 
gang-related, said Sgt. Frank Reynoso of the Foothill Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoso said several members from opposing gangs came to a party Saturday 
night in the 13300 block of Dyer Avenue, and an altercation began. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are continuing to investigate the killing and there were no 
suspects in custody Sunday, Reynoso said.

FIGHT OUTSIDE BAR LEAVES 1 DEAD, 2 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed and two other men were wounded in a fight outside a bar in 
North Hollywood on Sunday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Rocha, 35, of North Hollywood was shot once in the upper body and died 
in the street outside the El Senioral bar at 5761 Lankershim Blvd.A second man, 
Felipe Rodriguez, 21, of North Hollywood, was shot once in the chest and was 
also found in the street. He was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center, where he 
was in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man, Daniel Rosales, 22, of Hollywood, who suffered two knife wounds, 
was arrested inside the bar on suspicion of murder, said Detective Mike Coffey. 
Coffey said Rodriguez would also be arrested on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coffey, as many as five people began fighting inside the bar 
about 1 a.m. The men decided to go outside to settle their differences, and 
knives and a gun were produced. Police later found a knife and a gun at the 
scene.

VALLEY CHRONCICLE: FOR THIS STRAY IGUANA, HOME IS WHERE THE ELECTRIC BLANKET IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was gone. The Piras had looked everywhere, but their 1 1/2-year-old pet 
had vanished without a trace. Gene and Teri Pira and the kids had looked inside 
the house and all around their Northridge neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 No Iggy. 
</P>
<P>
 She was simply nowhere around. 
</P>
<P>
 "She disappeared right before Christmas, when there was a lot of activity in 
the house, so we figured she got out when the door was left open," Teri Pira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggy is actually Lena's pet, and the 13-year-old honor student at Northridge 
Middle School was disconsolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, the Piras put an ad in a local paper. The ad, amid all the lost dog 
and cat notices, explained the Piras were looking for their pet iguana, which 
was described as being 2 1/2 pounds and four feet long, "but friendly and 
green." 
</P>
<P>
 They got not one phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piras' holiday spirit was dampened. Even Gumby, her foul-tempered buddy, 
seemed to sense something untoward was happening. Gumby, a 3-pound, 
four-foot-long male iguana, belongs to Thomas Pira, 10, who looks after his 
care and feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The pets were given to the youngsters, with their parents' approval, by a 
friend from the First Baptist Church of Northridge who wanted to encourage 
their interest in the care and feeding of reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumby and Iggy were kept in separate aquariums -- Gumby, the family 
discovered, should really be called Grumpy. He is euphemistically described as 
being aggressive, the macho hunk. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say he is a bad iguana, according to Teri Pira. "Gumby licks 
tears from the kids' faces when they cry," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gumby likes to be the center of attention when the iguanas are out of 
their 90-degree, climate-controlled shelters, and he would not, for a minute, 
play dress up the way Iggy seemed to like to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggy apparently liked it when Lena put her in little costumes. One of the 
favorites was the Zorro look, which included a hat, cape and sword. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had almost lost hope when, a few days ago, Teri Pira was cleaning 
out some stored Christmas boxes from a part of the house that's being 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Iggy, looking cold, forlorn and frightened in an area where the 
Piras had searched countless times before. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggy was wrapped in an electric blanket until she was sufficiently thawed out. 
Then everyone took turns petting and fussing over her. 
</P>
<P>
 So, everyone's thrilled at the return of Iggy. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not Gumby. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the jury is still out. Zen Therapy Is So L.A., Dahling 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until the New Yorkers hear about this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a little something to brighten their Dante-esque existence, and have 
them tripping all over their stale little L. A. cliches. There's an Encino 
therapist who is now offering Zen meditation in conjunction with introspective 
group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it too cute? 
</P>
<P>
 She says meditation at the beginning of a session opens people to learn about 
themselves more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearing your mind of extraneous thoughts helps bring focus to the work of 
dealing with past experiences," according to Paula Jakunin Fuld, "and helps you 
get on with making a creative future for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her traditional practice, Fuld is now working with two small 
groups of meditating clients. One group meets Monday evenings and the other on 
Friday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuld says this experimental technique is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are frightened by the painful memories meditation seems to bring 
up so quickly. Others are simply unable to sit still," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she adds, for those who are comfortable with this approach, it can speed 
up the discovery of past trauma and facilitate the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuld is, as far as she knows, the only one in the country practicing this 
approach in a psychological practice. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's able to do this pioneering work because of the dual nature of 
her area of expertise. She's published on both Zen and traditional therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 For New York scoffers who will want to label Fuld's emerging therapy as 
another California aberration, they are going to have to get by this 
self-proclaimed New York kid's bona fides. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuld is a longtime student of meditation at the Zen Center of Los Angeles. 
Additionally, she holds undergraduate and master's degrees from City College of 
New York and a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a member of the New York City-based Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine faculty in neuropsychology from 1972 until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see the New Yorkers make something of that. Formalizing a Friendly 
Gathering 
</P>
<P>
 For several years a group of young Valley African American women would get 
together informally to compare notes on how things were going professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked to talk about our experiences in the workplace, and keep each other 
up-to-date on possible upward career moves," says Kathy Perdu-Nemo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the group were full-time or part-time Mary Kay cosmetic salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were just friends who wanted to feel like they were in a loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, says Perdu-Nemo, it dawned on her that what was going on was the 
beginning of a full-fledged networking organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Women of Color Network was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "We held our first meeting with eight women in October in Encino," says 
Perdu-Nemo. "In November, several of us went to Los Angeles to have a meeting 
with some women who were interested in the group down there." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Perdu-Nemo and her engineer-husband, George Nemo, hosted a social 
for group members and their guests in their Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I envision for our women's group is something more than just a 
professional woman's organization," Perdu-Nemo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to concentrate on basics like making a professional appearance and 
behaving professionally in a business situation. When your self-esteem is low, 
sometimes this is hard to do," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdu-Nemo has also started a book club for the members. "Some of us who have 
never read recreationally are having a good time now that we are all reading 
the same books," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdu-Nemo says that although the new group's name specifies members as women 
of color, the group is open to anyone who shares the goals and aims of the 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be a support group for women who want the tools to succeed in 
business," says the founding chairman. "A sisterhood for entrepreneurs."

PRESCRIPTION FOR SURVIVAL; O.C., SOUTHLAND DOCTORS IN ETHNIC AREAS NETWORK TO 
SURVIVE HMO ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After completing their training at UC San Diego's School of Medicine, Drs. 
Nwachukwu and Vicki Anakwenze opened a medical clinic in a renovated former 
nightclub across the street from the poverty-stricken Nickerson Gardens housing 
project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have an impact," said Nwachukwu. "We felt that Watts had the 
greatest need and the largest collection of sick people." 
</P>
<P>
 Working nights and weekends over the past decade, the Anakwenzes (pronounced 
ANA-QUINCYS) have grown a thriving practice that includes their three Quincy 
Care Medical Clinics and 25,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are now worried that the practice they have worked so hard to build 
is imperiled. Increasingly, their patients' employers are pushing them into 
health maintenance organizations, which require them to go to the HMO's own 
doctors and clinics. The Anakwenzes have never done business with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause for concern is the state Department of Health Service's decision 
to double managed-care enrollment among the state's roughly 5 million Medi-Cal 
beneficiaries by 1995. Sixty percent of the Quincy clinics' patients receive 
Medi-Cal benefits. The Anakwenzes fear they will lose their Medi-Cal patients 
as they are snagged by large managed-care groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anakwenzes have responded to this threat by forming a large network of 
doctors that, if successful, would use its strength in numbers to land 
managed-care contracts. Although networks of doctors of all stripes have grown 
dramatically in the past decade nationwide, the Anakwenzes' group is still a 
rarity: a minority-owned physician network that serves inner-city 
neighborhoods. And their strategy is one that is becoming highly popular with 
minority doctors throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a cascading of the movement," said Clyde W. Oden, president and 
chief executive of United Health Plan, a 92,000-member HMO operated by the 
nonprofit Watts Health Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to drive this effort is the fear of many ethnic doctors in private 
practice that they will be locked out of physician groups and HMOs. "The health 
plans are not open for the doctor who is standing by themselves in South 
Central or East L.A.," said the Nigerian-born Anakwenze. "We can't just sit in 
one place and continue bleeding to death." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other reasons for banding together into ethnic physician groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Roy Martinez, president of California Hispanic Medical Group, a 
30-physician group based in Santa Ana, said he formed his association, not for 
fear of being locked out of HMOs -- although some members of the group 
personally make that claim -- but because many mainstream managed-care 
organizations are virtually ignoring the mostly poor Latino population in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us went into medicine with the commitment to go back to the 
community and serve as role models," Martinez said. "It makes sense to form a 
group that will serve the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But the reach of mainstream HMOs into ethnic enclaves, such as predominantly 
Latino Santa Ana, is getting deeper. Martinez's year-old physicians group has 
already garnered a contract with FHP Inc., a Fountain Valley-based HMO, and 
hopes other contracts will be signed in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, Martinez said, many of his colleagues have had a hard time 
breaking into HMOs administered by those who do not see the value of bilingual, 
bicultural doctors. And as private physicians, they have found patients being 
pulled away from their practices by cost-conscious insurance carriers and the 
employers who pay managed-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is discouraging," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Dr. Robert A. Beltran, a general surgeon in East Los Angeles: "Trying to 
survive in private practice is a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran said he reluctantly joined an independent practice association, or 
IPA, when he began losing patients to large integrated health-care companies 
like Mullikin Medical Centers. He joined an IPA formed by Latino, Asian and 
Filipino doctors who work in predominantly Latino communities. The groups are 
linked to several community hospitals owned by American Healthcare Management, 
a hospital operator, and to a larger physician network organized by the 
Hospital of the Good Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, these networks of minority doctors have had varying degrees of success 
in winning contracts with managed-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jeffrie Miller, chief executive of Healthquest 2000, the first African 
American owned physician network in Los Angeles County, concedes that the 
year-old group has been "not very successful." It has struck a deal with only 
one managed-care firm: Maxicare Health Plans. The network includes 140 doctors 
in Inglewood, Hawthorne, Compton, Culver City and South Los Angeles, 75% of 
whom are African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is also director of the health services research center at Charles 
E. Drew Medical Center in South Los Angeles, said new IPAs face significant 
competition from more established medical groups, often affiliated with a 
hospital. "The HMOs say they are not that interested because they already have 
providers in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Maxicare, the link with Healthquest is part of a plan to "open some 
geographic areas and neighborhoods that have been underserved by managed care 
in the past," said Ed Coghlan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based company. 
The deal with Healthquest should also help Maxicare with a new marketing 
venture announced last week: a health plan for Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new group that has had more success is a 30-doctor network in San 
Diego called the Multicultural Primary Care Group. Since starting last year, 
the group has become a provider to a countywide health network operated by UC 
San Diego and is close to a deal with Blue Cross of California, said Dr. Rodney 
G. Hood, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 A major obstacle for these minority doctor networks is that they are 
latecomers to the managed-care game. Medical groups have been forming and 
growing for 20 years in Southern California and many groups have deeper pockets 
and far more experience. 
</P>
<P>
 United Health's Oden believes that the inability of minority doctors to get 
involved in managed care has more to do with their own stubbornness than racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the physicians of color who have worked in the inner city have 
resisted group practice," said Oden, who recalled a speech years ago to a group 
of African American doctors who booed him when he began discussing managed 
care. As a result, many minority doctors now forming groups aren't yet ready to 
compete for managed-care contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help these doctors cope with the fast-changing health care system, United 
Health later this year will sponsor something Oden calls "managed-care 
college," an educational program for physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who work in minority communities believe their experience is crucial 
to improving care for the poor. They point out that many patients feel more 
comfortable when their doctor is sensitive to their culture, speaks their 
language and comes from the same community. And that will be a selling point as 
minority doctors seek contracts with managed-care firms.

 All eyes today will be on Wall Street's reaction to Viacom's extraordinary 
11th-hour gambit Friday to merge with Blockbuster Entertainment, the home video 
retail giant, and sweeten the cash portion of its bid to $105 per share for 
50.1% of Paramount's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weekend, some analysts said they expected QVC to launch another 
court battle, claiming that Viacom had violated bidding procedures that all 
parties had agreed to, but a source close to QVC cautioned against such 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts reacted negatively to Viacom's new bid, saying it was still worth 
less than QVC's. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom, facing a Friday deadline to top QVC's bid, offered cash and stock for 
Paramount that analysts valued at a total of $9.7 billion. That compares to 
$9.9 billion offered by QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts and traders are expecting Viacom to revise the non-cash 
component of its offer for the movie studio and book publisher, perhaps by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing to prevent them from raising the back-end portion of their 
offer," said Lisbeth Baron, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities. "They 
could spend the next few days polling their largest shareholders about what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC appeared to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that once the dust 
settled early this week shareholders would begin tendering their shares to it. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to QVC said that in the wake of the Viacom-Blockbuster 
announcement "the entire community froze and no one will tender their shares." 
</P>
<P>
 But the source expressed confidence that "next week they'll start the 
process."

JAMES FLANIGAN: ARE BIG EGOS, ILLUSIONS WORTH SUCH BIG BUCKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the epic, four-month takeover battle for Paramount Communications draws to 
a close, the simple fact to keep in mind -- whether you're directly involved as 
a shareholder or just an interested observer of business folly -- is that 
billions of dollars are being blown here on egos and illusions. And those are 
not the soundest yardsticks for evaluating a business. 
</P>
<P>
 The illusion is that movie studios will be the heart of a vast new global 
business called multimedia, the envisioned convergence of television and 
computers, entertainment and information. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about high concept! That illusion and the egos of the bidders, Barry 
Diller of QVC and Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom, have pushed the price of 
Paramount to almost $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And that could be a record that stands for a long time. At that price, 
Paramount may be seen as a supernova of the movie business -- a final burst of 
expectations before disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 But first a few specifics, before we consider the realities of business and 
the dreams of multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a Paramount shareholder, the real message in the latest buyout offer 
is that your stock is not going much higher than it already has, or about $80 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 A new bid late Friday by Viacom, acting with its new merger partner 
Blockbuster Entertainment, offered what amounts to $78 per Paramount share in a 
package consisting of $105 cash per share for just over half of Paramount's 120 
million shares and a selection of Viacom securities for the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposing bid by QVC Network consists of $92 cash per share and a package 
of QVC stock and warrants -- for an average value of about $83 per Paramount 
share. The possible attraction in Viacom's latest bid, which is lower overall, 
is that it contains more cash. 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, the contest for Paramount could end this week. 
</P>
<P>
 So either you sell your stock on the open market -- Paramount closed Friday at 
$79.25 -- or you wait to accept the winner's package, which means you make an 
investment in Diller's QVC, a home shopping channel company, or Redstone's 
Viacom, a cable channel owner which is now scheduled to merge with H. Wayne 
Huizenga's Blockbuster video rental chain. 
</P>
<P>
 But whoever the winner turns out to be, a great premium is being paid for 
Paramount -- which was selling below $60 a share in September when bidding 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread belief is that a movie studio will be a great business in the 
new multimedia age because it will have a lock on providing entertainment for a 
world market of countless video channels and interactive, computerized 
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 That multimedia vision has propelled an extraordinary increase in prices for 
movie studios in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Paramount will sell for $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, where only 
three years ago MCA sold for $6.6 billion and a year before that Sony paid $3.4 
billion for Columbia Pictures. And yet in 1985, Rupert Murdoch was able to buy 
20th Century Fox studios from Marvin Davis, a very shrewd seller, for $575 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anything changed in the last decade to make studios intrinsically more 
valuable? Not really. Paramount revenues and profits today are roughly 
identical to what they were in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And the movie business is as it has been for decades. Studios such as 
Paramount have relationships with theater owners across the United States and 
worldwide based on their ability to produce and distribute 20 or so films a 
year. Because they can borrow on the strength of their film libraries, studios 
can finance roughly $600 million to $1 billion worth of movies a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to Paramount's appeal is scarcity value -- Paramount is just about the 
only independent studio left. Therefore, goes the thinking, it will be one of a 
handful of monopoly providers of entertainment for vastly expanded markets in 
the multimedia future. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where the thinking goes wrong. Whatever the multimedia future is, 
it will involve the computer. And -- witness the decline of IBM -- computer 
businesses are not kind to monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the digital future, "there will be information and entertainment coming 
from many sources, hundreds of competing monopolies," says Andrew Kessler, a 
managing director of Unterberg, Harris, a San Francisco investment firm 
specializing in new media issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, nobody knows what multimedia will amount to or what customers will 
go for. Telephone companies are experimenting now. American Telephone & 
Telegraph is running an experiment with Viacom in California's Castro Valley. 
US West and Time Warner have an experiment in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., owner of 20th Century Fox and satellite broadcast 
channels in Europe, last year paid $525 million for two-thirds ownership of the 
largest satellite system in Asia -- where more movies are made, and far more 
cheaply, than in Hollywood. But despite Asia's millions of potential customers, 
News Corp. knows it will wait years for a profit on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain: With phone companies, broadcasters, movie makers, 
newspaper barons and outright entrepreneurs such as Blockbuster's Huizenga 
vying for business, multimedia will be a very diverse industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And another certainty, after Paramount is sold for almost $10 billion, is that 
the resulting company, Paramount-QVC or Paramount-Viacom, will be burdened with 
debt for the immediate future. And the need to produce earnings to service that 
debt will constrict its flexibility in its present business, not to mention new 
ventures in multimedia. High concepts can be bold or foolhardy, but usually 
they're expensive.

PROBE CLEARS 3 IN SATELLITE REPORT CASE; DEFENSE: INSPECTOR CONCLUDES THAT A 
STUDY ON A CHEAPER SPACE SYSTEM WAS HANDLED PROPERLY AND SAYS COMPETITION 
EXPLAINS UNUSUAL CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A confidential investigation by the Air Force inspector general has cleared 
the president of Aerospace Corp. and two senior Air Force officers of 
allegations that they improperly quashed a proposal to save $10 billion on a 
satellite system. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation followed a flurry of unusual accusations that Gen. Charles 
Horner, Gen. Garry Schnelzer and Aerospace President Pete Aldridge prevented 
Congress from learning about a lower-cost alternative to a sophisticated new 
spacecraft under development. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations were taken seriously because they came from senior defense 
industry executives, Air Force officers, a member of Congress and 
whistle-blowers who have yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy centered around an obscure technical report written by two 
engineers from Aerospace, a nonprofit engineering firm in El Segundo that 
assists the Air Force on space programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers had proposed that the Air Force abandon a Cold War-era satellite 
development program and instead simply update the existing Defense Support 
Program satellite, which can provide early warning of missile attacks on the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldridge and the Air Force officials had suppressed the Aerospace report, 
which said that an update to the DSP system would be $10 billion cheaper than 
building a next-generation satellite and would provide much of the same 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was particularly touchy because it pitted the major California 
military satellite producers against each other and inflamed passions at an 
increasingly tough time in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Marcus Anderson, the Air Force inspector general, noted in his report 
that the bitter allegations were a byproduct of the lean times facing the 
military and the defense industry. The Times obtained a copy of the 
investigation report's executive summary. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the space arena and perhaps across the acquisition spectrum, the intense 
competition for dollars in the (Department of Defense) and among its defense 
contractors is producing distrust, suspicion, breakdowns in communications and 
ultimately allegations of impropriety, both from within the Air Force and from 
defense contractors," Anderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, Hughes Aircraft, TRW and Grumman are competing to build the 
next-generation system, which would replace future production of the existing 
DSP. TRW in Redondo Beach and Aerojet's Electronic Systems Division in Azusa 
make the current DSP system. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Fisher, president of Aerojet's Azusa unit, charged in a letter to 
Anderson in October that Air Force officials had suppressed information about 
lower-cost updates to DSP, had misrepresented facts and had intimidated 
industry officials who did not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fisher charged that Aerojet's proprietary technology had been 
leaked to its competitors by Air Force officials who wanted to favor 
competitors' systems, according to a letter Fisher wrote to Anderson that was 
also obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 While Anderson found that the report on an updated DSP was quashed, he 
asserted that the actions were proper because an updated DSP system could not 
have met the Air Force's technical requirements. Those requirements call for a 
satellite capable of detecting short-range missiles, such as the Scud used by 
Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is hotly debated, however. An independent technical panel last year 
doubted whether any satellite system could effectively warn of short-range 
missiles -- those with ranges of as little as 42 miles. The panel recommended 
that the Pentagon rely on ground radar to defend against such missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aldridge, Horner and Schnelzer blocked the report, it was leaked to 
senior defense officials, congressional staff members and the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Aldridge was embarrassed with the report, as was the Air Force, about the 
content and the way the report was written and distributed," Anderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson investigated more than 17 allegations brought by various unnamed 
informants, defense executives and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). Of those, 
Anderson substantiated five charges, though he downplayed the significance of 
them and said that in some cases the actions were justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet's allegation that its proprietary technology was parceled out to 
competitors was separately investigated by Air Force officials in Los Angeles, 
who substantiated the charge, Anderson wrote. He termed the release of data as 
inappropriate but did not indicate whether any disciplinary action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up, Anderson asked: "Where do we go from here? There is no simple 
fix." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough times in the industry raise the possibility that similar allegations 
will be made in the future, he said.

 What the Mighty Bucks Buy 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner's $203-million payday in 1993 -- 
virtually all of it stemming from his decision to exercise long-held stock 
options -- no doubt sets a record for some time to come on how much a chief 
executive of a public company reaps in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
 But what other records might Eisner be setting? Consider what the amount buys: 
</P>
<P>
 * 6.77 million Disneyland admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1.6 million of the most expensive seats to a game of Disney's Mighty Ducks 
of Anaheim hockey team, and 15.6 million of the cheapest seats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 8.1 million "Aladdin" videocassettes at the suggested retail price. They

 No one seems to know where the Los Angeles Rams plan to play in the future, 
much less where the professional football team is, period. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a knowledgeable source, one team -- the Rams -- was conspicuously 
missing from a recent National Football League meeting aimed at giving an 
official stamp of approval to a new lucrative television contract the league 
negotiated with Fox Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 No word on why. Getting the Message Across 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Weekly, a free weekly newspaper in the western San Gabriel Valley, is 
no longer accepting ads containing explicit sexual messages nor ads for 
handguns and assault weapons. (It will continue to accept ads for rifles, 
however.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a message to readers in its latest edition, publisher Jim Laris didn't 
bother with elaborate explanations. On the ban on sex-related ads, Laris said, 
"We've just reached some sort of threshold." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the partial ban on gun ads, Laris explained that "this concealed 
handgun and machine gun type of deal is just plain wrong, in our opinion." The 
'Like Wow, Man' Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Time to start digging through the closet for those old tie-dyed shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top trends in 1994 will be Woodstock, predicts The Trends Journal, 
a New York group that forecasts business and social trends. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newsletter, a concert marking the 25th anniversary of the 
1969 upstate New York music festival will "catalyze a new genre of rock and 
reinvigorate the music industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In a prediction reminiscent of Woodstock-era hype, it adds that the event 
"will also be the biggest cross-promotional/marketing tie-in extravaganza of 
the year and possibly the decade." Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica company sells "Soviet army winter hats" with the slogan "Warm 
up now that the Cold War is over." . . . Safer than an AK-47: A New Jersey 
company sells for $695 a semiautomatic gun that shoots tiny balls of paint, 
calling it "the '90s' fastest-growing sport. . . . That's synergy for you: 
Finishing first in Time magazine's list of "The Best Products of 1993" is the 
3DO interactive video game system that the magazine's parent, Time Warner, is 
funding.

BCCI FIGURE TO BE EXTRADITED TO UNITED STATES; BANKING: SWALEH NAQVI IS UNDER 
HOUSE ARREST IN ABU DHABI. HE IS EXPECTED TO BE PROSECUTED ON FEDERAL FRAUD 
CHARGES.

<P>
 A key figure in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal will be 
extradited for prosecution by the Justice Department under an agreement with 
the government of Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials confirmed the agreement Sunday and said they 
expect Swaleh Naqvi, the top deputy to the founder of BCCI, to be brought to 
the United States from Abu Dhabi within four months to face bank fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Naqvi, now under house arrest in the Persian Gulf emirate, has been indicted 
in the United States but has never been interviewed by American prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be delivered here . . . within 120 days. He'll be tried, and we hope 
to convict him," Gerald Stern, head of the Justice Department's bank fraud 
section, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials and a statement issued by the government of Abu 
Dhabi confirmed the agreement between the U.S. government and the ruling family 
of Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will give U.S. prosecutors access to Naqvi as well as thousands of 
documents related to the case, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, reached in Geneva after a series of secret meetings, was first 
reported Sunday by the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Naqvi's extradition, the agreement calls for the royal family 
in Abu Dhabi to give up claims to an estimated $400 million it had invested in 
the Washington-based First American Bankshares Inc., a former subsidiary of 
BCCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds, instead will be used in part to reimburse depositors of BCCI who 
lost money when the bank closed in 1991. Some of the money also is to be used 
to help pay severance for 1,000 former First American employees who lost their 
jobs when the bank's branches and assets were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, U.S. prosecutors have agreed not to pursue criminal charges against 
the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, who had been the 
majority shareholder in the defunct BCCI, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a $1.5-billion civil suit brought against Zayed by the court-appointed 
trustee for First American will be dropped, according to the statement issued 
on behalf of the royal family. Zayed also has agreed to give up the 28% 
interest he held in First American. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money being surrendered by Abu Dhabi will be used to help First 
American trustees pay for "continuing litigation against other parties," said 
the statement issued by a Washington public relations firm on behalf of the 
royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann in a statement called the settlement "a 
remarkable agreement in terms of what we've succeeded in getting."

 China Posts Biggest Trade Deficit Since 1985: China customs data show its 
trade deficit in 1993 was $12.18 billion, the biggest since a $14.9-billion 
trade gap in 1985 and its first deficit since 1989. Total trade jumped 18% to a 
record $195.7 billion, but most of that came from a 29% increase in imports to 
$103.9 billion that swamped an 8% gain in exports. While the gap increases 
pressure on Beijing to boost exports and control imports, the United States and 
other countries are clamoring for more access to China's markets.

AUSTRALIAN INSURERS CALL BRUSH FIRE LOSSES MODERATE

<P>
 Australian insurers say property losses to date from savage brush fires in and 
around Sydney are moderate compared with losses from the nation's past natural 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Council of Australia, in a preliminary estimate, said it expects 
losses to total about $68.5 million, equally divided between residential and 
commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
 About 135 fires were reported still burning in New South Wales state this 
morning, but cooler, moister weather today has eased conditions that fanned the 
flames in recent days.

 Macy's Chief Says Company Is Not for Sale: In videotaped remarks, R.H. Macy 
Chairman Myron Ullman said the department store has its "own game plan (and) is 
not for sale," -- a direct rebuff of overtures from Federated Department 
Stores.Federated bought $449.3 million of Macy debt, saying it was looking to 
combine the two retailers. Since then, other companies have contacted Macy, 
which has been in bankruptcy for two years. Ullman said Macy would resist 
efforts by others to develop a plan of reorganization.

 Major Hikes Estimate of Growth: British Prime Minister John Major said his 
government estimated the country's economy would grow perhaps as much as 3% 
this year.That compares with a 2.5% increase estimated last November. Major 
told a BBC interviewer there could be a large decrease in unemployment in 1994 
and he expects inflation to remain in the range of 1% to 4% until mid-1997. In 
1993, Britain emerged from a 2 1/2-year recession and is expected to have the 
highest growth rate in the European Union in 1994. However, the jobless rate 
remains at 10%.

 U.S. Economists Predict Vigorous Growth: The U.S. economy will grow by 3% this 
year, adjusted for inflation, said a group of 51 economists polled by Blue Chip 
Economic Indicators. If they are correct, it would be the economy's strongest 
performance since the 3.9% expansion in 1988. Momentum from the growth in the 
final quarter of 1993 -- now placed at an annual rate of 4.2% -- will carry 
over into the new year, the panel predicted, with strength in housing, autos 
and other consumer durables persisting into 1994.

 Long-Distance Rates Fall: A cutthroat battle among long-distance phone 
companies for the $26-billion home market has forced down prices to a low of 
$3.90 an hour for calls within the United States. That rate, offered by Sprint 
Corp., is good on weekends only and expires in July, but it undercuts any other 
price available from the three major carriers.One analyst said Kansas 
City-based Sprint has to compete on price because it is smaller than MCI 
Communications Corp., the No. 2 carrier after American Telephone & Telegraph 
Co. Sprint has about 10% of the U.S. phone market, compared to MCI's 19% and 
AT&T's 60%. Sprint's offer beat MCI's night and evening rate of 8.8 cents a 
minute. AT&T's bargain rates are the highest, at 10.8 cents per minute.

 Gasoline Prices Drop: The average price of gasoline, including all grades and 
taxes, was $1.0949 a gallon last week, down 1.29 cents from the previous 
survey, industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said.The trend 
of price drops is slowing and has bottomed out in some areas, Lundberg said. An 
upward price turnaround has also made a showing in Midwestern and Gulf Coast 
states, she said. At self-serve pumps, average prices per gallon were: regular 
unleaded $1.021; mid-grade unleaded $1.1389; premium unleaded $1.2198; regular 
leaded $1.0369.

 Oil Spill Charges Filed Too Late, Judge Rules: Allegations that Unocal Corp. 
covered up spills at its Guadalupe oil field cannot be pursued because 
prosecutors missed the statute of limitations by two days, San Luis Obispo 
County Municipal Judge James D. Ream said. However, he said there was 
"substantial evidence" that "Unocal and its employees actively engaged in a 
course of conduct which included not only failing to disclose the leaks, but 
(taking) steps to prevent the leaks from coming to the attention of the 
public."Prosecutors filed 28 misdemeanor charges alleging that Unocal and six 
employees failed to report more than 100 leaks since 1985. Los Angeles-based 
Unocal says it alerted authorities immediately after the problem was discovered 
in February, 1990.

 Another Group to Bid on Aladdin Hotel: Mark Vidergauz, an executive with 
Wedbush & Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, said his company represents a Las 
Vegas businessman who has submitted a proposal to buy the hotel, in hopes of 
topping a tentative deal reportedly reached by developer Donald Trump for the 
Strip resort. Vidergauz said the businessman, in partnership with investors 
outside Nevada, should be able to top Trump's reported offer of $65 million for 
the long-troubled resort. The purchase, if consummated, would be Trump's 
long-awaited entry into the Las Vegas market.

WHILE OTHERS SPUTTER, NISSAN RACES FORWARD; AUTOS: THE POPULAR ALTIMA HELPED 
THE FIRM'S U.S. UNIT SHOW AN 18% SALES SURGE IN 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While import auto makers are licking their wounds as 1994 begins, there is one 
Japanese company whose U.S. arm is flourishing in the face of stiff competition 
from the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. reported an 18% increase in sales last year -- far 
better than those reported by resurgent Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. 
Only Chrysler Corp., with a 20% sales improvement, did better. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan is the only Japanese auto maker to increase its share of the U.S. 
market last year, reaching 4.9% from 4.5% in 1992. Its popular Altima mid-size 
sedan was the top-selling new model in 1993, besting Chrysler's highly touted 
LH series. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting the separate luxury models, Nissan even supplanted Honda as the 
second-highest import seller, behind Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are back in the game in the consumer's mind," said Bob Thomas, president 
and chief executive of Nissan's U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 These accomplishments were achieved despite the serious financial problems 
afflicting Nissan's Tokyo-based parent. It also came in spite of adverse 
currency fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The company laid off nearly 400 white-collar workers nationwide last year and 
dismissed its top U.S. official at its headquarters in Torrance, replacing him 
with a more compliant Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan has tried to counteract the rise of the yen -- which increases the cost 
of importing cars and parts -- by increasing production at its assembly plant 
in Smyrna, Tenn., and buying more parts from American suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 While this has helped, the real seeds of Nissan's rebound were sown in the 
mid-1980s, when the company was as a niche player best known for its sporty 
cars. To survive, Nissan decided to change its image by moving into mainstream 
sedans, sport utility vehicles and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
 It had some success in 1989 with its restyled near-luxury Maxima sedan. Nissan 
also gained some attention with its upscale Pathfinder sport utility vehicle. 
Then, in 1992, the company introduced the sleek Altima sedan and stylish Quest 
minivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to Nissan's success has been the Altima," said Susan Jacobs, an 
automotive consultant for Jacobs & Associates in New Jersey. "It was well 
launched and well executed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the Altima was priced attractively. While smaller than the 
Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus, it is also priced below them. The base-price 
Altima is still about $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan sold nearly 134,000 Altimas in 1993. By comparison, it sold only 73,000 
Stanzas -- the car the Altima replaced -- in 1991, the last year of full 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Hesterberg, general manager of the Nissan division, said the Altima has 
helped generate new traffic in showrooms. No longer are sports car enthusiasts 
the only ones interested in Nissan. He notes that nearly half of first-time 
Nissan buyers are now women. 
</P>
<P>
 That broadened appeal also helped boost Pathfinder and Quest sales. Even 
though the design of the Pathfinder is aging and it is expensive for a utility 
vehicle, the company enjoyed a 33% increase in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sold nearly as many Quests, a minivan built in Avon Lake, Ohio, 
alongside Mercury-Lincoln's Villager. In 1993, Nissan sold 44,600 Quests and 
48,700 Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the company enjoyed improved sales of the upscale Maxima and 
compact Sentra. A new Maxima will be introduced in May, with a new Sentra 
likely to follow next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nissan was there with the right products at the right time," said George 
Magliano, analyst with WEFA Group in New York. "They were able to move with the 
economic recovery when other imports couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether Nissan can maintain the momentum. But with the strong 
yen and Nissan's troubles in Japan, it may be difficult to hold the line on 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Nissan has already raised prices twice since introducing 1994 models in 
September. On average, the company has hiked prices $1,144, or 7.2%, in the 
last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with Nissan's parent company in the throes of a painful restructuring, 
the pressure to do more with less is likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo-based company is expected to lose up to $370 million in the fiscal 
year ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel more pressure than ever to contribute more profit to the company 
worldwide," Hesterberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say it will be difficult to repeat last year's performance, 
but they hope to see sales increase at least 5% in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cedergren, an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana, believes 
Nissan will continue to thrive in the U.S. market. He said the yen is likely to 
weaken slightly and that leasing programs can mitigate price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have strong products and more coming in the next 2 1/2 years," Cedergren 
said. "The future looks bright for Nissan." Nissan's Year 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. SALES JUMP... 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan's U.S. car and truck sales increased 18% in 1993, compared to an 
industry-wide jump of 8.5%. Only Chrysler reported a higher percentage sales 
increase. 1984: 689,022 1993: 680,357 
</P>
<P>
 ...LED BY ALTIMA GAINS 
</P>
<P>
 Strong sales of the Altima helped Nissan capture a 5.2% market share of the 
mid-size sedan segment, up from 3.3% in 1992. 03,12,11,11 Model '93 sales '92

 Minimum Wages Set for First Time: Workers in Shanghai will receive at least 
$24 a month, and those in the southern boom town of Shenzhen will get a minimum 
of $32, the official China Daily reported.The minimum wages are a step in a 
series of government reforms intended to protect urban workers. The government 
has given provincial centers until July to come up with their own minimum 
wages, the paper said. As well as guaranteeing a reasonable standard of living, 
the new minimum wages will prevent workers from being exploited by foreign 
factory managers, the paper said.

 Measures Sought to Boost Economy: Japan's ruling coalition parties plan to 
propose abolishing taxes on securities transactions as part of measures to 
stimulate the economy, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said.The parties will also 
propose a third supplementary budget totaling more than $62 billion. Help for 
the real estate market would come in the form of reduced land sales taxes and 
relaxed restrictions on which land sales must be reported to the government. A 
widely debated income tax cut would not be proposed until at least next month, 
the report said. The newspaper said the parties will unveil their economic 
stimulus proposals Jan. 20.

 Retail Sales Soar: The figure grew by an adjusted 2.1% in November, the 
largest increase in two years, confirming economists' belief that Australia's 
three-year economic slump may be at an end.The retail sales growth was more 
than 10 times the 0.2% gain analysts had forecast. "These are wonderful numbers 
for the economy," said Chris Caton, chief economist with Bankers Trust 
Australia. "Consumers are spending again, labor market indicators are 
favorable, business sector confidence is recovering, exports are still strong. 
We're on our way again."

 Foreign Applications Plunge: The applications for manufacturing investments in 
Malaysia plunged 37.6% last year, a fact that could undercut the country's 
drive to build a high-tech economy.Overall investment applications fell 19.5% 
to $6.925 billion, the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority said in a 
report. In releasing the report, Rafidah Aziz, international trade and 
international minister, stressed that foreign investment is falling worldwide 
and that Malaysia is still well ahead of its 1991-95 investment targets under 
the Sixth Malaysia Plan. But Rafidah acknowledged that Malaysia remains 
dependent on foreign investors as a source of technology transfer.

 Charles Paskerian lives in Orange County but spends his days wooing California 
businesses to Spokane as a representative of the Spokane Area Economic 
Development Council. Paskerian, 60, founded and managed a Santa Ana plastics 
manufacturer called Flexipak for 20 years. He said urgent action by local and 
state leaders is needed to stop California's business drain. Far from being 
disloyal, he helps the state by forcing it to face its shortcomings, Paskerian 
said in a conversation with Times correspondent Debora Vrana.

</P>
<P>
 You've lived in Orange County for more than 30 years, yet you tell our 
businesses they should move to Spokane, Wash. Doesn't that make you a traitor 
of sorts? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not me, I'm not doing this. The manufacturers want to get out of here. 
It's the burdensome regulations and the attitudes of local and state 
administrative leaders who are driving them away. Most of these companies have 
already decided they are going to move before I speak with them. For them it's 
just a question of whether it's going to be Spokane or Phoenix.

 I am a U.S. citizen first and then a Californian. And I am very concerned 
about the future of U.S. manufacturing, which continues to diminish throughout 
the United States. The point is we want our country to be as strong as it can 
be. And hopefully as a result of this California will become stronger. 
California must recognize that it is not meeting the needs of the manufacturing 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How do you imagine taking businesses away from California could make the state 
stronger? 
</P>
<P>
 It won't help the state, but hopefully what it will do for the state of 
California is make it recognize how serious the problem is. How bad does it 
have to get before they take action? How far down does it have to go before 
they (state officials) address the major functional issues?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But are state leaders getting the message you are trying to send? 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of like the automobile industry. We all saw how far down the auto 
industry went before it decided to make a car comparable in quality with the 
imports. It's almost like a heroin addict or someone with an addiction. How far 
down do they have to go? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think state officials are addressing the problems, but I think that is 
because they don't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Does all the recent attention given to keeping businesses in California make 
your job difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point I don't think the business retention programs are as strong as 
they should be. That's part of the problem. They are are trying to gear up, but 
what are they doing?  
</P>
<P>
 They have a program "Stay alive til '95." That particular program to me is 
nonsense. Because the economy may pick up, but the economy is not the basic 
problem. The problem is the regulations to the businesses. And if a business in 
Los Angeles stays alive until 1995, fine, but that's not an answer. Business 
are looking for changes in the regulations and not foolish regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's my opinion that when business does pick up and manufacturers have 
more money to operate with, you're going to see more companies leaving the 
state, if the state is not responsive to solving the regulatory problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What about local efforts to keep businesses here by Partnership 2010 or the 
Orange County Economic Development Consortium? 
</P>
<P>
 These are marvelous people and they are doing good things. And Orange County 
is better than many counties in terms of retention efforts. However, there are 
two issues that debilitate their ability to perform. The first issue is that 
they are limited by state regulations. The second is that there are many other 
areas, and Spokane is not one of them, that are offering huge perks to move 
there. The problem with that is someone eventually has to pay for those perks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is the pitch you give California companies? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't consider it a sales pitch; it's a communication of the facts of what 
we have compared to what they are involved in. The first issue is 
quality-of-life issues, including schools, housing, cost of living compared to 
bottom-line business issues. It's not something you sell to someone because 
it's a major undertaking, they aren't only moving their family, they are moving 
their business.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How do you find companies who are interested in leaving the state? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not very hard. At the present time more than one-third of California 
companies are interested in relocation. Essentially what I do is network with 
people I know, because I was in the business world.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What are the major complaints you hear from businesses? 
</P>
<P>
 The primary complaint is workers' compensation costs, which are double what 
they are in many other states. Then the regulations, city, county and state. 
And the overlapping of regulations and the contradictory situations that a 
manufacturer will get into. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How many companies are you working with on relocating right now? 
</P>
<P>
 About 20, with about 10 in Orange County. Most of them with 25 to 50 
employees. One of the owners in Orange County, his primary concern is crime. 
Another is an owner of a machine-parts company in the mid-county area with 
about 40 employees. He needs a skilled work force to operate sophisticated 
machines, but he's having training difficulties because workers have poor 
language skills and are poorly educated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What could Spokane offer that business owner? 
</P>
<P>
 This manufacturer really needs highly skilled workers. The education system 
here is not providing the skilled factory workers to operate the complex 
computer-driven machines. Spokane has vocational programs with the highest 
state-of-the-art equipment at the community college level to train the workers. 
It's a more hands-on environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Spokane's attraction. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of living there is about 30% less than the cost of living in 
Southern California. The houses are half the cost, the schools are often 
superior and there is less stress. And the wages are within 10% of Orange 
County wages and there is no income tax." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On bureaucracy. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "California has always had an imperious bureaucracy. Even when I started my 
business in 1966 I had evidence of this, but then the economy was stronger and 
I could still make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On why he doesn't live in Spokane. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've been here a long time. I may move, but of course my work is here. 
But I would like to have a place up there. It's lovely." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On his family. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Several of my sons are seriously looking at leaving the state. They are not 
critical of what I do, because they are looking at quality-of-life issues and 
where they want to make their lives."

REPUBLIC AIR CASE SHOWS PRICE OF CHEAP FLIGHTS; TRAVEL: THE CHARTER COMPANY, 
WHICH STARTED SELLING TICKETS LAST SUMMER, IS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING VARIOUS 
FEDERAL RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Forgotston's experience illustrates the need for consumers to be careful 
about flying with charter airlines and other companies besides major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he bought a cheap ticket to fly from Dallas to Los Angeles through a 
company he saw advertised on a billboard, Forgotston thought he was using a 
regular airline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $220 round trip he booked through Republic Air Travel of Dallas in 
October showed him that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During a long night seeking his luggage at Los Angeles International Airport 
that stretched until 4:30 a.m., "we couldn't find anybody to tell us anything," 
said Forgotston, a Dallas computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody blamed everybody else," he said. "Nobody knew what anybody was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotston is one of many passengers who have complained about Republic Air, 
which began selling cheap tickets last summer. The Department of Transportation 
has filed an enforcement complaint against the travel agency accusing it of 
violating various public charter regulations, including diverting customer 
funds for illegal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic Air did not immediately return calls seeking comment last week, but 
it has denied the accusations in the past. The company has reportedly shut its 
doors but continued to take phone reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other allegations in the complaint: That Republic Air assumed the duties of a 
charter operator and that it took out ads in major newspapers that did not tell 
readers it is not a regularly scheduled airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are supposed to be told if they are flying a public charter. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference? A tour operator charters a jet and its crew and sells 
the seats. A regular airline owns or holds long-term leases for its jets, and 
the crews are on its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In Republic Air's case, the company said it was operating a reservations 
center for Miami-based Airlift Group Inc. -- also named in the complaint -- 
which was actually selling the charter trips. Express One International Inc. of 
Dallas was flying the jets, but it said last week that it would do so only 
until this Saturday, leaving Republic without a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Express One was also named in the complaint; it has settled with the 
government while admitting no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 While travel experts say the vast majority of charter operators do a good job, 
"there are some notorious cases over the last 15 years with planeloads of 
people being stranded in Europe," said Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports 
Travel Letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Several who follow the air travel industry suggest that consumers take steps 
to protect themselves when they're looking for bargains away from the major 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents are often familiar with a little-known company's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's too good to be true, call a travel agent," said Michael Boyd, 
president of Aviation Systems Research in Golden, Colo. "Let a travel agent 
handle it. Travel agents are paid to protect people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pay with a credit card, or make checks payable to the escrow account that 
charter operators have to set up, so your money hasn't been spent before the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, customer prepayments for charter trips must go into escrow 
accounts until after the trip is made. The Transportation Department has 
accused Republic Air of using funds that were supposed to go into escrow 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 One more option: Buy trip interruption insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said the insurance -- which protects against, among other things, 
airline and operator failure -- can be purchased from virtually any travel 
agent or directly from the insurance companies.

50 MILLION INVESTORS SENT SAVINGS BONDS SALES SKYWARD; INVESTMENT: ALTHOUGH A 
BIT OF A HASSLE COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVES, SERIES EE CAN STILL BE A BETTER DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cash is trash and CDs are yesterday's news, so U.S. Savings Bonds must be 
history, right?  
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Sales of Series EE bonds set a record for the fiscal year ended Sept. 
30, with more than 50 million Americans investing $17.3 billion in them. That's 
a 28% increase over 1992, when $13.5 billion worth were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sales rate dropped dramatically in the second half of the fiscal 
year, after the guaranteed yield dropped from 6% to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 While personal finance experts say the bonds have their place, they worry that 
the bonds are being used as a substitute for long-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of anything that will make people save. It's better than going 
out and buying a fancy lunch, but if you want to do something for your kids, 
you'd probably be better off to open up a growth and income mutual fund," said 
Paul Brown, a financial planner and co-author of the book "Grow Rich Slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bonds' advantages include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Safety. The bonds guarantee the principal and a 4% return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flexibility. They can be cashed in anytime after six months, so, unlike a 
CD, investors are not locked in for another six months. If you cash the bond 
after nine months and six days, for example, you get nine months' worth of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small face value. Bonds come in denominations as small as $50 (issue price 
$25), so they are easier to give as gifts or for beginning investors to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forced savings. The bonds can be deducted automatically from many companies' 
payrolls, so they may force some people to sock away money they might otherwise 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax exemption. The interest on bonds is free of state and local taxes and, 
if the money is spent on education, federal taxes. This can make them look more 
attractive than their 4% interest rate might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds are also a good place to park cash for six or 12 months. With a 
guaranteed 4% minimum, they compare favorably to the average 2.8% rate for 
six-month certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 But as New York-based financial planner Rob Harrigan points out, that works 
out to only a $60 return on $10,000 in bonds. Add to this the hassle of not 
being able to purchase the bonds through brokers and the difficulty in 
replacing lost coupons, and many investors may not feel the difference is 
worthwhile, Harrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 4%, I would go out and buy a Treasury, which yields 3.2%. There the 
difference over six months is only $40 and you have more flexibility," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Until March 1, the guaranteed interest rate on bonds held for at least five 
years was 6%. Now the minimum is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a difference between an EE bond's guaranteed rate and its current 
market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The market rate is adjusted every six months, to 85% of the rate on five-year 
Treasuries. It is currently 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the rate was cut, sales of the bonds averaged $2 billion a month. That 
slid to $800 million a month, however, as investors turned to higher-yielding 
investments.

 Analyst review: "Summa Industries used to be called Morehouse Industries. It 
changed its name and offered a one-for-four reverse stock split last month. 
Things were stagnant for them for a while, with sales slow and costs creeping 
up. But James Swartwout, the CEO, has developed a strategy to improve the top 
line through acquisitions. Summa's principal business used to be large, 
industrial mixing machines, but it acquired other niche businesses, including 
one that manufactures water cannons for fireboats and another company that 
makes plastic grid conveyor belts used in food processing plants. The companies 
he acquired were usually the only ones making a particular product or by far 
the dominant player. Swartwout knows how to run a company from a financial 
standpoint and he will be working to get some growth out ot these 
divisions."--Jim Liuzzi, analyst, Cruttenden & Co., Irvine

WAHLCO WILL TAKE $10-MILLION CHARGE FOR W. VA., CANADA PLANT-CLOSING COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wahlco Environmental Systems Inc., a maker of pollution-control and 
power-efficiency equipment, said last week that it will take a charge of about 
$10 million to cover costs of closing plants in West Virginia and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Santa Ana, cited the sluggish worldwide economy, ongoing 
delays by U.S. utilities in complying with the 1990 Clean Air Act and 
competitive pressures as reasons for the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-million pretax charge will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by between 
37 and 42 cents a share, Wahlco said, adding that it plans to release its 1993 
results in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Wahlco posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.8 million, or 27 cents, 
on revenue of $17.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will close the operations of Wahlco Power Products Inc. in 
Fairmont, W. Va., and Wahlco Engineered Products Canada Inc. in Montreal. 
Manufacturing at the Montreal unit will be consolidated at Wahlco's operations 
in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock 
closed at $4.75 a share, up 25 cents.

INSIDE JOB: OCCUPATION: HOTEL TOUR AND TRAVEL COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Name: Hiroko Dreyfus 
</P>
<P>
 Employer: Pan Pacific Hotel, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: Hotel tour and travel coordinators assist hotel visitors, 
particularly international guests, in making transportation and sightseeing 
arrangements. They make sure the hotel's food and accommodations are suitable 
for guests from various cultures and traditions. They occasionally assist the 
concierge in providing general information and act as a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "The new management of our hotel believes in teamwork and gave the 
staff the responsibility for formulating a new mission statement. That brought 
all of us together toward the same goal. But the greatest reward in my job is 
the wonderful smiles and shining faces I see when I have been able to help 
someone enjoy their stay. International visitors are often very overwhelmed and 
really appreciate my help." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "Sometimes I wish I could begin preparing tour agendas and making 
plans for guests before they check in, since the extra time would really help. 
It is my nature to be helpful and I always wish I could do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "To do this job, you really have to like helping people and be willing 
to put in extra hours. When I'm not at the hotel, I'm on call and it's really a 
24-hour-a-day job." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: $25,000 to $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Regular business hours, with extra time required on evenings and 
weekends during special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: Most tour and travel coordinators have 
a background in hotel management or training in the travel industry. It is 
extremely important to have a solid background in at least one other language 
and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected demand: Steady. The strong yen is bringing more Japanese and other 
foreign visitors to the United States and coordinators are needed to help with 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employing industries: Major hotels and resorts. 
</P>
<P>

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: PACIFIC FUNDS LOOK ROSY -- AT LEAST IN LONG TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, Wiles, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, specializes 
in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westerners have been dreaming about the riches of China since before the days 
of Marco Polo. Last year, they got a nice little payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific region mutual funds leaped 63.8% in 1993, with almost half the gain 
coming during the final three months of the year. Next to gold portfolios, it 
was the best performance of any mutual fund category, Lipper Analytical 
Services reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the Pacific funds held little, if anything, in the way of 
stocks from China proper, the country's move toward capitalism was an important 
reason behind their success. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous corporations from elsewhere in the region are doing business in 
China, lured by the potential of operating in the world's most populous nation 
-- which features low wages, tremendous pent-up consumer demand, a long 
mercantile tradition, double-digit economic growth and other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is definitely a big part of the investment story for the region, but 
it's certainly not the whole story," says George Murnaghan, a vice president at 
Rowe-Price Fleming International, which serves as investment adviser to the T. 
Rowe Price international funds in Baltimore, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding China and Japan, other nations in the region will probably log 
economic growth of 6.5% to 7% this year, Rowe-Price Fleming predicts. China's 
growth could be closer to 11%, while Japan's will come in at an anemic 1% to 
1.5%, the firm believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such superior economic growth for the region (aside from Japan's) is the 
reason Pacific funds appear to have a bright long-term future. But the more 
timely question is whether they are currently overpriced given the surge in 
1993. 
</P>

 Thomas R. Robinson, chief international equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in 
New York, says he is concerned about the region's stock markets today after the 
sharp rallies of the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the (positive) long-term story is intact, but I'd exercise caution 
right now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign that the road could be bumpy, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index -- which 
doubled in 1993 -- tumbled 6% on Thursday, Robinson points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high-fliers include the stock markets of Indonesia and the Philippines, 
whose major market indexes more than doubled during the year, and those in 
Malaysia and Thailand, where indexes nearly did so.  
</P>
<P>
 Another voice of caution comes from Mark Mobius, who runs two emerging-markets 
funds for the Franklin-Templeton family and heads Templeton Investment 
Management in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 He considers the East and Southeast Asian markets to be vulnerable to 
corrections, although he hastens to add that it's hard to say when these might 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices in the region have been fueled by low interest rates, a surge of 
investment cash from outside the region, a changing view of the risks of 
investing in Asia -- especially China -- and "simple greed," Mobius says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't want to miss the boat have a tendency to forget the 
fundamentals," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobius and Robinson say another emerging-market region, Latin America, looks 
more promising from a near-term perspective. In particular, Mobius says he has 
been finding more individual bargains in Brazil, which has largely been 
overlooked due to its economic and political uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lukewarm outlook is given by Mark Headley, director of international 
investments for the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who had Pacific fund investments last year, Headley recommends 
staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "These remain the most attractive growth stories in the world," he says of the 
Southeast Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for people thinking about jumping in now, Headley suggests waiting for a 
pullback or putting in money gradually through a dollar-cost averaging 
strategy. Headley, who has lived in Hong Kong, says stocks there are especially 
vulnerable given that they have advanced fourfold in the past half a dozen 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts that China will eventually have to apply the brakes to its surging 
economy to keep inflation in check, and that could cause the Hong Kong market 
to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Murnaghan takes a more optimistic short-term view of the Pacific region. He 
points out that many other stock markets around the globe are also trading near 
record highs, despite much slower economic growth in their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous to try to time these (Pacific) markets on a short-term basis," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But to mitigate the risks, Murnaghan also urges interested investors to follow 
a dollar-cost averaging strategy. 
</P>

 T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore has introduced a separate group of bond 
and money-market funds featuring lower expenses and higher investment minimums. 
</P>
<P>
 The six no-load Summit portfolios will carry expense ratios ranging between 
0.45% and 0.60% annually -- lower than most competing funds. The minimum 
investment will be $25,000 per fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group of Valley Forge, Pa., 
are two other no-load groups that have special high-minimum, low-expense bond 
and money-market funds.

 How much do mutual funds pay to trade stocks? Not much, according to 
information compiled by Morningstar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based research outfit says the average stock fund pays about 0.31% 
annually in brokerage commissions -- equivalent to $3.10 on a $1,000 
investment. Including other operating expenses, fund costs amount to 1.63% on 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that most mutual funds are cost-effective investment vehicles, 
even when their trading fees are taken into account," writes Morningstar 
Analyst Amy C. Arnott. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain investment categories are more expensive than others, of course. 
Precious-metals funds have the top brokerage costs of 0.79% a year on average, 
followed by foreign-stock funds at 0.60% and health-care portfolios at 0.54%. 
</P>
<P>
 Equity-income funds are cheapest at 0.19%. Other penny pinchers include 
financial-services and utilities funds, both at 0.20%. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund reveals its brokerage costs in its Statement of Additional Information, 
a prospectus-like document available on request. Adding Asia 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a global or international mutual fund, you probably already have a 
stake in the hot western Pacific stock markets. On average, broadly diversified 
foreign funds have 15% to 20% of their assets in these markets. 
</P>
<P>

better-than-average track records and have large if not dominant positions in

JIFFY LUBE FOUNDER TRIES TO HELP JUVENILE DELINQUENTS; VISION: THE FORMER 
FOOTBALL COACH HAS TAKEN OVER A MARYLAND REFORM SCHOOL PLAGUED BY ESCAPES, 
CROWDED CONDITIONS AND VIOLENCE AGAINST EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After proving that a reform school kid can become a millionaire, James Hindman 
wants to show juvenile delinquents they can be successful and that he can make 
a profit setting them straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old founder of Jiffy Lube has taken over one of the state of 
Maryland's biggest headaches, the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a reform school 
plagued by escapes, crowded conditions and attacks on employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindman, who grew up in an Iowa reform school, said he knows firsthand about 
the potential promise of juvenile delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a dream and a vision of what these kids can be, not what they have 
been," said Hindman of his latest venture, Youth Services International. "I 
tell them, I've been where you are and I know a way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hindman's proposal to help juvenile delinquents while making a profit may seem 
like the rantings of a dreamer, but his record as a dreamer is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The stocky, tough-talking entrepreneur made his first million in the early 
1970s buying and selling nursing homes. Semi-retired at 40, he landed the head 
football coaching job at Western Maryland College in Westminster in 1976, 
leading the team through four winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a player complained it was no longer possible for an average person 
to become a millionaire, Hindman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I'm just going to work at Social Security because no one can become 
rich anymore.' I said, 'What kind of pinko told you that? I'll do it and take a 
lot of you fellas with me."' 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 years, Hindman built Jiffy Lube from an eight-store chain to the 
nation's dominant quick lube franchiser with about 1,000 outlets, although he 
accumulated about $150 million in debt in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Pennzoil bought an 80% stake in publicly held Jiffy Lube for $35 
million. Hindman received $1.3 million and about $250,000 a year for five years 
in consulting fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hindman says he wants to pay back society and once again prove wrong the 
doubters by making Youth Services International a success. The company has 
about 665 youths under its care at juvenile correctional facilities in 
Maryland, Iowa, Tennessee and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hyman, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, 
said it is too early to tell how things are going at the Hickey School. But 
state officials are pleased with the work Hindman's business has been doing at 
the Victor H. Cullen school in Sabillasville, Md., which Youth Services has 
been running for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a very caring staff. They work very well with the kids, teaching 
them responsibility and accountability," Hyman said. "Overall, they're doing a 
very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Hindman said he can turn a profit at the Hickey School even though the Rebound 
Corp. of Denver, another for-profit rehabilitation contractor, backed out of a 
three-year, $50-million-a-year contract to run the reform school after only 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Botkin, director of marketing for Rebound, said overcrowding and promised 
improvements to the facility that were never made were the main reasons Rebound 
and the state decided to break the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A reduction in the number of youths at Hickey and improvements made since 
Rebound left should make the job easier for Hindman's company, Botkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll have an easier time of it from a variety of standpoints," 
Botkin said. "It's still not an easy thing, but they have reduced the 
population." 
</P>
<P>
 Hindman said he hopes to replicate the success of Sam Ferrainola, who heads 
the Glen Mills School for youth in Concordeville, Pa. The school has built 
successful academic and athletic programs using a positive peer pressure 
approach in which older students push younger students to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrainola, however, said he doubts a for-profit corporation can care for 
youths as well as Glen Mills, a nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have four meals a day, a full-time dentist, 13 vocational programs and 14 
varsity sports," Ferrainola said. "Our kids who can get into college, we pay 
their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to do that if you're a profit-making organization. Sure, he means to 
do well, but I don't think he can run a school profitably on the model we are 
based on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hindman said running the school profitably and rehabilitating its residents 
are not conflicting goals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hickey School, 70 cents of every dollar spent goes toward labor costs. 
Hindman says he wants to lower that by having students at the school do as much 
as they can, not only to save costs, but to instill a work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 One example is the push mowers Youth Services brought in after learning the 
state wouldn't allow youths at the school to use power mowers. Such chores are 
integrated into a reward system to teach students the value of hard work, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to give them the opportunity to see they can make their life better, 
and they'll work in return to get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second key to the equation is convincing students of the importance of 
education, Hindman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned very early on that knowledge is power. Education gives you choices. 
I knew I had to learn to earn," he said.

TRADE AGREEMENTS BRIGHTENING THE GLOOMY WORLD ECONOMIES; FINANCE: GATT, IN 
PARTICULAR, IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A STRONG BOOST AT A TIME WHEN KEY COUNTRIES 
ARE DEALING WITH RECESSION, UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION AND OTHER ILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The world's economies staggered through 1993 with a wide range of maladies, 
from recession in Japan to high unemployment in Western Europe and inflation in 
Russia. But economists see a healthier future as they pin their hopes on 
expanding world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The 117-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in particular, is 
expected to provide a strong boost by eliminating many tariffs that impede the 
flow of goods and services. The pact, 400 pages long, was seven years in the 
making and finalized in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT is scheduled to take effect in 1995, after it has been ratified by the 
participating nations. The formal signing will be in Morocco in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say it couldn't come at a more welcome time. 
</P>
<P>
 As 1994 opens, unemployment is ravaging Western Europe, weak oil prices are 
hurting Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and inflation is gripping 
the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is moving farther out of recession, but higher interest 
rates could derail its fragile recovery. Latin America and Africa also are 
looking toward renewed growth after emerging from years of debt crises and 
droughts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, the so-called "Small Tigers" of Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong 
Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, growth champions for years, are finding themselves 
overshadowed by the "Big Tiger" of China, which expanded at a double-digit 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Europe had pinned its economic recovery on the creation of a separate 
17-nation free trade zone embracing 380 million people from the Arctic to the 
Mediterranean. The pact, made in January, was not ratified until December. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 million people remain jobless in the 12-nation European Community, an 
unemployment rate of 10.6%. Economists predict it could reach 11.3% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Delors, president of the EC executive commission, said the EC would 
have to bring more people into the job market or face the end of the European 
way of life, with 30 million unemployed by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 EC Economics Commissioner Henning Christophersen predicted the EC economy 
would grow 1.3% in 1994, following a 0.4% contraction in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery must mainly come from trade with third countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But which countries? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, whose unemployment is rising as corporate profits, auto exports and the 
stock market are all plunging, faces bleak prospects this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a tradition of lifetime employment, more Japanese companies have 
resorted to dismissing workers. Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno said in 
December that there were still no signs of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, experiencing a stop-and-go recovery since the most recent 
recession ended in March, 1991, faces modestly favorable prospects for this 
year. Its economy will grow about 2.8% this year, the same as last year, the 
National Assn. of Business Economists forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement in December, 1993. NAFTA takes in 360 million consumers and about $7 
trillion a year in production. 
</P>
<P>
 In South America, the Third World's biggest debtor, Brazil reached a deal with 
creditor banks on a major part of its $120 billion in foreign debt. It was the 
last major Latin American country to do so under a U.S.-sponsored plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When completed, (the agreement) will mark the end of the Latin American debt 
crisis," which had stuck the region in economic stagnation in the 1980s, said 
bank negotiator William Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The OPEC nations seem to be entering an economic crisis of their own. Unable 
to agree on a production cut to raise prices, the 12-member cartel decided in 
November to leave its crude output unchanged at 24.52 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
 With the oil market glutted, said Ian Seymour, editor of the Middle East 
Economic Survey, OPEC faces the possibility of prices moving even lower. That 
would help restrain inflation in the developed world, but Seymour said it 
"would obviously be catastrophic on the finances of OPEC." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, parts of Asia anticipated more growth in 1994. Deutsche Bank of 
Germany predicted a gross domestic product growth rate of 6.2% in Taiwan, 5.8% 
in South Korea, 7.2% in Singapore and 4.5% in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong, a British colony to become part of China in 1997, saw its economy 
grow 5.5% in 1993, and its per capita output surpassed Britain's. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand is estimated to grow 8.5% this year on top of 7.5% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch & Co. forecasts 7.8% growth for Indonesia and 8.3% for Malaysia. 
Only the Philippines lags in the area with 3.8% growth foreseen byMerrill Lynch 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 But China -- which grew at 13% in 1992 and was expected to surpass that rate 
in 1993 -- was the standout. Success came as the Communist Party announced that 
100 state-owned enterprises would be turned into independently run 
Western-style businesses over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 China's record growth "over the past 15 years has already brought it roughly 
the same per capita income levels as the economies in Eastern Europe," said 
Union Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nobel Economics Prize winner Douglass C. North said the former Soviet 
republics will take about 50 years to reach Western economic levels "if they 
are lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 In the republics and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe, chaos and 
confusion reigned in 1993 as democracy struggled to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperinflation, unemployment and declining industrial production were the main 
economic ailments.

FORMER BANKER CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY, FALSIFYING DATA; COURTS: ANTONIO MARIO 
ANGOTTI, THE SON OF AN ORANGE COUNTY FUGITIVE FINANCIER, FACES A MAXIMUM OF 135 
YEARS IN PRISON AND $4.5 MILLION IN FINES.

<P>
 The son of fugitive Orange County banker Ottavio A. Angotti has been convicted 
by a federal court jury of conspiracy and making false statements on a home 
loan application. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Mario Angotti, a former New York investment banker, was convicted late 
Thursday of falsifying his income and assets in an effort to obtain a $480,000 
loan from Western Federal Savings & Loan in Los Angeles, which, in an unrelated 
action, was seized by regulators last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence at the 16-day trial showed that Antonio Angotti, 36, of La Habra, 
told the thrift that he earned $17,500 a month and had assets totaling 
$200,000. The evidence showed that he had no income or assets, but obtained 
$20,000 from the proceeds of a fraudulently obtained loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Angotti faces a maximum of 135 years in prison and $4.5 million in fines. U.S. 
District Judge William Rea scheduled sentencing for March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Angotti was chief executive of Consolidated Savings Bank, an Irvine 
thrift that was seized by regulators in May, 1986, and closed later that year. 
He was convicted last May of falsifying Consolidated's loan records to hide 
proceeds funneled to Pyrotronics Inc. in Anaheim, which was once the state's 
largest maker of so-called safe and sane fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottavio Angotti, 56, then was indicted with his son. But on Memorial Day, 
before he was sentenced in the first case and arraigned in the second, he 
disappeared after being dropped off at a hospital in San Diego. He remains at 
large.

WOMEN FEAR RAPE SUSPECT MAY HAVE GIVEN THEM HIV; HEALTH: OFFICIALS SAY SOME 
VALLEY VICTIMS WILL NEVER KNOW IF THEY ARE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY 
LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When accused serial rapist Monette Johnson goes on trial this week, the 
prosecutor will say he is the man who broke into the homes of at least six San 
Fernando Valley women and raped them, and the defense lawyer will argue that he 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one subject neither of them is likely to address in the 
courtroom, or anywhere else for that matter: whether Johnson might have the 
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, and whether he could have passed 
on the deadly virus to his alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Johnson is suspected of raping as many as 15 women from across the 
East Valley, often at knifepoint in the middle of the night, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those women have been notified by county health officials that they 
may have been infected with the HIV virus by some person; but the notices won't 
say who. That's because state confidentiality laws shield Johnson and other 
accused, or convicted, rapists from having their health status widely 
publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some instances where rape victims can be told whether their attacker 
is infected with the virus, but only if criminal charges are filed in their 
case and if they get a court order mandating an AIDS test. But if a woman 
alleges a man has raped her -- and authorities are unable or choose not to 
prosecute -- she cannot be told his medical status. 
</P>
<P>
 And that rankles police, prosecutors, and especially, rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a travesty of justice," said one woman, who is set to testify that 
Johnson, 35, raped her. "It's not right for people not to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman and three others Johnson has been charged with raping all 
successfully petitioned the court two years ago to force him to undergo an AIDS 
test, and now know the results. Police believe other women were raped by 
Johnson besides those in the cases in which he is charged, but don't think they 
can prove it. And since no one can tell these women the results of the AIDS 
test -- not even another suspected rape victim who knows -- these women may 
never find out if the stocky parolee has tested positive or negative for the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone who is entitled to know, whether it be another suspected rape 
victim who may know or a county health official, runs the risk of a $10,000 
fine and a year in county jail if they disclose the results. Some authorities 
say that the law protects rapists at the expense of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those victims have a right to know," said Los Angeles Police Detective Gary 
Barthelmess, who added that even he is prohibited from finding out. "They're 
going to spend the rest of their lives wondering if and when they will come 
down with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The women who claim that Johnson raped them have been clamoring for 
information, say some victims, police and other authorities with knowledge of 
the case. They want to know if the letters they received from the county Health 
Department mean that he is the one who may have exposed them to the virus, or 
if someone else was the source. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine a rape victim who gets a letter like this, and doesn't know," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Rabichow, who is prosecuting Johnson. " 'Was it 
the suspect? My husband? My boyfriend?' There is no reason to prevent law 
enforcement or the victims from knowing the results in a sexual-assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a right to know if they've been exposed," Rabichow said, "and who 
exposed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, victims of rape, sodomy and certain types of sexual molestation in 
which body fluids may have been exchanged are entitled to go to court to force 
their accused attacker to undergo an AIDS test if a criminal case is brought. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire officials also can request such a test if they believe that 
they have come into contact with tainted blood or other body fluids. But they, 
too, cannot divulge the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Finn, medical director for AIDS programs for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services, said the confidentiality law may not be perfect, 
but that it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Without it, he said, people could claim that they were sexually assaulted 
simply as a means of determining whether a sexual partner or other person was 
HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can empathize with the women sitting out there with great concern," Finn 
said. "But if we move to change the law to say anyone can find out such 
results, then we're moving into the area of hearsay. And that really concerns 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some private groups that promote AIDS outreach and awareness vehemently oppose 
changing the laws, and say people would never come forward to be tested if 
there was any possibility that the results would be given to others. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they say, fewer people would get tested and treated, and more 
people would unknowingly spread the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the issue hasn't come up all that often in police stations and the 
courts, according to Rabichow. 
</P>
<P>
 Finn, who has the responsibility of discussing such test results with those 
entitled to get them, said only about 15 rape and molestation victims in Los 
Angeles County have ever asked for the results of their attackers' tests. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the women in the Johnson case have reported testing positive 
for the HIV virus. Finn said that in the vast majority of cases, if someone 
does not test positive within three months of an exchange of bodily fluids, 
they can rest assured that they were not infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Like prosecutors and police, Finn predicted that the clash of AIDS disclosure 
and confidentiality in criminal cases will become more pronounced in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Barthelmess, a veteran sex-crimes detective in North Hollywood, said the issue 
already is coming up with increasing frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims have pleaded with him and health officials to tell them if they 
have been infected with the virus, and by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts you in a moral dilemma, of fundamental right versus wrong," he said, 
adding that he would never divulge such information illegally, even if he did 
know. "I'd risk a $10,000 fine I'd have to pay out of my pocket, and if not my 
job, my assignment." 
</P>
<P>
 Someday soon, he said, prosecutors and police will have to grapple with even 
more confusing issues, such as when a man who knows he is HIV-positive is 
caught raping someone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, HIV-infected prostitutes have been charged with attempted murder 
or other felony charges for knowingly having unsafe sex, but few rapists have 
been charged in a similar fashion. And since police and prosecutors are usually 
precluded from knowing such information about a defendant's HIV status, they 
may not be able to make an informed decision on what charges to file against 
them, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rabichow, an expert on sex crimes and confidentiality issues, and 
Barthelmess said the law is very murky in such areas, and untested by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows how the law applies," Barthelmess said. "It's just too new." 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that some health or law-enforcement authority eventually will be 
accused of giving out HIV-related information to a victim or even a prosecutor, 
and that the issue will be brought before the courts to see if the person 
should be fined or charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody wants to be that test case," Barthelmess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, of Lake View Terrace, is a convicted criminal with a long record and 
a list of aliases, including Monnette C. Alford Johnson. Police say he prowled 
Valley neighborhoods and raped his victims at knifepoint after entering their 
houses and apartments through unlocked doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with 28 counts of rape, burglary, robbery and other criminal 
counts for a series of attacks that police say he committed between August, 
1991, until he was arrested in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His trial is scheduled to begin today in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Johnson case, prosecutors say they will try to convict him on the basis 
of witness testimony, DNA testing and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Property stolen from some of the victims, including jewelry and video and 
music equipment, were found at his apartment, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's lawyer, M. David Houchin, has said in court documents that such DNA 
testing is faulty. Johnson has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Johnson was 
released from parole in July, 1991, after serving nearly a year for an 
extortion conviction. Authorities allege that the rapes started soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, his past convictions also include assault with a 
deadly weapon or firearm on a peace officer and unlawful driving or taking of a 
vehicle.

MIKE PENNER: SUPER BOWL CAN GET BY WITHOUT VISIT FROM BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Potential Super Bowl matchups to root for: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Kansas City-San Francisco. Joe Montana vs. Steve Young. And you thought the 
Bay Area shook in '89. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Houston-Dallas. For the undisputed heavyweight championship of Texas, with 
Buddy Ryan vs. Kevin Gilbride on the undercard. Yeee-haw!  
</P>
<P>
 3. Raiders-New York Giants. Where Jeff Hostetler, emerging giant among 
Raiders, attempts to show his old mates that 1990 was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Kansas City-Green Bay. Where it all started, XXVIII years ago. Many great 
Max McGee stories worth retelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential Super Bowl matchups to root against, with all the blood, sweat, 
passion and vigor a human being can possibly muster: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Buffalo-Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Buffalo-New York. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Buffalo-San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Buffalo-Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It cannot happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 It must not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible to conceive, considering the back-to-back blowouts 
against Washington and Dallas, the change in general managers, the defection of 
six free-agent starters before the season and the fodder they have provided 
stand-up (and sit-down) comedians for the past 12 months, but there the Buffalo 
Bills are again, two home victories away from a record fourth consecutive Super 
Bowl appearance/disaster, the team to beat in the AFC . . . before somebody 
from the NFC stomps the stuffing out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-handedly, the Bills have all but killed off the Super Bowl, rendering 
the concept meaningless, the point moot. 
</P>
<P>
 College football has no credible method of deciding a champion, only a bunch 
of corporate-subsidized bowl games and a system that disregards a victory by 
No. 2 over No. 1 while awarding the national title on the basis of which coach 
the sportswriters like best. Yet when college football looks at the results of 
the last three Super Bowls -- average score: Buffalo 20, Other Guys 38 -- it 
straightens its lapels and says, "Uh, thanks, but we'll stick with what we've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, who hated seeing what Buffalo's football team did to his good 
name last January, tried to enact legislation banning the Bills from all future 
Super Bowl competition, but Bob Dole filibustered it to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shula loaded up on old all-stars -- Keith Jackson, Keith Byars, Irving 
Fryar -- in an attempt to derail Buffalo before the playoffs, a humanitarian 
gesture that won him Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year award. But 
Shula's best all-star, Dan Marino, blew out an Achilles' tendon and the 
Dolphins lost their last five games, enabling the Bills not only to back into 
the AFC East championship but the conference's home-field advantage as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone stop them? 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, all hope rests with the Raiders, Buffalo's second-round 
opponent on Sunday. Imagine: For one week, for the first time in 34 years of 
late hits and assorted Al Davis skulduggery, the Raiders have been designated 
"America's Team." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days ago, they were "America's Thugs," but that was before they completed 
a three-game sweep of Denver and stepped on up to the icebox. Now, an entire 
country wishes them well: Godspeed, Art Shell, may the road rise with you -- 
and may the wind-chill factor be conducive to your kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Pete Rozelle is probably pulling for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But what chances do these wild-card Raiders have on the frozen artificial 
tundra of Rich Stadium? Remember the last time the Raiders ventured to Buffalo, 
for the AFC championship game in January, 1991? Buffalo covered the spread, 
51-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Hostetler and before last month's regular-season meeting 
in Buffalo. The Raiders won that one, 25-24, triggering a 4-1 stretch run that 
got them back in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Raiders, it's either Houston or Kansas City. Finally, Joe Montana 
and Buddy Ryan have something in common -- another once-in-a-lifetime 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston lost to Buffalo earlier this season, 35-7, but that was back in early 
October, when the Oilers were so discombobulated by Ryan's presence that they 
were losing to everybody who wandered into the stadium, even the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Ryan's presence: That 35-3 lead Houston blew against Buffalo in 
the first round of the 1992 playoffs. The Oilers hired Ryan, severe personality 
defects and all, for one express purpose: Don't let it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City owns a better track record than Houston -- the Chiefs beat Buffalo 
in November, 23-7, at Arrowhead Stadium -- but the Oilers have the home field. 
Could Kansas City do it again, in Buffalo, if need be? 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs have two chances, and two chances only: 
</P>
<P>
 If Montana plays . . . and if Montana plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other conference, Green Bay plays at Dallas and New York plays at San 
Francisco. Big deal. The outcomes of those pairings are irrelevant. Whoever 
wins, and wins the week after that, will defeat Buffalo in the Super Bowl. 
Probably by five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the only playoff games that matter belong to the AFC. Three 
challengers left. Two more opportunities to halt the decline of western 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders win next week, I say Al Davis gets the Nobel Peace Prize.

RAIDERS AT BEST WHEN IT COUNTS MOST; AFC: THEY REACH A NEW LEVEL IN BEATING THE 
BRONCOS, 42-24. THE BILLS AWAIT IN THE SECOND ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, it wasn't even close. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, there was no need for a Jeff Jaeger game-winning kick. Or a Jeff 
Hostetler last-second drive. Or a Tim Brown clock-beating catch. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Raiders, who have played so many close games against Denver, 
scored early, often and relentlessly against the Broncos, played stifling 
defense in the second half and reserved the final minutes for celebrating their 
first playoff victory in three years and only their second since winning Super 
Bowl XVIII a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders squeaked into the playoffs, but they roared through the first 
round Sunday to set up a second-round matchup with the Bills in Buffalo 
Saturday. The Raiders decimated the Broncos Sunday, 42-24, with their finest 
all-around performance of the year in a wild-card game played Sunday before a 
sellout Coliseum crowd officially listed at 65,314. 
</P>
<P>
 And wild it was. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a paraglider in the sky above the Coliseum, numerous fights down on 
the field and a sidelined Raider player racing in from the sidelines in street 
clothes to take on the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 And those were only the sideshows. 
</P>
<P>
 Center stage, there was Hostetler, spraying passes all over the field. There 
was Brown, making the big catches that have become his trademark this season. 
There was James Jett, flashing the speed best described by his last name. There 
was Ethan Horton, coming up with the game's first big catch. There was an 
offensive line that kept Hostetler safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a running game that had once been dormant. It came alive, led by 
Napoleon McCallum, who scored three touchdowns six weeks after laying in a 
hospital bed undergoing an appendectomy, and Ty Montgomery, who has become a 
effective force after spending most of the first 15 games waiting on the 
sidelines for his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think today, whenever we had to score," Hostetler said, "we could have 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver offense had its moments as well, Shannon Sharpe catching 13 passes, 
to tie the NFL playoff record, for 156 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense played on emotion. And that emotion was fueled by the 
Broncos' first offensive play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Robert Delpino went around left end for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play turned out to be a huge loss for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Chester McGlockton, in pursuit, took on center Keith Kartz. 
As McGlockton did so, guard Brian Habib came down hard on the back of 
McGlockton's left leg, breaking it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was asinine," Raider lineman Nolan Harrison said. "It doesn't make any 
sense to go out there and try to hurt somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Howie Long, McGlockton's closest friend on the team, took the injury 
especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an empty spot on the bench next to me," Long said. "He's been a 
very big part of my season. It was very emotional for me. Very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the day was set for the Raiders who felt, to a man, that it had 
been a cheap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are going to play dirty, we've got to play dirty," linebacker Winston 
Moss said. "The way I play, it's an eye for an eye." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, it was more like a touchdown for a touchdown. Neither 
defense could do much. Both sides punted on their first possession and neither 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was an old-fashioned quarterback shootout. Hostetler, who finished 
with 13 completions in 19 attempts for 294 yards, hit Horton for nine yards and 
a touchdown in the first quarter. Denver quarterback John Elway, who wound up 
with 29 completions in 47 attempts for 302 yards, answered with a 23-yard 
touchdown pass to Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler connected with Tim Brown on a 65-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway came back with a 16-yard TD pass to Reggie Johnson early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler hooked up with Jett on an over-the-shoulder, twirling, wirling 
54-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Back came Elway with a six-yard touchdown to Derek Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was only the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 21-21 at intermission and it looked like it was going to be one of 
those games where the last team with the ball wins. 
</P>
<P>
 That figured. Fourteen of the previous 21 games between the two clubs had been 
decided by three points or fewer, six of them going into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second half, the Raiders broke the game open. On the ground of all 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 And with McCallum of all people. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who hadn't rushed from scrimmage for about two years until earlier 
this season, spending his time on special teams, the man who saw his season 
flash before his eyes when he underwent the appendectomy in Cincinnati the day 
before a game in late November, broke off left tackle in the third quarter, 
broke a tackle and carried defensive back Darryl Hall into the end zone on a 
26-yard run, the longest by a Raider all season. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCallum was just warming up. He also scored from two yards out and from a 
yard out. The three touchdown runs, on a day when McCallum gained a season-high 
81 yards rushing, equaled his season total in touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And meanwhile, the Raider defense was tightening the vise on Elway, holding 
the Broncos to three points in the second half, those coming on a 33-yard field 
goal by Jason Elam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders sacked Elway once, Anthony Smith doing the honors, and intercepted 
one of Elway's passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The interception, the Raiders' first in four games and Elway's first in 141 
attempts, was set up when Eddie Anderson blitzed from his safety spot. Trying 
to beat the pressure, Elway threw the ball into the hands of Raider defensive 
back Torin Dorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the undercurrent of emotion bubbled. Hostetler charged the 
Broncos' Le-Lo Lang after the Raider quarterback felt Lang had gone for his 
knees. Brown and Denver defensive back Tyrone Braxton battled all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And the officials responded against both sides. The Raiders were penalized 17 
times, a new league playoff record, for 130 yards. The Broncos were penalized 
10 times for 97 yards, breaking NFL marks for combined penalties and combined 
penalty yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bitter loss for the Broncos, their third this season to the Raiders, 
their seventh straight in the Coliseum and their ninth in the last 10 meetings 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 But what also hurt was that it wasn't even close.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT'S SMOOTH SAILING FOR MCCALLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Professional football may or may not be ready for the backfield of. . . 
Napoleon McCallum and Todd Peat??? Who would be? No matter how unprepared 
anyone was for the low-scoring Los Angeles Raiders to pop for 75 points in two 
games, or for the mile-high Denver Broncos to hyperventilate and gag again here 
at sea level, absolutely nothing could have braced the football world for a 
playoff-bound backfield of Lt. McCallum and Mr. Peat, the sailor and the 
destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the secret weapons of the Raiders as they prevailed once more over 
the three-strikes-and-you're-out Broncos, who with minutes remaining in 
Sunday's game at the Coliseum were so clearly beaten that at quarterback they 
sent for Tommy Maddox, the surrender equivalent of Appomattox. The final score 
was 42-24, and it instantly turned the Raiders into America's team, because 
someone has to spare us from another Super Bowl involving the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, saying "I finally made it to the promised land," had a 26-yard run 
for a touchdown, the longest run from scrimmage of the entire Raider season and 
his own longest since leaving the Naval Academy. He also scored twice more, 
following the search-and-destroy blocking of the 305-pound Peat, an offensive 
guard who lined up in an I-formation and cleared a hole like no one since the 
heyday of Refrigerator Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that's how a fullback feels," Peat said later. 
</P>
<P>
 At a game that began so ominously for the Raiders, with quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler being sacked on his first play from scrimmage and defensive tackle 
Chester McGlockton breaking a bone in his leg on his first play from scrimmage, 
a crowd of 65,314 was wildly entertained by an old-style Raider-Bronco game 
that had everything but Fred Biletnikoff and Rick Upchurch, with one bombs-away 
pass after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen catches by Shannon Sharpe of Denver might have dominated the game 
statistically, but you will see few better catches this season than an 
over-the-shoulder grab by James Jett of the Raiders during which he spun around 
and around until ultimately he resembled Willie Mays running under a baseball 
hit by Vic Wertz. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think this great game nearly failed to sell out. Why were all the 
available tickets not bought? That will remain a mystery for the ages, although 
a Denver offensive lineman, Gary Zimmerman, made a joke beforehand that if the 
Raiders had offered a free ticket to every one of their fans who turned in a 
handgun, there wouldn't have been an empty seat in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 There were fireworks, all right. Emotional ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering some of them was a low -- and we do mean low -- block thrown by 
Bronco right guard Brian Habib at the legs of McGlockton, who heard a crack and 
had to be wheeled off the field by electric cart. McGlockton's linemate and 
close friend, Howie Long, was particularly put out, saying: "There's no place 
in the NFL for a block like that. None." 
</P>
<P>
 More emotional commotion followed after Hostetler, who probably never dreamed 
that he would end up handing off 28 times to McCallum and Tyrone Montgomery 
while throwing only 19 passes, scrambled out of bounds on one play only to be 
undercut by Le-Lo Lang. Out of reflex, Hostetler went after the tackler, 
risking eviction, whereupon offensive lineman Steve Wisniewski offered his 
support by clocking Lang with his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how wild a game it was, with an NFL playoff-record 27 penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the peace-loving McCallum, the good lieutenant, who ended up the 
conquering hero. No running back on this squad had ripped off a run longer than 
16 yards all season, but when McCallum's 26-yard bolt midway through the third 
quarter took him into the end zone standing up, he celebrated with a spike that 
sent the ball bouncing like Silly Putty, several feet above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely one of the best days I've ever had," McCallum said. "I can't wait 
to go home and celebrate with my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Inactivity had been McCallum's burden for so long, whether it be because his 
employers already had a Marcus Allen or a Bo Jackson or because he was laid up 
by appendicitis. After such a splendid career at the academy, it had to hurt 
McCallum that his pro career never took off. The joy in his voice was palpable 
when he said: "I love playing football. I love playing with these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as teammates were concerned, it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Nap," Long said. "Here's a guy, well, let's just say I have no idea if 
I could have persevered through everything he has in his career. I remember 
when he stood night watch for the Navy, midnight to 8. Then he'd drive his car 
north, with no sleep, to practice with us. He's the kind of guy you'd want to 
marry your daughter. He's like a Navy highlight film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you something about Napoleon McCallum," Long added, laughing. "He 
has no moves, he's slow and I have no idea how he does it. But he's one hell of 
a football player." 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of no moves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred-plus pounds of Peat went plopping on top of the Denver Bronco 
season, the biggest surprise of the playoffs thus far. Peat, whose nickname 
from his teammates is "Heavy," did everything but carry the ball and said 
afterward: "Maybe we'll get around to that later. Today I was happy to do 
whatever I could to help us win the game. I haven't done anything like this 
since high school or college, and obviously it was a lot of fun. That was some 
collision out there! I don't know if Denver was expecting that."

GIANTS GO EXTRA YARDS FOR TAYLOR; NFC: LINEBACKER'S HALFTIME HARANGUE IS 
CREDITED AFTER VIKINGS ARE BEATEN, 17-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For three hours in sub-freezing temperatures Sunday, fingers were cracked, 
muscles were popped and a quarterback was knocked totally numb. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the loudest sound during the New York Giants' 17-10 playoff victory 
against the Minnesota Vikings was not heard on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kratch heard it from the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Myron Guyton heard it from where his head was buried inside his shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Miller said he will hear it the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sound of Lawrence Taylor stalking the Giants' locker room at 
halftime, screaming and cursing. It was the sound of an old fighter in probably 
his final season trying to extract another ounce of glory from a team that 
trailed by a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to cuss in public anymore but . . . the young guys have to learn 
that you have to step it up a bit in this thing called the playoffs," Taylor 
said. "I think we learned." 
</P>
<P>
 They learned they could score two touchdowns in fewer than 10 minutes against 
the league's top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned that they could hit Viking quarterback Jim McMahon hard enough to 
knock him out of the game not only once, but twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, well, they learned that sometimes your worst fears can come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were as tough as we thought," said Viking quarterback Sean Salisbury, 
who replaced McMahon for a couple of series. "They line up, they hit you in the 
mouth, then they line up and hit you in the mouth again." 
</P>
<P>
 And again. And again. In the Vikings' last three possessions, even with a 
stiff wind at their backs, they gained nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Hamilton ended the game by sacking McMahon at midfield, sending these 
old-time Giants to a second-round game Saturday in San Francisco against the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be those teams' sixth postseason meeting in 13 years. The Giants have 
won the last three, most recently by 15-13 in the 1990 NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 If the condition of Jim McMahon Sunday is any indication, the 49ers' Steve 
Young had better dig up a flak jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's left shoulder was so badly bruised that he could barely dress 
afterward. His head was spinning from a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have nothing at the end," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing with gloves in 23-degree temperatures, he was doing fine late in the 
first half, when the Vikings stunned the Giants and 75,089 mostly booing fans 
with 10 points in two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon eluded Taylor and threw a 40-yard touchdown pass with two minutes to 
play.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Giants' Mike Horan punted into teammate Greg Jackson's back, the 
Vikings added a 52-yard, wind-aided field goal by Fuad Reveiz with eight 
seconds remaining for a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it was Taylor's turn to blister the team, which did not catch anybody by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the bathroom and I heard all this screaming and cussing and I just 
said, 'Oh, that's Lawrence,' " Kratch said. "One hour and 45 minutes before the 
Dallas game last week, he was doing the same thing. That's a long time before a 
game to be that fired up." 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Miller, a linebacker in his third season: "He said the young guys 
didn't know the emotion it took to win a playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one play into the second half, it was known that Taylor had been heard. 
Young linemen Keith Hamilton and Mike Fox collided upon McMahon in the 
backfield and knocked all the feeling out of him. "My whole body went numb, I 
didn't know what was wrong," said McMahon, who lay on the turf for several 
minutes before the feeling returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, the Giants tied the score on Rodney Hampton's season-high 
51-yard touchdown run through a hole on the left side. Hampton tied a Giant 
postseason record with 161 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon returned on the Vikings' next series, but did little, leading to a 
shanked punt by Harry Newsome. Eight plays later, the Giants took the lead on 
Hampton's two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Giants had run nine consecutive running plays for 77 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Viking were talking a bunch of trash in the first half, but we finally 
knew we had gotten to them on that series," Kratch said. "All of a sudden, it 
got real quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon again tried to bring the Vikings back, but this time he lasted only 
five plays before Fox pounded him into the turf once more. And once more, he 
lay there for a few minutes before being helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of felt bad for McMahon . . . they were knocking the mess out of him," 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury, a potential free agent who was playing perhaps his last game in a 
Viking uniform, gave the Vikings their last hope by connecting with Cris Carter 
on a 30-yard pass play early in the fourth quarter. But Guyton knocked the ball 
loose and Greg Jackson recovered at the Giant 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing crazier was the scene on the sideline before the Vikings' final 
series, which started at their 42.  
</P>
<P>
 McMahon, who had returned to the game after sitting out only two full series, 
appeared woozy, but wanted to play. Salisbury had looked more sound, but didn't 
want to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while the world waited, the Viking coaches argued about whom to send into 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a game of duck, duck, goose," Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they decided on McMahon, who completed one of five passes in the Vikings' 
final possession, the name of the game was the same as it had been all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck, duck.

THERE'S NO NEED TO COME FROM BEHIND AGAIN; RAIDERS: L.A. GETS EVERYTHING 
TOGETHER DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND AVOIDS A CLOSE FINISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 While sitting calmly by his locker unwrapping tape from his wrist, middle 
linebacker Joe Kelly best summed up the Raiders' second victory in consecutive 
weeks over the Denver Broncos. "This one wasn't as climactic, but it feels just 
as good," Kelly said in comparing the victory to the Raiders' comeback against 
Denver the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, this means more because it's just the first step for us. We now 
have two more steps to go." 
</P>
<P>
 What Kelly and his teammates were referring to was the number of victories the 
Raiders need to reach Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spotting Denver a 17-point lead, as they did the week before, the 
Raiders only let the Broncos stay close for a half before shutting them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver quarterback John Elway passed for 199 yards and three touchdowns as the 
teams ended the half tied at 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is, but we just seem to start slow against them," Raider 
linebacker Winston Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we made some good adjustments and played a lot better in the second half 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, the Raiders' offense did not know what to expect from its 
defense. All the players knew was that they needed to score in case the defense 
did not get it together to stop the Broncos' passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sense of urgency, the Raiders unloaded on Denver in the third quarter 
for two touchdowns to take a 35-21 lead, and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did have concern about scoring," Raider wide receiver Alexander Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we were going to have to score more and move the ball in order 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense then felt that it was its turn. 
</P>
<P>
 On their first four drives of the second half, the Broncos punted three 
consecutive times and had their fourth end on an interception by cornerback 
Torin Dorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to have to come from behind again," said Moss, who had six 
tackles. "So, we had to shut them down." 
</P>
<P>
 A key defender for the Raiders was veteran Greg Townsend, who seems to always 
play his best against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend had two big tackles for losses and a deflected pass that bounced off 
his face mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you just get it going and plays just happen for you," Townsend 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that we were letting our offense down, so it was great for me to make 
some plays that fall within my responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense made its most effective stand of the game when they forced 
Denver to kick a field goal early in the fourth quarter that cut the Raiders' 
lead to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Raider offense took over with a 10-play, 76-yard drive that 
took nearly six minutes and was capped by Napoleon McCallum's third touchdown 
run of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Elway and the Broncos got the ball again, they trailed, 42-24, with 6:43 
remaining and the game was all but over. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, there weren't any jumps for joy by the Raiders, only subdued 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, last week's win was a little bit more exciting, but this was close," 
Raider center Don Mosebar said. "After all, if we didn't win today, we wouldn't 
have a game next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders earned a trip to Buffalo to play the Bills, whom they defeated 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what it's all about," Kelly said. "Playing to win. Denver's over with 
and now we move on to Buffalo."

SIDELINED RAIDER FIGHTS; PARAGLIDER IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were involved in two incidents at the Coliseum Sunday -- handcuffing a 
Raider who participated in a fight that broke out among Raider and Denver 
Bronco players and arresting a paraglider who threatened to disrupt the game. 
</P>
<P>
 James Trapp, a Raider rookie cornerback who is not on the active roster 
because of a groin injury, was in street clothes on the sidelines when the 
second-quarter fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapp, a third-round draft choice from Clemson, was led off the field by Randy 
Jordan, a teammate also on inactive status. Trapp returned after halftime and 
was handcuffed and escorted from the field by police but was not arrested. 
Police said they will leave any disciplinary action to the Raiders and/or the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight started after Bronco cornerback Le-Lo Lang hit Raider quarterback 
Jeff Hostetler out of bounds and Hostetler retaliated. Hostetler's teammates 
and several Broncos entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapp told Jordan he went onto the field to fight with the Bronco defensive 
back Frank Robinson after he saw Robinson hit the Raiders' Tim Brown in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos were penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the Raiders were 
not because game officials did not realize Trapp was an inactive player. 
</P>
<P>
 The paraglider arrested by police was James Miller of Henderson, Nev., who had 
landed in the ring at Caesar Palace in Las Vegas during the Evander 
Holyfield-Riddick Bowe heavyweight title fight on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commander Dave Gascon said Miller, after flying over the Coliseum, flew 
to Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood. He was followed by a police 
helicopter and arrested for allegedly interfering with a sports event, a 
misdemeanor. An alleged accomplice fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police helicopter pilot Jack Brandt said: "We confiscated his 
little motor. . . . But he still said: 'Just wait until the Super Bowl.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. John Preston said Miller apparently has been hired to perform aerial 
stunts during halftime of the Super Bowl in Atlanta. Preston did not elaborate 
and organizers for the halftime show were not immediately available.

SHARPE IS SHARP, BUT BRONCOS AREN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Denver Broncos, so happy to rid themselves of Coach Dan Reeves after last 
season, are on their way back to Denver, knocked out of the playoffs by the 
Raiders, 42-24, and finished with a 9-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who supposedly was too intense and too domineering for the likes of 
quarterback John Elway, will have no time to consider what went wrong with the 
Broncos Sunday in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, named the Associated Press' coach of the year on Thursday, has his 
Giants (12-5) two victories away from the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't get my vote," said Elway, when asked if Reeves deserves such 
credit. "I thought Wade Phillips did a great job as head coach; he's my coach 
of the year. He walked into a tough situation, and with the injuries we've had 
with the youngest team in the league, I think he's done a super, super job." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' Broncos, however, took a dive at season's end, squandering an 
opportunity to secure home-field advantage a week ago with a loss to the 
Raiders and now dropping out of sight with another loss to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 While Elway is happier and playing the best football of his career, the 
Broncos appeared to lack the overall attention to detail that marked Reeves' 
years in command. The Broncos were never considered all that talented under 
Reeves, but somehow, some way, they advanced to three Super Bowls.  
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' Broncos were called for 10 penalties against the Raiders, failed to 
gain an edge in field position because of poor punting in the second half, and 
allowed quarterback Jeff Hostetler to shred their secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, this game came down to two final quarters of play, and the 
Broncos failed to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very well on defense and it was probably our worst game of the 
year," Phillips said. "Any time you give up 42 points, you're going to get 
beat. You can't win that way. . . . We couldn't stop the passing game and we 
played poorly on short yardage and on the goal line." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler passed for seven touchdowns without being intercepted once this 
season in three starts against the Broncos. On Sunday, he hit tight end Ethan 
Horton for a nine-yard score, beat Denver's three-deep zone with a 65-yard 
strike to Tim Brown for a second score and then took advantage of that same 
defense again for a 54-yard touchdown pass play to James Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a race," said Bronco safety Dennis Smith. "We're the trucks and 
they are the race cars. If it is a race, we're going to lose. If it is a 
collision, they're going to lose. Unfortunately, there were more races in this 
game than collisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's game of pitch and catch with tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is the 
younger brother of Green Bay's Sterling, allowed the Broncos to stay even with 
the Raiders, 21-21, in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take your hat off to the Raiders," said Sharpe. "They just 
outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe caught 13 passes, tying an NFL-playoff record shared by Buffalo's 
Thurman Thomas and San Diego's Kellen Winslow, for 156 yards, including a 
23-yard touchdown to open Denver's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were double- and triple-teaming me and yet it felt like I couldn't do 
anything wrong," Sharpe said. "I was just putting my hands up and it seemed 
like John was finding me. The record doesn't matter, though, because we lost 
the ballgame. I just wish I could have done something to sway the game in our 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of playing both ways and upgrading Denver's secondary, there wasn't much 
more Sharpe could do. Three of Sharpe's nine receptions in the first half 
resulted in first downs, including a 13-yard diving reception on third and 
seven at the Raiders' 18-yard line that set up Denver's second score. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said the Raiders had a psychological edge because of beating us here 
so many times," Sharpe said. "A psychological edge is when you put up 42 points 
and the other team has 24. They scored, we scored, but they kept grinding on 
us."

 Sunday's game established AFC playoff records for penalties by one team and 
for two teams combined.In both cases, the Raiders broke their own records. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 17 penalties Sunday were three more than the previous record set by the 
Oakland Raiders during a 1980 game against Houston. The record of 14 was tied a 
year later by San Francisco in an NFC playoff game against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the Raiders and Broncos had 27 penalties, easily breaking the record 
of 22 set in three different games -- the same Raider-Oiler game, the same 
49er-Giant game and a game between Houston and Cleveland in 1988. STEVE

 It has been a few days, but Buddy Ryan says he has no regrets about The Punch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers' defensive coordinator told the Philadelphia Inquirer that 
the blow to offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride on Jan. 2 during the Oilers' 
victory over the New York Jets served its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you won't see him making calls like that again," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan hit Gilbride in the face after an Oiler offensive play called about 30 
seconds before halftime resulted in a sack and led to a Jet field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a third-down offense, not a pro offense," Ryan said in the interview 
conducted Tuesday in Houston. "And he has no business coaching the pros. He 
should be selling insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, 59, says Gilbride had it coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks that it's all my fault, and they keep showing that on TV," 
Ryan said. " . . . He is the one who made the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I said. I might have called him a high school coach. 
Something like that. He was cussing me and coming at me."

SHULER, LEWIS, WALKER TO ENTER DRAFT

<P>
 Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler, saying it was his dream to play pro 
football since he was 10 years old, will give up his senior year of eligibility 
to make himself available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana flanker Thomas Lewis, who caught 55 passes for 1,058 yards and seven 
touchdowns this season, and former UCLA nose guard Bruce Walker, who did not 
play this season but has one more year of college eligibility, also said they 
would give up their senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was suspended this season by UCLA after pleading no contest to a charge 
of receiving stolen property that was traced to a campus dormitory.

SPEEDSKATING; BLAIR CONCLUDES OLYMPIC TRIALS WITH A FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bonnie Blair wrapped up the U.S. Olympic long-track speedskating trials with 
her eighth track record in nine races, strong evidence of her readiness for 
next month's Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after competing in the Games three times, winning four medals and 
becoming the only woman to win consecutive gold medals in the 500-meter sprint, 
Blair is having no trouble motivating herself for Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one being inside, the times are going to be fast, and that psyches me 
up. That's what this sport is all about -- speed," Blair said after cruising to 
a time of 1:20.46 in Sunday's 1,000-meter race at the Pettit National Ice 
Center. "You know it's going to be fast, and that's what's more exciting about 
this Olympics than the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair qualified in the 500 -- in which she holds the world record of 39.10 
seconds -- the 1,000 and the 1,500, although she hasn't decided if she will 
race the 1,500. Also qualifying in the 1,000 Sunday were Chantal Bailey of 
Boulder, Colo., Michelle Kline of Circle Pines, Minn., and 18-year-old Chris 
Witty of West Allis, Wis., a first-time Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen skipped Sunday's 1,000-meter race, but his first two times made him 
the top qualifier. Nathaniel Mills of Evanston, Ill., who also qualified in the 
500 and 1,500, was second overall. Brendan Eppert of St. Louis, a first-time 
Olympian at 23, was third in the 1,000 point standings, one spot ahead of Dave 
Besteman of Madison, Wis. Besteman will also race the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now Dan's mentally tired and he doesn't want to see the ice for a 
couple of days, so he's not going to come here for two days," said his coach, 
Peter Mueller. "(The trials) didn't do much for him in terms of motivation. 
Lillehammer will be better, and just the competition will bring Dan to a 
different level." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Talbot of Schuylerville, N.Y., didn't qualify in the 1,000 but was 
assured a berth in the 500. That lifted her spirits for the ordeal she faces 
Tuesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where she will donate bone 
marrow to her brother, Jason, who is suffering from aplastic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure will keep her overnight at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore 
and render her too weak to train at a normal pace for about two weeks. However, 
she expects to be at full strength for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a rough couple of weeks," she said. "I'm exhausted now. I don't 
think I realized how much stress I've had on me. . . . I'm pretty calm (about 
her procedure), but I'm nervous for Jason. I'm glad he's done so well with his 
chemotherapy, and that's what I was most worried about." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Scheels of New Berlin, Wis., won the 5,000 meters in 7:58.11, but 
her participation in the Olympics hinges on her time in the 3,000 at the Games. 
KC Boutiette, winner of Sunday's 10,000 in a track-record time of 14:50.66, is 
in an even dicier situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee has limited the field in the women's 3,000 
and men's 5,000 to the 32 fastest times, with a maximum of three skaters per 
country. The 16 fastest skaters in those races will qualify for the women's 
5,000 and men's 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, Scheels and Angela Zuckerman appear likely to make the final 32 in the 
3,000, but competition is tougher in the men's ranks and the U.S. trials 
leaders in the 5,000 are unlikely to make the Olympic field. Boutiette, Dave 
Tamburrino of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Brian Wanek of Mequon, Wis., were the 
top finishers in the 5,000, but Boutiette's best of 7:07.96 is 10 to 12 seconds 
off the expected cutoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutiette, Wanek and Brian Smith of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were the top three 
finishers in the 10,000, but Boutiette's time was almost 45 seconds off the 
American record and 67 seconds off the world mark. Milwaukee will be host oftwo 
more open, international meets in which skaters can reduce their times by the 
International Skating Union's Jan. 30 deadline.

NCAA CONVENTION; NEW DIRECTOR URGES LEADERS TO SHOW FLEXIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cedric Dempsey, the new executive director of the NCAA, Sunday urged college 
sports leaders to be willing to consider amending some of their decisions, 
including the controversial academic requirements that have drawn criticism 
from black coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I submit that reform does not mean rigidity, and refinement does not mean 
retreat," he said in his first "State of the Association" address, the formal 
opening of the 88th annual NCAA convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey, former athletic director at Arizona, was named to replace Dick 
Schultz in the NCAA's top administrative post in November. Dempsey did not use 
his first opportunity to address NCAA members as a bully pulpit for a 
particular issue, but touched on some of the key matters facing the group, 
including debate over the new academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA Council voted last Friday to present a resolution to convention 
delegates directing various NCAA committees to review legislation that will 
raise academic standards for prospective student-athletes. The new academic 
standards, commonly known as Proposition 16, were approved in 1992 and are due 
to take effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Coaches Assn., a national group of college and high school coaches, 
has complained that the requirements will disproportionately affect blacks. The 
group has also raised questions about the research that was used to support the 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging convention delegates to approve the resolution, Dempsey said: "We need 
to evaluate whether we have been successful in communicating these new 
requirements to prospective student-athletes. We must also determine if, based 
on the best and most current information, these requirements meet our goals of 
academic integrity and educational opportunity, particularly . . . for minority 
student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Whitcomb, athletic faculty representative at San Jose State and 
chairman of the NCAA Minority Opportunities and Interests Committee, said 
reviewing the legislation is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA has got to look at some issues -- the research data group as well as 
the effect Proposition 16 is going to have on Afro-American students of the 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey also expressed his support for a convention resolution that would set 
up a special committee to study a restructuring of the NCAA. He added that an 
outside panel might also become involved in developing a plan for such a 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners from the eight major Division I conferences, pressing for a 
greater voice in shaping their own destinies, have suggested setting up a 
separate division for schools with annual athletic budgets of $9 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing one of the hotter issues of the day, Dempsey noted that a special 
panel, chaired by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, has been formed to study the 
feasibility of a Division I-A football playoff. Dempsey said the NCAA should 
examine the concept and "either place it back on the shelf or present 
legislation for the Division I-A membership to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference after his speech, Dempsey described himself as 
being "neutral" on the playoff issue, but seemed to approach the subject with 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a (significant) financial impact, I don't think it makes much sense," 
he said. "It's not bad to have 18 (bowl) winners."

VALK FINDS HIS NICHE WITH DUCKS; PLAYING ON TOP LINE BEATS MINOR ROLE WITH 
CANUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbing sensation lasted about a week, but there was little Garry Valk 
could do about it. He knew there was no miracle cure available from his doctor. 
Only time and distance could ease his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 3 news troubled Valk deeply, forcing him to ponder his future in 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone told him the Vancouver Canucks, his team for three seasons, had left 
him unprotected in the NHL waiver draft and now he was a Mighty Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it seemed as if he might have to fight another battle simply to 
prove he belonged in the league. And hadn't there been enough of those already? 
</P>
<P>
 Just past the midway point of what's turning out to be his finest NHL season, 
Valk wonders what he was so worried about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed to leave Vancouver," he said. "They're a good bunch of 
guys, a good team. But right now there's no way I'd ever want to go back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Not when he knows for certain he'll be in the Duck lineup every night. Or when 
he's contributing in ways he rarely did in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many Ducks, Valk played a minor role with his old team. His job in 
Vancouver was to check somebody, play sound defense and keep the other team 
from scoring while the top-line players took a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 He always hoped the day would come when he would play on the No. 1 line, but 
it took a move to Anaheim to realize that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for an eight-game period starting the season, Valk has played on the 
Ducks' top lines and been a big part of the expansion team's startling success. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson, a Canuck assistant for the three seasons Valk was there, 
knew he could be a valuable addition and talked General Manager Jack Ferreira 
into making the selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he became available, I said to Jack, 'He could really help our team,' " 
Wilson said. "Jack didn't know much about him, but fortunately he trusted my 
judgment. I knew he would be good for the kind of team and character we have." 
</P>
<P>
 But who could have known Valk would be this good? Even Wilson has been 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 Valk is not the Ducks' leading scorer, their best playmaker or fastest skater, 
but somehow good things happen when he hits the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 His play has been key to making his line the Ducks' most productive this 
season -- a threesome of Valk, Peter Douris and Anatoli Semenov. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 17-game span, that line combined for 46 points, including a 10-point 
performance in a 5-4 victory Nov. 3 over Dallas. Semenov led the line with 
eight goals and 10 assists, Valk had four goals and 11 assists and Douris added 
four goals and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries to Valk and Semenov ended the hot streak in early December, however. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Valk suffered a concussion when he was cross-checked into the boards 
from behind by Tampa Bay's Joe Reekie on Dec. 5. Then, Semenov was sidelined 
with a dislocated elbow when he collided with teammate Stu Grimson Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Valk missed five of the next seven games and Semenov is not expected to return 
until the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 After juggling his lines, Wilson recently put center Bob Corkum with wingers 
Valk and Douris and they're off and scoring again. 
</P>
<P>
 With two assists in a 5-3 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Saturday night 
in St. Louis, Valk pushed his point total to 23 (seven goals, 16 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 His career-high is 25 points (eight goals, 17 assists) set in 1991-92, but it 
might not last until the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finally starting to feel like I can be an everyday NHL player," said 
Valk, Vancouver's fifth-round pick in the 1987 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first year I really have. In Vancouver, I just never really felt 
comfortable enough to be an everyday NHL player." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson believes he knows the reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was caught in a numbers situation in Vancouver," Wilson said. "The 
last year and a half, he didn't get much quality ice time and possibly his 
confidence went down." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991-92, Valk played well enough to win the Canucks' unsung hero award. 
</P>
<P>
 But they had acquired Geoff Courtnall, Robert Dirk, Cliff Ronning and Sergio 
Momesso in a March, 1991 trade with St. Louis and it was only a matter of time 
before Valk was squeezed out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 He went from playing in 65 games in '91-92 to 48 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played a lot like this in his first year in Vancouver, when the team was a 
little under .500," Wilson said. "He scored quite a few goals at the beginning. 
But then Vancouver made the big trade and got Courtnall and Momesso, some real 
quality left wings, and it limited his ice time. He dropped from the second to 
the fourth line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garry is the kind of player who, on a real good team, could be an excellent 
third liner because he can check and kill penalties and punch in the odd goal. 
Here, his role is obviously expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson brought Valk along slowly. After all, Valk had spent his training camp 
with Vancouver and was the new Duck on the block when he arrived in time for 
opening night on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Wilson was about the only one in the organization Valk had met 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got along pretty good there," Valk said. "He helped me a lot by letting me 
know what I needed to do to stay in the league. I respected him in Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Valk played on the Ducks' checking line for eight games before Wilson took him 
aside one day and said he needed more offensive punch from him. Valk was 
pleased to hear Wilson's demand and soon found himself playing on a line with 
Semenov, a teammate last season in Vancouver, and Douris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Semenov, Douris and I seemed to click for a while," Valk said. "If it's 
worked, (Wilson) has stuck with it. If you're playing well, he rewards good 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the reason I'm here. He's got expectations. I've got expectations. I 
just hope I can fulfill them." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there have been no complaints and Valk couldn't be happier.

WHITACRE GIVES PROGRAM RIGHT SPIN; BASKETBALL: VILLA PARK COACH, WHO SUFFERS 
FROM VERTIGO, HAS TURNED AROUND GIRLS' TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Villa Park girls' basketball Coach Len Whitacre had the strangest dream as he 
lay on the ground, unconscious after taking a tumble on his bicycle, while his 
two sons scrambled to find a phone so they could call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 He dreamed he was playing left field for the Chicago Cubs, a team he hated, 
and there was a runner on second base, and he had just crashed into the ivy 
wall at Wrigley Field while making the catch. And he had to rise so he could 
throw the ball into the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember saying to myself, 'You've got to get up because you're going to 
look like an idiot when that sucker tags and scores all the way from second,' " 
he said, recalling that Sept. 8, 1991 afternoon. "And then I'm thinking, 'There 
were two outs, man; wait for the stretcher.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear to you, I'm on the ground, and when (paramedics) wake me up, I think 
I'm playing left field for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is spinning -- there's only two guys, but it's like there's 200 
guys running laps around me, and I go 'Where am I?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't tell paramedics who was president, what day it was, what year it 
was. And that spinning experience he was feeling was in the embryonic stages of 
a relationship that has become far more than Whitacre might have ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedics explained Whitacre's situation to him, that he had been in a 
bicycle accident near his San Juan Capistrano home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous," Whitacre said. "I don't ride a bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your two sons were with you and they said you were riding a bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any sons," he answered, "and if I had any sons, I wouldn't be 
spending my time riding bikes with them." 
</P>
<P>
 He was completely delusional and eventually landed in a head trauma unit at 
Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim. Released after four days, he spent 1 1/2 months 
in bed. His teeth and the right side of his face -- where he landed -- are 
still numb. He developed little idiosyncrasies, such as inverting words in 
sentences. He occasionally loses things -- not objects, but thought, time and 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre suffers from benign positional vertigo. He has had episodes during 
which he was dizzy a thousand times a day. He hasn't had any spells since 
November, but he knows they'll be back. He is, as he says, "one of the dizzy 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite a tale for an uncommon coach. The vertigo has invaded every avenue 
of his life -- including timeouts during games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just lose it," Whitacre said. "I don't know if anyone knows it -- or 
maybe they all know it -- but I'll just look at my assistant and say, 'Do you 
have anything to add?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre is a walk-on coach at Villa Park. He has run his own business, 
Computer Group Industries in Laguna Hills, for 18 years and says his condition 
is analogous to resetting a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to some people in Oregon," Whitacre said, telling a story that will 
end in one of his trademark laughs. "They said there are some people who never 
get over the original vertigo and they go through their life being dizzy 
forever and that I should count my blessings because for me, it's only seasonal 
-- it comes and it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 The vertigo has not affected the outcome of a game since Whitacre's system has 
taken hold. In the two years he has headed the program, the Spartans are 27-9, 
and have won 22 of their last 25 games. Twenty-one of those 22 victories have 
been by 10 points or more, and in none of the three losses has he been 
stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans are 13-2 this season and defending their Century League title. 
Before Whitacre's arrival, the program had not had a winning season in nine 
years; the championship was their second in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The "dizzy man" has turned the program upside down -- or more appropriately, 
right side up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Gardiner has been on campus since 1970. She is in her 11th year as girls' 
athletic director at Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with his resume: He seemed very articulate, seemed to know 
basketball and had some coaching experience, and it's sometimes difficult to 
find coaching experience in a walk-on," Gardiner said. "I knew I was taking a 
little bit of a chance, but after interviewing him and talking to him, I had a 
feeling about him, that he knew how to go about things and put together a good 
program from the head coach on down. It was the little things, like how 
important it was to him to stay involved with the lower level programs; a lot 
of varsity coaches don't have anything to do with the freshman or junior 
varsity teams. He doesn't even want them practicing at the same time so he can 
attend all their practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner looked like a genius after she made the hire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any idea the turnaround would be so quick," Gardiner said. "I 
knew there was some talent, but I was really quite amazed at how fast he made 
it work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that really concerned me was that he has a very aggressive 
personality and comes on a little strong, and we've had to work together with 
working with people. He genuinely likes people, but sometimes he gets so 
intense he wants things to happen immediately, which shows in his wins and 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly ranks as one of the top coaches I've ever seen, though. What I'm 
afraid of is that someone is going to steal him away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the program's turnaround, critics say Villa Park is not a top-10 team 
because the lofty record is the offspring of a weak schedule. Whitacre said 
next season he will try to get in some of the tougher local tournaments, like 
Woodbridge, Costa Mesa or Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 As intense as he is upbeat, this is only his fifth year coaching, and it's his 
first varsity job. He could easily be making more money concentrating on his 
computer business, but he's in the gym because he wants to be. Villa Park was 
the only school that would hire him based on his lukewarm credentials: Three 
years as a junior varsity coach at Capistrano Valley. He played one year of 
high school varsity basketball. He admits he's learning on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the first day I walked on, I think I tried to treat (the players) like 
they were better basketball players than they thought they were," he said. 
"What I've tried to explain to them is that if you play aggressive defense, 
then you don't have to have the kind of skill level that it takes to play soft 
defense and win basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, there was no feeder program, and there is very little 
feeder program now. Athletes that play basketball here are often playing 
competitively for the first time, so I just tried to select a team that has as 
much athleticism as we can get, and then convince them that athleticism was 
enough to play basketball -- that if you weren't a great ballhandler or 
shooter, you had to play your rear-end off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make a mistake on the court, I will not hold it against you. but if 
you quit working hard, you will not play. They have come to believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 He made his point last year by benching the Spartans' best player, Tara Earl, 
in the last five minutes of a game in which they trailed but eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward, I told her every time she stopped and pouted, she would sit the 
rest of the game, and I didn't care who we lost to or by how much," Whitacre 
said. "She had to work hard all the time to stay on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing we decided is nobody's ever going to embarrass us; if we play 
as hard as we can, then we have pride in our effort. Nobody can embarrass you 
if you're working hard. You can only be embarrassed if you quit. And they 
believe that. And after last season, we worked real hard to learn to shoot and 
dribble." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 45 years old," he said. "I've been here for two years. My plan was to be 
somewhere for 20 years. I'm in midlife, I'm stable, and I lose a lot of income 
coaching. I have six children. I coach 10 months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to being in the delivery room with my wife, it's the greatest experience 
with the human spirit that I've ever had."

 A doctor who admitted providing steroids for sprinter Ben Johnson and other 
athletes was arrested at an airport on drug warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Astaphan was arrested Saturday by Drug Enforcement Administration agents 
after his Toronto-bound plane from Antigua was diverted to John F. Kennedy 
Airport because of bad weather, DEA spokesman John Dowd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astaphan was wanted on two federal warrants, one from Buffalo for importation 
and distribution of steroids, the other from Tampa, Fla., for conspiracy to 
distribute anabolic steroids and cocaine, according to Jason Brown, a lawyer 
with the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Astaphan, 47, will be held in New York for several weeks until he can be 
transferred to Buffalo, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested after the FBI attache in Barbados notified the DEA that he was 
aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson set a world record while winning the gold medal in the 100-meter dash 
at the 1988 Olympics, but was stripped of the record after testing positive for 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 in Toronto, Astaphan admitted giving steroids to runners.

SANDERS HAS HAD ENOUGH COMPETITION

 Olympic gold medalist Summer Sanders says she is through with competitive 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm retired," she told The Daily Democrat of Woodland, Calif."I wasn't loving 
it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, 21, won two gold medals, a silver and a bronze in the 1992 Olympic 
Games in Barcelona. She was a six-time NCAA champion while at Stanford and 
twice named NCAA Swimmer of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hastings, Sanders' Olympic coach, said it was time for her to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd given the best she could and she couldn't give anymore," Hastings said, 
"She understands all the processes. The reason she retired was that she lost 
that extra 5% to be competitive (at the international level)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders told the Daily Democrat she did not want to elaborate about her 
retirement or "make it a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just print that I'm retired," she told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In Barcelona, Sanders won gold medals in the 200-meter butterfly and as an 
alternate in the 400 medley relay. She won a silver in the 200 individual 
medley and a bronze in the 400 individual medley.

ADS AND JOURNALISTS: CROSSOVER A CLOUDY ISSUE; TELEVISION: IS THERE A PROBLEM 
WHEN EX-ANCHORS SUCH AS MARY ALICE WILLIAMS AND KATHLEEN SULLIVAN MAKE 
COMMERCIALS? THE ISSUE TROUBLES SOME JOURNALISM PROFESSIONALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dressed in a pullover sweater, an overweight Kathleen Sullivan surveys a 
thinner version of herself on TV as co-anchor of "CBS This Morning." "One 
moment I'm a network anchor -- now look at me," says Sullivan, patting her 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a newscast -- it's a TV commercial. Sullivan, the first female anchor 
of the Olympics and a former news anchor at both ABC and CBS, has been hired as 
the national spokesperson for SuperStart, a new weight-loss program from Weight 
Watchers International. Over the next year, Sullivan will be seen in TV 
commercials, radio spots and public appearances as part of a $35-million 
campaign to introduce the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in another media campaign launching this month, Mary Alice 
Williams, a former CNN vice president and news anchor at both CNN and NBC, is 
doing TV commercials, radio spots and public speaking as the national 
spokeswoman for NYNEX, the Northeast regional telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has signed a three-year contract with NYNEX for an undisclosed 
sum, is cast as the knowledgeable "explainer" of telecommunications today. 
"NYNEX will be the name for a lot of the new things that will make your life 
more manageable," Williams says in a TV ad currently airing. "My job is to stay 
on top of what they're doing and keep you posted." 
</P>
<P>
 The commercials by Sullivan and Williams raise anew questions about the 
separation between advertising and editorial content in television today. The 
line is growing increasingly blurry: There are TV commercials featuring actors 
as anchors who "report" the merits of cold remedies, while real-life TV anchors 
attend the baby shower of fictional TV anchor "Murphy Brown," and Candice 
Bergen, who plays Murphy, brings her hard-nosed TV persona to her job as TV 
spokeswoman for the Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and Williams note that they are not working as network journalists 
today. But the advertising executives who hired them say that their credibility 
from TV news was a big factor in their being hired as TV pitchwomen. It's a 
practice that disturbs some journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertisers in these commercials are trading on the credibility of the 
anchors and the network news divisions," said Dick Wald, senior vice president 
at ABC News. "There is a close relationship between journalists and the news 
division, and each one shares in the credibility of the other. Our position is 
that what we say as journalists is not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News, along with CBS News, NBC News and Cable News Network, prohibits its 
journalists from making TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must admit it was a jolt to me to see a former CNN executive in a 
commercial," said Joan Konner, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School 
of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think journalists should be allowed to make career choices to go into 
acting, catering or whatever they want to do without criticism from their 
colleagues," Konner said. "But, at the same time, it is troubling to me to see 
advertisers and journalists trading on the credibility, authenticity and 
integrity that journalists have built up by being newscasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 44, who spent 25 years in TV news, makes a distinction between doing 
commercials as a journalist and making TV spots after leaving the business.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not presenting myself as a dispassionate observer, and I am not trying 
to do both journalism and (my NYNEX work) at the same time," she said. "When I 
left NBC News last fall to form my own marketing and TV production company, I 
felt that I had to make the decision that I was leaving network news, even 
though Barbara Walters and others told me that might not be the case in today's 
environment. I am not selling Post-Toasties in these commercials -- I'm talking 
about a company that I believe in, and I'm involved in an exciting new field, 
the information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams maintained that, at least in terms of public speaking, there are some 
similarities between her NYNEX job and her work as an executive at CNN in the 
early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning at CNN, I spoke to cable operators and city officials about 
CNN," Williams said. "I don't think my public speaking for NYNEX is all that 
different."  
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, 40, who lost her job on "CBS This Morning" in 1989 when she was 
replaced by Paula Zahn, said that she had not considered whether her Weight 
Watchers job would prevent any possible return to network news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the Weight Watchers program," she said. "The diet is working for 
me, and I believe that I am helpful other women" with the commercial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who also does health reports on a syndicated TV series called "Life 
Choices," said she had gained weight when she went through a very difficult 
period in her life: She lost her CBS job, her father died and her marriage 
broke up.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted Kathleen because she is articulate and knowledgeable, and her work 
as a newscaster gives her both celebrity and credibility," said Jeff Myers, 
vice president for integrated marketing and communications at Weight Watchers 
International. "The fact that even a prominent woman can struggle with weight 
also makes her someone that many women can identify with." 
</P>
<P>
 After she left CBS, Sullivan said, she was offered large salaries to be an 
anchor on "Inside Edition" and "A Current Affair." "I didn't want to do those 
shows because they're tabloids," she said. "I think the standards of accuracy 
in the Weight Watchers commercials are better than some of what goes on in TV 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the networks' strong prohibitions against commercials by 
newscasters, there are some loopholes in the system. "Today" weatherman Willard 
Scott is allowed to make commercials (and he makes many of them) because he is 
not considered a journalist, according to an NBC News spokeswoman. Joan Lunden, 
co-anchor of ABC's "Good Morning America," was allowed to make a lotion 
commercial because the morning show is a production of the network's 
entertainment division, not ABC News. (ABC's Wald said that he would not allow 
Lunden to make any commercials if it were his call to make.) And Charles 
Osgood, who makes an estimated $1 million a year as the primary voice and 
anchor on CBS radio, does some ads in his daily radio newscasts. Although he 
still appears occasionally on "CBS This Morning," Osgood is allowed to make 
commercials because he is now an employee of the CBS radio network and and not 
CBS News, the network says. 
</P>
<P>
 With TV journalists having become superstars and advertisers realizing the 
value of their credibility, the opportunities for high-profile ad campaigns 
will grow, and with them the ethical questions for journalists. Mike Wallace 
did commercials as a young broadcaster (he had to convince CBS News that he 
wanted a serious career in journalism), but the door swung only one way. Would 
a network today hire a former news anchor who had done commercials and wanted 
to come back to network news? 
</P>
<P>
 "We recently had Linda Ellerbee as the special anchor for an ABC News 
documentary on breast cancer, a subject on which she is an expert," Wald 
responded. (Ellerbee did a much-criticized commercial for Maxwell House coffee 
several years ago after leaving NBC News; she is now an independent producer). 
"We'd have to look at that as one factor in hiring somebody. I don't think it 
absolutely would rule someone out, but it certainly would make them harder to 
place."

NO MORTON'S TONIGHT? (RELAX, IT'S TEMPORARY); INDUSTRY: FOR YEARS, 
ENTERTAINMENT'S MOVERS AND SHAKERS HAVE GATHERED AT THE EXCLUSIVE ENCLAVE, WITH 
MONDAYS DRAWING THE ELITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE GALBRAITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Monday night. Marvin Davis is sitting at his usual, big round table just 
inside the entrance, where he and his wife, Barbara, are entertaining Sidney 
Poitier. Good pals Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and media mogul 
David Geffen are at the prime table against the window chatting it up. Michael 
J. Fox and CAA agent Brian Lord are in the northeast corner talking movies. And 
independent producer Steve Tisch is table hopping, as he always does, working 
the room between bites. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Where will they be tonight when Morton's is dark? Or next week? 
Morton's won't reopen for another two Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 The pink, dimly lit West Hollywood eatery on the southwest corner of Melrose 
Avenue and Robertson Boulevard, is closing -- and reopening right across the 
street on Jan. 18. Since debuting 14 years ago, Morton's has become the 
exclusive dinner-only enclave of the entertainment industry's movers and 
shakers -- especially on Monday nights, when Hollywood's most powerful elite 
appropriated the best tables. Now, with a bigger building and more parking 
slots, it's expanding for lunch . 
</P>
<P>
 In a fickle business and tenuous economy, the $2-million move might worry some 
proprietors, particularly since people are generally averse to any kind of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morton? Never. The restaurant's owner, 46, who thrives on competition 
and risk, is not only taking over on the site of the once-hot lunch spot, 
Trumps, he's taking on the Ivy, Cicada, Citrus, the Grill and the Palm for the 
Hollywood heavyweight lunch crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Morton is preoccupied with a much bigger risk, the $85-million Hard 
Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, spawned from his successful Hard Rock Cafe 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then? "This building was in need of repair. In certain ways, I thought 
the food was in need of repair. It was just time to update the whole thing 
without altering dramatically the philosophy of the restaurant: clean, healthy 
food in a simple environment," Morton said in his characteristically laconic 
manner, eating a plateful of vegetables and sipping "room temperature" Evian 
water on the last Monday night at the original site. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a new chef with new dishes, an expanded bar that serves pizza, 
and new prime tables to jockey for. 
</P>
<P>
 Much, he promises, will be familiar, like the subdued lighting and the 
strategically placed towering potted palms. Whether the special ambience 
survives is the bigger question. The critical issue is to keep Morton's as a 
sanctuary -- a sophisticated, protected, rendezvous place where everyone knows 
your name and may gossip about you later -- where looky-loos aren't a welcome 
part of the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 As Tisch said, high prices and no bar scene (Morton wants diners, not 
drinkers) has effectively discouraged "tourists from Wisconsin from coming in 
after the Rose Bowl."  
</P>
<P>
 "Studio commissary for dinner" . . . "Chasen's for our generation" . . . "A 
clubhouse for the big boys" . . . are three descriptions offered by some 
regulars, the latter who may have had a temporary lapse in judgment by not 
remembering certain notable patron esses more powerful than he, like Paramount 
Pictures chairman Sherry Lansing. On any given night, she might be in the 
company of 20th Century Fox's chairman Peter Chernin, producer Leonard 
Goldberg, CAA chief Michael Ovitz and author Jackie Collins. Bill Clinton's had 
a meal (as governor of Arkansas) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) has just 
recently phoned ahead for a reservation two weeks hence. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's may have been immortalized with the catch tag line "See you Monday 
night at Morton's" in Celia Brady's industry column in Spy, but those who've 
always dined there needn't be reminded in print. They know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The faithful core came from the get-go, knowing Morton from London, where he 
opened the first Hard Rock, which attracted such future investors in his 
restaurants as Tisch, Steven Spielberg and Barry Diller. While the Hard Rock 
formula attracts youthful masses to stand in line for hamburgers and loud rock 
music, Morton's is just the reverse. It has two reservation lines -- one 
private for the inner-inner circle, the other for the public. The regulars are 
billed via the mail. And, of course, there is the table hierarchy, which Morton 
dismisses, claiming the food is the same no matter at which of the 25 spots one 
sits. 
</P>
<P>
 For Howard Rosenman, president of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment's film 
division and another close friend of the owner, Morton's is a kitchen away from 
home. "Peter carried my dinner debts during the dry years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Morton's, as with the old, has the buffer zone of a parking lot 
between the front door and the sidewalk, to keep at bay the paparazzi who 
regularly stake out stars at Spago, Le Dome, Chasen's and Nicky Blairs. Also, 
there's a no-camera policy inside -- always. 
</P>
<P>
 But just imagine the photos that could have been taken over the years. Sean 
Connery returning from the parking lot to break up a fight. A middle-aged 
actress, whose wig was horribly askew -- and nobody clued her. The 
bride-for-hire who stripped naked at a bachelor party. Kim Basinger and Alec 
Baldwin's first date. (She was 45 minutes late.)  
</P>
<P>
 Juicy Stories, by the way, Morton himself would never tell: "I respect 
people's privacy and I always have since we've been open." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morton is comparatively effusive about the new digs. The chef, sought 
after for six months from Jeremiah Tower's famous Stars in San Francisco, is 
Brian Keller, hired to redefine the "California" cuisine that Morton said his 
restaurant offered before the moniker was coined. The main menu will feature 
foods Morton himself likes to eat: pasta, salads, vegetarian specialties. "The 
Bacon," as in the large Francis Bacon painting, will again hang in the main 
dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 Will his friends all return? Probably. Maybe even the once-banned Julia 
Phillips, whose damning Hollywood tome "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town 
Again" depicted certain Morton's regulars in very unflattering light. Likely, 
you won't see Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger -- 
investors in the movie-themed Planet Hollywood chain that Morton is suing for, 
among other things, devaluing the Hard Rock by imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Martin, the bartender who's been with Morton's since the day it opened, 
will also be there, serving them up, from memory: Geffen's mineral water, 
Katzenberg's ice tea, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman's Smirnoff on the rocks 
with a slice of orange, Jack Nicholson's Bloody Marys -- "not necessarily 
strong, but spicy."  
</P>
<P>
 Martin -- like several other of Morton's 50 employees -- has received his 
share of hefty tips ($100 and multiples) over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good gig . . . a really good gig."

QUALITY AND HOPES ARE UP AT PALM SPRINGS FILM FESTIVAL; MOVIES: EIGHTY ENTRIES 
FROM 22 COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED TO DRAW MORE THAN 45,000 MOVIEGOERS. A BANQUET 
HONORS SOPHIA LOREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sonny Bono was clearly befuddled. The ex-mayor of Palm Springs, founder of the 
5-year-old Palm Springs International Film Festival, squinted at his notes and 
gripped the microphone like a man adrift. "Is this thing on?" he croaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gathered at the Plaza Theater for the festival's opening-night screening 
last Thursday of the French hit "Les Visiteurs" fidgeted and giggled when Bono 
held up a letter from President Clinton but then declined to read it due to 
political differences. He then went on to encourage the current mayor, Lloyd 
Maryanov, to "carry on the baton" symbolizing civic progress. Since so many of 
the Springs' fabled denizens and their taxes have long since moved to Rancho 
Mirage, this optimism is evidently based both on the film festival and the 
legalized gambling ordinance recently passed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bono relinquished the podium, the crowd was jarred back into cinematic 
reality with "Les Visiteurs," a French production by director Jean-Marie Poire 
that tells the story of a 12th-Century knight who runs afoul of a witch and 
finds himself and his squire transported to present times. Here they meet their 
descendants, stink up everyone's cars with their medieval hygiene and mock the 
modern bourgeoisie. It's a sort of "Monty Python's Holy Grail Meets Feydeau."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, at a reception in the courtyard where the local Hollywood Old Guard 
showed true esprit by standing patiently in an unmoving buffet line, one man 
remarked to another, "I hear this film did huge box office in France." "Yeah?" 
replied his friend. "So did 'The Nutty Professor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even if opening night did not quite reach the stellar heights of previous 
years, the city's leaders could take pride in this year's festival, which has 
attracted more than 80 entries from 22 countries. Running until through Sunday, 
the festival is expected to draw more than 45,000 moviegoers.  
</P>
<P>
 A more select group gathered Saturday night at a $250-a-plate banquet honoring 
Sophia Loren for her screen achievements. Those attending included Bob and 
Delores Hope, Ginger Rogers, Tippi Hedren, Arthur Hiller and ex-Columbia head 
Leo Jaffe. Loren, accompanied by her son Eduardo Ponti, said she was genuinely 
touched by the recognition and felt that since leaving her humble origins in 
Italy, her "life has been one long dream." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to screenings of Loren's more memorable works, including "The 
Countess From Hong Kong" and "Two Women," the festival has taken on a decidedly 
Italian accent this year in staging the first full retrospective of Federico 
Fellini's work since his death last year. Among the films being shown are "8 
1/2," "Amacord," "La Dolce Vita" and "Nights of Caribira." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the hottest venues the first few days of the festival were for Italian 
entries such as Ricky Tognazzi's taut political thriller, "La Scorta," about 
four carbinieri trying to protect a magistrate in violence-prone Sicily; 
brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's beautifully photographed "Fiorille," 
about several generations of a cursed Tuscan clan; and Francesca Archibugi's 
"Il Grande Cocomero," about the relationship between a psychiatrist, his 
emotionally troubled patient and her overprotective mother. All three films 
have had overflow crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most film festivals, like Cannes, exist as a marketplace for 
independents seeking distributors, Palm Springs is a festival in the 
celebratory sense of the word. In fact, 75% of the films here already have 
distribution deals. There is also a growing feeling among both industry 
professionals and festival devotees that the quality of foreign independents 
shown here has risen dramatically. One reason mentioned repeatedly is that 
international co-productions have dramatically raised the technical and 
artistic quality of independents. For years, filmmakers have complained that 
while state subsidies gave them the freedom to pursue non-commercial subjects, 
such reliance also resulted in small budgets and amateur participation on many 
levels of the production.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the international co-production more successfully illustrated than 
in the growing clout of Canadian independents. This year Canada has 10 films in 
the festival, including "The Boys of St. Vincent," a three-hour made-for-TV 
dramatization of a scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of boys by Catholic 
clergy at an orphanage; "La Florida," about a Quebecois family's attempt to run 
a motel in Florida; and "Le Sexe des Etoiles," an Oscar submission about a 
young girl's struggles with her father's new identity as a transsexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The most eagerly awaited film of the opening weekend, although reactions to it 
were mixed, was Roman Polanski's "Bitter Moon," a tale of psychological and 
sexual obsession starring Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner. Coyote's 
character, during a Mediterranean cruise, narrates to a young Englishman the 
history of his obsessive, soul-destroying relationship with his wife. While 
some in the audience were clearly uncomfortable with the graphic nature of the 
work, writer Larry Gelbart ("Tootsie") said that a viewer has to accept the 
film as "a very personal view of Polanski on the nature of human 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Ferrara's remake of "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," while having 
made the festival circuit rounds for a year, also screened this weekend. But 
both late-night performances were attended by only a smattering of insomniacs.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the films coming this week are the late Cyril Collard's autobiographical 
"Savage Nights"; Percy Aldon's "Younger and Younger"; an award-winning Spanish 
film, "Belle Epoque"; and John Schlesinger's "The Innocent."

 Performance magazine has named the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts the 
third-highest-grossing theater under 3,000 seats. According to the trade 
publication, the Cerritos Center, which opened Jan. 13, 1993, is the 
highest-grossing theater in the California category, finishing ahead of Los 
Angeles' Pantages Theater, which ranked fifth.Among last year's presentations 
at the Cerritos Center were a Frank Sinatra performance and a concert by dance 
stars Twyla Tharp and Mikhail Baryshnikov.
