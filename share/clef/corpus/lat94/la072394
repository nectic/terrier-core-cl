CITADEL ORDERED TO ADMIT ITS 1ST FEMALE CADET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking down a 152-year-old all-male tradition, a federal judge Friday 
ordered The Citadel, South Carolina's state-supported military institute, to 
immediately grant full admittance to its first female cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck said in a ruling in Charleston, S.C., that 
the student, 19-year-old Shannon Faulkner, must be admitted in the 1994 fall 
term, which begins in August. The school has a year to set in place a plan to 
accommodate other women who may want to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled," said Valorie Vojdik, an attorney on Faulkner's legal team. 
"We think this is a major victory for women's rights in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they will appeal and will seek a stay of the judge's 
order requiring Faulkner's immediate admittance. 
</P>
<P>
 "An institute as venerable as ours should not be required to transform itself 
by being forced to become co-educational until after the United States Supreme 
Court has ruled on an issue this significant," said The Citadel president, Lt. 
Gen. Claudius E. Watts III, in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview he said, "We believe that we are entirely in compliance 
with the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Houck ruled that the school's refusal to admit Faulkner because of her sex 
violates her rights under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted that one day I would win," Faulkner said. "I was told I would 
never enter The Citadel's gates. Now, I've entered them and I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Houck has severely scolded school officials for dragging their 
feet on his orders to prepare contingency plans to admit women. Friday's ruling 
also had a critical tone. The judge compared the school's opposition to 
admitting women to the way schools once resisted racial integration and said 
officials at The Citadel had "continued to defend this case at a cost of 
millions of dollars to taxpayers of South Carolina when they do not have a 
single case to offer in support of their position." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had contended during a 10-day hearing in May that they were 
justified in admitting only men because there was no demonstrated demand by 
women for a Citadel-type education. They also argued that single-sex schools 
were part of a state policy of offering a variety of choices in higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck found, however, that the school "failed to articulate an important 
policy that substantially supports offering the unique benefits of a 
Citadel-type education to men and not to women." The Citadel is the only 
military school in the state and the only single-sex public school. 
</P>
<P>
 He said lack of demand does not justify denying admittance to women. Testimony 
during the trial indicated that the school had no way of determining the extent 
of women's interest because it threw out their applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Citadel has made no secret of the fact that its primary goal in this case 
is to keep Faulkner out of the Corps of Cadets," Houck wrote. "Not once has 
(the school) done anything to indicate that it is sincerely concerned to any 
extent whatsoever about Faulkner's constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union, which had supported Faulkner, praised the 
ruling. Sara L. Mandelbaum, acting director of the ACLU's Women's Rights 
Project, called on the school "to assure (Faulkner's) safety and a smooth 
transition when she enters the Cadet Corps in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 If the school is successful at getting a stay, Faulkner would not be admitted 
to the corps until after appeals are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, a 1993 high school honors graduate, applied to The Citadel last year 
and was accepted. The school revoked its acceptance of her application, 
however, when it learned she was female. In January, the school was ordered to 
admit her to day classes alongside male cadets while the case was being 
decided. With Friday's ruling, she must be allowed to participate fully in the 
school's rigorous military training. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of how she will be accommodated on campus will be decided at a hearing 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plan the school submitted to the court in June, it said that if it was 
forced to admit Faulkner, the school would favor holding off on her 
participation in military training until next year. Then she would be required 
to receive a crew cut, a uniform and a private room in the college infirmary. 
Later, according to the plan, she would be allowed a regulation military 
haircut for women -- hair above the collar that doesn't interfere with 
headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, The Citadel president, acknowledged that other military institutes such 
as West Point admit women, but he said the presence of women at The Citadel 
would drastically alter the environment of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was disappointed by Houck's comparison of the case to racial 
discrimination cases. "Black and white men you treat the same," he said. "You 
don't treat men and women the same. There's a physiological difference."

 DAY FOR AFRICA: Carl Burrowes of Fullerton likes to pull this quiz on people: 
Name another country that has a red, white and blue flag and celebrates its 
independence day in July. It's his native Liberia, Africa's oldest republic at 
147 years old. . . . More than 200 Liberians who live here now will celebrate 
the event today at William R. Mason Regional Park in Irvine. Burrowes says 
entertainment will include soccer for the adults and Liberian folk tales for 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 CAR CITY: The Saturn Corp. promotes the notion that Saturn car owners are one 
big happy family. More than 8,000 Saturn owners have purchased $16 discount 
tickets to spend today at Knott's Berry Farm. Included is a picnic lunch, a 
T-shirt and a preview of the 1995 Saturn. . . . One sticky question: If you're 
one of 8,200, how do you find your car in the parking lot? "By paying very 
careful attention where you park," says Knott's spokesman Bob Ochsner. 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY OPERA: One tiny fear about tonight's gala preview of "Phantom of the 
Opera" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa: That regular 
patrons used to its usual 8 p.m. starting time will miss the first act. 
"Phantom" -- tonight only -- starts at 7. (Sunday's opening is at 7:30, and all 
performances after that start at 8). . . . South Coast Plaza Village's six 
restaurants will join in on the hoopla: They'll provide free shuttle service on 
weekends for ticket holders, to save on parking hassles at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 NO REAL PIONEERS: Maybe the California Angels aren't having the kind of season 
they want. But they're doing better than the other baseball team that shares 
Anaheim Stadium with them -- the Pioneers. That's the name of the fictional, 
losing American League West baseball team on the sitcom "Hardball," which is 
unveiled on Fox TV this fall. Why did they choose Anaheim Stadium? Producers 
say it was cheaper to rent than Dodger Stadium and less instantly identifiable. 
The losing team, they are quick to add, was not modeled after the Angels.

COCHRAN TAKES ON ANOTHER HIGH-PROFILE COURTROOM ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. had agonized over an invitation to join the legal 
defense team for O.J. Simpson. The prominent Los Angeles attorney feared that 
their friendship might make it difficult for Cochran to represent the former 
football star in the double murder case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about that a lot because I've never defended a friend before," 
Cochran said Friday, several hours after he first appeared in court for 
Simpson. "But I think I can represent him objectively. And besides, who else 
best to be on your side but a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend, plus a lot more, say legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cochran, Simpson is getting a politically connected trial lawyer who has an 
impressive record of proving police misconduct and defending minorities. 
Simpson also is getting the services of a well-liked figure who is able to 
handle the accompanying crush of television cameras that comes with such 
celebrity clients as singer Michael Jackson and Reginald O. Denny, the truck 
driver severely beaten at the start of the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, he is a friend of Mr. Simpson and it can be difficult to 
represent a friend in a capital case," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA criminal law 
professor. "Onthe other hand, this is an extremely attractive and exciting case 
for a criminal lawyer despite its potential pitfalls. For someone who loves a 
challenge, what greater challenge can there be than defending someone in a 
trial that the entire country will watch." 
</P>
<P>
 During the brief arraignment Friday at which Simpson pleaded "absolutely, 100% 
not guilty" in the murders of his ex-wife and her friend last month, Cochran 
said he experienced a media assault that surpassed incidents surrounding the 
child molestation investigation of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most well-covered arraignment in the history of man," he dryly 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Cochran declined to say how long ago and under what 
circumstances he had been invited onto the Simpson team, which is headed by 
Robert L. Shapiro and advised by such national heavyweights as Alan M. 
Dershowitz and F. Lee Bailey. Cochran described himself as a social and 
business friend of Simpson for years, "not intimate friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Just three days before Cochran formally joined the Simpson defense, he and 
other African American community leaders met with Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to 
discuss their concerns over whether Simpson could receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue of racial fairness, some attorneys say, probably was important in 
Cochran's decision to join the previously all-white legal team. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to talk about the race issue, but O.J. is a black man and 
Los Angeles is very racially sensitive. For him to have an all-white legal 
defense team may alienate some potential black jurors," suggested attorney Edi 
M. O. Faal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Faal stressed that Cochran's race is of secondary importance. "The primary 
issue is he's a great legal asset. With one stone they're killing two birds," 
he said. "They have a fine legal mind who will appeal to all members of the 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Faal last year defended Damian Monroe Williams, who was convicted of throwing 
a brick that struck Denny in the head. Cochran is representing Denny and three 
other riot victims in a federal civil suit that alleges the city did not 
provide them sufficient protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism of a black attorney seeking justice for a white truck driver 
beaten by black men was irresistible to Cochran, his friends say. It also 
appealed to actor Denzel Washington, who consulted with Cochran in researching 
his role as the black attorney for the AIDS-stricken white plaintiff in the 
film "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, 56 and a resident of the mainly white Los Feliz district, said he 
joined the Simpson team "not as an African American but as a lawyer." Still, he 
acknowledged that his courtroom presence may reassure jurors and spectators 
sensitive to the race issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The main questions raised about Cochran's involvement revolve around how much 
time he can devote to the Simpson case and whether the expanded team will be 
too unwieldy. In the past, Cochran's critics objected to what they contended 
was a conflict of interest in his serving as a Los Angeles Airport Commission 
member from 1981 to 1993 -- -- while at the same time suing the city on behalf 
of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran and his wife, Dale, a marketing analyst, were hosts of a fund-raiser 
for former Mayor Tom Bradley that was attended by people who did business with 
the airport. Cochran insisted that he never knowingly solicited contributions 
from them. In 1992, the district attorney's office ended an investigation of 
Cochran and other Bradley appointees without filing any charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana-born, Cochran graduated from Los Angeles High School and UCLA and 
earned his law degree from Loyola University. He served as a deputy Los Angeles 
city attorney from 1963 to 1965 and later made a name representing minority 
victims of alleged police brutality at a time when the city was still reeling 
from the Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1978 to 1981, he was an assistant district attorney, ranking third in 
that huge office and helping to create a special "roll-out" team to investigate 
officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 His subsequent practice has paid off well; he drives a Rolls-Royce Silver 
Shadow. His Wilshire Boulevard firm, which bears his name alone, employs 11 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released through his spokesman, Garcetti, who once worked under 
Cochran in the district attorney's office, said Cochran "is a great trial 
lawyer. He has had a great deal of success in defending criminal cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian said Cochran's 
rapport with jurors is key to his success. "He's certainly seen and lived a lot 
of life in Los Angeles," Philibosian said. "So in addition to his courtroom 
skills, he has tremendous understanding of people." 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent local criminal lawyer, who asked not to be identified, said he 
thought Cochran took on the Simpson case only after being assured that he would 
have final say on tactics even if that is not publicly apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, attorney Harland W. Braun said it would have been better if Cochran 
had joined the Simpson team earlier. Any coordination problems had better be 
worked out quickly, Braun noted. "You can't have decisions by committee. If 
Johnnie comes in, they'll make it look like they're co-counsel for diplomatic 
reasons. Then Johnnie will take over. Johnnie is a good diplomat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran insists the teamwork will be smooth. "Egos will be melded for the 
greater good, and the greater good is providing the most effective 
representation for Simpson," he said. While Cochran said his own role is not 
fully defined yet, he stressed that Shapiro will remain the lead attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said the Jackson investigation and the Denny case will not interfere 
with the Simpson trial, which is expected to begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denny civil rights trial, set for October, could be delayed, Cochran said. 
Jackson, he said, will not be indicted and in the small chance that he is, the 
case would not be heard for a year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, the other attorney representing Jackson, said Friday that he 
talked with Cochran extensively about the Simpson case. The main obstacle to 
Cochran's joining that defense team was his friendship with Simpson, Weitzman 
said. "I think Johnnie agonized over it tremendously," he added. "I believe Mr. 
Simpson prevailed on him."

ITO READIES HIMSELF FOR GLARE OF MEDIA SPOTLIGHT; COURTS: JUDGE'S LAST BRUSH 
WITH FAME CAME IN CHARLES KEATING CASE. JURIST IS SEEN AS SMART AND 
UNFLAPPABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito is about to become the most 
watched jurist in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although millions will soon be observing him as he presides over the O.J. 
Simpson murder trial, this will not be Ito's first brush with a celebrated case 
-- he presided over the 1992 trial of multimillionaire swindler Charles H. 
Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 That experience taught him several maxims to live by in such cases: 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 1: "Be cautious, be careful and when in doubt, keep your mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 2: "When tempted to say something, take a deep breath and refer to Rule 
1." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 3: "The sirens of mythology pale in comparison to the allure of seeing 
yourself on CNN. The results, however, can be about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ito adhered strictly to Rule 1 in regard to the Simpson trial: "I 
can't say anything about the case. The less I say the better." 
</P>
<P>
 He did acknowledge that his life was about to change, though. An hour after 
his appointment was announced before a worldwide television audience, Ito said 
in an interview: "It feels like I've had 12 cups of coffee and I've only had 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Ito, 43, is jittery. Court watchers say they have no 
doubts that Ito, named 1992 trial judge of the year by the Los Angeles County 
Bar Assn., will be able to handle the pressure of the former football star's 
double murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lance is prepared, intelligent, thoughtful and unflappable," Los Angeles 
defense lawyer Gerald Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a judge who controls his courtroom in a fair way. I expect each side 
will get ample opportunity to express their opinions, but the trial will move 
along at a good pace," said Chaleff, past president of the county bar 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine University law professor Janet E. Kerr called Ito an excellent 
choice for the Simpson case. She served as Ito's court-appointed expert on 
complex securities law issues when he presided over the prosecution of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the highest respect for him," Kerr said. "I found him extremely 
fair-minded and brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
 His appointment was something of a surprise because Supervising Criminal Court 
Judge Cecil J. Mills had said the case would go to one of nine judges now 
presiding over so-called long cause cases. Ito is handling the criminal court's 
heavy master calendar and will have to turn over those duties to another judge, 
court observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's work on the Keating case and numerous others was praised by prosecutors 
and defense attorneys. In April, 1992, Ito sentenced Keating to a 10-year state 
prison term after a jury convicted him on 17 counts of state securities fraud 
after the failure of Keating's Lincoln Savings & Loan, which cost hundreds of 
investors their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, that was Ito's major moment in the limelight -- his most 
challenging case during seven years as a judge. "There were good lawyers, hot 
topics and a subject area I was not familiar with," Ito said in an interview 
Friday. "It was hotly contested, with a lot of media and new challenges each 
and every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Although declining to discuss his newest case, he spoke briefly about his 
life, his experiences as a prosecutor and judge, and his career goals. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native, Ito grew up in the city's Silver Lake neighborhood. His 
parents, who met in a Japanese American internment camp in Wyoming during World 
War II, were both public schoolteachers. Ito attended Ivanhoe Elementary 
School, Thomas Starr King Junior High and John Marshall High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He majored in political science at UCLA, graduating cum laude in 1972. Ito 
worked his way through school, managing student parking lots, according to 
Robert D. Rose, a San Diego lawyer who lived on the same floor as Ito in a UCLA 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said Ito was organized, thoughtful and a dedicated prankster. Stunts 
attributed to him ranged from putting firecrackers in clothes dryers to 
switching furniture between dorms. "He had a very pronounced mischievous 
streak," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pranks continued through Ito's years at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of 
Law, where he graduated in 1975, and into his years at the district attorney's 
office, which he joined in 1977 after two years of private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bascue, Ito's former boss in the district attorney's hard-core gang 
unit, recalled one of those incidents during a 1992 interview. Bascue said he 
walked into his office one morning before an important meeting to find several 
pigeons that Ito and some co-conspirators had put there the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running around trying to catch the pigeons and clean up the mess before 
the meeting," said Bascue, now also a Superior Court judge. "It was not the 
kind of stuff that was hurtful. But it was good for morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman, who shared an office with Ito during those 
years, recalls the pranks, but said no one should have any doubt that Ito was a 
hard-working, serious prosecutor. He said Ito showed particularly good 
organizational skills while the two of them successfully prosecuted nine 
defendants accused of conspiring to murder a witness in the early 1980s: "That 
was a monster case for anyone, a major production in terms of the amount of 
physical evidence, transcripts, informants." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Robleto, commanding officer of the LAPD's South Bureau homicide unit, 
who worked on the case, said Ito and Berman were called "the dynamic duo" by 
officers in the gang unit. He said officers often had to roust the attorneys 
from bed in the middle of the night to help obtain search warrants. "They kept 
us out of trouble and helped guide us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito was very detail-oriented, Robleto said. "All those attorneys, prosecution 
or defense, better do their homework before they try to b.s. him." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of those early morning rousts -- at 4 a.m., to be precise -- Ito 
met his wife, Margaret York, then an LAPD detective, at the scene of a murder. 
York, who heads the Police Department's bunco-forgery unit and is the 
highest-ranking woman on the force, was one of the models for the television 
series "Cagney & Lacey," according to a friend of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Ito was assigned to the complaints unit, the organized crime and 
intelligence division, and then the special trials unit. In 1986, in his last 
major case before becoming a judge, he successfully prosecuted Brandon Tholmer, 
the prime suspect in the murders of more than a score of elderly Los Angeles 
women. After a lengthy trial, Tholmer was found guilty of four of the five 
murders with which he was charged, and sentenced to life without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Republican Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian persuaded Gov. George 
Deukmejian to pick Ito for a Municipal Court judgeship despite the fact that 
Ito is a Democrat: "I knew Deukmejian was looking for people who shared his 
common-sense, law-and-order profile. I thought Lance was particularly well 
suited in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Deukmejian elevated Ito to the Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Keating case was his longest trial, Ito, as the master calendar 
judge in the criminal courts for more than a year, has had a piece of other 
noteworthy cases. They include the pandering case of accused madam to the stars 
Heidi Fleiss, the riot-related assault case against Damian Monroe Williams and 
the pending murder case against gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito has a background as a prosecutor, he drew high marks for fairness 
from several defense lawyers, including Thomas A. Stanley, who represented a 
man who contended he shot his neighbor in self-defense after he was severely 
beaten in a fight. The district attorney asked for first-degree murder, but 
after a three-week trial the jury found the man guilty of voluntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito sentenced the man to 16 years in state prison. "I thought he was very 
fair," Stanley said. "He is a very good judge in terms of the amount of respect 
he gives everyone in the case -- lawyers, defendants, jurors. He was absolutely 
on top of the law and I certainly would try another case in front of him 
without reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 A lover of classical music, a camera buff, a long-distance runner and a 
connoisseur of good coffee, Ito lives in Pasadena with his wife, two dogs and a 
cat. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being considered for a seat on the state Court of Appeal. If that 
appointment does not come soon, Ito said, he would like to move to the Juvenile 
Court bench in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more to be accomplished there," Ito said. "In criminal court, 
you're dealing with adults who have lifestyles and patterns that are 
established. With juveniles, you have the ability to intervene. You have the 
potential to make a positive change in people's lives. That's not always the 
case in adult criminal cases."

INSURERS SAY GARAMENDI NOW ASKS THEIR DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, who has prospered politically by 
refusing to take a dime from the industry he regulates, is now actively 
soliciting insurance organizations to buy tickets to a $5,000-a-plate 
fund-raiser in Washington next month, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In personal phone calls over the last two weeks, Garamendi has told startled 
trade group officials that he is holding the Aug. 4 event to help defray the 
$1.4-million debt remaining from his unsuccessful campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised by the phone call because on many issues I've tried to reach 
the commissioner and he's never returned my call," said Michael S. Cabot, 
executive director of the Western Assn. of Insurance Companies. He declined the 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliciting contributions from the industry is not illegal -- and other 
insurance commissioner candidates have taken such donations. For example, Wes 
Bannister, Garamendi's Republican opponent in the 1990 race for commissioner, 
was an insurance agent who made no bones about accepting industry money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi failed to return numerous telephone calls Friday to his Insurance 
Department office and his campaign headquarters in Sacramento. His department 
staff referred calls to his campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates find Garamendi's actions troubling, particularly because he 
is in the midst of tough negotiations with property-casualty insurers over the 
crisis in the homeowners insurance market triggered by the Northridge 
earthquake. Homeowner insurers are pressing for relief from the state law that 
requires them to also offer earthquake insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The obvious concern is that the insurance industry is going to want something 
in return," Harvey Rosenfield, author of the Proposition 103 insurance 
rate-cutting initiative, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't do it. He's still regulating them," said Harry Snyder, 
co-director of Consumers Union in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Others find Garamendi's action hypocritical in that he long made political 
capital out of his refusal to take industry money. In 1990, he was criticized 
for accepting personal donations from the wives of insurance executives. He 
later returned those contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several insurance organizations have turned down Garamendi's solicitation, but 
at least one is considering accepting. It could not be determined whether any 
others have already contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought our money was dirty to him," one trade group executive said 
Friday, adding that he was "kind of shocked" by the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the industry regards Garamendi as adversarial, even hostile, to its 
interests. The commissioner has clashed with insurance carriers in the 
courtroom and in public forums on issues ranging from redlining, or sales 
discrimination, to unfair denials of catastrophe claims, to failure to pay 
Proposition 103 rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser, to be held at the Washington Court Hotel, is billed as a 
"policy day." It will feature such congressional and Clinton Administration 
luminaries as House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Robert Altman and Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). 
</P>
<P>
 Groups that say they received personal solicitations from Garamendi include 
the Assn. of California Insurance Companies; the Western Assn. of Insurance 
Brokers and its parent, the National Assn. of Insurance Brokers; the California 
Assn. of Life Underwriters; the Assn. of California Life Insurance Companies, 
and the Professional Insurance Agents of California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms representing insurance companies also were invited to the 
fund-raiser. Garamendi has not previously refused contributions from such 
firms. Individual insurance companies apparently were not solicited. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas F. Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, 
the state's largest insurance trade organization, said he turned Garamendi 
down. "I told him that at this point we have absolutely no discretion to spend 
any PAC (political action committee) money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conneely also found the solicitation jarring, given Garamendi's past posture 
of refusing insurance industry funds. One of Conneely's employees was once 
turned down by Garamendi's political office when he tried to buy a $35 ticket 
to the commissioner's annual barbecue at his ranch in Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received the invitation (to next month's event) and are considering it," 
said Brad Wenger, president of the Assn. of California Life Insurance 
Companies, which represents 45 California life and health insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Darry Sragow, who managed Garamendi's campaign for 
governor, said Friday that because he no longer works for Garamendi, he could 
not comment on the fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said, however, that after the June 7 Democratic primary for governor -- 
in which state Treasurer Kathleen Brown defeated Garamendi -- the debt totaled 
about $1.4 million. That included more than $500,000 in loans that Garamendi 
made to himself; $700,000 in loans from supporters, some of which may be 
forgiven; and $150,000 owed to consultants, advertising firms, printers and 
other vendors, Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Pinkerton, Sacramento lobbyist for the California Assn. of Life 
Underwriters, representing about 11,000 agents, described Garamendi's pitch as 
"friendly -- certainly not overbearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi mentioned that he expects to land a job in Washington, involving 
"something related to health," Pinkerton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is a friend of President Clinton and chaired his California 
campaign. A Clinton aide, who spoke on background Friday, said of Garamendi: 
"The President and First Lady like him, and if he wanted a position I'm sure 
they would try to find him one." 
</P>
<P>
 Would Garamendi's solicitation of contributions from the insurance industry 
affect his chances for a job with Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
 "That depends on how it plays out," the aide said.

RWANDA REFUGEES URGED TO GO HOME IN BID TO EASE CRISIS; AFRICA: THE U.N. 
REVERSES ITS POLICY AND OFFERS TO HELP REPATRIATE MORE THAN A MILLION HUTUS. IN 
WASHINGTON, CLINTON ORDERS 'MASSIVE INCREASE' IN U.S. AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Swamped by the dying, diseased and exhausted, the United Nations announced 
Friday that it would encourage and assist the voluntary repatriation, on foot, 
of more than 1 million Hutu refugees back to Tutsi-controlled Rwanda in hopes 
of lessening the humanitarian crisis here. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was a major policy reversal for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, which had insisted Rwanda was still a dangerous 
place after a civil war and 3 1/2 months of tribal slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy change, which came after U.N. officials received assurances from 
Rwandan rebel leaders that those returning would be safe, was unlikely to have 
an immediate effect on the flood of refugees who have overrun this border town 
and overwhelmed international relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But aid officials said they hoped that the policy change would eventually 
encourage the refugees to begin their trek home, easing the catastrophic 
conditions here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday in Washington, President Clinton ordered an "immediate and massive 
increase" in U.S. assistance to Rwandan refugees, including a round-the-clock 
airlift of food, water and medicine to areas where the death toll from a 
widening epidemic of cholera and other highly contagious diseases has risen 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 In Goma, Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, said his 
organization had confirmed nearly 3,000 deaths in the past three days. But that 
figure, he said, didn't include hundreds who were collected and buried in mass 
graves by French army teams or countless others who have died in sprawling 
refugee camps that still are without adequate food, water or medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The ravages of the fast-spreading epidemic, compounded by exhaustion and 
hunger, were everywhere amid the grim chaos here Friday. As the day wore on, 
hundreds of corpses were placed in dusty rows alongside the road. Bodies also 
crowded the few field clinics and lay across the black lava-strewn fields.  
</P>
<P>
 At a single clinic run by the Catholic diocese in downtown Goma, about 30 
people died overnight from a refugee population of 10,000. "The normal death 
rate is 1 in 10,000," said Isabelle Pardeau, a doctor at the clinic. "Two in 
10,000 is severe. Ten is catastrophic. And here we had 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the foul-smelling clinic, a woman staggered by a stone wall. She took 
two steps, then leaned weakly against the wall. One more stumbling step and she 
collapsed, face down and lifeless in the sharp-edged rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 130 were dead by early morning just outside the town of Munigi, where 
several thousand sick people lay jammed together on reed mats, thin mattresses 
and bare rocks under the hot sun. Half a dozen doctors and nurses worked 
frantically to separate the dead from the living. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two people are dead," an Irish nurse, Bernadette Feeney, shouted from 
the middle of the field. "They are dead. They must be removed." A French doctor 
screamed and cursed in her radio nearby, "We need water! We need water now! 
Now!" 
</P>
<P>
 The six-tent field hospital finally received a container of clean water by 
late afternoon and enough intravenous drips to rehydrate the worst off. In most 
cases, a relative stood above the patient, holding a plastic bag with saline 
solution. But 50 more corpses had already appeared, and no food had arrived for 
the third day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 At Munigi, the sickness was compounded by fear as Zairian army soldiers 
appeared overnight and tried to order the people to leave. Witnesses said the 
soldiers first fired automatic rifles into the air, then fired into the crowd. 
At least three people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials and the Zairian government have tried to use food as a magnet to 
draw refugees from Goma, where no emergency food or water is distributed, and 
into makeshift camps as far as 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 A river of refugees poured up the narrow road Friday, leading cattle, goats 
and children. Most carried mattresses, blankets, cooking pots or water 
containers on their heads. A few were hauled in wheelbarrows or rode heavily 
loaded bicycles. Thousands squatted by the roadside under the hazy shadow of 
nearby volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others never made it, however, and corpses lay in blankets and mats along the 
road. One man's body stretched across the pavement where he fell, blocking 
traffic. And even those who arrived at the camps found little help since no 
clean water and only a third of the required food was available.  
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 300,000 people, for example, have already settled amid the grassy 
hillocks and jagged lava boulders at Kibumba, 15 miles north of Goma. The camp, 
a teeming rabble of tiny grass huts dotted with tents of blue plastic, 
stretches to the hazy horizon. Smoke from cooking fires is thick and foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The only local source of water is a scum-covered pond lined with cattle 
excrement. Entrepreneurs and still-uniformed soldiers of the defeated 
government army sell plastic containers of water for the equivalent of 50 cents 
each to those who can afford them. Others sell potatoes, cabbages and freshly 
slaughtered goat meat by the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp has only one medical dispensary, three tents surrounded by a sea of 
the stricken. A single tanker truck with 2,000 liters of clean water arrived at 
the clinic at 1 p.m., but the camp's needs were 3 million liters a day, said 
Bob Van Soest, a Dutch sanitation worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," he said wearily. "In this area, you can't dig for water. 
We don't have time to do a survey for drilling. The people are dying under our 
hands. We need to truck the water in. But the roads are impassable." 
</P>
<P>
 Many here said they had no intention of going back to Rwanda because they fear 
they will be killed by the Tutsi-run government of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, 
led by Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame. An estimated 500,000 Tutsis were hacked and shot 
to death by vicious Hutu death squads before Kagame's guerrilla army won 
control of the tiny mountainous country two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go back," said Salvatori Uzabakiriho, a 20-year-old Hutu and former 
student in Rwanda's capital, Kigali. "They will kill me. They will kill me 
because I am not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Another refugee, Eustasie Wanzunuwe, 30, insisted -- even as she lay with an 
intravenous drip in her arm -- that the cease-fire in Rwanda was only a ruse. 
"They stopped fighting so we will go back," she said weakly. "Then they will 
kill us. That is the strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeated government's propaganda radio has fueled the panic by warning 
that victorious Tutsis will show Hutu refugees no mercy if they return. Wild 
rumors have spread that Tutsis have mined roads into Rwanda and caused the 
cholera epidemic by poisoning the food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight ministers of the former government are in Goma, and aid officials fear 
the exiled Hutu leaders seek to keep the refugees here as virtual hostages 
until they can resume the war. In any case, several hundred refugees who tried 
to return to Rwanda on Friday were halted at the border at Goma by heavily 
armed Zairian commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, of the U.N. refugee agency, said a letter explaining the new 
repatriation policy had been given to the local Zairian governor. Wilkinson 
said he expects the border to reopen in the next few days. "We do not know why" 
it was closed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision to urge refugees to return to their villages came after 
Michele Moussalli, a special envoy for the U.N. refugee agency, met with Kagame 
in Kigali on Thursday and met relief officials at the border here Friday. 
Wilkinson said Moussalli won assurances from the new government that "any 
Rwandan not wanted for alleged war crimes and who wants to go home will be 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now believe it is safe for the people who want to go back," Wilkinson 
said. "We will help anyone who wants to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 No one would be forced to return, he said. He added that no timetable has yet 
been made for the repatriation, and refugees must return home the way they came 
-- on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the decision "a sliver of optimism" amid the horrors that have 
descended upon this remote stretch of Central Africa. But he admitted it would 
be "a hard sell" to refugees terrified of reprisals after the Hutu-led 
massacres. How to Help

FOCUS SHIFTS TO TRIAL LOCATION IN HUBER CASE

 If he had his druthers, the Arizona defense attorney for the man accused of 
killing Denise Huber and carting her body around in a freezer for three years 
said Friday that he does have a preference of where his client should be tried: 
in California, where it's tougher to execute someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware that in the applicability of the death penalty, it's apparent 
that California has more lenient provisions," defense counsel Thomas K. Kelly 
said. "That's clearly an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's father, Dennis, sees it differently: "I want Arizona," he said. "I 
think if you get the death penalty there they carry it out. It's a joke here." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, 10 days after John J. Famalaro was arrested at his country club home, 
the issue of where the 37-year-old bearded house painter will be tried began to 
take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid growing indications investigators may be able to show the 23-year-old 
Newport Beach woman was murdered in Orange County, a task force of county 
prosecutors and forensic specialists rendezvoused in Phoenix on Friday with 
their Arizona counterparts to examine evidence and discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your gut tells you it's likely that Huber was kidnaped and murdered (in 
Orange County)," Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said. "But 
we're looking at whether we can prove she was abducted and moved. You need more 
than a gut instinct to prove that in court -- you need witnesses or physical 
evidence to prove it to a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tests on what appears to be blood found at a Laguna Hills storage complex 
could be completed by Monday, Conley said. Famalaro was renting the storage 
space at the time of Huber's disappearance. Crime lab specialists were expected 
to work through the weekend in an attempt to determine if the substance is 
human blood and, if it is, if it matches Huber's type.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sources close to the case revealed Friday that Famalaro painted homes 
belonging to members of the Orange County law enforcement community, including 
two Newport Beach police officers and one prosecutor, who may have hired the 
handyman around the time Huber vanished in June, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, in an odd twist, may be called as a witness in 
the case to testify on what could be a key issue: Investigators say Paer has 
told them that he remembers Famalaro being clean-shaven, as opposed to the 
bearded figure whom police arrested in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's appearance during that period is significant because some have 
speculated he posed as a police officer in luring Huber to her death, and it's 
generally known that most law enforcement officers don't sport beards. Handmade 
replicas of Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy shirts turned up in a search of 
Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense counsel Kelly won court approval to hire an independent pathologist 
to examine the body, as long as it does not interfere with the family's plans 
to bury Huber later this month in South Dakota next to her grandfather. The 
defense's independent exam is scheduled for Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weary of being inadvertently placed in the media spotlight, the roommate of 
Famalaro's brother Warren, who lives in Lake Forest, moved out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have interviewed Warren Famalaro, a convicted child molester, 
several times, saying he was being considered as everything from a "witness to 
a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 As prosecutors from both Arizona and Orange County weighed their cache of 
evidence in the case Friday -- including a possibly bloodstained crowbar seized 
from Famalaro's home -- authorities were turning their attention to the issue 
of jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in both states have conferred on the issue and, at least publicly, 
have agreed that justice should be dispensed where the crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Orange County officials await the results of tests on a 
blood-like substance found in a Laguna Hills storage locker rented by Famalaro 
during the time of Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test confirms investigators' suspicions the substance is Huber's blood, 
that would provide evidence of a potential murder site. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators already say they have evidence that Famalaro lived in Lake 
Forest at the time of Huber's disappearance, bought a freezer from a Montgomery 
Ward & Co. store in Orange County several days later and had it shipped to the 
Laguna Hills storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the freezer was transferred in 1992 to a San Clemente storage bin, 
where Famalaro requested that power be on 24 hours a day. Sometime early this 
year, authorities say, Famalaro rented a Ryder truck, put the freezer in it and 
relocated to his country club home in Dewey, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 When investigators opened the freezer July 13, they found Huber's frozen 
corpse inside, her head bludgeoned, her hands cuffed, and her eyes and mouth 
covered in cloth and sealed in duct tape.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said the Orange County "team" included Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Christopher J. Evans, investigator Don Null, pathologist Richard Fukumoto 
and three additional law enforcement officers. They arrived in Phoenix to meet 
with officials from the local medical examiner's office and the local 
prosecutor, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County prosecutors arrived too late to see some evidence. The Ryder 
rental truck, for example, has been released back to the truck company, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of information they are not privy to, but that is because it 
is not their case," said Yavapai County prosecutor Tom Lindberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will, however be kept up to date on all developments because it is 
important for them to keep abreast of things. There will be no jurisdictional 
squabbling in this case. We all want the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the representatives from the Orange County district attorney's 
office were sent to Arizona to act as "backup" prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley also stressed that there was no "competition" for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in any way acting like the big bad prosecutors from the big city 
coming in to take over," Conley said, alluding to the fact that Yavapai County 
(population 120,000) is not used to such high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a breakthrough in the next day or two and it can be proven she 
was murdered in Orange County," he added, "we would have to pick up the ball 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Arizona officials say their laws dictate that Arizona has 
jurisdiction unless it can be shown the murder took place in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As the defense has already pointed out, transferring the case back to Orange 
County may benefit the defendant if Famalaro is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 California prosecutors can seek the death penalty -- via gas chamber or lethal 
injection -- only if the murder was accompanied by "special circumstances," 
such as a kidnaping or other felony. 
</P>
<P>
 To execute someone by lethal injection -- the sole means in Arizona -- 
prosecutors have more leeway; they must simply prove the murder of Huber was 
"depraved" and heinous, a burden that investigators say is easily met in the 
Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Friday that the number of blows Huber suffered 
was underestimated. It appears that instead of eight to 10 blows to the head -- 
possibly with a hammer or crowbar -- Huber might have suffered more than 12 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kelly made his comments concerning his preferences on 
jurisdiction in an interview from his office in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hoping either way, but I am trying to anticipate each potential 
defense and where it could work better," Kelly said. "I have discussed with my 
client the advantages of trying this case in California rather than Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what he knows, Kelly predicted that Famalaro, who was indicted on 
first-degree murder charges Thursday, would probably be returned to face trial 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly also expressed concerns about the level of publicity the case has 
garnered, adding, "We have to consider that impact both in California and in 
Arizona in terms of selecting a fair and impartial jury." 
</P>
<P>
 In his motion to have an independent forensics expert appointed, Kelly argued 
that it would be crucial in preparing his defense to fix a time and cause of 
death. At the same time, Kelly said he understood the prosecution's concerns 
about releasing Huber's body to the family for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made every effort to meet our needs without infringing on the 
family's grief," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Friday, Yavapai County Counsel Charles Hastings offered no 
objections to the defense request for a private pathologist's examination -- so 
long as the family's plans to bury the Huber next week are not delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hastings, "I think the family deserves that."

SIMPSON PLEADS '100% NOT GUILTY' TO CHARGES; HEARING: JUDGE LANCE ITO IS 
ASSIGNED TO CASE. PROMINENT L.A. LAWYER JOHNNIE L. COCHRAN JR. JOINS DEFENSE 
TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking in a firm, assertive voice, O.J. Simpson proclaimed he was 
"absolutely, 100% not guilty" Friday as he was arraigned for the second time in 
five weeks on charges that he murdered his ex-wife and a young Brentwood 
waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's hearing featured a more forceful and engaged Simpson than in previous 
court appearances. He consulted with his lawyers throughout the brief session 
and stood ramrod straight when the charges against him were read. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a dark suit and accompanied by his growing team of lawyers -- the 
latest addition being veteran civil rights attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. -- 
Simpson calmly answered a series of routine questions by the Superior Court 
presiding judge, then entered his not guilty plea before a nationwide audience 
of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was escorted from the courtroom back to the jail cell where he has spent 
the past month, Simpson gave a jaunty thumb-up sign to spectators. Family 
members of the two victims, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, sat 
silently nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising Criminal Court Judge Cecil J. Mills assigned the Simpson case to 
his assistant, Judge Lance Ito. But Mills declined to set a trial date, 
preferring to leave that and other matters to Ito. Simpson lawyer Robert L. 
Shapiro has said he expects to seek an early trial date. Under the law, Simpson 
can insist on a trial within 60 days of Friday's arraignment -- meaning that 
the case could begin by Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito recently told the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal publication, that a 
judge "would have to be crazy to want that (Simpson) case." Now, he will 
quickly become a central player in a drama that has gripped the nation for 
almost six weeks. Almost every hearing in the case so far has been broadcast 
live on national television; the main participants already have become 
household names, and some have been subjected to withering scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 A bearded 43-year-old former prosecutor, Ito is married to the highest-ranking 
woman in the Los Angeles Police Department, Capt. Margaret York. Before 
assigning Ito the case, Mills asked the lawyers whether they had any objection 
to the appointment based on Ito's relationship to York, who heads the LAPD's 
bunco-forgery division. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that relationship, Ito routinely volunteers to step down from cases 
that involve the LAPD, Mills explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro and Cochran conferred briefly, then Shapiro spoke with Simpson before 
responding: "Judge Ito is a choice that is acceptable to us, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said prosecutors had no objection either. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran is the other new face in the explosive case, but his entry was 
expected and he is no stranger to publicity. His current clients include riot 
beating victim Reginald O. Denny and superstar entertainer Michael Jackson -- 
merely the latest in a long string of high-profile cases that have rarely had 
Cochran far from the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 A former ranking member of the district attorney's office, Cochran is one of 
Los Angeles' best-known trial lawyers. He lists Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and 
many other notables as personal references. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, he attended a meeting between Garcetti and prominent African 
Americans who raised concerns about the district attorney's handling of the 
Simpson case, including the racial composition of the jury and the possibility 
of Simpson facing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Cochran was part of the Simpson team, joining Shapiro, 
Gerald F. Uelmen, Sara L. Caplan, Robert Kardashian, F. Lee Bailey and Alan M. 
Dershowitz. Shapiro is acting as the lead attorney and said Friday that more 
lawyers are expected to sign up soon. So far, neither Bailey nor Dershowitz has 
appeared in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shapiro and prosecutors, who avoided questions from reporters after 
Friday's hearing, Cochran paused long enough to say he was pleased to have been 
hired by Simpson, with whom he has enjoyed a long friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important trial," Cochran said. "I'm glad to be part of the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Friday's arraignment was a brief, perfunctory affair, lasting 
about 10 minutes. Simpson had been arraigned June 20 in Municipal Court, where 
his preliminary hearing was held. Defendants who are ordered to stand trial on 
serious charges in that court, as he was, must be arraigned again in Superior 
Court, where the trial is held. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the arraignment Friday, aside from the assignment of Ito, was 
a brief exchange between Mills and Simpson after the charges against the famous 
ex-athlete were read. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you ready to enter a plea at this time?" Mills asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, your honor," responded Simpson, standing next to Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you plead to counts 1 and 2?" the judge inquired, referring to the two 
premeditated murder counts against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, 100% not guilty," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five weeks since he was arrested after a nationally televised pursuit 
across the freeways of Southern California, that brief remark by Simpson was 
his longest public comment on the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Simpson was proclaiming his innocence in court, investigators were 
moving forward in their case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD detectives on Friday delivered blood samples to a private laboratory in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The samples will undergo DNA testing as investigators attempt to show that 
blood at the scene of the crime came from Simpson and that bloodstains found at 
his estate might have come from either of the two victims. The procedure to be 
done by the lab is known as RFLP testing. In some cases it can show with great 
precision the likelihood that a certain sample did or did not come from a 
specific person. 
</P>
<P>
 In papers filed in court after Friday's arraignment, Simpson's lawyers sought 
to stop the prosecution from going ahead with the DNA testing of specimens of 
hair and blood collected by police at the murder scene, at Simpson's estate and 
from samples Simpson has provided to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing is scheduled for Tuesday, but Shapiro said a key defense expert 
would not be able to attend that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers have contended that they should be given portions of all 
of those samples so they can conduct their own independent testing. If the 
prosecution is allowed to proceed with the tests as planned, the defense fears 
that some of the samples will be entirely consumed, making the independent 
testing impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 That same issue was dealt with during Simpson's preliminary hearing earlier 
this month. At that time, Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled 
that the defense could have its experts present during the testing, and 
prosecutors offered to split any samples that were large enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark reminded Judge Mills of the earlier ruling during Friday's hearing, but 
Mills declined to take any action because the motion had not been filed at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, asserting that Kennedy-Powell no longer has jurisdiction in the case, 
asked Ito to rehear their arguments. Late in the day, Ito scheduled a hearing 
for Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Another motion filed by the defense, requesting immediate access to police and 
prosecution records, could be heard then or Friday, when Ito has scheduled a 
pretrial hearing. A trial date is likely to be set during one of those sessions 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday is also the day that prosecutors are expected to announce whether they 
will charge Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings, with aiding a fugitive based on 
his actions on the day that Simpson failed to surrender to police as scheduled. 
The Arraignment 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson was arraigned Friday in the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. A trial could start as soon as Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 THE PLEA: Simpson said he was "absolutely, 100% not guilty" of the June 12 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW JUDGE: Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, 43 was selected to preside over the 
trial. After being named, he said, "It feels like I've had 12 cups of coffee 
and I've only had one." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW LAWYER: Veteran civil rights attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., whose 
clients have included Reginald O. Denny and Michael Jackson, has been added to 
the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT STEP: Ito, who will ultimately set a trial date, has granted a defense 
request for a hearing Monday on DNA testing.

PLAN TO EXPAND MEDICARE SPARKS HEALTH SKIRMISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the controversy over health care reform focused largely on universal 
coverage and employer mandates, a little-noticed proposal that would 
dramatically expand Medicare is emerging as a potential congressional time 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex health care bill being assembled by the House Democratic 
leadership contains a provision that would cover millions of uninsured 
Americans by creating a new "Medicare Part C" program. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, endorsed earlier by the House Ways and Means Committee, is intended 
as an alternative to the mandatory health care alliances proposed by President 
Clinton to cover unemployed Americans, part-time or seasonal workers, 
independent contractors and others who would not be eligible for employer-paid 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially overlooked amid the clamor over universal coverage and employer 
mandates, Part C is now provoking a behind-the- scenes brawl among competing 
interest groups and their allies in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a big fight and we'll be in the midst of it," said Dick 
Davidson, head of the 5,000-member American Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalating dispute may be one reason that House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) missed a self-imposed deadline for producing a bill by Friday 
for House debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wrangling over the proposal is continuing, Part C will be a 
central element of the Gephardt bill, said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), acting 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a done deal," he said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the proposed program would be another big-government, 
budget-busting social program but backers hail it as the logical expansion of a 
program that is working well for 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmishing broke into the open Friday with a new advertising campaign by 
the influential Health Insurance Assn. of America, which attacked Part C as 
potentially "the largest entitlement program in history" and one that its 
president, Willis D. Gradison Jr., predicted would lead to "massive tax 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of Part C dispute such assertions, saying that the proposal is the 
most feasible way to reach universal coverage even if Congress imposes a 
requirement that employers pay for a portion of their workers' health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with an employer mandate, you've got to have a way to deal with all the 
people who are not connected to the work force," Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), 
the chief congressional advocate of a government-run single-payer system, said 
in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how -- or whether -- a health care bill being crafted by Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) for debate in the upper chamber 
would cover seasonal workers, independent contractors, part-timers and 
dependents of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The private insurance industry has never been able to serve that market. And 
when they do, it's at such an exorbitant price that nobody can afford it," 
Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of expanding Medicare to cover the uninsured is not new. Several 
years ago, it was proposed by the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health 
Care, better known as the Pepper Commission after its chairman, the late Rep. 
Claude Pepper (D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
 The idea also has the support of the influential American Assn. of Retired 
Persons, whose members are well satisfied with Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to reach universal coverage, the President originally proposed 
pooling most consumers into regional cooperatives that would buy insurance for 
members at less-expensive group rates, with the needy receiving government 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate evolved, Part C emerged in a bill by the House Ways and Means 
health subcommittee chaired by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward). It was then adopted 
by the full committee and Gephardt now has incorporated the proposal into his 
House leadership bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag of Part C is difficult to determine because it depends on key 
details that are not yet known, such as the scope of a benefits package and 
eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as with much else in the health care debate, what may be appealing about 
Part C to some is precisely what makes it unattractive to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.), an influential voice on health care issues, 
has derided the proposal as "just a back-door single-payer plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The program would create, in essence, a new "fee-for-service" arrangement, 
like Medicare, in which beneficiaries may go to any provider they choose. But 
that approach flies in the face of a nationwide trend toward managed-care 
systems in which consumer choice is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part C is like a dinosaur. It perpetuates all the things wrong with the 
current system," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part C insurance could be 20% cheaper than a comparable private insurance 
plan, according to McDermott. But the problem is that Medicare already pays 
providers at below-market rates, thus forcing them to recoup their losses by 
upping fees for insured patients -- one major reason for overall escalating 
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Part C would accelerate such "cost-shifting," Gradison said. 
</P>
<P>
 And because Part C coverage would be likely to cost less than private 
insurance plans, many employers, especially small businesses, would channel 
workers into the program, said Richard I. Smith, health policy director for the 
Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate Part C," he said. "All it does is cut prices and shifts costs to 
private payers." 
</P>
<P>
 But "if Part C works," McDermott said, "the private insurers will be really 
threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 The Part C debate emerged as the escalating struggle to influence public 
opinion before Congress approaches its climatic health care debate in the 
coming weeks.

BRAIN SIZE LINKED TO RISK OF DEMENTIA, STUDY FINDS; HEALTH: THE RESULTS SUGGEST 
THAT THE CAUSES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE MAY OCCUR IN INFANCY, NOT IN OLD AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People with below-average head size have as much as 18 times the normal risk 
of developing dementia caused by Alzheimer's and other diseases, Washington 
state researchers have found. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings suggest that such individuals do not have enough brain cells in 
reserve to offset the loss of cells caused by aging and neurological diseases, 
said epidemiologist Amy B. Graves of Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories in 
Seattle. When such losses do occur, the brains of people with smaller than 
average heads are more likely to contain fewer cells than are necessary for 
coherent thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The new results suggest that the most important causes of Alzheimer's may not 
occur late in life, as most scientists now believe, but at the very earliest 
stages of development, a conclusion that could have profound implications for 
efforts to prevent such disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves' findings are based on a study of 1,458 Japanese Americans that is to 
be presented at the upcoming Fourth International Conference on Alzheimer's 
Disease and Related Disorders. The results are supported by at least two other 
studies previously published or now in press. 
</P>
<P>
 Although small head size can be genetic in origin, the most common causes are 
the mother's smoking and drug use during pregnancy and nutritional deficiencies 
during pregnancy and in the baby's first two years of life, the periods when 
brain cells are actively growing. "If we are going to invest money in 
preventing Alzheimer's disease, we may want to invest it not among the elderly 
but at the other end of the age spectrum," said Dr. James A. Mortimer of the 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis. "It will be a very long-term 
investment, but it may prove to be the only effective way to do it."  
</P>
<P>
 Graves' study "does raise very interesting questions about the link between 
brain size and dementia," said Dr. Peter Schofield of Columbia University. It 
is impressive because of the large number of people studied, he noted, but 
still more studies are necessary to confirm the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Dementia is a jumbling of thought processes that leaves the victim forgetful 
and confused, a condition that is often called senility. Although it has a 
variety of causes, the two most common are strokes and Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous work has shown that key areas of the human brain must have a minimum 
number of cells, called the threshold, to prevent dementia, Graves said. An 
average-size brain can afford to lose up to 70% of the cells it had during 
childhood in regions of the brain that control thought processes, such as the 
hippocampus.  
</P>
<P>
 After the first two or three years of life, no new brain cells are formed and 
those present die off at a more or less constant rate, unless the rate is 
accelerated by disease or injury. "If everybody lived long enough, everyone 
would become demented," Graves said, but for many that might mean living to 
120. 
</P>
<P>
 By that reasoning, the more brain cells a person has to begin with, the longer 
it will take for the number of cells to fall below the threshold. Head size is 
generally considered to be a rough indicator of brain size. 
</P>
<P>
 The Battelle research was carried out as part of an international study to 
compare the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's, in Japanese Americans 
in Seattle and Honolulu and Japanese in Hiroshima, Japan. The goal is to help 
determine the relative influence of genetics and environment in strokes and 
Alzheimer's disease.  
</P>
<P>
 In the study, Graves and her colleagues measured the head circumference of 
1,458 people over the age of 65 and correlated it with their performance on a 
widely used diagnostic test for dementia. Those with the smallest 
circumference, about 21 inches or less, were 18 times as likely to be demented 
as those with a circumference of 23 inches or greater. In general, women's 
heads are smaller, Mortimer said, but there is evidence that their brain cells 
may be packed more densely, which would offset the size difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves' finding is buttressed by related studies. In a study of nursing home 
residents, Dr. Robert Katzman of UC San Diego first determined who was demented 
and then autopsied the brains after death. He found that people with dementia 
were most likely to have the smallest brains. In an as-yet-unpublished study, 
Schofield of Columbia has correlated the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in 
28 patients with the size of their brains as determined by a CAT scan. He found 
that the larger the brain size, the older the patient was at diagnosis. He 
concluded that those with the largest brains could afford to lose more brain 
cells before dementia occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers cautioned that not everyone with a small head develops 
dementia. "The density of brain cells could be just as important as the overall 
size of the brain," Mortimer said. Studies are under way now to determine if 
that is the case, he added.

 COMING HOME: The months of exile are almost over for CalArts. On Aug. 3, the 
school, which occupied temporary quarters in Santa Clarita and Pasadena after 
its Valencia campus was heavily damaged in the Jan. 17 quake, will be moving 
back home. . . . In the final analysis, according to school President Steven D. 
Lavine, the rebuilding process will cost in excess of $26 million.

 FELIX RETURNS: Cats do have nine lives, especially if they make it on 
television. This time, the fortunate feline is none other than Felix the Cat, 
who will return to the tube on Saturday mornings this fall in a series of 
five-second CBS spots produced by Film Roman, an animation company in North 
Hollywood. . . . "We want to make a whole new generation aware of this cat who 
has amused so many people," said President Phil Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 TWO VIEWS: Two different Catholic organizations are on opposite sides of the 
fence. "Picket Fences," that is. One group, the Studio City-based Catholics in 
Media, founded by Jack and Patt Shea (above), applauds the CBS series for how 
it's dealt with moral issues. . . . But another, Catholic League for Religious 
and Civil Rights, argues the show has featured anti-Catholic bigotry (B11).

 MOOD CHANGE: There are two Lance Whitakers. The one outside the ring listens 
to soul, but the one between the ropes goes right for the body (C14). . . . 
Whitaker, who attended San Fernando High, will take part in the Goodwill Games 
in Russia, which opened Friday. "Once I get in the ring," he said, "it's 
business. I'm gonna take care of you before you take care of me."

 VALLEY ANGEL: It sure didn't take Hart High alum Andrew Lorraine long to make 
it to the big leagues. In fact, Lorraine, 21, who made his first start Friday 
night (C14), signed with the Angels exactly a year ago Sunday. . . . Lorraine, 
a two-time All-Southern selection at Hart, was chosen in the fourth round of 
the June draft last year after playing for Stanford.

MISSING GIRL FROM FULLERTON IS FOUND SAFE 
</P>

<P>
 A daylong search for an 8-year-old girl reported kidnaped from her mother's 
bed Friday ended when the girl was found near midnight at a motel in Anaheim 
and her mother's boyfriend was arrested on suspicion of abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The boyfriend, Robert Granger, 34, who lives with the child and her mother, 
had told police that the girl disappeared when he checked on her in her 
mother's bedroom at 11:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Police and bloodhounds searched the neighborhood all day and all night, but 
said later that Granger's story had been inconsistent. She eventually 
telephoned police from the Silver Moon Motel after she saw herself on 
television, police said. She had been tied up but managed to free herself, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her apparent abduction was the second such incident in Orange County in a 
month. On June 30, a 7-year-old girl was carried out of her bed in Tustin, but 
that kidnaping was foiled when family members chased the abductor and forced 
him to release her. He was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton girl had been reported last seen about 10 a.m. in her mother's 
bedroom, wearing a green bathrobe and white T-shirt and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Lori Amaro, 29, had been driven to work in Los Angeles on Friday 
morning by Granger, police said. When Granger returned to the apartment he 
shares with Amaro about 10 a.m., he noticed the child asleep, he told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger and the girl and her 10-year-old brother were in and out of the 
two-bedroom apartment for the next hour and a half, Granger said. When Granger 
checked the bedroom again about 11:30 a.m., he saw that she was missing and 
found signs of a break-in, Granger told police. 
</P>
<P>
 After searching in vain for the child, Granger said he called the mother about 
1:30 p.m., and she came home. About 2:30 p.m. they called police, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also noticed there appeared to be some valuables missing -- jewelry, a 
handgun and one of those little portable fire safes, more like a locked box," 
Fullerton Police Lt. Tony Hernandez said earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaro said police told them that although the bedroom screen was cut, the dust 
on the window sill was undisturbed, perhaps indicating that it was not really 
the point of entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The window was made to look like it was broken through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaro, who is expecting another baby in two weeks, said earlier Friday night, 
"I am not going into labor; I'm going to stay calm because someone may come up 
with my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's father said he learned of the abduction when his former wife called 
him about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you see on TV; it doesn't happen to you," said Gary Amaro, 38, 
a drapery installer who lives in Long Beach. "I don't know how to feel. Angry, 
I guess, that someone would have the audacity to go into your house and take 
your kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Amaro, who has been divorced from the girl's mother for about six years, said 
his daughter is "like every 8-year-old. Every weekend she wants to go to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down in my house and just prayed," he said Friday evening. "It's out of 
my hands. It's in God's hands. I would like to do something but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 police officers using five bloodhounds searched the neighborhood 
surrounding the 88-unit apartment complex, located in the 2400 block of West 
Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it appeared that someone came in through the window of the 
mother's bedroom, which opens onto an alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge, none of the neighbors noticed anything unusual," Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors were stunned at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have happened to anyone, but it happened to her," said Luis Felix, 
13, who also lives in the complex and has played POGs with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Felix said that shortly after noon he saw the bedroom where the girl had 
slept and it was in disarray with items strewn on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Rawlings, manager of Regency Villas, said she first heard about the 
kidnaping when Granger asked her if she had seen his "baby." He said he had 
been doing laundry across the street and had noticed the girl missing when he 
returned. He also discovered the bedroom window screen cut, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't believe that (she) would run away with someone she didn't 
know," Rawlings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings, who spoke with the girl's mother throughout the day, said she's 
"holding up under the circumstances."

LATIN AMERICA; DRUG WAR ALLIES COLOMBIA, U.S. TURN SIGHTS ON EACH OTHER

 As Colombia prepares to install a new president whose reputation already seems 
compromised by the corrosive effect of drug money, the relationship between the 
United States and the South American nation has deteriorated so much that 
international anti-narcotics programs are in grave jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 President-elect Ernesto Samper, who takes office in Bogota on Aug. 7, "comes 
in under a tremendous shadow as far as we are concerned," a senior U.S. 
government official said Friday, referring to reports that Samper's campaign 
accepted money from cocaine barons headquartered in the Colombian city of Cali. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the official said, Samper is the democratically elected 
president of a country that stands "at the very heart of our counter-narcotics 
strategy." So the United States has no choice but to get on with the job while 
trying to ease Colombian outrage at what the Bogota government regards as a 
series of recent U.S. insults. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Samper's election, the official said, the U.S. government 
bluntly warned that Colombia would face serious consequences if it failed to 
remain engaged in the fight against cocaine traffic. The message was delivered, 
the official said, "under instruction from the highest levels of the (U.S.) 
government" -- a strong hint that it came from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about Samper were raised by the discovery of several tape recordings 
of telephone conversations between two Cali cartel leaders and a journalist who 
has long served as the cartel bagman. The tapes revealed efforts by the 
traffickers to contribute more than $3 million to Samper's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, counterattacking, declared himself "truly indignant" at what he 
described as a U.S. attempt to "smear the name of Colombian individuals and 
institutions, beginning with the very president of the republic." 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is producing great harm internationally to Colombia insofar as 
it seeks to ignore the fight which we have waged, at incredibly high costs, 
against the worldwide scourge of drug trafficking," Samper said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials agree that U.S.-Colombian cooperation against the drug trade 
has been generally good. But they say Colombia's efforts dropped off during the 
first half of this year, possibly because Colombian officials relaxed after 
smashing the Medellin cocaine cartel late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a series of recent incidents in both countries has soured the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 From Colombia's standpoint, the most grievous insult came July 15 when the 
U.S. Senate voted 94 to 0 to cut off all assistance to Colombia unless 
President Clinton certifies that the Bogota government is investigating 
corruption and taking concrete steps to fight the Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Posada went on national television and 
radio a few hours after the Senate vote to declare that Colombia would 
"unilaterally reject any type of (drug-war) assistance from the United States" 
if the measure became law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration opposes the measure, which has not yet been acted 
on by the House, and will try to prevent it from becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident that ruffled feelings in Colombia, the country's national 
police chief, Maj. Gen. Octavio Vargas Silva, was snubbed during a visit to 
Washington when Thomas Constantine, chief of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, refused to receive him. 
</P>
<P>
 The DEA blamed confusion over the meeting's agenda. But other U.S. officials 
said the DEA attache in Bogota had blundered by inviting Vargas to Washington 
knowing that the U.S. government "has reason to believe that Vargas is 
corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the snags, Colombia -- the world's leading producer of illicit cocaine 
-- and the United States -- the largest consumer -- have little choice but to 
continue to cooperate against the drug barons. In an indication that relations 
may be on the mend, a U.S. official said the Administration was pleased, so 
far, with the individuals Samper had named to his Cabinet.

EUROPE; BITTERNESS SULLIES POLISH PLANS FOR RECONCILIATION; SOME HOPED TO HEAL 
WOUNDS WITH GERMANY AND RUSSIA ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WARSAW UPRISING. BUT 
INVITATION TO LEADERS OF THOSE FORMER ENEMY COUNTRIES HAS DIVIDED NATION.

<P>
 In a year marked by World War II anniversaries across Europe, many Poles 
wanted their biggest commemoration to serve as an international example of 
reconciliation between former enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deep wounds of history have conspired against such good intentions. 
The upcoming anniversary of the so-called Warsaw Uprising has served instead as 
an unsettling reminder of how bitter many Poles remain toward their German and 
Russian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish President Lech Walesa has invited both Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin and German President Roman Herzog to the Aug. 1 ceremonies marking the 
50th anniversary of the rebellion. The move has angered some veteran groups, 
prompted a nationwide petition drive against the visits and left the Polish 
electorate deeply divided. 
</P>
<P>
 In extending the invitations, which have also gone to British, French and 
American leaders, Walesa said it is time to reach out to Germans and Russians 
and put to rest historic animosities, which for many Poles are best illustrated 
by the tragic uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not forget what happened," said Andrzej Zakrzewski, Walesa's top 
political adviser. "But at the same time we want reconciliation. We do not want 
to enter into the new world with a feeling of vendetta." 
</P>
<P>
 Polish underground forces mounted the 63-day revolt against occupying German 
troops in 1944 in hopes of liberating the Polish capital before the advancing 
Soviet army claimed the territory for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis brutally crushed the insurrection, killing 200,000 Poles and 
systematically dynamiting most of Warsaw, including the Royal Castle, a symbol 
of Polish sovereignty. The Soviets ignored calls for help and watched the 
carnage from the east bank of the Vistula River, content to see the Nazis put 
down the largely anti-Communist Polish resistance movement before moving in 
unhindered months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the uprising was a military debacle, Poles regard it as a proud 
moment of national honor: An ill-equipped band of citizens known as the Home 
Army dared to take on Hitler's war machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view the uprising as a victory," said Jacek Milobedzki, a retired 
electronics engineer who fought at age 16. "A lot of what followed in Poland, 
including Solidarity, we believe had its roots in the uprising. Young people 
were brought up knowing we needed to be independent and not subservient to 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent public opinion poll shows that half of Poles want neither Herzog nor 
Yeltsin to attend. Urszula Krassawska, a pollster with the Center for Surveying 
Public Opinion, said Poles still revere the uprising and are slow to forget 
"the hurt of that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin declined his invitation but promised to send a high-level delegation, 
which is equally unacceptable to opponents. Herzog readily accepted but 
offended some Poles when he confused the uprising with the Warsaw Ghetto 
Uprising, a 1943 revolt in the city's walled Jewish quarter that was also 
suppressed by Nazi troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In protest, some Home Army veterans plan to boycott the official ceremonies, 
and the Confederation for an Independent Poland, a nationalist opposition 
party, has undertaken a petition drive demanding the Germans and Russians not 
attend. The effort has been organized by 30-year-old party activist Tomasz 
Szczepanski. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is premature for gestures like this one," Szczepanski said. "The Warsaw 
Uprising was not just a battle like Normandy, it wasn't even just an attempt to 
conquer the Home Army. It was an attempt to annihilate Warsaw and the center of 
Polish culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Russian and German participation say they are not disheartened 
by the protests, describing them as a healthy byproduct of Polish democracy. 
Only a few years ago, Poles were not even allowed to publicly commemorate the 
uprising because the Communist authorities viewed it as anti-Communist.

EX-HONOR GUARD GETS LIFE IN PRISON FOR ARMY KILLING

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Army sergeant was given a mandatory life sentence Friday for shooting 
a lieutenant to death after he tried to rape her in a dormitory they shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sgt. 1st Class Ervin Graves, who was once an honor guard in the White 
House, was convicted Thursday by a military jury of killing 2nd Lt. Lisa Bryant 
with four blasts from his .357 magnum.Graves also was convicted of attempted 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves' life sentence was automatic. The jury met Friday to decide his other 
punishment, which included the forfeiture of all pay and allowances, a 
reduction in rank to private and a dishonorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the panel did not convict him unanimously, Graves avoided the death 
penalty. The balloting was secret. He will be eligible for parole in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, 21, was a newly commissioned officer who had graduated with honors 
from Princeton a month before she was killed on July 10, 1993. Bryant and 
Graves, 34, lived on the same floor in Hardy Hall, an Army dormitory for 
soldiers on temporary duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves, an Omaha native, enlisted 15 years ago and rose to membership in the 
Old Guard, a prestigious spit-and-polish unit that provides honor guards for 
the White House and Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded not guilty and did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's earring was found in Graves' room and several of her hairs were found 
in his shoes and socks. Gunshot residue was found on his hands, the steering 
wheel of his car and the victim's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 No one saw the shooting, although a witness said that Graves had appeared 
nervous afterward. The witness also testified about seeing what appeared to be 
Graves' van leaving the dorm parking lot with its lights off.

ASTRONAUTS' TRIP BECOMES LONGEST SHUTTLE FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Columbia's seven astronauts broke the shuttle endurance record Friday after 
thunderstorms offshore forced them to stay up for a 15th day. 
</P>
<P>
 Their science mission became not only the longest shuttle trip ever but the 
longest U.S. spaceflight in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just tickled to death to pass the baton and that trophy to you guys," 
said Mission Control's Bill McArthur, who flew on the previous record-setter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm sure that baton won't get hot in our hands," replied commander 
Robert Cabana. "This is something that's not going to last real long because 
we're just going to keep doing this longer and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia is carrying newts, fish, flies and other creatures for research into 
how organisms reproduce, develop and adapt in space. 
</P>
<P>
 The six Americans and one Japanese broke the record in the afternoon, six 
hours after being diverted from a sunrise landing at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 If Columbia lands on time at 3:38 a.m. PDT today, the flight will have lasted 
14 days and nearly 18 hours. The previous record, set last fall by another 
Columbia crew, was 14 days, 13 minutes.

 The CIA predicted Friday that the U.S. trade deficit with China will grow to 
$28 billion this year, bolstering recent predictions of senior Clinton 
Administration officials that China is fast closing in on Japan as America's 
leading trade problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual report to Congress on the Chinese economy, the CIA noted that 
China's exports of labor-intensive goods such as toys, shoes and clothes -- 
which have increasingly filled the shelves of American discount chains and 
retail stores -- are now being augmented by new sales of medium-technology 
products such as telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, while American companies are having trouble increasing their 
exports to China, Japan's sales in the world's most populous country have been 
shooting up rapidly, the CIA found. Like the United States, Japan had a trade 
deficit with China, but it was much smaller -- $3.3 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Friday, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) termed the existing U.S. 
trade deficit with China "unacceptable. . . . It is growing faster than that 
with any other trading partner." 
</P>
<P>
 If current rates of increase -- more than 20% a year -- continue, the trade 
imbalance with China will reach $40 billion by the presidential election year 
of 1996. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has been running at annual levels of 
$50 billion to $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (China) have learned the wrong lessons from Japan, frankly," U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor told The Times last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is now engaged in trade talks with China aimed at 
resolving disputes over such issues as China's pirating of copyrighted 
software, tape recordings and movies. These violations of intellectual property 
reduce levels of U.S. exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
 So rapidly are Chinese goods taking hold in the U.S. market that shoes and 
sneakers made in China accounted for 40% of all imported footwear last year, up 
from 30% in 1992. About half of all the luggage imported into the United States 
in 1993 came from China, as did nearly 40% of all the toys, games and baby 
carriages. 
</P>
<P>
 But CIA specialists on the Chinese economy pointed out that, if China, Taiwan 
and Hong Kong are lumped together, the increase in the trade deficit does not 
seem quite so dramatic. The reason is that, as Hong Kong and Taiwanese 
companies transfer their factories to China to take advantage of cheaper labor, 
the U.S. trade deficit with these other jurisdictions is reduced while the 
imbalance with China goes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of China's success in the U.S. marketplace is due to the relocation of 
manufacturing facilities from other rapidly developing regions in Asia to 
China," said Martin Petersen, CIA director of East Asian analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven-year period from 1987 to 1993, the U.S. trade imbalance with 
China increased by 700%. But the deficit with what is now commonly called 
"greater China" -- the amalgamation of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- was up by 
a much more modest 20% in the same period, Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA report, released Friday by Congress' Joint Economic Committee, pointed 
to a major change in China's economy last year: Japan, in past years a 
reluctant, cool partner in economic relations with China, has begun 
dramatically increasing sales and investment there. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, China was Japan's fifth-largest trading partner. But in 1993, it shot 
up to second on Japan's list -- behind the United States -- primarily because 
of a huge increase in Japanese exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's sales in China shot up by 45% last year, to $17.3 billion. Some of 
this increase was linked to exports of steel and iron, which more than doubled 
as Japan rushed building materials to help support China's boom in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with Japan, the United States increased its exports to China by a 
much smaller amount, 17%, to $8.8 billion, with airplanes and cars making up 
the largest share of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA said Japan's foreign aid to China helped support the increase in its 
exports. China is now the second-largest recipient of Japanese aid in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although these credits are officially untied (that is, not made conditional 
on the purchase of Japanese products), Japanese firms usually perform the 
feasibility studies for the credits, giving Japan an advantage in the bidding 
process," the CIA concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's exports to China were also helped by a nearly 60% increase in Japanese 
investment in the country last year. The CIA said new projects funded by 
Japanese investment probably helped increase Japanese sales of machinery, 
boilers and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA also reported a huge increase in overall foreign investment in China 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It said China absorbed about $26 billion in foreign funds in 1993, compared 
with $12 billion or so the previous year. Joint ventures and other 
foreign-owned enterprises made up 11% of China's industrial output last year 
and now employ nearly 10 million Chinese workers.

GERMAN LEGISLATURE OKS TROOP ROLE; MILITARY: PARLIAMENT BACKS HIGH COURT RULING 
ON PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS AND BALKAN PATROLS FROM THE SKITTISH NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a specially convened summer session, Parliament on Friday endorsed a 
supreme court decision allowing the German military to take part in 
international peace missions and approved the deployment of troops on NATO air 
and sea patrols in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationally televised vote marked the first time since World War II that 
Parliament has approved use of German troops in combat abroad, although it was 
largely symbolic because Germany joined the missions two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel cautioned that the government does not intend to 
militarize its foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after the ruling, we will stick with our established culture of 
restraint," he told legislators. "Normality in foreign and security policy does 
not mean playing world policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Minister Volker Ruehe added on television that the high court decision 
"is not a marching order for worldwide deployments." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Germany's highest court ruled that the constitution allowed 
federal troops to participate in international military missions with the 
consent of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was in response to actions brought by the opposition Social 
Democratic Party over Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decisions to deploy German ships 
in the Adriatic Sea to help enforce an embargo against the rump Yugoslavia, 
send soldiers on radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and order 
peacekeepers on the ground in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, United Nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organization have 
been urging Germany to play a greater role in international peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, who is seeking a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security Council, has 
agreed that the reunified country must take on more responsibilities in keeping 
with its size and economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans, recalling the country's Nazi history, are nervous about giving a 
higher profile and more power to the military. But Kinkel argued that Germany 
is morally and ethically obligated to participate in peace missions "precisely 
because Germany has broken the peace in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament agreed to the government's request to lift restraints it put on the 
troops monitoring the former Yugoslav federation, giving them the same power as 
their allies to fire on ships in the Adriatic Sea that are suspected of 
breaking the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
 German troops on NATO's AWACS aircraft will also be allowed to fly over 
non-NATO member countries such as Austria and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinkel said that for Germany to participate in future military missions, the 
operations must comply with international law and have a clear mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military mission must be fulfillable, and the military components must be 
part of a convincing concept for a political solution," Kinkel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their court challenge, the Social Democrats voted for approval of the 
troop deployment. They said they only opposed the government's unilateral 
decision to deploy troops and wanted a consultation with the legislature from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "My party takes the view that . . . aggressive states are blocked economically 
and that this blockade should not rest only on resolutions but should be 
supervised and, if necessary, enforced militarily," said Social Democratic 
leader Rudolf Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, we vote for the deployment of troops in the Adriatic Sea," he 
said. "The same is true for the supervision of the protective zones and for the 
enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping is challenging Kohl in the Oct. 16 federal election, and the daylong 
discussion of foreign policy often seemed like a campaign debate.

TERMS RAISED FOR YOUNG KILLERS OF BRITISH CHILD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cabinet minister has nearly doubled the minimum sentence to be served by two 
boys convicted of kidnaping and murdering a 2-year-old boy in a case that 
horrified Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Secretary Michael Howard, after a campaign for longer sentences by the 
victim's parents, set minimum terms of 15 years for Robert Thompson and Jon 
Venables. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, the boys, both 10 at the time, lured James Bulger from a 
shopping center in Liverpool, killed him and left his body on a railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were given indefinite sentences in November, when a judge recommended 
that they serve at least eight years before being considered for release. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph and Denise Bulger, James' parents, were pleased with Howard's action, 
the family's lawyer said.

HAITI REGIME SAYS IT HAS ALLIES IN U.S. CONGRESS; CARIBBEAN: LEADERS BOAST OF 
'BACK CHANNEL' TO DOLE, WHO OPPOSES INVASION. SENATOR CALLS CLAIM 'DELUSIONAL.' 
</P>

<P>
 As the Clinton Administration struggles to persuade Haiti's military rulers to 
step down, the isolated, brutal regime has found comfort and encouragement from 
an unlikely source: members of the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Haitians declared they had a friend in Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who sponsored a resolution to delay any U.S. military action 
against Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a not-so-open connection with Bob Dole . . . , a back 
channel," boasted Bernard Sansari, self-proclaimed president of Haiti's Senate. 
"We see Dole as someone who understands us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole angrily denied any contacts with the Haitian regime and dismissed the 
claim as "delusional." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the thugs running Haiti's illegal government are banking on support from 
me or the Republican Party, they will not get it," he told the Senate. 
Nevertheless, the regime's officials say they still consider him one of their 
best friends in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who overthrew democratically 
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991, latched onto a new "back 
channel" -- Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democratic member of the 
House Intelligence Committee, who met with the general for five hours and 
returned to Washington extolling his virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras is not as intransigent as everybody pictures him to be," Richardson 
said, urging the Administration to seek negotiations. "He feels misunderstood. 
I think he's a realistic person." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration stiffly rejected the idea. "I would hope there is 
flexibility, but the flexibility should translate itself into very simple 
action: They should leave," said Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials were unhappy with Dole and Richardson for a variety 
of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, they complained, the Haitian regime -- and many ordinary Haitians -- 
interpreted the legislators' actions as a form of support for Cedras, even if 
Dole and Richardson didn't mean it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haitians are convinced that the military has friends in Washington who truly 
set the policy and that they are opposed to Aristide -- otherwise, why isn't he 
back here?" one diplomat explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Administration desperately wants to avoid reopening the issue of 
whether the United States should seek a negotiated settlement with Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Dole and Richardson, former President George Bush and other leading 
Republicans have suggested that the Administration should seek negotiations; so 
have some officials in the CIA. But Clinton and his aides have rejected any 
further compromise with the generals. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dole and Richardson said they have tried to avoid any mixed signals that 
might encourage the Haitian regime to dig in its heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Haitians, perhaps indulging in some deliberate wishful thinking, said 
they believed they could rely on significant support in Washington from such 
figures as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Sens. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to see Republicans speaking on our behalf," Sansari said. "Statements 
by Kissinger, Helms, Dole and McCain make us feel at least we are not fighting 
in vain. They at least understand us." 
</P>
<P>
 An Aristide supporter agreed that the military had gained from congressional 
leaders' statements. "Cedras is telling everyone he has protection" in 
Washington, said Sen. Fermin Jean-Louis, who claims that he, not Sansari, is 
the legitimate president of the Haitian Senate. "A lot of soldiers believe the 
United States is bluffing" about an invasion because they believe Cedras, 
Jean-Louis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and Richardson both appear, at least in part, to be victims of the law of 
unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, declaring he went to Haiti only because Cedras invited him, said 
he tried to convince the general that the Administration was serious about 
launching an invasion if the regime clung to power. But the Haitians appear to 
have hoped that the congressman, an expert on intelligence, would instead open 
up a new back channel for talks between Cedras and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dole, the Haitians claim that the senator actively sought Cedras' 
approval for his Senate resolution, which would have set up a 45-day study 
commission on Haiti. According to Haitian Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, a strong 
Cedras supporter, Dole suggested that it would help if Cedras would endorse his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea came from Washington because they know exactly what we want," said 
Sansari, who speaks openly and proudly of his perceived alliances with Dole and 
others in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Cedras' endorsement backfired. Democratic senators cited it as a 
reason to vote against Dole's idea; the Senate rejected the commission plan 
July 14 in a 57-42 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole repeated this week that he neither sought nor wanted Cedras' blessing. 
"This idea was not made in Haiti," he said. "Neither I nor any member of my 
staff has met or communicated with any representative of the Haitian 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior Dole aide acknowledged that he met in Washington last month with 
Pierre Duly Brutus, a member of the Haitian Parliament who has been critical of 
both Cedras and Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to ask him some basic questions," the aide said. "Our proposal was 
being rejected and this was the only way we had of checking whether our 
government was getting the information it needed" to formulate its Haitian 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not discuss Dole's proposal for a bipartisan commission and Brutus 
"got absolutely nothing from me," the aide said. But Brutus did pick up a copy 
of the Dole plan at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- and 
that may be how Dole's proposal reached Haiti.

NIGERIA'S RELUCTANT REBEL TRIGGERS REBIRTH OF PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISM; AFRICA: 
MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER ANNULLED PRESIDENTIAL VOTE, JAILED WINNER SAYS HE'LL NO 
LONGER AVOID CONFRONTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Over breakfast at his sprawling home in Nigeria a few months ago, Moshood K.O. 
Abiola ruminated on his embattled political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillionaire had been chosen Nigeria's president in a free and fair 
election last year. But when the vote was annulled by the military, Abiola, 
fearing a blood bath, opted to avoid confrontation. His decision left the 
democracy movement in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a politician," he explained at the time, pausing to wipe sweat from his 
brow, "not a guerrilla leader." But he said he hoped the new military ruler, 
Gen. Sani Abacha, would have "the wisdom" to relinquish power. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Abiola is in jail, charged with treason. Abacha still clings to power, 
but barely. And Abiola, in a last-ditch effort to claim his rightful place as 
head of Nigeria, has started the uprising he once feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of workers in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and largest oil 
producer, staged a general strike last week, crippling business and 
transportation. In addition, workers in the oil industry, which generates $10 
billion a year in income, continued their strike, which is now in its third 
week. The two largest cities, Lagos and Ibadan, have been paralyzed by 
demonstrations against the government this week, and, according to various 
reports, the number of protesters killed Monday in clashes with police was 
between 10 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the actions, 13 months after the democratic elections, is to force 
military strongman Abacha to hand over power to Abiola. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Abacha has kept a low profile, although his government has issued 
stern warnings that strikes by civil servants and petroleum workers are 
illegal. The government has agreed to meet with its opponents, but the 
general's grand promises of a peaceful return to democracy have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abacha seized power quietly from an army-appointed, token civilian 
president last November, he raised cautious hopes in some quarters. He gave 
some of his political opponents important portfolios in the ruling council. He 
promised to call a nationwide forum for drafting a constitution and then 
forcibly "retired" 17 generals associated with the previous, notoriously 
corrupt regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. 
</P>
<P>
 But as many feared, Abacha has followed instead the tradition of his military 
predecessors: He has arrested journalists and dissidents, closed newspapers and 
dissolved the country's recently elected National Assembly, as well as all 
state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of Abacha's problems now is Abiola, a genial 56-year-old chief 
with a wide following in Nigeria and an impressive international business 
pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among the candidates for president in June, 1993, Abiola was able to 
draw support from a broad spectrum of Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that Abiola is from one of the country's largest, mostly 
Christian ethnic groups in the south. But he himself is a Muslim, a religion he 
shares with the northerners who have ruled the country for most of the three 
decades since it gained its independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is Abiola's personal wealth, which makes him a respected figure 
in a country where such achievements are important, and his reputation for 
honesty, something rare in Nigeria's corrupt society. As Abiola likes to say, 
he doesn't owe anybody anything. And for 20 years he has been courting 
Nigerians from all ethnic groups, giving thousands of scholarships across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "They claim I am a multibillionaire," he said a few months ago. "But I don't 
smile at my bank statement. I use it to build castles in people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola was born on a dirt floor, his parents' 23rd child and the first to 
survive. In fact, his name means: "Let us watch whether this one too will die." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Abiola sold wood to help feed his family. But he won a scholarship 
to school, and his business acumen soon became apparent. From 1972 to 1988, he 
was a vice president of the American communications giant ITT, in charge of 
Africa and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola invested the money he earned from ITT wisely. Today, he owns the 
Concord Press, which includes one of the most popular newspapers in Lagos and 
is run by one of Abiola's four wives. He has an oil exploration firm and a 
24,000-acre farm, which employs 5,000 people, in northern Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives with three of his wives and some of their 27 children on Chief Abiola 
Crescent in Lagos. (His first wife died a few years ago.) Before his arrest, 
his entourage in Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs, including his personal security 
detail, was greeted by cheers everywhere it went in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the former military ruler, Babangida, refused to allow the results of 
last year's election to be released, diplomats and other election observers 
said Abiola was the clear winner. Babangida had done his best to stage-manage 
the election process, creating two parties, writing their platforms and even 
approving the candidates. But when 15 million voters went to the polls, he 
refused to accept their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola was not one of the government opponents who had been jailed off and on 
for years in their push for democracy in Nigeria. In fact, his appeal was that 
he maintained contacts with the wide spectrum of Nigerian politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pro-democracy forces accepted his victory, they were disappointed 
when Abiola shied away from forcing a confrontation with the government over 
the annulled elections. At the time, Abiola said he feared widespread killing. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, pro-democracy riots last July left 168 Nigerians dead. When Abiola 
heard that the government planned to kill him, he went abroad for several 
months, making speeches in international capitals to call on Babangida to 
relinquish power. 
</P>
<P>
 Babangida did step down, in August, but he appointed a feeble interim 
government to run the country. Faced with riots in November over rising 
gasoline prices, the interim government resigned. The coup was staged by 
Abacha, who had helped Babangida take power eight years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, though, many in the pro-democracy movement had given up on 
Abiola. They thought he should have tried to form his own government and force 
Abacha to give in but that, in the end, he didn't have the courage to risk his 
own life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't seem to think of anything to do except wait until he's invited to 
become president," complained Beko Ransome-Kuti, a 53-year-old physician and 
head of the Campaign for Democracy in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Gani Fawehinmi, a widely respected civil rights campaigner: "He went to 
sleep with the mandate. People were prepared to die for him, and he didn't show 
enough courage." 
</P>
<P>
 But Abiola said he was just biding his time. He met several times with Abacha, 
which further upset the democracy activists. And he also launched a campaign, 
speaking out at churches and business functions, demanding that Abacha 
recognize his election victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the verdict of his friends in the democratic movement weighed heavily on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think I sold out," he admitted. "But I haven't sold out. To kiss 
somebody you have to get near them. But to bite him, you have to get near him 
too. And anyway, it would be a foolish man who sits in front of a moving 
train." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently though, Abiola had a change of heart, concluding that "all Abacha 
wants is to be president and stay there," a friend said. So Abiola announced 
his own government Cabinet, saying, "Let the heavens fall," and triggered a 
rebirth of pro-democracy activism across the country of 90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The government responded by arresting dozens, including Ransome-Kuti and, last 
month, Abiola. Ransome-Kuti later was released.  
</P>
<P>
 "The chief just lost confidence in the regime's ability to negotiate a 
transition to power honestly, freely and fairly -- primarily honestly," said 
Randall Echols, Abiola's executive assistant for U.S. affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola, Echols said, "was taking a credibility hit by trying to negotiate with 
the military elite. A lot of people saw it as a sign of weak leadership, and 
they thought perhaps he was in bed with them." 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the end, Echols said, "he responded to the mandate of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 And Abiola's fateful decision has, indeed, pushed the government to the wall, 
raising the specter of spreading civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Nigeria is mired in its deepest depression since the free-spending 
oil boom of the 1970s. Despite its substantial oil reserves, unemployment 
stands at 50%, inflation is running 65%, the country owes $30 billion to 
foreign lenders, and the middle class that once thrived in Nigeria has 
disappeared, leaving a wide gulf between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The corruption that has characterized so many of Nigeria's past military 
dictatorships continues unabated. And the people are fed up with leaders who 
loot the treasury and make hollow promises of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Nigeria," Ransome-Kuti said a few months ago, "it is always the man who 
has eaten who tells the hungry man to be patient."

CHRISTOPHER TO RETURN TO MIDEAST SOON; DIPLOMACY: SECRETARY OF STATE CITES 
PROGRESS BUT WILL REVISIT REGION TO TRY CLOSING SYRIA-ISRAEL GAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by a week of progress on his sixth Mideast peace shuttle, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said Friday that he will return to the region within 
the next three weeks to try to close the still "substantial gap" between Syria 
and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 After talks with President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Christopher said the 
Syrian and Israeli leaders have now passed beyond the initial posturing stage 
and are engaged in negotiating specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to this trip, there was a great deal of psychological testing of one 
party for another, a great deal of who goes first," he said. "They seem to be 
past that now . They're seriously engaged in the key issues like withdrawal, 
timing, phasing, the aspects of peace and security. They're dealing with the 
issues, and both have an attitude to achieve something on this track." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also denied that Assad is now the odd man out in the Middle East 
in light of recent progress between Israel and Jordan and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. "The comprehensiveness of the peace continues to be 
the goal of everyone in the region," he said. And Assad "continues to play a 
central role in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also told reporters en route home that he does not expect a 
breakthrough on the Syrian track, the centerpiece of a comprehensive Mideast 
settlement, in the near future. The Friday session was Christopher's second 
stop in Syria this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At a summit in January, President Clinton and the Syrian leader pledged to try 
to achieve a breakthrough by the year's end. Christopher refused to predict 
Friday whether the deadline would be met. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-controlled Syrian press Friday blamed the United States for the 
absence of major movement. "There is no doubt that the United States holds a 
responsibility for the lack of progress in the peace talks because it did not 
exert enough efforts to stop Israel's disregard of international will," the 
government daily Al Thawra said. The criticism was in stark contrast to upbeat 
editorials during Christopher's first visit Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in peace tracks with Jordan and the Palestinians, the U.S. team has 
vowed not to disclose details of Syrian and Israeli positions because of their 
sensitive nature. Both governments are believed to face significant domestic 
opposition to terms for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have said their initial offer centered on a three-stage, 
land-for-peace swap involving the strategic Golan Heights, which Israel 
captured in 1967 and annexed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest stumbling blocks are Israel's insistence on full normalization of 
relations, borders and trade from the start of a deal and Syria's demand that 
Israel first pledge to return all of the Golan Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 On the topic of the latest, apparently failed peace effort for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Christopher said the United States expects Russia to use 
its influence and special relationship with the rebel Bosnian Serbs to pressure 
them to reverse their position and accept unconditionally the international 
peace plan before July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked by telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. He 
said the Russian government pledged to take "special measures" to contact the 
Bosnian Serbs before the five world powers who had sought to mediate a peace in 
Bosnia meet in Geneva to discuss punitive measures against the Bosnian Serbs 
for rejecting the partition plan.

QUESTIONS STILL LACK ANSWERS IN COLOSIO PROBE; MEXICO: NEW PROSECUTOR WILL HAVE 
TO PROVE TO A SKEPTICAL PUBLIC THAT SHE IS NOT PART OF A COVER-UP. MANY DOUBT 
'LONE ASSASSIN' THEORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a Spartan meeting room overlooking the colonial patio of the Mexican Senate 
building, a congressional committee charged with following the investigation 
into the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio listened 
attentively. Dr. Rafael Moreno, the attorney general's head of criminology, was 
outlining the questions that he said any crime investigation must answer: 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened? . . . Who is the murderer? Who is the victim? . . . When did 
it happen? . . . How? . . . Where? . . . What weapon was used? And finally, 
why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, early this month, Moreno and a dozen other forensics experts 
signed off on a report on Colosio's murder that, for most Mexicans, left many 
of those questions without credible answers. 
</P>
<P>
 People simply do not believe their conclusion that accused killer Mario Aburto 
Martinez was the classic lone assassin, a deranged dissident determined to make 
his mark on history. In the national uproar that followed, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari ordered the investigation reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Islas, the new special prosecutor Salinas appointed, faces the daunting 
challenge of proving to a conspiracy-minded public that she is not 
participating in a cover-up by hard-line members of Colosio's own ruling party, 
drug traffickers or someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not saying that there was a mastermind, just that the conclusions should 
be reached after a serious investigation," said Juan Velazquez, an attorney 
representing Colosio's widow, Diana Laura Riojas. "All I am doing is asking for 
an investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, Velazquez and Riojas are exercising her rights under Mexican law, 
which grants the victim's family a standing equal to that of the defense or 
prosecution. The fragile-looking mother of two young children has become the 
voice for Mexicans demanding justice.  
</P>
<P>
 "They should talk with Mr. Aburto's family; they should look into the 
references to third persons in his writing," said Velazquez. "They should 
investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's father, who lives in San Pedro, was subpoenaed to testify last week 
about his allegations that his son, a 23-year-old factory worker, met with 
three members of Colosio's security team -- who are now imprisoned as suspected 
plotters -- and other security agents in the months before the slaying. "That 
certainly brings into question the theory that Mario acted alone," said Peter 
Schey, attorney for the Aburto family. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents recently told The Times that their son had once applied to work as 
a state judicial police officer, and said he complained in the days before the 
assassination that he was being followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides talking with the family, it also appears likely that the new special 
prosecutor will attempt to retrace Aburto's steps in Tijuana, where the murder 
occurred -- a task that did not appear to have been done thoroughly during the 
first probe. There are accounts that Aburto grew increasingly moody and 
withdrawn in the final weeks, that he was dressing better and other signs that 
he was coming into money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new leads are expected from the panel of five legal experts who are 
reviewing the original investigation's 284 interviews, 29 technical studies, 80 
videotapes and 1,621 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the lingering questions the new prosecutor must answer are basic: The 
investigation has revealed that there was a far more extensive security force 
from an array of government and private agencies than anyone suspected. 
However, investigators have offered little explanation for how a presidential 
candidate could be shot in the head at point-blank range in the midst of nearly 
70 security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 And she will be expected to sort through conflicting interpretations of 
existing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, repeated viewings of the videotapes recording the murder have 
produced starkly different versions of what happened. Like Aburto's writings, 
the tapes were first submitted to a judge as evidence of a conspiracy that 
landed the three Colosio security agents in prison, accused of clearing a path 
in a crowd for the gunman. Later, the prosecutor dismissed the tapes as 
inconclusive and cited the writings as proof that Aburto acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Islas' role is crucial, because investigators' failure so far to answer the 
public's questions has raised the specter of a dark force behind the killing 
that overshadows next month's presidential election and casts suspicion on 
every decision made in the Byzantine world of Mexican politics. Officials at 
the highest levels of government are rumored to be disturbed by fears that the 
slaying may have been directed by a disenchanted faction of the ruling elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the controversy surrounds Aburto himself: his treatment by the Mexican 
justice system, his writings and statements about mysterious political 
activities with influential people, and what some describe as changing and 
secretive behavior in the weeks before the slaying . 
</P>
<P>
 In confessions and news interviews, Aburto has declared that he only meant to 
wound the candidate and denied that the other accused suspects were involved -- 
although witnesses say he hinted in his first confession that he had 
confederates. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, family and acquaintances say Aburto talked repeatedly about 
attending political meetings -- reportedly boasting that he was paid to do so 
-- and alluded to a mysterious political "project." His address book contained 
the address and phone number of an elderly Tijuana leader of a faction of the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, and information about 
when the group met. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did not interview that political leader, Blas Manrique, until 
three months after the assassination -- and have not explained the entry in the 
address book. When legislators asked former special prosecutor Miguel Montes 
Garcia last month whether he had spoken with all the people listed in Aburto's 
address book, he told them the investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Manrique told The Times in an interview that he never met Aburto, but 
suggested the young man may have been a government informer. "Maybe he was 
working for the police," Manrique said. 
</P>
<P>
 That speculation is echoed by others, who suggest that the ambitious young 
laborer fits the classic profile of a domestic political spy used to infiltrate 
opposition groups, operatives known in Mexico as orejas , ears. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a scenario described by one Baja California government official, 
who asked not to be named, Aburto could have been recruited into an 
assassination plot after being cultivated as an informer. 
</P>
<P>
 Theorists further cite the allegations by family members that Aburto was 
friendly with an Interior Ministry agent, Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who was 
present at Colosio's murder. He was investigated because his hands tested 
positive for having fired a gun and his shirt was stained with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sanchez Ortega was cleared, his actions at the fateful campaign rally 
may well be reviewed as part of the renewed inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes told the members of Congress that his questioning of Aburto had been 
limited because when he took over the case on March 28, the suspect had already 
been turned over to the court system. At that point, all questioning must be 
done in public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Aburto's family has complained that he is being held practically 
incommunicado. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey said he has been assured that under Mexican law, Aburto has the right to 
choose his own attorney. However, the family's requests for him to see a 
lawyer, doctor or even them have been met with a wall of bureaucratic 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor referred them to the judge, who referred them to the prison 
authorities, who have not responded to calls or faxes, Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want independent lawyers to visit him, they don't want family 
members to talk with him, they don't want doctors to examine him," Schey 
concluded.

 The 13,000-foot Colima volcano in western Mexico erupted in a towering cloud 
of ash and rocks that forced those living near the flanks to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries or deaths were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs of new volcanic activity emerged Friday and about 500 people returned 
home following the Thursday night scare. 
</P>

2 MISSING ARAB ENVOYS IN ALGERIA FOUND UNHARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Arab ambassadors were found unharmed Friday, a week after they were 
reported kidnaped, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Found with the ambassadors of Oman and Yemen were a Moroccan driver and 
another Yemenite, according to security sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment on how and where they were located. 
</P>
<P>
 The four disappeared July 15, adding to a climate of fear among foreigners 
prompted by the murder this month of 14 Italians and East Europeans by Islamic 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The car that had been carrying ambassadors Hilal ibn Salem ibn Hamoud Siyabi 
of Oman and Qassem Askar Gibran of Yemen was found gutted by fire in an Islamic 
fundamentalist stronghold near the Algiers airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The respected Algerian daily El Watan had speculated that the abduction could 
be linked to Yemen's recent civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibran was a supporter of the southern separatists who lost the war and was 
likely to be relieved of his post, El Watan reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab diplomats said Mohammed Qassem Essour, a friend of Gibran and a leading 
member of the separatist Yemeni Socialist Party, was the other Yemenite. 
</P>
<P>
 No ransom demand was made, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility, and representatives abroad of the 
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front condemned the act.

VENEZUELA ONCE AGAIN SUSPENDS KEY CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defying Congress, the government Friday again suspended key constitutional 
freedoms one day after legislators ordered them restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Ruben Creixems said the government was lifting protection 
against arbitrary search or arrest, the right to travel freely, the right to 
private property and protection against expropriation without proper 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 President Rafael Caldera first suspended these rights June 27, arguing that 
his government needed the muscle to suppress speculation and subversion that 
were destabilizing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition parties banded together late Thursday to restore the 
guarantees, saying there was no evidence of a conspiracy against democracy and 
accusing the government of abusing its power in raids to round up alleged 
subversives.

GUATEMALAN POLICE FIND BODIES OF 1,000 WAR DEAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have discovered about 1,000 charred bodies of men, women and children 
who apparently died in the civil war violence that swept Guatemala in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains were discovered in the remote Playa Grande region, about 100 miles 
north of the capital and about 12 miles south of the Mexican border, police 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was by far the largest in a series of recent discoveries of graves of 
victims of the 34-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 A local police station in Playa Grande reported the discovery by telegram to 
the National Police station in Coban, capital of Alta Verapaz province. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no word about who had killed the people or how the remains were 
buried, but the report said they were discovered in four locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The army conducted a scorched-earth campaign against the rebels during the 
early 1980s, when a large proportion of the war's 120,000 victims died. The 
campaign largely broke the back of the rebel movement but at a huge cost in 
civilian lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recently exhumed 18 bodies of people slain during a 1982 massacre in 
La Libertad, about 70 miles northeast of Playa Grande in Peten province. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six more bodies, victims of a July, 1982, massacre, were discovered in 
the town of Rabinal, 30 miles north of the capital, according to the federal 
human rights office.

PANEL WITHHELD NAVY CHIEF'S TIES TO S&L; CONGRESS: FULL SENATE WAS NOT TOLD OF 
NOMINEE'S INVOLVEMENT WITH FAILED INSTITUTION BEFORE VOTE TO CONFIRM HIM. NUNN 
SAYS IT WAS A CONFIDENTIAL ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday that it did not tell the full 
Senate about John H. Dalton's involvement with a failed savings and loan when 
it recommended his nomination as secretary of the Navy last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the panel's chairman, said in an interview that the 
committee did not make the issue public because it was part of a routine FBI 
background investigation that the lawmakers had promised to keep confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said the committee examined the evidence in a closed session before it 
voted on the nomination and decided that Dalton's involvement amounted to a 
"bad business situation" that would "not be disqualifying." It then recommended 
him unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the exception of the 22 members of the Armed Services Committee, 
the Senate was not aware of Dalton's S&L dealings when it confirmed his 
nomination without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy emerged after the New York Times reported on Friday that 
before his nomination, Dalton had been president of a Texas S&L that went 
bankrupt in 1988, requiring a taxpayer rescue that cost $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case ended in a $3.8-million settlement that avoided any civil 
charges, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. initially threatened to charge 
Dalton and other Seguin Savings Assn. officials with "breach of fiduciary duty, 
negligence . . . (and) violations of state and federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton denied any wrongdoing, both to the committee last July and to reporters 
on Friday, contending that the S&L's failure stemmed from an abrupt drop in oil 
prices, which led to a collapse of the real estate market in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Friday's disclosure renewed complaints by some lawmakers and 
outside critics that the Senate's procedures for handling such reports in 
closed session -- and often not making other senators aware of potential 
problems before they vote -- are badly in need of overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Dalton case, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of 
the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said that he was 
uncomfortable when he heard about the omission. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the relevant information should be brought to the table," Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure of leaving such decisions to the committee that handles a 
nomination has been a standard practice in the Senate for years. In some cases, 
when a report is considered especially sensitive, a committee chairman may 
decide to keep the allegations to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just such a situation that backfired in 1992 when Sen. Joseph R. Biden 
Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, decided not to tell 
members of his committee about sexual-harassment charges involving then-Supreme 
Court nominee Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Thomas case, the report was leaked to National Public Radio, which 
broadcast the allegations, forcing the Judiciary Committee to conduct public 
hearings at which University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Faye Hill made her 
allegations. Thomas' nomination, however, was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the revival of the Dalton allegations on Friday, Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry, returning home from a weeklong trip to the Balkans, moved to 
reaffirm his support for the Navy secretary, saying that he had "established a 
record of integrity and good character." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nunn, defending the current procedure for handling such cases, pointed out 
that much of the information in FBI reports is either hearsay or 
unsubstantiated. If lawmakers did not agree to keep it confidential, he said, 
"we'd have a hard time filling (government) slots." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its other allegations, the FDIC contended that Dalton and other 
officers of the S&L had pursued "a negligent course of conduct" that "caused 
(it) to fail," according to court documents the agency filed at the time of the 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 It also listed a variety of bad loans that had been financed by Seguin 
Savings. In one case, the S&L loaned $8.9 million to a land developer without 
verifying an unaudited financial statement in which he claimed to be worth $6.9 
million. The man later declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, experts familiar with FDIC procedures said that the agency routinely 
uses such language when it hopes to prod S&L officers into agreeing to a 
settlement and it pressed no criminal charges in the Dalton case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, 52, a San Antonio businessman, was an instrumental figure in President 
Clinton's Texas campaign during the 1992 election. He also is a friend of 
former San Antonio Mayor Henry G. Cisneros, who currently is serving as 
transportation secretary.

GOP QUESTIONS LEGALITY OF CLINTON'S DEFENSE FUND; INQUIRY: AS WHITEWATER 
HEARINGS NEAR, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ASK ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DETERMINE IF GIFT BAN 
IS BEING VIOLATED. RENO DENIES REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Days before congressional hearings into the Whitewater case, House Republican 
leaders on Friday asked the Justice Department to explain the legal basis for 
President Clinton's defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP lawmakers, in a letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, said that the fund 
appears to violate a ban on the President receiving gifts, except for those of 
"protocol and etiquette" traditionally given to a head of state. Exceptions to 
this ban do not allow gifts of cash to be solicited, they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican request will go unfilled, however. A Justice Department 
official said that a response was being sent to the congressmen explaining that 
the attorney general does not provide legal opinions to anyone outside the 
executive branch. The official noted that the White House considers the defense 
fund to be legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his wife, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, announced the 
fund last month to cover what they said could be legal bills as high as $2 
million a year to defend themselves in the Whitewater inquiry and a sexual 
harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones. Both matters 
occurred before Clinton's inauguration in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican letter was signed by House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of 
Illinois, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. Containing a list of 13 questions 
about the fund, it asked Reno for her "written assurances" that the fund is 
legally permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter said that the Justice Department during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration issued an opinion telling White House employees that they could 
not accept free or discounted legal services. Republican lawmakers suggested 
that there was no "ethical distinction" between this prohibition and the 
Clinton defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate response to requests for comment from the White House 
counsel's office. But Michael H. Cardozo, a Washington attorney and former 
State Department lawyer who helped establish the fund, said that all the 
questions raised by the GOP lawmakers "were carefully considered by the legal 
advisers" who worked to set it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the trust fund more than meets all applicable legal statutes 
as well as ethical and administrative standards of conduct," Cardozo said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Whitewater inquiry, the Clintons have hired private attorneys because 
of the federal investigation of activities surrounding Whitewater Development 
Corp., an Ozarks real estate company in which they were partners while Clinton 
was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones lawsuit, filed in federal court in Little Rock earlier this year, 
alleges that while Jones was a state employee in 1991, then-Gov. Clinton made 
an unwanted sexual advance that caused her emotional distress and violated her 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense fund is the first for a sitting President. Former President 
Richard Nixon accepted donations to help cover some legal bills after he left 
office, but he paid the bulk of his legal fees himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton fund, with a list of prominent Americans as trustees, is formally 
known as the Presidential Legal Expense Trust Fund. It is structured as a 
grantor trust to protect the Clintons from having to pay gift taxes. 
Solicitations will be made to individuals only and their names will be made 
public, the White House has said. The maximum contribution will be $1,000.

POLICE SEARCH FOR GIRL, 8, APPARENTLY TAKEN FROM BED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and bloodhounds searched Friday for an 8-year-old girl apparently taken 
from her mother's bed by someone who forced his way into the apartment through 
a window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Amaro's abduction would be the second such incident in Orange County in 
a month. A 7-year-old girl was carried out of her bed in Tustin on June 30, but 
family members gave chase and forced the abductor to release her. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole was last seen about 10 a.m. in her mother's bedroom, wearing a green 
bathrobe, a white T-shirt and underwear. She is blonde with brown eyes, 4 feet 
tall and 45 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's mother, Lori Amaro, 29, had been driven to work in Los Angeles on 
Friday morning by her boyfriend, Robert Granger, 34, police said. When Granger 
returned to the apartment he shares with Amaro about 10 a.m., he noticed Nicole 
asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger and Nicole's 10-year-old brother, Tommy, were in and out of the 
two-bedroom apartment for the next 1 1/2 hours. When Granger checked the 
bedroom again about 11:30 a.m., he noticed Nicole missing and signs of a 
break-in, said Sylvia Palmer, a police spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger told police he searched in vain for the child and then called the 
mother about 1:30 p.m., Palmer said. The mother arrived at the house about 2:30 
p.m. Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also noticed there appeared to be some valuables missing, jewelry, a 
handgun and one of those little portable fire safes, more like a locked box," 
Fullerton Police Lt. Tony Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 police officers using three bloodhounds searched the neighborhood 
surrounding the 88-unit apartment complex in the 2400 block of West 
Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it appeared that someone came in through the window of the 
mother's bedroom, which opens onto an alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Rawlings, manager of Regency Villas, said: "I personally don't believe 
that Nicki would run away with someone she didn't know." Rawlings, who spoke 
with Nicole's mother throughout the day, said she's "holding up under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County cases follow the kidnaping and murder of Polly Klaas last 
fall.

ALTMAN DIARY TO FIGURE IN WHITEWATER HEARINGS; PROBE: DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY 
EMERGES AS FOCUS OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS BEGINNING NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman kept a diary that contains embarrassing 
references to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's anger over Whitewater 
disclosures and describes her as furious that her husband appointed a special 
counsel to investigate the tangled financial affair, congressional and other 
sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat serving as one of the 
Administration's point men for the Whitewater hearings getting under way in 
Congress next week, disclosed the existence of the Altman diary to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank did so as the President's congressional allies sought to lessen the 
expected impact of new Whitewater revelations by unveiling them before the 
hearings start. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was apparently nothing in the diary's references to Mrs. Clinton 
that suggested any wrongdoing, they did shed more light on the way the scrutiny 
had preoccupied the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, the only Administration official known to have kept a 
Whitewater-related diary was Joshua Steiner, chief of staff to Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner's private journal reportedly contains references to some of the 
controversial contacts between White House aides and department officials 
overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp. investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings 
& Loan, a failed Little Rock, Ark., thrift that was owned by the Clintons' 
partner in the Whitewater land venture. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank revealed at a breakfast meeting with reporters that Altman also kept 
a private journal and that it contained possibly embarrassing references to 
Mrs. Clinton's "personal state of mind," describing her as being "upset" and 
"distracted" by the activities of special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who took 
charge of the Whitewater investigation in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Clinton wasn't thrilled with the idea of (the special counsel) 
investigating everything she had ever done," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials stressed that Mrs. Clinton was not upset with Fiske 
personally, but with the idea that her family's personal finances should be 
subject to scrutiny by a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official reacted with surprise when told that Frank 
had disclosed the existence of the diary, but he also confirmed that the 
lawmaker's description of it was generally correct. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other sources said that the White House has provided congressional 
investigators only a heavily censored version of Altman's diary that did not 
contain any references to Mrs. Clinton personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about reports that the diary had been censored, Frank said later that he 
had not read it but had been provided with "the three or four juiciest 
excerpts" and was basing his evaluation of its contents on them. Those 
excerpts, he said, are not to be made public in next week's hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the White House had been stunned by Frank's remarks, another 
senior Administration source said he thought that the lawmaker may have 
"received information about the contents of the diary that goes beyond" what 
the office of White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler has provided to congressional 
investigators in censored form. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests, one White House source added, that Frank had seen uncensored 
excerpts of the journal, which other sources described as not so much a formal 
diary as a collection of notes and impressions about other Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman did not respond to requests for comment but the senior economic 
adviser, who at one time was considered to be the most influential man at the 
Treasury Department, was clearly emerging as the main focus of the hearings 
opening Tuesday in the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and 
next Friday in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings are expected to last about a week each and, by prior agreement 
with Fiske, will focus only on the two narrow aspects of the Whitewater 
controversy that the special counsel has finished investigating. Those are the 
suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster a year ago and the 
possibly improper contacts between White House aides and Treasury Department 
officials who were overseeing the RTC's investigation of allegations that the 
Whitewater Development Corp. may have been used to illegally siphon funds away 
from Madison Guaranty, which cost taxpayers an estimated $47 million when it 
went bankrupt in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske said he found no evidence that anyone at the White House or the Treasury 
Department sought to impede the RTC's investigation illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said that Altman had turned into "the main target" for 
Republican members of the banking committees. Altman became the focal point 
after Treasury counsel Jean Hanson gave a deposition to the Senate committee 
last week that contradicted Altman's earlier testimony before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman told the Senate committee that he did not learn until March of this 
year that Hanson had alerted the White House some six months earlier about the 
RTC's plans. Hanson had told the White House that the RTC intended to seek a 
Justice Department investigation of Madison Guaranty and of the possibility 
that the Clintons, through their Whitewater connection with its owner, James B. 
McDougal, may have been beneficiaries of criminal activities related to its 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanson, in her deposition last week, said that she alerted the White House 
about the RTC's plans after Altman told her to do so in the fall of 1993. In a 
statement issued Friday, Altman acknowledged that he and Hanson have differing 
recollections of events. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fiske has said that he found no evidence of any criminal conduct in 
either Altman's or Hanson's actions, a Democratic House source conceded that 
Altman has "some heavy-duty explaining to do" and will be in for some tough 
questioning in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that he took no actions to impede the investigation, but he 
wasn't as open about his conversations with people as he should have been," 
Frank said. "I don't know at this point whether he lied or withheld, but he did 
not seem to give a complete accounting of his conversations" when he testified 
before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank added, however, that he thought these discrepancies would be the worst 
thing to come out at the congressional hearings. He predicted the hearings 
would be anticlimactic.

 A South Carolina mail carrier confessed to throwing away mail he would not 
have been able to deliver on time, local radio and television reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials said the part-time mail carrier told them he discarded the 
mail on July 6 because he could not finish his route on time. The man was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 A jogger spotted the bundles of mail along a wooded area Tuesday and called 
postal officials. They confronted the employee at his home, where he confessed 
to dumping more than 500 pieces of mail, and immediately resigned.

ENTREPRENEUR TAKES AIM AT FASHION TREND; BUSINESS: NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN SELLS 
BULLET-RIDDLED CLOTHING AS A LARK. BUT HE'S UNDER FIRE BY THOSE WHO OBJECT TO 
HIS HIGH-CALIBER STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an especially hot summer day, and Frank Allgeyer had worked up quite a 
sweat out there at the sandpit, shooting holes in T-shirts with his MAC-10 
automatic submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and there also were bullet-riddled jeans and jackets, all victims this 
scorching Friday of Allgeyer's unerring trigger finger and shrewd fashion 
marksmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who'd have thought?" said the 44-year-old carpenter, now the corporate 
sharpshooter behind the sights of Drive-By Fashions, a one-month-old enterprise 
that will "custom-perforate" your favorite jeans, T-shirts or denim jackets. "I 
mean, this whole thing started out as a goof." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Granite State politicians were less than amused. New Hampshire Atty. 
Gen. Jeffrey R. Howard called a news conference Wednesday to denounce what he 
feared was a potentially dangerous teen-age fashion trend. He was joined by a 
Democratic state senator, Barbara Baldizar, who worried that children might 
"take guns and try to shoot their own holes in clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did the two state officials realize that Allgeyer and his best friend, 
Steve Holden, also a carpenter, had dreamed up Drive-By Fashions on a fishing 
day when nothing was biting. Talking about how ridiculous it was that people 
actually paid good money for pants with holes and slashes in them, the pair 
began speculating about the limits of couture correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a 'Saturday Night Live' skit," said Holden, 42. "We were out 
there in a boat, and we're thinking, 'Yeah, maybe we should throw some grenades 
at a pile of T-shirts."' 
</P>
<P>
 Holden went so far as to dare his friend to run with what both admitted was a 
ludicrous idea. In a black-bordered two-by-four-inch advertisement in the 
Manchester Union Leader, Allgeyer proved he was a better fiction writer than 
fisherman. "Looking for that unique gift for the person who has everything?" he 
wrote. "Clothes with bullet holes are big on the West Coast now." 
</P>
<P>
 A mailing address and price list followed. 
</P>
<P>
 So did a firestorm that Allgeyer said he was completely unprepared for. Along 
with his political strafing, Allgeyer was shrapneled in a Boston Globe 
editorial Friday berating him for a "tacky, tasteless fashion scam" that 
promotes violence in a country where every day 42 people are killed by 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco psychologist Ross E. Goldstein, president of a trend-watching 
organization called Generation Insights Inc., termed those reactions "another 
example of people trying to set social policy by quick and easy sloganing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like magic," he went on, "this idea that we will ban the most visible 
symptom and thus stop the cause. The problem is not fashions with bullet holes, 
the problem is much deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Millstein, a fashion analyst in New York, said bullet-riddled clothing no 
more condoned violence than military surplus attire could be viewed as "a 
statement of support for the armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind that in Beverly Hills or the East Village, they 
would find a host of fashion flakes and fashion savants who would want to wear 
these kinds of things," Millstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allgeyer, a native of a state where green flies pose a greater menace than 
gang warfare, said he could not understand why anyone in Southern California 
would want to buy his product anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "In L.A., from what I understand, all you have to do is hang a bag of laundry 
on your porch in the morning, and by afternoon, you'll have drive-by fashions," 
Allgeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Course," he added, tongue planted firmly in cheek, "then you wouldn't have 
the certificate of authenticity." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that if current projections hold true, New Hampshire will have an 
annual homicide rate of 12 for all of 1994, Allgeyer stressed that "this was 
never meant to be mean-spirited or to promote gang violence or anything like 
that. I can't emphasize that enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he found it ironic that in a state known for its panther-like 
protection of individual liberties, his T-shirt company would suddenly become a 
cause celebre. New Hampshire takes seriously the phrase "Live Free or Die" 
emblazoned on its license plates, Allgeyer noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have the attorney general, the defender of peoples' rights, and he's 
walking all over my First Amendment rights," Allgeyer said. "We don't even have 
a line of clothing in stores, and he's trying to get us banned from schools in 
September." 
</P>
<P>
 The venture has hardly been a financial gold mine, either. In one month, 
Allgeyer has "custom-perforated" about 35 garments that have been sent to him. 
Prices range from $15 to $35, and customers can select how many rounds of 
ammunition they want, as well as the type of firearm. Most, he said, opt for 
"the flagship of the fleet," the machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 All of his weapons are fully licensed, Allgeyer said, explaining that after he 
has paid for the ammunition and the gas he uses to drive out to the local 
sandpit, where the shooting is conducted, "I'm probably making about $6 an 
hour. I make more than that pounding nails." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Drive-By Fashions does turn a profit, Allgeyer has pledged to donate 
some of his earnings to anti-violence groups or drug rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he expressed amazement that even three dozen people would spend money on 
the shoot-'em-up look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I started out goofing on everybody," Allgeyer said. "I'm still goofing 
on everybody. And now the politicians are goofing on themselves."

COCHRAN'S CASES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who has joined O.J. Simpson's defense team, has been 
involved in several high-profile cases. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leonard Deadwyler: He was rushing his pregnant wife to the hospital when he 
was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police officer in a routine traffic stop 
in 1966.Cochran, representing the man's family, contended that the officer had 
grossly overreacted. Cochran's firm lost the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Settles: In 1981, the Cal State Long Beach football star was found 
hanged in his cell in the Signal Hill jail after being arrested on speeding 
charges. Signal Hill officials maintained that Settles hanged himself. A 
coroner's jury found that Settles' death had come "at the hands of another." 
His family was awarded $760,000 in a wrongful death suit settled in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * Todd Bridges: In 1990, Cochran successfully defended the actor, who was 
acquitted on charges of shooting a drug dealer eight times in a South-Central 
Los Angeles house used for cocaine sales.  
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Jackson: In 1993, Cochran joined the defense team representing the 
pop star, who was facing a civil lawsuit and criminal investigations stemming 
from allegations that he had sexually molested a boy. The lawsuit was settled 
in January, reportedly for $15 million to $24 million.  
</P>
<P>
 * Reginald O. Denny: The trucker's lawsuit alleges that the city violated the 
civil rights of Denny and two others by pulling police forces out of a 
neighborhood where rioting erupted April 29, 1992. The case is still pending.

BROWN TO OFFER BILL BARRING WITNESSES FROM SELLING TESTIMONY BEFORE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troubled that witnesses in the O.J. Simpson case have sold their stories to 
tabloid publications and television programs, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
says he will introduce legislation that would bar material witnesses in any 
criminal case from selling their testimony until after a trial is over. 
</P>
<P>
 In a radio address scheduled for broadcast today, the San Francisco Democrat 
said violators of his proposed law would be required to forfeit any money they 
have received and, in addition, pay a substantial fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In his prerecorded statement, Brown described his dismay at the extensive 
media attention given to the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum, we must wonder how in the aftermath of such intense media 
coverage, there could possibly be 12 impartial jurors left in the city of Los 
Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that intense attention is almost inevitable in such a high-profile 
case, Brown said he is most troubled by "the specter of witnesses who have sold 
their testimony for a fee." 
</P>

publicity, but "second and more importantly, it intrudes upon the judicial

DOROTHY COLLINS; SINGER ON TV'S 'YOUR HIT PARADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Collins, the "Lucky Strike Girl" on television's "Your Hit Parade" and 
later one of the performers who confounded unsuspecting victims on "Candid 
Camera," has died at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Holgate, her ex-husband, said Collins died Thursday night. The cause of 
death was unknown, but a heart attack was suspected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been sick for a very long time," Holgate said. He said she had asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who sang on the radio with big bands when she was a teen-ager, landed 
a job in the 1950s selling Lucky Strike cigarettes on "Your Hit Parade." Placed 
in the middle of the Lucky Strike bulls-eye, Collins would sing the jingle "Be 
happy, go Lucky." She later sang weekly top hits on the show and became one of 
its stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Hit Parade," a spinoff of radio's "Lucky Strike Hit Parade," ran from 
1950 to 1959. The TV show featured elaborate production numbers of the week's 
seven most popular songs, with a regular buildup to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Collins appeared frequently on Allen Funt's "Candid Camera," 
setting up gags on unwitting victims. One memorable stunt was the time she 
innocently asked men to help her with a car that wouldn't start, and they would 
lift the hood and find no engine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, she appeared on Broadway in the Stephen Sondheim hit musical 
"Follies," about aging showgirls in a soon-to-be-demolished Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
 She also appeared in a number of other musicals, including "South Pacific" and 
"My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 She spent years working as a volunteer for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., and 
appeared frequently on its Labor Day weekend telethons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her role as a Lucky Strike pitch woman, Collins never smoked, Holgate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins was born Nov. 18, 1926, in Windsor, Canada. She got her first break in 
the late 1940s as a singer for bandleader Raymond Scott, whom she later 
married. He was musical director of the "Hit Parade." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins had lived for the past 1 1/2 years with her daughter in Watervliet, 
just north of Albany. She died at home there. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral plans were incomplete.

HUGH SCOTT; SENATE GOP LEADER DURING WATERGATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Scott, who served as Republican leader in the Senate during the Watergate 
years, has died at 93. He had represented Pennsylvania in Congress, as a House 
member and senator, for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott died Thursday of cardiac arrest in a retirement home in Falls Church, 
Va., a Washington suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died peacefully in his sleep," said his longtime secretary, Janet Horgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was elected to the House of Representatives in 1940 and to the Senate in 
1958. He served three Senate terms. His tenure as minority leader began in 1969 
when Richard Nixon became president. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon resigned in 1974; Scott remained in the Senate until his retirement in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 On Watergate, Scott often urged Nixon to come clean to save his presidency. 
Scott said in December, 1973, that Nixon would not get out of the Watergate 
"mess" unless he fulfilled a promise to disclose all records and tape 
recordings related to the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in 1974, Scott urged Pennsylvanians to remember that "the horrible, 
shabby and most unfortunate Watergate mess was not the doing of the Republican 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 While a member of the House, representing Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional 
District, Scott served as chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely pictured without a pipe in his mouth, the partisan but affable Scott 
was a calming influence on his party during the years of Vietnam War protests 
and Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 A native Virginian who moved to Philadelphia after law school, he was at once 
staunchly supportive of the GOP and able to forge alliances with Democrats and 
change with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, as chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1948, Scott 
rallied fiercely against Democratic "commie coddling" and "big government." Two 
decades later, he proposed a joint U.S.-Soviet space venture and later he and 
Democratic Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey met with Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was a staunch supporter of the Vietnam War during the terms of 
Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, but parted with the Nixon 
Administration by calling for a unilateral U.S. cease-fire in 1969. He later 
modified his stance to say he was interested in a mutual cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have anything in my life to be proud of if I hadn't had many an 
occasion to grow and to change my mind," Scott said in a 1984 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott had a penchant for turning an acerbic phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 During his Senate years, he accused Alabama Gov. George Wallace of practicing 
"jackassery" on civil rights. Nearing 70 years old, he told a Democratic 
challenger in 1970 to "come down here and see if he can keep up with me." 
</P>
<P>
 After serving eight terms in the House, Scott was elected to the Senate in 
1958 and reelected in 1964 and 1970. He decided not to seek reelection in 1976 
under the cloud of a Senate probe into allegations that he received illegal 
cash contributions from Gulf Oil Co.

JUNE 7 TURNOUT IS A RECORD LOW FOR STATEWIDE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's voter turnout for the June 7 primary was the lowest ever for a 
statewide election, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just under 5 million of the state's 14 million registered voters participated 
in the primary -- a dismal 35% showing, Miller said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, voters are tuning out in record numbers, turned off by politics and 
politicians," Miller said. Campaign reform, including limits on contributions, 
will be necessary to bring them back to the voting booth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage was lower than the turnout for California's special elections 
in 1973, 1979 and 1993, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4.96 million voters who went to the polls in June represent only 26% of 
the nearly 19 million Californians eligible to vote. They decided the fates of 
776 candidates for state office, nine statewide ballot measures and numerous 
local races, Miller said.

SACRAMENTO FILE: WILSON SIGNS BILL ELIMINATING MANDATORY PREMARITAL BLOOD TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marriage license applicants no longer will be required to take expensive blood 
tests to check for syphilis and rubella under legislation signed into law by 
Gov. Pete Wilson that goes into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the tests, which can cost up to $140, have not been effective in 
identifying cases of syphilis and rubella, which the governor said are no 
longer considered serious health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), author of the legislation (AB 
3128), said syphilis has been effectively treated by penicillin for the past 50 
years and that rubella immunization programs now reach about 95% of the married 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seeking public marriages in California are forced to spend over $20 
million annually on blood tests for diseases that are no longer public health 
problems," Speier said. "Premarital blood testing, once a justifiable 
tradition, has become an unnecessary drain on personal finances."

SCIENTIFIC FRAUD SUIT TO BE SETTLED FOR $1.6 MILLION; WHISTLE-BLOWERS: UC WILL 
PAY $625,000 OVER CHARGES THAT RESEARCHER FAKED DATA TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first scientific fraud case settled under federal whistle-blower laws, 
the University of California and another major college will pay nearly $1.6 
million to settle charges that a former researcher faked results in a federally 
funded project, Justice Department officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 UC has agreed to pay $625,000 and the University of Utah has agreed to pay 
$950,000 to settle a federal lawsuit alleging that John L. Ninnemann, an 
immunology researcher, obtained National Institutes of Health funding by 
falsifying data on a project investigating immune system suppression after burn 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC San Diego, where Ninnemann conducted part of his research, a spokeswoman 
said the school agreed to settle only to stem further legal costs, and not 
because it agrees with the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In settling, we haven't admitted that the person committed intentional 
research fraud," spokeswoman Denine Hagen said. "We've been saying all along 
that there was no intentional misrepresentation or fraud at UCSD." 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark settlement stems from charges made in a 1989 lawsuit filed in San 
Francisco federal court by J. Thomas Condie, Ninnemann's research assistant at 
Utah during the early 1980s. Condie sued under provisions of the federal False 
Claims Act, which allows private citizens to file anti-fraud lawsuits on behalf 
of the government and share in any court awards if the legal action is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating Condie's claims, the Justice Department took over the 
lawsuit in 1990 and accused both schools of receiving more than $1 million in 
federal funds based on Ninnemann's fraudulent work. Utah received the federal 
money from 1981 to 1984 and UC San Diego from 1984 to 1988, when Ninnemann 
transferred his work to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said Utah administrators became aware of Ninnemann's fraud 
after a 1983 internal investigation but covered up by calling it sloppy 
research. The government also said the school lied when it promised that all 
problems had been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that false assurance, Utah officials were also liable for Ninnemann's 
continued NIH grant when it was transferred to UC San Diego, federal officials 
alleged. But they also blamed UC San Diego administrators for failing to 
carefully monitor Ninnemann's research as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 But in January, when UC San Diego administrators disclosed the terms of the 
settlement, they denied allegations of mismanagement. They said a blue-ribbon 
committee was impaneled as soon as Condie raised questions of fraud in 1988, 
before his lawsuit, and the group found no evidence of intentional 
misrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the government will recoup $1.03 
million while Condie will receive $311,100. An additional $255,000 will pay for 
Condie's attorneys fees and costs, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both schools will create programs to prevent scientific fraud or 
misconduct and, in a separate agreement, Ninnemann will issue retractions and 
corrections to the scientific journals in which he published the bogus data. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said Ninnemann left UC San Diego to teach at a small college but 
declined to say where.

CLINTON HEALTH PLAN SUPPORTERS HEAD EAST TO LOBBY CONGRESS; CARAVAN: ADVOCATES 
BOARD BUSES AS THEY BEGIN NATIONAL ROAD TRIP TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR REFORM. 
THEIR DESTINATION IS WASHINGTON, D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blazing their own trails east, caravans of buses carrying dozens of supporters 
of universal national health care began heading toward Washington on Friday as 
part of a lobbying effort for President Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying young and old, ill and injured, as well as doctors, nurses and 
celebrities, the first wagon train of buses pulled out on a hot and muggy 
afternoon, sent on their way after a pep rally attended by several thousand 
well-wishers and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in Pioneer Square in the 
heart of downtown Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 They call themselves the Reform Riders, and they will be joined in the 
nation's capital in early August by similar caravans from Texas and Missouri, 
Louisiana and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the caravans include Families USA, a pro-Clinton lobbying group, 
and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has 
1.3 million members. They have sought contributions from labor unions, 
businesses and other groups to help pay for the caravans, which are modeled 
after similar bus tours that drummed up enthusiasm for the 1992 Clinton-Gore 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass it now," the Portland crowd chanted, boosting signs and tiny flags and 
applauding Mrs. Clinton's call to raise their voices against Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other congressional leaders who oppose universal, 
employer-mandated health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who votes against universal coverage is not just casting an easy vote 
to get out of a dilemma, but is going to have to be held accountable for that 
kind of vote," she warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the bus riders -- several hundred strong -- do not have health 
insurance. Some are people who are disabled and unable to work. Some have 
children who are ill. There were families who cannot afford health care, as 
well as people who lost their insurance the day they lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Nelson of Portland said he can't get a job because he would lose 
Medicaid assistance for his six children. Sixteen-year-old Rachel Caruthers, 
suffering from epilepsy and cancer, said she will lose her Medicaid coverage 
when she graduates from high school here and finds her first job. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father got laid off," she said, "and there went our health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Kerns is riding the buses in his wheelchair, a victim of a paralyzing 
spinal cord injury that broke his neck 16 years ago. Now 37 and finishing a 
master's degree program here in social work, he said his re-entry into the 
labor force will cost him his Medicaid benefits too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Congress doesn't pass health insurance now, there are going to be a lot 
more people like me," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Lumley, 30, of Seattle, who lost a right arm and left leg in a 
motorcycle accident four years ago, said his insurance vanished when he could 
no longer work as a warehouseman. He said his unpaid bills total $35,000 and 
that his credit has been ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 He now is on Medicare, he said, which covers only 80% of his continuing health 
care costs, but now he will lose that protection when he finishes college and 
begins a new career as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all in the downtown park were Clinton supporters. Many carried signs or 
walked picket lines protesting Clinton's plan because they fear it will include 
federally funded abortions. Others criticized it as a big federal program that 
will tighten the government's control over individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beware the Phoney Express," shouted Scott Lively, mocking the bus caravans as 
he and other protesters marched along Morrison Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a conservative group opposed to 
government intervention, he said "we believe there are better ways of handling 
the health care problem." 
</P>
<P>
 With a wife and two children at home, and about $1,500 in health costs for his 
family last year, Lively suggested that all Americans should do as he does: pay 
for their own medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And if someone in his family suddenly suffers a catastrophic injury? "We're 
the normal family and we'll keep the costs as low as they can be and then we'll 
pay our bills," he said. "We wouldn't ask or expect everyone else in the 
country to bail us out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mrs. Clinton, in her address sending the bus riders to Washington, said it 
is the just that kind of unseen medical emergency expense that would be 
protected under the plan that she and the President are proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," she said, "this part of the country was settled by people who got 
on wagon trains and went out not knowing exactly where they would end up. When 
we began this health care crusade I sometimes felt like I was on a journey that 
I did not know exactly where it would end up either. 
</P>
<P>
 "But every day that went on I became more and more convinced that if the 
American people had a chance to vote themselves, there would be no question 
about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if we give our energy, our hearts, our souls to the next few weeks and 
make it clear that the American people want what the members of Congress have 
-- guaranteed health insurance paid for with an employer-employee shared 
responsibility system -- we will get it for every single American." 
</P>
<P>
 Reform riders will be holding rallies in the dozens of cities they will be 
passing through on their cross-country trek. They plan to collect letters from 
supporters along the way and hand them to members of Congress when they reach 
Washington. Organizers expect to spend as much as $2 million on the caravan. 
Group sponsors were asked to pay $20,000 for a bus.

$15.2-BILLION BUDGET SURPLUS POSTED IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government had a $15.2-billion surplus in June, new evidence that the 1994 
budget deficit is likely to be much smaller than earlier estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department reported Friday that for the first nine months of 
fiscal year 1994, which began Oct. 1, the deficit was $150.1 billion.That 
compares to $201.2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration last week lowered its budget deficit projections 
for this fiscal year to $220.1 billion, down from an earlier $234.8 billion 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit for all of last year was $254.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the reduced red ink is due to limits on spending enacted last 
year and in 1990, higher corporate tax revenues and lower interest rates that 
have cut federal debt payments and the cost of bailing out failed S&Ls.

PIZZA HUT PRESIDENT TELLS PANEL THE ADDED PRICE OF HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under fire for offering health benefits to foreigners that it does not provide 
to U.S.-based workers, the head of Pizza Hut said Friday that providing 
coverage could cost pizza lovers an extra $1 a pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza Hut President Allan Huston, an unlikely player in the increasingly 
heated debate over health care reform, came under intense congressional attack 
for his company's policy of providing better benefits overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a flagrant double standard," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the 
Massachusets Democrat who scheduled the hearing before his Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston defended the fast-food giant, saying the 50% contribution to health 
care costs that Pizza Hut must pay by law in Germany and Japan would cause a 
10% to 11% pizza-pie price hike and job losses if applied in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza Hut, which made about $370 million in profits last year, hit the 
limelight last week when a health reform group accused it of paying for 
workers' coverage abroad but lobbying against delivering the same benefits 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really came as a shock to all of us that, overnight, we were somehow 
transformed from a pizza baker to a target in a national political debate," 
Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the McDonald's Corp. president "chose not to come" to the hearing 
to testify about its practice of insuring employees abroad but not chipping in 
for hourly workers here. 
</P>
<P>
 A Big Mac, large fries and Coke were set down at the witness table by 
committee staff in the place of a McDonald's representative. 
</P>
<P>
 But several senators rallied behind Pizza Hut, and Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas -- the home state to Pizza Hut -- took to the Senate floor to 
decry what he called "misleading attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what company or industry will next be attacked by the White 
House, the Democratic National Committee, or their allies, but from the 
arguments they use, I know that they like their pizzas with a lot of baloney," 
Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most controversial issues in the debate concerns employer mandates 
-- a requirement that businesses pay most of their workers' insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza Hut, and its parent Pepsico, belong to a coalition battling against 
employer mandates.

PUBLIC MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HUBER PLANNED TODAY IN NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service for Denise Huber is scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Mariner's 
Church, 1000 Bison Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 Huber disappeared three years ago when her car broke down along the Corona del 
Mar Freeway, and the discovery of her body last week in a freezer in Arizona 
has led to an outpouring of support for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 The service will be open to the public. The family's pastor, Walt Shepard, 
will officiate and friends and relatives will give eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huber family intends to bury Denise, who was 23 when she vanished, in 
South Dakota on July 28, pending the release of the body by medical examiners 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial fund in her name will be established by her family. The charity 
that the fund will benefit has yet to be selected. Donations may be sent to the 
Denise Huber Memorial Fund, 120 Columbia Drive, Suite 100, Aliso Viejo, Calif. 
92656.

FAMALARO HAD WORKED ON HOMES OF O.C. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS; INVESTIGATION: 
SUSPECT MAY HAVE BEEN PAINTING A PROSECUTOR'S HOUSE AROUND THE TIME OF DENISE 
HUBER'S DISAPPEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Costa Mesa police continue their investigation into the murder of Denise 
Huber, they have interviewed some unusual potential witnesses: members of the 
Orange County law enforcement community who had hired murder suspect John J. 
Famalaro to paint their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Famalaro may have been painting the home of an Orange County 
prosecutor around the time that his alleged victim disappeared, and was also 
hired as a house painter by two Newport Beach police officers, sources close to 
the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was charged this week with the murder of Huber, a Newport Beach woman 
who had been missing from June 3, 1991, until last weekend, when Arizona 
authorities identified her frozen remains from fingerprints. Her body was 
discovered in a freezer that Famalaro purchased and moved around South County 
before taking it to Arizona. Huber was 23 when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence to suggest that Famalaro, who tried to become a police 
officer in the mid-1980s, specifically sought out the homes of law enforcement 
officials to paint. They may have simply lived in the area where he advertised 
his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary S. Paer said he remembers dealing with a man he 
thought was a clean-shaven Famalaro, as opposed to the bearded suspect arrested 
in Arizona last week, Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This could lend credence to the theory that Huber, stranded with a flat tire 
on her car in the darkness on the Corona del Mar Freeway, might have been lured 
to her death by Famalaro masquerading as a police officer or sheriff's deputy. 
Law enforcement sources this week have alternately discounted and been 
intrigued by this theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said this week that he thought Huber was "too 
smart" to fall for such a thing, especially since "it's very unusual to have a 
uniformed officer with long hair and a beard." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith added that everyone police have interviewed said Famalaro has sported a 
beard and mustache for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement sources and Huber's family have found the bogus-police 
theory credible. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would trust someone in a uniform," her mother, Ione Huber, said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's interest in law enforcement has taken on added significance since 
authorities in Arizona found two look-alike Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy 
shirts in his Arizona home as they were searching for evidence in the death of 
Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley confirmed Friday that Paer had hired Famalaro to paint his house in 
June of either 1990 or 1991. Conley said Paer isn't sure which year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking into this to see if it's significant," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer, who has been interviewed by Costa Mesa police about when his house was 
painted, has been asked to review a lineup of photographs provided by police, 
Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted at his home on Friday, Paer declined comment. Sources said he may be 
called as a potential witness and has been told not to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was also hired to paint the homes of Lt. Mike Jackson and Officer Ron 
Bellercamp of Newport Beach police, said Sgt. Al Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellercamp confirmed that Famalaro had painted his house, but he declined to 
talk about it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to get involved in any of it," Bellercamp said. "I've 
already spoken to the Costa Mesa Police Department about it. There is no big 
scoop here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who department spokesman Sgt. Andy Gonis said is on vacation, could 
not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gonis would not confirm that the two officers were among those whose 
homes were painted by Famalaro, he released the following statement: "Neither 
officer will be available for comment at the request of the Costa Mesa Police 
Department, so it will not possibly jeopardize their ongoing investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro made attempts to become a police officer, sheriff's deputy or reserve 
officer in 1983 and 1984, but was either rejected or dropped out early in the 
application process. For a brief time, he was enrolled in the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department training academy for reserve officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro had once applied for a police officer job with the Irvine Police 
Department and twice with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, once as a 
reserve deputy and once as a regular deputy, officials said.

2 BROTHERS HELD IN SPANISH PARK BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two brothers were detained for negligently starting a forest fire in a Spanish 
national park, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers were held after they admitted dropping burning cigarette butts 
that apparently sparked the blaze in the pine-covered hills of the Cazorla 
national park in Andalusia on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cazorla blaze was the latest in the worst wave of forest and brush fires 
to hit Spain in recent years. At the start of July dozens of fires destroyed 
325,000 acres in the east and south of the country and claimed 20 lives.

JUDGES WHO INSIST ON TRUE JUSTICE; THREE-STRIKE LAW PROVOKES POWERFUL ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bad cases make for bad law, runs the old saying, and just as surely bad law 
can make for egregious injustices. California's "three strikes" law, which 
mandates tough prison terms for second and third felony convictions, is an 
obvious example of bad law. It's bad not because it aims to lock up dangerous 
criminals for long periods -- a lifetime, in its severest application -- but 
because it fails to differentiate between crimes that greatly threaten society 
and crimes that, while they certainly deserve to be punished, are not as 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of judges, sometimes laudably, sometimes disturbingly, are beginning 
to insist on making that differentiation on their own. A minor judicial revolt 
may be underway as the three-strikes law, in all its implications, reaches the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Rosa, Superior Court Judge Lawrence Antolini, a strict law-and-order 
appointee of former Gov. George Deukmejian, says he will refuse to sentence a 
man to jail for up to eight years after the man pleaded no contest to 
possessing a small amount of marijuana while an inmate at a county honor farm. 
A prior felony burglary conviction would, under the law, merit such a sentence. 
But Antolini believes that such punishment in this case would be wildly 
disproportionate, amounting to constitutionally forbidden cruel and unusual 
punishment. The Sonoma County district attorney promises to appeal Antolini's 
intention to impose only a one-year jail term, on the grounds that he does not 
have the discretion to ignore the sentence mandated by the three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue of discretion, of allowing a judge to take into account 
circumstances and contingencies not provided for in the cold language of a law, 
is vital in trying to see that justice is really done. To be sure, abuses 
occur. A case in Santa Barbara, for example, has seen a municipal court judge 
who has openly scorned the three-strikes law reducing to a misdemeanor a felony 
child-abuse charge filed against a man with five prior felony convictions. The 
prosecution will probably appeal, and from all appearances it deserves to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes law, like its initiative echo on the November ballot, is an 
attempt to deal with career criminals who threaten society. Its fault lies in 
failure to distinguish among the degrees of threat posed. Violent criminals 
should be locked up for long periods, even life, to protect society. But to 
force judges to order three-time losers who have no record of violent behavior 
locked up for 25 years to life is simply absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can be comfortable seeing judges deliberately ignoring the law; anarchy 
on the bench is no less dangerous than anarchy in the streets. No one can be 
comfortable either with a system that, far too often up until now, has set 
loose criminals whose violent behavior cried out for extended, even permanent 
incarceration. But some sense of proportion, of reasoned differentiation, has 
to be restored to the sentencing process. The three-strike law needs a narrower 
focus. Judges should have some of their discretionary authority in sentencing 
returned.

WHEN SWEET CHARITY GOES SOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We will all have to give a little more, share a little more because charity 
and nonprofit organizations in the Los Angeles area are having to work harder 
and longer to raise donations as the local philanthropic scene changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arco Foundation, a well-known funder of local charities and a nationally 
respected pacesetter in corporate philanthropy, is having to eliminate its 
entire staff as part of its parent firm's reorganization. The foundation will 
continue to fund projects, although the level of giving is likely to drop off 
from the current $13 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutback leaves a void in the Los Angeles community and sends a chilling 
message to charity circles nationwide, where the Arco Foundation earned 
well-deserved kudos for its philanthropic initiatives. Those activities ranged 
from community groups like the PUENTE Learning Center in Boyle Heights to 
LEARN, the Los Angeles education-reform initiative. Notably, Arco also ranked 
first among U.S. corporations in its giving to minority populations. 
</P>
<P>
 While corporate foundations will continue to have a role as social catalysts, 
individual citizens will need to do more giving. Los Angeles ranks an 
embarrassing 48th among 50 areas ranked in order of per capita charitable 
giving, according to a recent survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Los 
Angeles has more wealthy people than any region except New York, but people on 
average gave $7 each to United Way in 1992, compared with $32 in Columbus. The 
survey did not include donations to small specialized organizations or 
contributions to churches and the needy, which are increasingly attracting 
support in a diverse Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals and corporations provide vital funding to address community needs, 
especially in current times when the state, counties and cities are having to 
slash services because of budget problems. Some say there is no bottom-line 
advantage to charitable giving. We think they are wrong. Helping others become 
educated, helping kids stay out trouble, helping people get along makes for a 
better community in which to live and to do business. And that's a terribly 
important bottom line indeed.

WILSON TO SMOKE: GET LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an election year, when politicians can do odd things, Gov. Pete Wilson did 
the right thing Thursday by signing a bill that gives Californians the best 
protection from unwanted smoke of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), outlaws smoking in 
nearly all enclosed places of employment, including restaurants and shopping 
malls, starting Jan. 1. Violators are subject to fines of up to $500 per 
violation. There are certain exceptions, such as bars, hotel lobbies and 
banquet rooms and workplaces with five or fewer employees if none object. Under 
the law, localities are free to pass even tougher restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 This and other recent bans on smoking are based on growing evidence that 
nonsmokers are injured by secondhand smoke. Last month the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. published a study of 653 cases of lung cancer among 
women who had never smoked -- in five metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. It found that in women with long-term exposure to secondhand 
smoke, the risk of getting cancer was up to 75% higher than among those not 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry claims that California's new rules are bad for business. 
But that is belied by the support for the Friedman bill from hotel and 
restaurant associations, which prefer a statewide level playing field for all 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also deserves a cheer for announcing his opposition to Proposition 188, 
the November ballot measure mounted by Philip Morris Inc., the cigarette maker. 
It would nullify the Friedman bill, substitute weaker smoking rules and allow 
local exceptions. Unfortunately, the governor says he will be too busy running 
for reelection to campaign against it. But on this, at least, he and his 
Democratic opponent, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, agree. It is urgent that 
all concerned with public health unite to crush this pernicious abuse of the 
initiative process.

CALIFORNIA DESERT ACT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "House Vote Downgrades Desert Land Status," July 13: 
</P>
<P>
 The vote to designate the East Mojave Desert a preserve rather than a national 
park is a victory for wildlife. For decades now the California Department of 
Fish and Game has been doing an exemplary job of managing our state's wild 
sheep population. From near-extinction a century ago, bighorn sheep have 
increased in number to over 5,000. With continued management it could be only a 
matter of years before we see twice that number of sheep in our mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marble Mountains in the East Mojave have been a prime source for bighorn 
sheep that have been transplanted to new habitats or reintroduced into their 
traditional ones. In those mountains the Department of Fish and Game, in 
cooperation with private conservation organizations, has been able to enhance 
the living conditions of wild sheep through numerous habitat improvement 
projects, such as artificial watering holes (which benefit all the wildlife in 
the area, not merely sheep), and to acquire information about sheep biology and 
behavior -- vital to their survival -- through capture and testing. Park status 
would have ended all such management activities in the Marble Mountains, 
leaving the sheep to a highly uncertain fate. 
</P>

<P>
 In its editorial, "Political Aridity Over the Desert" (July 14), The Times was 
unmistakably clear in its appraisal of the treatment of the California Desert 
Protection Act by the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 By voting to downgrade the Mojave National Park to a preserve, the House has 
done a great disservice to the ecological and economic centerpiece of the 
desert legislation. Worse, it did so for narrow-minded, political 
self-interest. The vast majority of Californians support a desert bill with a 
full-fledged Mojave National Park. While a few die-hard opponents to the bill 
continue to try to talk the bill to death on the false claim that the residents 
of the desert oppose the bill, the truth is that in Rep. Al McCandless' desert 
district, only one city government has opposed the bill, more than seven, 
including Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, and Riverside, are 
enthusiastic supporters. The City of Redlands, the heart of Rep. Jerry Lewis' 
district, supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 When the House-Senate conference committee takes up the desert bill, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, who has been stalwart in her defense of the Mojave National 
Park, must stay the course and make it brutally clear to her conferees that the 
Mojave National Park must be restored to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The House still must pass the bill. When it returns to the bill next week, the 
bill's opponents, Reps. Lewis, McCandless and Duncan Hunter, must get out of 
the way of a bill supported by the majority of California.

the East Mojave, yet make no mention of the 50-odd amendments added to the 
Senate version that enabled it to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 You decry the lack of park status, yet either way the National Park Service 
would manage the area. You claim the argument for hunting is fatuous because 
"only 28 deer were taken in the area." You fail to mention the other hunting 
opportunities in the 2,500-square miles that comprise the East Mojave. There is 
abundant quail, chukker, rabbit, coyote and bobcat. The Nelson bighorn sheep 
hunt, limited to less than 30 tags, annually generates $250,000 that is used 
exclusively for habitat improvements. Passage of the bill would restrict 
hunting, access and even rock collecting in 10,000-square miles of desert of 
which the East Mojave represents 25%.

 As a 10-year member of the Sierra Club and a field geologist who has devoted 
over 15 years to study of the California desert, I support the overall goals of 
the California Desert Protection Act (S 21). There is, however, a problem with 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The California desert is a valuable scientific resource for society that 
deserves protection and study. It is now among the most intensively studied 
geological laboratories in the world. As just one example, it is the birthplace 
of a recent revolution in geological thinking about how the Earth's continental 
crust rifts open to form ocean basins. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, the version of S 21 recently passed by the Senate will restrict 
access to such an extent that serious scientific investigation of most of the 
region will come to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
 In geologically mapping some 500-square miles of roadless, waterless area in 
Death Valley National Monument over the last 10 years, my graduate students and 
I cached 50-gallon barrels of water by helicopter in areas more than a few 
hours walk from the road. This was sufficient to support two backpackers for up 
to two weeks in a study area of about 5 to 10 square miles. Permission for 
helicopter landings in the monument backcountry is rarely granted. Placement 
and retrieval of the caches in our case were authorized by the Park Service on 
the basis that understanding the natural history of the monument is one of its 
primary missions. In a letter signed by the superintendent of the monument 
accompanying our last permit, we were rightly informed that if S 21 is signed 
into law, the Park Service "would not be in a position to approve any 
helicopter use in the backcountry in support of your investigations." For our 
research group and many others like us, this means our work in the desert 
wilderness is over. 
</P>
<P>
 A clause should be included in the law that extends the limited, very brief 
visits of aircraft to wilderness areas to include the support of basic 
scientific research, subject to permitting by the appropriate federal agency.

 In response to your editorial "Public Schools Can't Deliver Science Education 
Alone," July 5: 
</P>
<P>
 You're right, we can't. But you may be interested to know one of the new 
things the University of Southern California is doing to foster and improve 
science education in our community.In response to the recently created 
LAUSD/USC Math Science Technology High School across the street from USC, 
former Dean Robert Douglas, Drs. William Weber and Mike Appleman along with 
other science professors at USC have assisted the new public school in a 
variety of ways to launch this endeavor to upgrade secondary math, science and 
technology education voluntarily. Professors do not always need monetary or 
meritorious awards for research and writing. Some of them just do the right 
thing because they care!

NANSEN FIELD OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article concerning the Norwegian government's property, Nansen Field on 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula (June 14), has come to my attention. There is a 
lawsuit pending concerning the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article is marred by errors and inaccuracies; I feel compelled to attempt 
to correct some of the most egregious ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The least defensible misstatement is the canard that the Nansen Field property 
was "donated" (to whom?) by the previous owner, the Palos Verdes Corp. In fact, 
the Norwegian government, through its agency, the Norwegian Welfare Service for 
Merchant Seamen, purchased the property in 1948 at what was then fair market 
value. Over the years, Norway also improved the property at great expense, 
creating athletic facilities and building several clubhouses on the property 
for the use of Norwegian merchant seamen. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's adversaries enjoy painting themselves as intrepid "Davids" fighting 
the Norwegian government's "Goliath." However, what truly characterizes 
Norway's adversaries in this matter is a quite astonishing lack of appreciation 
for the Norwegian government's generosity towards the local Norwegian American 
community over the years. For many years, Norway has freely allowed 
individuals, clubs and organizations with Norwegian affiliations to use the 
Nansen Field property virtually free of charge, and has required only that they 
contribute to the maintenance of the property in a manner justified by their 
own use of the property. Instead of the gratitude, the Norwegian government has 
instead been confronted with an egregious attempt on the part of Ragnar Amlie 
and his cohorts, some of whom have enjoyed the free use of Nansen Field for 
years as a result of Norway's generosity, to appropriate for themselves 
property that has belonged to Norway for more than 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway purchased the Nansen Field property in 1948 for the very specific 
purpose of it serving as a recreational area for Norwegian merchant seamen 
during the time they spent in local harbors. However, due to the decline in 
Norwegian shipping on the West Coast of the U.S. and to other changes in the 
way merchant shipping is conducted (primarily much shorter layover times), the 
property cannot any longer be used for the purpose for which it was acquired. 
It would seem to be a matter of elementary fairness to let a property owner 
dispose of the property or put it to some other use. To the Norwegian 
government's utter amazement, Amlie and his cohorts have a different view of 
the matter.

SOME DON'T LIKE GAME, OTHERS DON'T LIKE WAY WORLD CUP FINAL ENDED

 Until two months ago, I, like most American sports fans, was ignorant about 
soccer, considered it the most boring sport on Earth and could not understand 
its worldwide appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the coming of the World Cup to the United States, I decided to learn the 
rules and tactics of the game, the skills involved and the strengths and 
weaknesses of the better teams. I attended two games at the Rose Bowl and 
watched many more on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I can say that I was wrong. Backed by a basic understanding of the game, I 
readily admit that soccer, when played at its highest levels, is every bit as 
exciting as "Bowling for Dollars."

 I'm sure that for many months to come, sports pundits will debate whether 
soccer will be able to successfully compete in popularity against basketball, 
baseball and football here in America. That question was resolved for me once 
and for all this morning, when my 10-year-old basketball addicted son eschewed 
his Shaq/Larry Johnson/David Robinson T-shirts in favor of an old, yellow No. 
11 AYSO jersey, upon which he printed Romario's name on the back.

 For the past month we've been living in a real-life version of "The Emperor's 
New Clothes." If that snore of a World Cup final was international soccer's 
showplace event, we can be thankful the next one is four years off. And if that 
"dramatic climax" was as exciting as the media hype about it, let's abandon 
overtime in the NBA final for a nail-biting game of H-O-R-S-E.

 After witnessing an epic struggle between two titans of the soccer world, that

shootout. If this is acceptable to anyone, we suggest a similar method to 
decide other classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time there is a Game 7 in the World Series, if it is tied after two 
extra innings, that sweetest moment in baseball should be decided by taking 
each team's best five sluggers and having them throw at the pitcher, trying to 
hit him, in alternate order, of course.

often-maligned Sports Arena since 1990.

ANGELS MAY HAVE DROPPED BALL ON REESE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Jimmie Reese left no (immediate family) survivors, so the Angels kindly 
provided him with a Christian (memorial service). However, it would seem that 
Angel errors are not limited to the playing field because I believe Jimmie 
Reese was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times article several years ago contained an anecdote about a celebrity 
baseball game in the 1940s. Songwriter Harry Ruby was pitching and told his 
catcher to dispense with the signs and just call out the pitches in Yiddish, 
since the batters would not understand this language. When Jimmie Reese came to 
bat, he looked at the catcher and said, in perfect Yiddish: "S'vet dir nit 
helfen . " (It ain't gonna help). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Angels did not know Jimmie Reese as well as they thought.

DATA REVEALS LOSS FOR O.C. BANKS, PROFIT FOR THRIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's small community banks lost a total of $7 million for the first 
three months this year, but local savings and loans, some of which are among 
the nation's largest, earned a combined $66.2 million, according to federal 
statistics released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly results for the 27 banks based in the county reflect the rise in 
interest rates this year as well as the lagging effects of Southern 
California's worst recession in 60 years. Deep cuts in real estate values, 
which back many loans, are barely leveling off, and corporate customers who 
also felt the pinch are only starting to increase their borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county's 17 S&Ls, the dramatic drop in demand for home loan 
refinancings, caused by the higher rates, hurt thrifts that sell the mortgages 
they make. But most of those that kept the loans in their portfolios fared 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county's six thrift and loans -- hybrids of banks and finance 
companies -- earned a combined $2.5 million for the three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 A few large gains and a few large losses spelled the difference for the banks 
and S&Ls. Only half of them posted profits, while the other half dragged down 
total earnings, according to regulatory figures compiled by Sheshunoff 
Information Services in Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Newport in Newport Beach, one of numerous banks operating under orders 
from regulators to improve their financial conditions, lost $4.6 million for 
the first quarter. Others among the 13 money losers were Sunwest Bank in 
Tustin, $1.1 million, and CommerceBank in Newport Beach, $936,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest profits among the 14 banks that earned money were posted by 
Eldorado Bank in Tustin, with $604,000; followed by National Bank of Southern 
California in Newport Beach, $236,000, and Landmark Bank in La Habra, $190,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two banks no longer exist. Pioneer in Fullerton was seized last week by 
regulators and closed. Colonial in Santa Ana has an agreement to sell its 
deposits and is liquidating itself to become a private mortgage banking 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the S&Ls, Household Bank in Newport Beach, with $34.9 million in 
earnings, and American Savings Bank in Irvine, with $32.2 million in profit, 
led the group of eight profitable S&Ls. American is the nation's fourth-largest 
S&L. Downey Savings & Loan in Newport Beach earned $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT Federal Bank in Newport Beach was the biggest money-losing S&L, suffering 
a $6.8 million hit. Union Federal Savings Bank in Brea, with a $5.3 million 
loss, and Guardian Savings & Loan in Huntington Beach, with a $5.1 million 
loss, were the next-largest losers among nine that posted red ink. Guardian is 
a failed S&L being operated by regulators, who have been unable to sell it.

PROFIT REPORTS BOOST APPLE AND MICROSOFT STOCKS; COMPUTERS: INVESTORS SEEM 
HAPPY WITH THE INDUSTRY'S PERFORMANCE. BUT PRICE WARS AND MARKET SATURATION 
COULD LOOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The computer business is on a summertime roll -- at least as far as investors 
are concerned. Just a day after International Business Machines Corp. shares 
spurted on better-than-expected earnings, Apple Computer Inc. and Microsoft 
Corp. stocks got major boosts on good earnings and positive comments from 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street may be overlooking storm clouds on the horizon in the form of 
price wars and market saturation. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's stock jumped $3 to $31 on the Nasdaq after the company reported that 
its quarterly profit surged to $138.1 million, as much as three times analysts' 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it shipped more than 200,000 of its Power Macintosh computers 
in the three months since they were launched. Though the shipments fell short 
of Apple's optimistic expectations, analysts said they were a good omen for the 
product, which uses a new kind of microprocessor and therefore represents a 
major transition for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft shares closed up $2.81 to $50.56 after company Chairman Bill Gates 
assured analysts that Chicago, the company's upgrade to Windows that is due out 
early next year, will be a great success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago's a phenomenon," Gates said. "We are doing everything we can to make 
sure it's more of a phenomenon than any new piece of systems software we or 
anybody else has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk was more upbeat than at past analysts' meetings, where the company 
has typically tried to throw water on growth expectations. Analysts expect 
Chicago to boost Microsoft revenue by as much as $1 billion in its first year 
out, and they were busy with their calculators after the meeting upgrading 
their earnings forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of his confidence in Microsoft's long-term outlook, Gates said the 
company will spend $150 million a year on information superhighway-related 
research that wouldn't bring immediate returns, as well as $100 million 
annually on advertising to boost the Microsoft brand name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, awareness of our company is quite low compared to, say, IBM or 
Apple," Gates said. 
</P>

 Analysts praised Apple on Friday for tight financial controls resulting in 
lower-than-expected restructuring costs. Apple lost $188.3 million in the third 
quarter last year and took a pretax charge of $320.9 million to cover 
restructuring costs including layoffs, but it didn't end up using all the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts seemed temporarily happy to overlook problems lurking under the 
surface. Retailers and industry observers have warned that with companies such 
as Compaq stocking up huge inventories of computers and with overall growth in 
the market slowing, there could be a price war leading up to the Christmas 
season.

PAINEWEBBER TO PROP UP MUTUAL FUND DAMAGED BY DERIVATIVE TRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PaineWebber Group Inc. said Friday that it will spend $180 million to prop up 
an ailing mutual fund that had tumbled in value due to losses in risky 
derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The action -- part of what is believed to be the largest-ever bailout of a 
mutual fund -- is one of the starkest examples of how the tumbling market for 
those exotic securities has hammered brokerages and banking firms this year. 
BankAmerica Corp., for example, had to inject money to prop up a fund hurt by 
losses from derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber said it will prop up the ailing Short-Term U.S. Government Income 
Fund by buying some of the fund's weakest securities.  
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage's cash buyback of fund securities is equal to nearly a quarter 
of the fund's value. 
</P>
<P>
 That injection raises to $286 million the amount PaineWebber has spent to bail 
out the fund. The latest $180 million comes on top of injections in early June 
of $33 million in cash and a purchase of $55 million of the fund's 
mortgage-backed derivatives, which are securities based on, or derived from, 
homeowners' monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The June cash infusion was responsible for the firm's second-quarter loss of 
$25 million, or 35 cents a share.  
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts with a profit of $59.3 million, or 74 cents a share, in the 
1993 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber stock closed unchanged at $16.375 in trading Friday on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based Pacific Investment Management Co., a major bond investment 
manager, has agreed to act as a consultant with the fund's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Market demand, or liquidity, for mortgage-backed securities began drying up in 
early February after the Federal Reserve Board pushed interest rates higher for 
the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders in the PaineWebber fund lost 7.15% of their investment through 
the first six months of this year, according to the Chicago-based Morningstar 
Mutual Funds report. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop is significant among short-term bond funds, which generally are 
considered extremely safe and able to retain their value even in times of 
market declines. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people might buy a fund with 'government' in the name and might 
automatically think it's safe," said Jeff Kelley, an associate editor of the 
Morningstar report.

EPA BRINGS UP ALTERNATIVES TO ELECTRIC CAR MANDATE IN EAST; AUTOS: THE AGENCY 
SEEKS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CAR MAKERS AND STATES THAT WANT TO ADOPT 
CALIFORNIA'S EMISSION RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in quiet meetings with car makers 
and state environmental regulators, has signaled that it might try to head off 
the growing efforts by East Coast states to mandate the use of electric cars -- 
a move that could leave California alone to face the strong opposition of 
Detroit's Big Three auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen East Coast states want to adopt California's strict tailpipe emission 
standards to help meet federal clean air standards. Like California, New York 
and Massachusetts have mandated the use of electric cars, and other states are 
expected to follow their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The big U.S. auto makers strongly oppose any expansion of a mandated market 
for electric cars, which they say are going to be high-priced and low on 
performance, making them hard to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is attempting to find a compromise between the feuding companies and 
the state regulators. But the idea of dropping electric car mandates has drawn 
a quick, angry response from several states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," said Trudy Coxe, Massachusetts secretary of environmental 
affairs and a member of the Ozone Transport Commission, which represents 12 
eastern states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any discussion with Massachusetts or New York," Coxe said Friday, "we 
would be asked in the future to put our zero-emission vehicle law in abeyance. 
. . . Detroit will pick off Massachusetts, pick off New York and destroy a new 
industry -- and the only entity left standing will be California, so why not 
pick it off too?" 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is hoping to avoid lawsuits and other delays as the northeastern 
states face a Nov. 15 deadline to submit plans to meet the federal Clean Air 
Act. In a 9-4 vote Feb. 2, the state group petitioned the EPA to approve their 
use of California's strict standards to reduce emissions -- though without 
specifically requiring zero-emission vehicles, which would almost certainly be 
electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a negotiated compromise, the EPA expects either the auto makers or the 
states and various environmental groups to sue, no matter which way it decides 
on the states' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is "exploring the feasibility and usefulness" of holding meetings 
between the auto makers and states, said John Beale, deputy director of the Air 
Policy Office of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation.  
</P>
<P>
 He described avoiding mandates for electric cars as one of many potential 
"elements" of an agreement. However, he said, "We've not said this is a 
compromise package and put it on the table."  
</P>
<P>
 Mary Nichols, assistant administrator for air and radiation, outlined the 
elements of a compromise with Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn. and other Big Three auto executives in 
Washington on July 14. She sketched the same ideas to 12 of 13 commissioners 
from the northeastern states commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One state official described the proposals as including a so-called 49-state 
car -- a low-emission vehicle that would not meet California standards but 
would be required in all other states. The auto industry has proposed a 
non-electric car it claims is 99% pollution-free.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the elements contained in the proposal . . . are very much worth 
discussing with the auto industry and others," Coxe said, "but it can't be by 
sacrificing the electric vehicle technology that is growing day by day."

DRUG FIRMS JUMPING OVER THE COUNTER; PHARMACEUTICALS: BY SWITCHING FROM 
PRESCRIPTION FORMULAS WITH FDA APPROVAL, THEY HOPE TO BOOST SALES, PROTECT 
THEIR TURF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To get Rogaine, the only federally approved drug for treating hair loss, a 
person must see a doctor for a prescription. But many people apparently think 
that visiting their doctor about a problem that is usually more cosmetic than 
medical is too much trouble -- or maybe a little too embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You usually go to a doctor because you're sick; you usually don't go just to 
discuss hair loss," said Jeff Palmer, a spokesman for Upjohn Corp., which 
manufactures Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Upjohn hopes to remedy that problem. It is seeking federal approval to market 
an over-the-counter version of Rogaine that would cost less and, the company 
hopes, encourage more people to give the treatment a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Upjohn is one of a growing number of drug makers that have been switching more 
of their prescription drugs to over-the-counter status in hopes of boosting 
sales. While some people may be bewildered by the growing array of remedies on 
drugstore and supermarket shelves -- and by the potential health risks -- the 
development is mostly good news for consumers because it makes these drugs more 
widely available at a lower cost, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very good trend," said Joel Hay, a health economist at USC's 
School of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel will consider 
requests from drug makers to approve three high-profile products for sale 
over-the-counter. Besides Upjohn's request for Rogaine, Merck is seeking 
approval for a lower-dose version of its popular anti-ulcer drug Pepcid. And 
SmithKline hopes to gain approval for a non-prescription version of Tagamet, 
one of the world's best-selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the panel recommends the switch, as analysts expect, the full FDA is likely 
to follow suit and grant formal approval to the products. However, the drugs 
are not expected to be available on store shelves until sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn, winning approval for a non-prescription 
version of Rogaine -- the only prescription treatment for hair loss -- is 
crucial to boosting lackluster sales of the drug. Worldwide sales of Rogaine 
were $110 million last year, down slightly from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say sales of Rogaine, introduced in 1988, have suffered because the 
drug doesn't work as well as many consumers hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping the switch to OTC would at least stabilize sales of the product, 
which are declining as the prospective audience has become increasingly 
disenchanted," said Steven Gerber, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 (Upjohn officials cite results from medical studies that show that after four 
months, 26% of patients using Rogaine report "moderate to dense" hair 
regrowth.) 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Rogaine is a good example of a drug that could benefit greatly 
from being available without a prescription. Rogaine is relatively pricey, at 
about $55 to $60 a month -- or $660 to $700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most health insurance plans don't reimburse patients for Rogaine because it is 
considered a cosmetic treatment. And because a patient now must go to his 
doctor to get a prescription for Rogaine, there are costs, such as insurance 
co-payments, that add to the expense and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Upjohn believes that converting Rogaine to over-the-counter status will 
broaden the market because consumers will be able to buy it more easily. The 
company also plans to cut the price, but it isn't saying yet by how much, 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Converting prescription medications to OTC use has boosted sales in the past. 
When Schering-Plough's Gyne-Lotrimin and Johnson & Johnson's Monistat -- both 
anti-fungal products used to treat vaginal yeast infections -- were switched in 
1990, sales more than doubled in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tagamet and Pepcid, the manufacturers hope to bring out lower-strength 
versions that would be used for "sour stomach" and heartburn rather than 
ulcers. The U.S. patent protection on SmithKline's Tagamet expired in May, and 
the brand-name product is already facing tough competition from lower-cost 
generic versions. Bringing out an OTC version is one way for SmithKline to slow 
the erosion in sales of the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Health experts advise consumers to use OTC medications with caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, people don't realize that OTC products can interact with 
each other or a prescription drug," said Melanie Privette, a spokeswoman for 
the American Pharmaceutical Assn., a pharmacists trade group. "Just because OTC 
products are often not as powerful, they still can cause very strong side 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
 To be on the safe side, Privette and others advise consumers to read product 
labels carefully and discuss proper use of medications with their pharmacists.

STOCKS EDGE HIGHER DESPITE RISING YIELDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices closed mostly higher Friday even though interest rates continued 
to creep up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials added 2.59 points to 3,735.04, leaving the blue chip 
index down 18.77 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise, Mexican stock prices rallied sharply Friday, following a strong 
earnings report from phone giant Telmex. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-quarter corporate earnings also generated some big individual stock 
swings in the U.S. market, but winners outnumbered losers on the New York Stock 
Exchange by just 11 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that was impressive given another rise in bond yields. The yield on 
six-month Treasury bills, for example, closed at 4.95%, up from 4.91% on 
Thursday and 4.82% at the start of the week.  
</P>
<P>
 Markets were focused for much of the day on Federal Reserve Board Chairman 
Alan Greenspan's testimony before a House Banking subcommittee. Greenspan 
largely repeated the two-part message he gave the Senate on Wednesday: The Fed 
wants to see a stronger dollar, and will do whatever is necessary to fight 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Greenspan said, "What we don't wish to see happening is a loss 
of confidence in the productiveness of dollar-denominated assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe the Fed is setting the stage for another hike in 
short-term interest rates in mid-August, which in part would help support the 
dollar. Fear of another rate boost pushed bond yields up for much of the week, 
though the biggest rise was in shorter-term securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Among long-term securities, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond closed at 
7.56% on Friday, up from 7.54% on Thursday. A week ago, the yield was also 
7.54%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Greenspan sought to bolster the dollar, its rally of recent days 
faded. In New York, the greenback closed at 1.596 German marks, up from 1.589 
on Thursday. But it eased to 98.90 Japanese yen, from 99.20. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the stock market, some analysts called it a positive sign that 
investors were responding to earnings reports, suggesting that the mood of 
paralysis over future interest rates is dissipating. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were again in the spotlight. Apple Computer surged 3 to 31 
after reporting quarterly operating earnings of 50 cents a share, well above 
analysts' mean estimate of 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big winner was Microsoft, up rose 2 13/16 to 50 9/16 after the firm 
met with analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM, which rocketed 6 1/2 on Thursday on a strong earnings report, dipped 
1 to 61 3/8.  
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks were higher after USX-U.S. Steel reported healthy earnings. Its 
shares jumped 1 3/4 to 37, while Inland Steel added 1 1/8 to 38 7/8 and LTV 
rose 7/8 to 18 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, McDonald's reported 13% higher quarterly earnings, but some 
analysts warned that the firm's results will face tougher comparisons over the 
next few quarters. Also, overseas sales growth was said to be slower. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's shares fell 2 to 26 1/4. Other growth issues losing ground included 
Kellogg, down 1 1/2 to 52 1/2; Home Depot, down 1 3/8 to 40 3/4, and Pfizer, 
off 1/2 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the day's big casualties was Paragon Trade, a maker of private-label 
diapers. It warned that pricing pressures and delays in customers switching to 
its new thin diaper may depress sales near-term. The stock lost 5 3/4 to 24 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Mexican stocks, NYSE-traded Telmex surged 1 5/8 to 57 1/8 after saying 
inflation-adjusted operating income grew 12.6% in the first half. The results 
helped re-energize the depressed Mexican market, sending the Bolsa index up 
67.85 points to 2,300.66. 
</P>
<P>
 * In other foreign markets, Frankfurt's DAX index gained 36.96 points to 
2,150.26 and London's FTSE-100 index added 19.6 points to 3,114.7. In Tokyo, 
the Nikkei average eased 160.03 points to 20,462.89. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the U.S. municipal bond market, yields slid on California's 21-month 
revenue anticipation warrants, or RAWs, which the state sold Wednesday. The 
RAWs were quoted at an annualized yield of 4.88%, down from nearly 5% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors responded favorably to the state's decision Friday to make two 
interest payments on the RAWs, one a year from now and the other at maturity. 
Originally, the state had planned to pay all interest at maturity, but that 
could have resulted in tax problems for some buyers.

 Supervisor of Fired Kidder Star Quits: A government bond trading scandal at 
Kidder, Peabody & Co. claimed another victim as the supervisor of the central 
figure in the saga quit, effective immediately. Edward A. Cerullo, executive 
managing director, head of Kidder's fixed-income division and a 15-year veteran 
of the Wall Street investment firm, said in a statement that he decided to 
resign because of "the events of recent months." Cerullo supervised Joseph 
Jett, a former star bond trader fired from Kidder three months ago after the 
firm accused him of concocting $350 million in phony profits from government 
bond trading to hide losses and inflate his bonus.

RALPHS TO PAY OUT $38,500 TO SETTLE OVERCHARGING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in two years, Ralphs Grocery Co. has pleaded no contest to 
criminal counts of overcharging customers at some of its stores and has agreed 
to pay fines and a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges involved disparities between the posted shelf prices on some 
products and prices registered at the checkout counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations followed inspections by Los Angeles County officials at 10 
supermarkets in the San Fernando Valley and central and West Los Angeles. City 
Atty. Jim Hahn filed the case in April, charging Ralphs and the managers of the 
10 stores with 17 counts of false advertising and seven counts of overcharging 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain with prosecutors entered in Van Nuys Municipal Court, the 
supermarket chain agreed to pay a fine of $5,000 and a penalty of $8,500. 
Ralphs also agreed to donate $20,000 in food to two food banks for the poor and 
$5,000 in Ralphs gift certificates to be divided among five Los Angeles 
shelters for battered women.  
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Hahn dropped all but five misdemeanor overcharging counts against 
the company. He also dismissed all charges against the 10 store managers.

CHICKEN FAT: IT GOES SKIN-DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite their reputation as a healthier alternative to burgers, chicken or 
fish won't always help reduce fat content in a fast-food meal, according to the 
August issue of Consumer Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The fat and calorie content of chicken varies dramatically depending on how it 
is prepared, the New York-based magazine reported."In fact, the skin and dark 
meat of KFC's Rotisserie Gold chicken helps make it one of the fattiest foods 
we tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Nutritional data provided by restaurant chains shows that chicken served 
without the skin is lower in calories and total fat than that with the skin 
still on. Nutritionists note that skinning chicken before cooking further 
reduces the fat content. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports' new study did not include fast-food meals at El Pollo Loco, 
Boston Chicken or Kenny Rogers Roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine reported last year that consumers can find poultry products that 
are "especially low in fat." The bottom line, Consumer Reports says, is that 
"if, like most Americans, you prefer the standard foods, you'll probably 
sacrifice nutrition to taste." GREG JOHNSON

 Ford to Cancel Mazda Navajo for 1995: The company, the only Big Three auto 
maker to build a vehicle for a Japanese nameplate, will probably not supply 
Mazda with a 1995 Navajo sport utility vehicle, Mazda dealers said. They said 
it was unclear whether the vehicle -- nearly identical to the very popular Ford 
Explorer -- will ever return to Mazda showrooms.The Navajo was hailed as a 
symbol of Ford's and Mazda's cooperative relationship when it was introduced in 
1991. Ford owns nearly 25% of Mazda and in the past year has moved to 
strengthen its influence at the struggling Japanese auto maker. Ford is 
redesigning its Explorer for the 1995 model year and does not want to 
complicate the new vehicle's production launch by starting up a Mazda version 
at the same time, dealers and industry analysts said.

 Frederick's Announces Loss Linked to Closings: Frederick's of Hollywood Inc. 
said it will post the loss for its fiscal fourth quarter as it spends $2.4 
million to close a dozen unprofitable stores and refocus on the frilly lingerie 
that made it famous. Chief Financial Officer John Hatfield said the one-time 
expense represents a fundamental shift in philosophy as the company drops lines 
that are too mainstream or don't offer adequate profit.The Los Angeles 
retailer, which also has a mail-order division, did not disclose which of its 
209 stores will be closed. Chairman George Townson said it is too early to 
estimate the size of the fourth-quarter loss. Frederick's Class B shares fell 
25 cents to $4.25 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

THEATER REVIEW; TORN BETWEEN ROCK AND A BARD PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shakespeare's light 'n' frothy "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" is no walk 
through the Huntington Beach Central Park. It's sometimes tough going for 
director Ken Perkins and his Huntington Beach Playhouse cast, who deliver a 
forgettable reading of this smart comedy on love's tremendous pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the principles has his or her own problems, but all can be grouped 
under a general umbrella: Shakespeare-in-Training. 
</P>
<P>
 And Perkins clearly wanted to diddle with the comedy, which follows Veronese 
pals Valentine and Proteus as they trip over each other in pursuit of Silvia, 
daughter of the Duke of Milan. All the while, lovesick Julia is going to 
extremes to woo Proteus. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins' efforts are a bit slap-dash. As Proteus, Eric Anderson cops a grunge 
attitude in speech and garb, as does Todd Mooney as servant Speed (obviously an 
Angels fan) and Leigh Forrest as quirky maiden Lucetta. But Jessica Sandilla's 
Julia is a lady of Athens -- and Courtney Gains adopts a classically 
Elizabethan tone for Valentine. Besides, if it's grunge-style we're after, then 
why the music from Meat Loaf? And if it's a general rock 'n' roll mode Perkins 
wants for this youthful love tryst, then why the traditional Shakespeareanisms 
sprinkled throughout? 
</P>
<P>
 The four lovers have other problems as well. Anderson shows off some heady 
charisma, but his delivery is dangerously casual, and his Shakespeare is badly 
American (read: flat). Double-dealing Proteus is a rather nasty, dark guy whom 
Anderson needs to get to know better. Gains, by contrast, appears to work far 
too hard for some kind of classical aura; his poses not only resemble Edmund 
Kean in old daguerreotypes but are too laborious for so simple a character. 
</P>
<P>
 Their objects of desire unfortunately are not much more than that; Sandilla 
and, as Silvia, Wendi de Barrios don't do much to humanize them. Sandilla 
becomes affecting only when she disguises herself as a boy servant to spy on 
Proteus; where her performance had been whiny, it suddenly is able to express a 
sense of loss. Silvia has to be a turn-on; de Barrios sounds and looks aloof 
and is not very charming. She is not, like Helen of Troy, a woman over whom men 
would fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob May comes to the rescue as a quietly nutty Launce, Proteus' servant, 
forever talking to his stuffed toy dog. Mooney's Speed and Bryce Cahn's 
hopelessly trumped Thurio carry some of the comic load as well. (Indeed, when 
you get lost trying to figure out what this show is after in the style 
department, just watch Cahn, who creates his own show off-stage running through 
the park's woods on another fruitless love hunt). 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first production of the Playhouse's "Shakespeare in the Park" '94 
season, on a rough-hewn amphitheater stage in a shady glen -- a smaller version 
of Topanga's Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, the granddaddy of all Southern 
California's outdoor summer Shakespeare venues. The stage is much closer than 
the Botanicum's and, on the day this reviewer attended, the sun was a lot 
kinder. But as is the case at the Botanicum, an extra pillow is a must.

PLAZA COCKTAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Nightclubbing on the Edge" (June 23), about the new clubs in Los Angeles, was 
very interesting. Re the Lava Lounge -- "a paradise in the middle of hell," "a 
Hungarian bar," a "prostitute hangout" and "like watching 'Cops' ": Plaza 
Cocktails, as it used to be known, was a small neighborhood bar -- my nearest 
local bar when I lived in Hollywood.One of my best friends (whom I met in 
there) was a bartender there in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it was frequented by a number of Hungarians, mainly because the owner 
was Hungarian, and the Eastern European people knew they had somewhere to go to 
mingle with their own countrymen. Also a lot of other people, who had 
businesses in the neighborhood, frequented the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 I also remember meeting a very famous household-name rock star who had been 
visiting a record company in the neighborhood. He had gone in for a drink and 
exclaimed to me that "he wouldn't be bothered in a little working-class 
neighborhood bar." 
</P>
<P>
 As for prostitutes, I am not myself one, so possibly would not know what to 
look for either upscale or downscale. I certainly do not remember anyone 
haggling a price. 
</P>
<P>
 I have some good memories of Plaza Cocktails, as I met a lot of people way 
back then and made some good friends. I only hope the new Lava Lounge lives up 
to L.A.'s expectations.

THE THRILL OF 'THREE TENORS' LIVE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am one of those that did not opt for the living room to enjoy "Encore! The 
Three Tenors" at Dodger Stadium. Instead, I was treated to the greatest thrill 
of my life as an opera fan: a live performance by Luciano Pavarotti and company 
("Greatest Tenor Show on Earth," July 18). 
</P>
<P>
 True, I could not afford a front-row seat, but that did nothing to diminish my 
entertainment: By arriving on time I was also treated to some pre-concert 
rehearsals by Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be obvious to everybody that Dodger Stadium does not have the sound 
of La Scala, but Martin Bernheimer's expectations were once again wilted. Here 
are some suggestions for the critic from a humble but faithful fan: 
</P>
<P>
 I can distinguish between Puccini and Massenet just fine, no program needed 
(so could the people around me in our economy $75 seats). Furthermore, I 
learned from Pavarotti and company the joy and thrill of opera, a world I was 
little aware of before the 1990 concert in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I would suggest that Bernheimer admit the general public into the 
once-exclusive world of opera: Three famous singers and one recognized 
conductor have done so, and the world, including this still-giddy fan, are 
grateful. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Midway through the "Three Tenors" concert, I looked around Dodger Stadium and 
reflected on how very fortunate I was to be there. As a concert and opera 
singer for a number of years, I admit to approaching the concert with a rather 
jaundiced eye, sure that it would fail to impress me artistically. I had heard 
that the elaborate, Hollywoodesque set and sound system created for the 
occasion would likely be unsatisfactory, even offensive. I was, however, 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
 How thankful I am to know that, now and again, I can still be swept away by 
the magic of a moment. It should be said that, despite artistically difficult 
conditions, the singers showed their true greatness as performers. Although the 
evening admittedly was short on subtlety, it was both moving and exciting to 
witness a rare musical phenomenon as three premier singers and one of the great 
conductors of our age abandoned caution and performed their hearts out for us. 
</P>
<P>
 What a wonderful stroke of good fortune to have such an event in our 
beleaguered city! How marvelous that national and international attention were 
once again focused on Los Angeles in an entirely positive and uplifting manner. 
</P>

 Beautiful! Beautiful! 
</P>
<P>
 The world's three leading tenors. 
</P>
<P>
 But where are the world's three leading sopranos? Or is this, like soccer, an 
all-male province? 
</P>

<P>
 "Encore! The Three Tenors" was for many a once in a lifetime opportunity to 
hear the legendary tenors perform together. By and large it lived up to the 
expectations of fans who purchased tickets many months in advance to be part of 
this special occasion. Thanks to Tibor Rudas, the artistry of the three tenors 
and Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the event will linger in our 
memories for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of us were annoyed and embarrassed by the rudeness of so many of 
the patrons who came in after the 8 p.m. starting time. The repeated entreaties 
of the announcer for all to be seated were ignored for nearly 40 minutes. To 
make matters worse, the same problem persisted after the intermission. Most of 
the offenders seemed to be those in the high-priced seats in the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 The management should have closed the door and barred them entry until after 
intermission, as is the practice in most concert halls.

THEATER REVIEW; A GHOST RETURNS TO MAKE PEACE WITH HIS 'DAUGHTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sentimental comedy about a wayward father who returns from the grave to make 
peace with his children, "Vic Lanudi's Daughters," at Theatre/Theater, hangs 
some well-played emotional exchanges on a flimsy plot skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 As the eavesdropping ghost who materializes for the reading of his will, John 
Phillip Law conjures up enough breezy charm to almost make us forget that Vic 
was a reprehensible parent who sired each of his four daughters with a 
different mother and consistently ducked out on his family responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But his daughters recall his shortcomings all too well, especially the 
flamboyant Trudy (Priscilla Barnes), a gorgeous, acid-tongued socialite with no 
regrets about her father's suicide, and Laura (Gina Minervini), a spirited but 
struggling singer with a more balanced perspective. Jilanne St. Clair and 
Martha Thompson give nicely shaded portrayals as the younger daughters who 
eerily contribute so little to the facile story line. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances consistently exceed the quality of a script haunted by 
unnecessary padding; playwright Marc Umile too often confuses biographical 
detail with character definition. As we wonder what changes his new-found 
perspective might have wrought in Vic, the specter of a missing second act 
looms ominously over Mary Lou Belli's animated staging. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vic Lanudi's Daughters," Theatre/Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 and 10 p.m.; Sundays, 5 and 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 14. $10.

MUSIC REVIEW; BAMERT INSPIRES QUALITY PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For whatever reasons -- and many possibilities exist -- attendance seems to be 
down at Hollywood Bowl in this 73rd summer season at the outdoor amphitheater. 
Thursday night, for instance, when Matthias Bamert returned to lead the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic in a Beethoven-Brahms program, a crowd of merely 8,521 
listeners semi-filled the showplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the high quality of the performances, that seemed a shame. Bamert, the 
52-year-old Swiss musician of international low-profile, exudes authority 
without glamour, and appears to get splendid results from an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 His leadership of both Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture and Schoenberg's 
orchestral transcription of Brahms' Quartet, Opus 25, revealed compelling 
overviews and striking details. Moreover, the Philharmonic on Thursday played 
for Bamert with the kinds of interest and focus it does not always muster for a 
guest on its podium, especially in this outdoor situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenberg's colorful but never overwritten realization of Brahms' youthful 
work remains a novelty uniquely associated with Los Angeles. Made in 1937, the 
orchestration was given its premiere performance by this orchestra, conducted 
by none less than Otto Klemperer, the following year. Later, former 
Philharmonic music director Zubin Mehta admired it enough to bring it back a 
number of times during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamert's approach lightened the work's textures even more than we remember, 
and its many charms seemed fresh again. Even those who cannot get enough of 
Brahms' four symphonies have to welcome this pleasant footnote to that oeuvre . 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Frank was the assured soloist in a direct but sometimes pedestrian 
reading of Beethoven's Violin Concerto at mid-program. Frank's technique is 
admirable for its unfettered and immaculate profile; further, she is a 
violinist of strong musicality. She certainly brought to the Larghetto a 
becalmed utterance worthy of its character. One wanted only more heat in all 
movements; without that, the composer's inspiration becomes merely a collection 
of well-played scales and arpeggios.

TV REVIEW; 'GUN' DRAWS A BEAD ON WEAPONS BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Full of real-life mystery, intrigue and shady government dealings, HBO's 
"Doomsday Gun" is the type of intricately woven thriller that demands the 
viewer's undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
 This politically trenchant film revolves around Canadian arms designer and 
dealer Gerald Bull, who was assassinated in 1990 while building a "super gun" 
for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Had it been completed, the gun -- with a 
barrel nearly 200 yards long and firing a shell the size of a telephone booth 
-- would have been the largest weapon of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doomsday Gun" is perhaps most compelling for its critical look at the morally 
bankrupt nature of the international arms business and the clandestine role 
some Western governments played in feeding the Iraqi war machine. It is noted 
at the end of the movie that approximately $3 billion of American taxpayers' 
dollars was secretly funneled to Iraq in the years before the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, the United States and Britain are well aware that Bull is 
building a massive gun for Iraq with parts delivered from various European 
countries. Supporters of Iraq in its war with Iran, the two allies choose to 
look the other way rather than try to prevent the weapon from falling into the 
hands of the volatile Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Langella is transfixing as the obsessive Bull. With his imposing frame 
and almost maniacal stare, Langella plays the arms designer as a man far more 
preoccupied with achieving glory than in making money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bull's naivete and single-minded drive to build his super gun blind him to 
the dangers around him. He never fully grasps that there are countries -- 
including Israel, Iran and possibly even Iraq -- that might feel more 
comfortable if he were six feet underground. Who killed Bull is the film's 
intriguing, unsolved mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Doomsday Gun" airs at 8 tonight on HBO. It will repeat July 26 and 31 and 
Aug. 3, 8 and 12.

'THREE TENORS' A PBS FUND-RAISING HIT; TELEVISION: THE CONCERT HELPS RAISE 
PLEDGES OF MORE THAN $1.9 MILLION FOR SEVEN OF THE LARGEST AFFILIATES. BY 
MIDWEEK, KCET HAS THE MOST, WITH $653,300. KOCE RAISES $162,000.

 "Encore! The Three Tenors," a hit with its audience at Dodger Stadium last 
Saturday, also performed mightily backstage -- in the fund-raising rooms of 
public-television stations across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No figure was available as to how much the program with Luciano Pavarotti, 
Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras raised among PBS' 346 stations, but a survey 
of seven of the largest public-TV outlets found that more than $1.9 million has 
been pledged thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET Channel 28 in Los Angeles is leading the pack with $653,300 and 6,408 
pledges. The response was so strong that KCET reprised the program again 
Thursday night, a month before the next broadcast had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Goen, KCET's vice president of public information, suggested that 
"community pride" as well as strong listener support helped account for the 
high donation numbers here. 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently the pride didn't stop at the county border. KOCE Channel 50 in 
Huntington Beach raised $162,000 and gained 1,428 new members with "Three 
Tenors" broadcasts Sunday and Wednesday, breaking its record for money pledged 
during a drive pegged to a single program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was phenomenal," KOCE's Nancy Lambing said Friday. "We love those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at other stations were equally ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely something out of the ballpark," exulted Tina Bachemin, a 
spokeswoman at KQED in San Francisco, which reported a record 4,000 pledges 
last weekend for $361,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's WHYY raised $174,046; Washington's WETA, $163,073; Boston's 
WGBH, $102,000, and Chicago's WTTW $47,000. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's WNET raised $414,786 over its pledge weekend, which included the 
live broadcast at 11 p.m., a rebroadcast the following night at 8 and a repeat 
airing of the first "Three Tenors" concert from March, 1990, in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Most PBS stations usually have a pledge drive in August, but stations took the 
opportunity to raise money now, perhaps because "The Three Tenors" concert is 
scheduled to be released on video and laser disc Aug. 30. KCET's Goen, however, 
denied that the video release had anything to do with the station's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a ratings hit, by PBS standards. The network said that "The Three 
Tenors" was seen by 18 million people in the United States during its various 
telecasts last weekend. The live broadcast Saturday even beat the three major 
commercial networks in San Francisco, San Diego and Phoenix, PBS said. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS President Ervin S. Duggan hailed the event as "a brilliant success that 
underscores the power of public television to bring the best to enthusiastic 
millions who love the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising and ratings did not come without a price, however. PBS 
spokesman Harry Forbes said the network had "paid more for (rights to the 
concert) than for any other program acquired specifically for fund-raising." He 
declined to say how much, as did the concert producer, Tibor Rudas.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CODEINE GIVES MOOD MUSIC THE PUNK TREATMENT AT WHISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, what would you expect from a band called Codeine? 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the mood-rock wing of alternative rock, few groups are as doggedly 
devoted to the slow-down game as Codeine.At the Whisky on Thursday, the New 
York trio emitted an ooze of narcoleptic trance music. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Stephen Immerwahr alternately muttered and crooned the lyrics, while 
drummer Douglas Scharin did a lot of his timekeeping in the air, crashing down 
sparingly and strategically at the treacherously slow tempos. 
</P>
<P>
 John Engle's guitar tone is too hard-edged to make the music dreamy. The 
impression is more stark and pensive, suggesting an isolation that's absolute 
but not altogether unpleasant. The titles of the band's two albums on Sub Pop 
Records -- "Frigid Stars" and "The White Birch" -- sum it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Codeine didn't really elaborate on its powerful atmospheres. Instead of the 
extended explorations you might expect, the group simply made a statement, 
drove it home with mounting intensity, dropped it and moved on to the next one. 
It's a sort of punk approach to mood music. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Whisky audience seemed absorbed, while the unconverted filled some 
of the many silences with wisecracks. None of it broke Immerwahr's grim 
concentration. RICHARD CROMELIN

 A practical guide to life in L.A.: A Spanish-speaking friend of ours is taking 
an extension class in English that seems relevant to these parts. Her homework 
recently included this multiple-choice problem:

 Bears' rights: Megan Rosenberg of Thousand Oaks found this disclaimer in a 
local play group's program: 
</P>
<P>
 "The stereotypes portrayed in 'Winnie the Pooh' are in no way condoned by the 
Young Artists Ensemble, and we have left them intact to preserve the author's 
original message. All bears do not like honey, not all donkeys are slow, not 
all piglets are easily frightened, and not all boys think that Winnie the Pooh 
can talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, stage manager Eric Martin of the Young Artists Ensemble wrote 
the disclaimer as a joke. Sure, we asked the group about it. These days you 
never know. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Not a relative of Winnie's, we hope: George Davies of La Verne, meanwhile, 
found a restaurant that doesn't seem as sensitive about Smokeys.

 Our last-ever item on "Mairzy Doats": In reference to the '40s comedy song, 
Bryan Coulter of Long Beach recalls seeing a sign on the River Mersey in 
England that said: "Mersey Docks and Harbors Board." 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath that someone had scrawled: "And little lambs eat ivy" (the second 
line of "Mairzy Doats").

 Lounging with a lizard? "During a recent production by the Civic Light Opera 
of South Bay Cities, a patron approached the hospitality table to report that 
the show 'Oklahoma!' was terrific," writes spokeswoman Patty Ewing, "but that 
he was being distracted by a woman kissing and stroking a rather large iguana." 
</P>
<P>
 When investigators found the woman, Ewing says, by then she "had put the 
lizard in her car and claimed that it was made of rubber." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ewing wonders: Does the fact that it's rubber put the woman in a better 
light? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Water, water, sort of: Donna Pearson of Glendora sent us two photos of a sign 
in the stall of a public bathroom that said: "Caution non-potable flush water." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson wrote: "Since I don't usually drink out of the toilet I wasn't tempted 
to sample this water. I do wonder what the woman in the next stall thought when 
I took two flash photos in the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, as long as you didn't have an iguana with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We're clean befuddled: Bob Abrahams of L.A., meanwhile, does have several 
questions about a laundry sign he snapped. To wit: "Are they guaranteeing to 
press the buttons? Do buttons wrinkle? Five or more per order -- is that shirts 
or buttons? Does this qualify as a dueling sign? Or worse?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dunno. Can't get that iguana off our mind. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 We all know there are basically two types of people in L.A. And, so, the 
Pasqua sandwich shop in the L.A. County Mall has two lines -- one for those who 
want espresso or au lait with their food, and one for customers who prefer some 
other drink.

CITYSCAPES / LAURA A. GALLOWAY: FOR THE STARBUCKS CROWD, NEW PRICES AREN'T TOO 
MOCHA

<P>
 For some time now, a plain old cuppa Joe hasn't been good enough for a certain 
type of Los Angeles coffee drinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricey specialty coffee shops, catering to the pure addict, have sprung up 
faster than you can say, "Grande cafe Americano." 
</P>
<P>
 But the price of addiction just went up. 
</P>
<P>
 A surge in coffee prices, attributed to crop-crippling frosts in Brazil, has 
begun. It struck first Friday at Starbucks, the hangout of the moment for many 
caffeine freaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly an iced grande latte, which on Thursday went for $2.65, was running 
$2.75 before tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But is the gourmet coffee trend dead? Are javaheads taking up Diet Coke, or 
even Snapple? No way. Once you've grown accustomed to the top-of-the-line 
stuff, it seems, no mere price hike can drive you away. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, lots of people were too groggy to even care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky I remember my name in the morning until my first cup of coffee," 
said Vincent DeStefano, a regular at the Starbucks on Lake Avenue in Pasadena, 
who had come in with his own jumbo ceramic mug. "It's no big deal. It's 10 
cents." 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few grousers, naturally, among the usual crowd of joggers, 
commuters and other early morning revelers standing two abreast in lines that 
at times reached the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation hasn't even gone up that much. I don't want to buy the place, I 
just want to buy more coffee," said George Rodriguez of Pasadena, who was 
buying for himself and a friend. "I support his coffee habit," he said, nodding 
toward his comrade, "so it's actually going to go up 20%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Brazilian freeze, a trade association spokesman said, virtually 
every wholesale coffee roaster is raising prices, and increases are expected 
soon at specialty coffee shops all over. 
</P>
<P>
 At Starbucks, they tried to break the news gently. Placards were posted behind 
plexiglass informing customers of the change nearly a week before it took 
place. E-mail messages and interoffice memos were sent out ordering that 
containers of nickels and dimes be kept within easy reach of the cash register 
lest a patron come up short. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major question has been: 'How much is my coffee gonna cost?' " said Eric 
Brouhard, manager of the Lake Avenue Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: An average of 5 cents more for each shot of espresso and 5 to 10 
cents more for drip coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 In this elite coffee-drinking bracket, some didn't notice the increase at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even realize there was one," said Leaanne Dickson, who was patiently 
waiting for coffee and a sour cream and pecan muffin before heading off to work 
as the vice president of a credit union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale coffee bar has become one of the great social levelers. Grunges, 
Suits and Sneakers peacefully convene, sipping double espressos, cappuccinos 
and tea, reading the paper and sharing conversation. "We almost liken it to a 
romance," Brouhard said of the specialty coffee junkies. It begins with a drive 
by the shop and an initial visit, and it ends with a regular customer who buys 
coffee beans to brew at home. "Then they buy an espresso machine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Starbucks on Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena, javaphiles and 
bibliophiles alike sit sipping coffee and browsing through the adjoining 
bookstore. Secondary school teacher and self-described 
writer/poet/shrink/four-cup-a-day coffee drinker David McCann sat reading a 
book and sipping coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 McCann was one of the few who felt the price increase would affect his coffee 
drinking, particularly given the company's new refill policy. (Previously, 
refills were free and now they're 45 cents.) "I drink too much coffee. My wife 
will tell you that," he said. "Now I'll probably just get a cup and no refill. 
That'll be better for my health." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders say higher prices won't do much to erode the upscale coffee 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's significant, but it's happened before. Coffee will continue to be a 
popular beverage," said Ted Lingle, executive director of the Specialty Coffee 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Gold, regional operations manager for another popular coffee chain, 
Pasqua, agrees. In September, Pasqua also plans to increase prices. But Gold 
remains confident about the future of the specialty coffee business. "For those 
of us who grew up with canned -- or even instant -- coffee, the thought of 
going back is simply out of the realm of possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for those who put price over premium, there is always Winchell's. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the opening of a Starbucks nearby siphoned off some of the coffee 
trade from the Winchell's on Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I lost a lot of customers in coffee, but (Starbucks) brought me a lot 
of customers in doughnuts," said Jose Argueta, the shop's assistant manager. 
After the price increase, "maybe we will get more customers," he said 
optimistically, throwing out a lure to any would-be Starbucks defectors: "Now 
we have five different kinds of coffees and decaf." 
</P>
<P>
 And at 75 cents for a large, they are holding the line.

DETAILS EMERGE ON ALLEGED DRUG RING MASTERMIND; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY 
COCAINE-FILLED COMPUTERS WERE SHIPPED NATIONWIDE IN OPERATION YIELDING $30 
MILLION IN PROFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many have made their fortunes in the booming business of computers and 
information technology, but no one, authorities say, has done it quite like 
Erick Bozeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Bozeman, 31, operating under many aliases and shell 
corporations in the Cayman Islands and other exotic locales, has made more than 
$30 million in the past two years by running a ring that hollowed out 
computers, filled them with cocaine, and shipped them nationwide for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earlier this month, they say, Bozeman was living the high life, buying a 
$680,000 house in the Leona Valley in the mountains seven miles west of 
Palmdale with laundered drug proceeds, and spending $150,000 a month on travel, 
restaurants, business expenses and perks for his many associates. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 6, he was arrested while staying at a Downtown Los Angeles hotel, 
trying to hide from the FBI after many of his alleged associates had been 
caught, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was three blocks from the courthouse, which we found kind of funny," said 
Janis Gordon, an Atlanta-based assistant U.S. attorney who is leading the 
multi-state effort to prosecute Bozeman and his alleged associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman and 20 alleged associates were indicted July 19 by a federal grand 
jury in Atlanta, and there are two related cases: a Los Angeles indictment 
involving alleged money laundering affiliated with the group, and a New York 
City case that points the finger at people accused as lower-level drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Bozeman -- also known as Jason Mitchell, Erick 
Powell, Buddy Jones and "Mr. Harris" -- masterminded a drug ring that sold more 
than 2,000 pounds of cocaine, racking up profits of at least $30 million since 
1992, and laundered the money through more than a dozen offshore bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, authorities say, Bozeman will be transferred to Atlanta for 
prosecution, where he could be sentenced to a mandatory life prison term if 
convicted under the federal government's "drug kingpin" statute. 
</P>
<P>
 His trial, authorities hint, will shed light on a shadowy criminal genius. 
Bozeman blurred the line between white-collar crime and drug dealing as 
effectively as anyone ever caught by federal authorities, said Kent B. 
Alexander, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The case started more than a year ago, authorities said, when federal agents 
in Los Angeles suggested that the FBI in Atlanta investigate an alleged 
co-conspirator, who apparently failed to heed her own advice on a to-do list. 
</P>
<P>
 The note, one of many incriminating documents authorities say they found in 
the woman's trash, said: "Get paper shredder." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently she never did. FBI agents testified in an Atlanta federal court 
that in going through the woman's garbage, they found detailed computer 
printouts of drugs allegedly bought and sold by the organization, including 
price and customer lists and destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, they say, they began tracking Bozeman on his trips around the 
country and overseas, tapping phones and compiling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Bozeman used Los Angeles and Atlanta as hubs of a 
criminal enterprise that had all the trappings of a major corporation. They 
allege that spreadsheets, payrolls, fax machines and computer e-mail networks 
were used to coordinate a drug business that pulled in millions in profits 
while employing dozens of associates selling cocaine in Los Angeles, New York 
and many cities in between. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the largest cases we have ever prosecuted and one of the most 
sophisticated," Alexander said. "They were not operating out of a file cabinet 
in an apartment room. It was big business." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell Price, a lawyer representing Bozeman, said: "The indictment reflects a 
significant amount of cocaine trafficking -- at least allegations of it. But 
proving it is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The allegations don't sound good. . . . The grand jury has concluded there is 
some smoke, but I haven't seen what the grand jury has seen," said Price, who 
said his client will not enter a plea until he gets to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Price described Bozeman as an articulate, intelligent man, stocky and 
well-built, with a ready smile and an eye for detail. "He's got a very sharp, 
very quick mind," Price said. "He falls into the smart person category." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Bozeman floated from one place to another, spending lots of 
time in Los Angeles, although authorities would not say whether the Leona 
Valley house was a base of operations for the organization. At one place where 
he was staying, authorities said they found 107 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of his alleged associates went by names such as "Blue" and 
"Rock," authorities said Bozeman was not involved in gangs. "He's too 
high-class," said one, who added that Bozeman was frequently heard on wiretaps 
saying: "I don't do retail." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman is being held without bail in the federal Metropolitan Detention 
Center in Los Angeles. Authorities say that because of all his aliases -- at 
least eight that they know of -- Bozeman is a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 63-page indictment, FBI Special Agent Bill Lewis detailed how wiretaps 
caught Bozeman calling drug sources in Cali, Colombia, and placing orders for 
240 or 300 pounds of pure cocaine at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the cocaine made its way to Bozeman, authorities and court documents 
allege, it was packaged into the innards of computers and then shipped to 
various destinations in huge, bulky packages bearing innocuous corporate logos.

SHERIFF WILL FIGHT RETURN OF 5 DEPUTIES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERMAN BLOCK SAYS HE 
WILL GO TO COURT TO BAR THE REINSTATEMENT OF OFFICERS INVOLVED IN FATAL 
SHOOTING AND BEATING OF A SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said he will go to court to try to 
block the reinstatement of five deputies who were dismissed two years ago for 
their involvement in the fatal shooting and beating of a suspected kidnaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the Board of Supervisors released this week, Block said he 
intends to petition the Superior Court to review decisions made by the county 
Civil Service Commission. In May, in two separate decisions, the commission 
ruled that the dismissals were not justified and that the deputies should be 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discharged these deputies for their unprofessional conduct and for showing 
their willingness to engage in a subterfuge to avoid sanction," Block said. "I 
believe the commission's decision to grant four separate hearings in this 
matter . . . and the time frames in which the commission claims to have read 
the records, prior to rendering their final decision, cause concern that a 
thorough review may not have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Block will ask the supervisors at their regular board meeting Tuesday to 
approve the use of county counsel to represent the department in the court 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's May rulings are among a series of reversals of departmental 
firings that have raised concerns about the progress of reforms recommended two 
years ago after an inquiry found a troubling pattern of officer-involved 
shootings and excessive use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, headed by retired Superior Court Judge James G. Kolts, also 
suggested that there is not enough accountability or discipline at higher 
levels of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials, however, contend that the Civil Service Commission has 
hampered their efforts to implement reforms and fire problem officers by 
improperly reversing disciplinary decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 No representatives of the commission were available Friday to respond. The 
commission ruled 3 to 2 in May to accept the recommendations of two hearing 
officers to reinstate Deputies Jason Mann, Thomas Brownell, Timothy Anderson, 
Douglas Gillies and Timothy Running. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman said Friday that the five deputies will not 
be allowed back on the job pending the outcome of the department's court 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick J. Bobb, an attorney hired by the Board of Supervisors to monitor 
implementation of the Kolts recommendations, said he is concerned about the 
commission's reversals of departmental firings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bobb said the numbers are not so stark that he can draw any conclusions 
about whether the commission is biased in favor of deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April report on the Kolts reforms, Bobb determined that the commission 
has reversed 27% of the force-related firings it reviewed. The findings reflect 
appeals brought to the commission from 1992 to April 1 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is actually a significant decrease from a previous review, which 
found a 53% reversal rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I am able to draw any firm or final conclusion I need a better 
understanding about whether the quality of the department's investigation is as 
high as it should be," Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the five deputies could be reached for comment. But their attorney, 
Richard Shinee, called the planned court appeal a "waste of taxpayer's money." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sloppily done investigation that reached a completely erroneous 
conclusion . . . and now they are trying to save face by taking this to court," 
said Shinee, whose law firm represents the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy 
Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinee said he will pursue his own court action to have the five deputies 
reinstated. He said his clients were "ecstatic and happy" at the Civil Service 
Commission decision "because their conduct has been vindicated and their names 
have been cleared." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of seven deputies were fired for their actions in the death of 
32-year-old suspected robber and kidnaper Arthur Jones after a high-speed 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The March, 1990, incident was one of several controversial shootings of black 
or Latino suspects over the course of several months that sparked community 
protest and allegations of undue use of force by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings resulted in the creation of the Kolts inquiry, which in its 1992 
report found a deeply disturbing pattern of excessive force and brutality by 
deputies. It cited the Jones incident -- although not by name -- as an example. 
The panel also said there had been significant underreporting of the force used 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jones case, the suspect was allegedly seen by deputies robbing and 
kidnaping a man at gunpoint in Compton. A 15-minute chase ensued, in which 
deputies fired at Jones as he crashed through blockades, traveled the wrong way 
on Artesia Boulevard, and threw a shotgun and his kidnaping victim out of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, he was hit by a bullet that struck his face. Jones 
was finally stopped when pursuing deputies shot out the tires of his car. He 
emerged with his hands raised but deputies struck him several times after he 
allegedly resisted being taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report concluded that the beating was so severe that it might have 
killed him had he not already been wounded by the gunshot. Jones died three 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal sheriff's investigation determined that the deputies breached 
various departmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Service Commission sustained only one allegation, the finding that 
Mann violated policy when he failed to notify superiors that he was joining the 
pursuit and that he may have violated policy by reloading his weapon prior to 
an investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission concluded that a written reprimand, not dismissal, was the 
appropriate discipline.

SCIENTISTS SQUABBLE OVER ROCK NAMED SPOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cat. A Vulcan. And an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix them together and you have a controversy of cosmic proportions that has 
been brewing for nearly a decade around James Gibson, a planetary scientist 
from Tujunga. Gibson is the target of scientific ire because he named an 
asteroid after his late cat, Mr. Spock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that there would probably be some flak for it, but we didn't expect 
it to go this far," said Gibson, 66, who chose the name in 1985 with the help 
of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Gibson's choice is still the lightning rod for the question of how 
liberal astronomers should be in naming their discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 300 asteroids named every year, scientists are running out of 
names, and turning to those of political dissidents, musicians and even 
mistresses. That has irritated some members of the international astronomy 
group that registers such names, setting off a debate in the letters columns of 
astronomy journals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler can't get one named after him until 2045 (there is a century-long 
moratorium from the time of death on naming asteroids after military or 
political figures), but otherwise there are few restrictions: There's Asteroid 
564, named Dudu, and Asteroids 4147 to 4150, named after the four Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gibson's decision to name Asteroid 2309 after his marble gray 
tabby, who kept him company at an isolated mountaintop observatory in 
Argentina, was apparently the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to his action, a review panel at the International Astronomical 
Union in 1985 passed a resolution discouraging such pet names. Ever since, 
Gibson's cat has surfaced periodically in the written debates of scientific 
journals as an example of bad taste; some scientists expect the issue to come 
hurtling back into view next month in the Netherlands at the meeting of the 
astronomical union, which convenes every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules that now regulate such names are "not entirely satisfactory," 
concedes Brian Marsden, who serves on the IAU's Minor Planet Names Committee. 
"It can get silly. But you have to have a sense of humor in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden, putting that philosophy into practice, supported the application to 
name 2309 for Spock the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gehrels, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who 
coordinates the Spacewatch search for asteroids that may collide with the 
Earth, is anti-Spock, saying Gibson "has hurt (astronomy) enough that the 
committee will not allow it to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe most asteroids are rocky space chunks ranging from the size 
of a house to the size of a small city -- cosmic debris left over from the 
solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Asteroids are first given numbers upon their discovery. After their orbits 
have been confirmed in subsequent sightings by other astronomers, the 
discoverer has 10 years to assign a name, Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, 6,057 asteroids had been discovered hurtling through the solar 
system, about 4,600 of which have been named, said Marsden, who also serves as 
director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass. The names are 
registered by being published in the Minor Planets Circulars edited at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden said obvious names like Copernicus, Galileo and those of other famous 
astronomers have already been taken. "It does make things rather difficult when 
it comes to naming things," Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson is happy with the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 An astronomer for 36 years who previously named asteroids after his wife, 
Ursula, and his hometown of Ellensburg, Wash., Gibson submitted Spock in part 
to reaffirm that asteroids should be named after those who have made helpful, 
significant or unusual contributions to astronomy. His late cat qualifies, he 
said, but some other personal choices do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with people who name objects after the seven 
astronauts who went down in Challenger," Gibson said. "But to name an asteroid 
for a granddaughter who isn't out of the crib yet, that's a little extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spock -- so named in part because his pointy ears resembled those of the 
"Star Trek" TV series Vulcan -- deserves to be immortalized in the heavens for 
his services to astronomy by keeping Gibson company on his lonely work of 
watching the sky, the scientist figures. The tabby was often Gibson's only 
companion on moonlit walks to the lonely observatory in Argentina where he 
worked from 1971 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that observatory that he discovered Asteroid 2309 in 1971, which he 
would name after Mr. Spock in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great cat," said Gibson, recalling the nights when the friendly 
feline would spend hours outside the observatory dome waiting for him, or 
entertain the couple in their home. "He had done more for us than some people 
(that) asteroids are being named after now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spock died in 1985, shortly after the space rock was named for him. And 
Gibson has gone on to become a research assistant at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, scientists hope that the controversy over what to name asteroids is 
settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At next month's IAU general assembly of 3,000 astronomers, Marsden said he 
expects to pitch a simpler idea: allowing a computer to invent names by 
randomly grouping several melodic vowels and consonants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name won't make any sense to anybody," Marsden said. "But at least it 
will sound good."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SANTA 
MONICA FREEWAY RAMPS REOPEN 4 DAYS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repairs to the quake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway were virtually completed 
Friday with the reopening of two connector ramps at La Cienega Boulevard, four 
days ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic started moving on the off-ramp from eastbound freeway lanes to 
northbound La Cienega and the on-ramp from southbound La Cienega to the 
eastbound freeway at 4:35 a.m., according to Margie Tiritilli, a Caltrans 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Meyers Inc., the Sacramento construction firm that won a $14.5-million 
bonus for its completion of overpass reconstruction work two months ahead of 
schedule, was not eligible for a bonus for its early completion of the La 
Cienega ramp work. The $3.8-million ramp contract was let on May 13 and the 
scheduled completion date was Tuesday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; BANK CAMERA 
DID NOT FILM SUSPECT IN FATAL ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI officials said Friday that a San Pedro bank's surveillance camera failed 
to capture a woman who shot and killed a security guard during a robbery with 
two male accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, a teller has to activate the camera," said FBI spokesman John 
Hoos."It was apparently activated, but it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, security guard Juan A. Corona-Garcia, 36, of Los Angeles was 
shot in the neck as he struggled with the robber inside the Home Bank branch on 
South Gaffey Street. He died later at a hospital. The suspects fled with an 
undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera had been installed by the Bank of San Pedro, which was seized by 
state banking regulators on July 15. Home Bank bought the branch and reopened 
it under its new name Monday.

Edmund A. Gray Co., and Mayson's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gray was accosted at gunpoint Tuesday morning as he was leaving his 
Pasadena condominium to go to work. The abductors left him about 16 hours later

CITY'S PROMISE OF QUAKE RECOVERY PLAN UNFULFILLED; BUREAUCRACY: ASSISTANCE 
TEAMS, HOT LINE ARE DUE TO BE SET UP IN SEPTEMBER. CRITICS SAY THAT IS TOO 
LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after the Northridge quake hobbled hundreds of businesses, the city 
of Los Angeles has yet to deploy business assistance teams and begin a hot line 
for quake assistance information -- measures that were promised in a disaster 
recovery plan adopted five days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers to Mayor Richard Riordan, who is also the head of the emergency 
operations panel that adopted the plan, contend that the city has taken steps 
to fulfill the promise by getting federal funding for the teams and the hot 
line. Both should be in place by September, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gearing up to hire eight to 10 staff people for two years to provide 
business and technical assistance to businesses affected by the earthquake," 
said Mary Leslie, deputy mayor for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some City Hall officials and business owners say that will be too 
late and blame Riordan for allowing the initially strong momentum of the 
recovery effort to wane. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle said a September starting date for the assistance 
measures may be too late, noting that the deadline for businesses to submit 
Small Business Administration loan applications is Sept. 17. "This all needs to 
move faster," he said. "It seems that a process that doesn't start until 
September is too late." 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical help the city can offer, Tuttle said, is to contact and 
provide help to quake-damaged businesses that have not turned in loan 
applications or have been denied a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 9 letter to the mayor, Tuttle stressed the need for the business 
assistance teams. And in a June 29 letter to Riordan and City Council President 
John Ferraro, he suggested that they invite President Clinton, Gov. Pete Wilson 
and other top officials to a summit meeting in Los Angeles to discuss the next 
steps in the quake recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles cannot afford to continue losing businesses, watch homes and 
multifamily housing units disappear and not see recovery from this natural 
disaster," Tuttle said in the June 29 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle and others say the need for assistance is apparent in the gap between 
the number of SBA loan applications issued to business owners and the far lower 
number turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 About 135,000 applications for business loans were distributed by the SBA as 
of July 17, but only about 43,600 were filled out. So far, the overall approval 
rate is about 50%, lower than the approval rate after Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ferraro spokesperson said the councilman is trying to arrange a session with 
the mayor and Tuttle to plan a summit meeting with federal and state officials. 
But Ferraro stopped short of criticizing the mayor's efforts, saying only that 
he would "like to see this whole process expedited," the spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's disaster recovery plan, which was being drafted months before the 
Jan. 17 quake but was approved Jan. 22, calls for the mayor to establish 
assistance teams and a hot line to provide quake-damaged businesses easy access 
to information on loans, permit applications and engineering work, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ourieff, owner of Michael J's pizza in Sherman Oaks, said he could use 
such help in his effort to relocate his business after it suffered about 
$20,000 in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he spent about a month getting an SBA loan approved to pay for the 
repairs and is frustrated because he cannot persuade the SBA to let him use the 
money to relocate instead of rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't get some help or if I don't get lucky, I'm going to put 30 people 
out of work," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials and business leaders praise the city's recovery efforts 
and say the business assistance called for by Tuttle has been offered by other 
groups and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Curry, president of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando 
Valley, said his group and other Valley business organizations have been 
providing owners with assistance for months. "I didn't think the city needed to 
do that because it was essentially being done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick said she was shocked at the news that the assistance 
measures promised by the city will not be in place until nine months after the 
disaster. "How can we think that something that starts nine months later is 
going to work?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Leslie, a former administrator for the SBA, defended the city's 
recovery efforts, saying assistance is provided through four centers, partially 
funded by the city, and seven state-funded centers. The centers give business 
owners information and technical help in getting recovery loans or grants, she 
said.

JUDGE CLEARS THE WAY FOR USE OF MENENDEZ TAPE; COURTS: BROTHERS CONFESS TO 
KILLING PARENTS IN RECORDING OF THERAPY SESSION. DEFENSE HAD CLAIMED 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the Menendez brothers murder case cleared the way Friday for 
prosecutors to present the most explosive evidence from the first trial, the 
tape recording in which the brothers confess they killed their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg rejected the defense claim 
that the contents of the tape -- recorded Dec. 11, 1989, by the brothers' 
therapist -- had once again become secret under the rules of 
psychologist-patient confidentiality that usually apply to therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense bid was based on technicalities in the rules of court evidence. 
Although it was the defense that played the tape at the first trial, the 
brothers' attorneys insisted Friday that the rules gave Lyle and Erik Menendez 
the right to resurrect a claim of secrecy at the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weisberg said that when the tape was aired at the first trial, any secrecy 
was ended. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear when the tape will be played again for jurors. A start date 
for a new trial remains bogged down over the issue of how much of the brothers' 
testimony will be presented at the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 After asking Friday for more legal briefs, Weisberg scheduled an Oct. 27 
hearing to pick a start date. He said he also will decide then whether the 
retrial will be before one jury or two, one for each brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it was evident Friday that the Menendez trial, which had been the 
preeminent court drama in Los Angeles and across the nation, has lost the 
spotlight to the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in months, there were a few empty seats in the courtroom. 
Court TV, which was covering Friday's hearing live from Van Nuys, switched to 
the Simpson case, then came back to the Menendez case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the brothers still drew the usual crowd of about a dozen avid supporters. 
"Nice shirt," someone called to Lyle Menendez, 26, who sported a new plaid 
dominated by blues and greens. Erik Menendez, 23, wore a new red shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, they look good," another supporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers remain in County Jail without bail. They face first-degree 
murder charges in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, 
entertainment executive Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, which began one year ago this week and ended in January, 
separate juries deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers admit to killing their parents in the TV room of the family's 
Beverly Hills mansion. But they testified that they lashed out only after years 
of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, contend that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Dec. 11, 1989, tape, the brothers tell psychologist L. Jerome Oziel 
that they killed their mother to put her "out of her misery" and that their 
father's infidelity caused her despair. 
</P>
<P>
 On tape, the brothers present the killings as far from a spur-of-the-moment 
act of self-defense. Lyle Menendez told Oziel: "There was no way I was gonna 
make a decision to kill my mother without Erik's consent. I was going, I didn't 
even wanna influence him in that issue. I just let him sleep on it for a couple 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-minute recording also includes a comment from Lyle Menendez that he 
missed his parents but also missed "not having my dog around." That comment set 
off gasps in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the first trial, prosecutors asked Weisberg to order that the 
tape be released. 
</P>
<P>
 He did so near the end of testimony, saying that the brothers had opted to 
make their mental state a central issue in the case. By doing so, he said, they 
erased the protection of the rules of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preemptive strike, the defense then played the tape for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have made it plain that they plan to play the tape early in the 
retrial and refer to it often. "It's a very difficult piece of evidence for the 
defense to explain away," Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn said Friday outside 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape also offers prosecutors the tactical advantage of not having to rely 
on Oziel's testimony. The therapist, who was the prosecution's chief witness at 
the first trial, became the target of a relentless cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contended Friday that the tape had once again become confidential. 
Until the brothers take the stand again to discuss their emotions the night of 
the killings, the defense contended, their mental state is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's attorney, promised an appeal. 
Weisberg, she said after the hearing ended, "will only change his rulings to 
favor the prosecution. He will not change his rulings to favor the defense."

AL MARTINEZ: ALL THE LONELY PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Timothy Murphy. It isn't a household name yet, so don't trouble 
yourself trying to remember who he is. True, he was a Burbank city councilman 
once, but that won't buy anyone a place in "Who's Who." 
</P>
<P>
 You might recall his dad, Tom Murphy, who was a Superior Court judge in L.A. 
for a lot of years and still sits on the bench occasionally. But Tim is 
relatively new at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 I met him the other day at the Criminal Courts Building, where he's serving as 
a court commissioner. That's someone who's appointed by sitting judges to 
handle the awesome overload of cases in L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy is 41, was born here and practiced law for 13 years before becoming a 
commissioner 18 months ago. He has a wife and three sons, and his chambers are 
filled with their presence, from photographs to stuffed toys. I mention that 
because it's important. You'll see. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote me a letter earlier this month commenting on a column about a growing 
meanness in L.A. It was a thoughtful, caring letter. He said so many young 
people passed through his courtroom on their way to prison without anyone 
caring. Not relatives, not friends, not even fellow gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed," he wrote. "The fears and the rules have changed as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a deep and abiding sadness to the note, not the kind I usually 
receive from judges. I had to meet this Timothy Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His courtroom is on the 11th floor. You don't get high-profile cases in this 
modest arena of civil order, cast in tones of brown and dusty blue; no 
celebrity defendants with million-dollar lawyers. Ordinary felons file by here, 
accompanied by attorneys with briefcases borne through many battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where justice happens," one lawyer said to me, "five days a week, 
every week of the month, every month of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 I was there for one of the days. An accused killer passed through and so did 
an accused armed robber and three accused thieves, all but one barely in 
adulthood. Most were there to have trial dates set. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession of those charged with felonies seemed endless. "We're full," 
Murphy said from the bench, waving his arms to indicate incoming flights. "I 
feel like LAX." 
</P>
<P>
 One defendant was 19 but looked 15, a child-man who, in the orange, 
loose-fitting garb of a County Jail inmate, looked a little like a kid playing 
dress-up. He pleaded guilty to car theft and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy sentenced him to 16 months in prison, then leaned forward to say 
gently, the way a father might, "When you get there, take a good look at the 
future. A way out of this mess is school and family. If you want to spend the 
rest of your life in a cage, you're headed that way. Think it over." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was what I wrote you about," Murphy said later, talking about the young 
man. "No one was there for him today. No one is there for any of them. They're 
alone in the world. I feel like a lunatic giving these speeches, but someone's 
got to say to them, 'Look, this isn't the way. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's different, this Timothy Murphy. He cares not only about the way he raises 
his own kids, but enough about others to start a youth club in his community. 
And he cares deeply about those who come before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His comments from the bench are unique," one attorney said during a recess. 
"He really talks to people. His attitude makes us better lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, he told a prospective juror who thought her sister was a 
court clerk, but wasn't sure, that she ought to get to know her sister better. 
Family is important, he said to her. Go home and give her a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 His own family, he told me, was his top priority. Being a good parent was the 
most difficult job in the world, but one he relished. He would almost rather 
stay home and raise his sons than gauge the human misery that passes before 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never met a jurist quite like him. During one session with opposing 
lawyers, he left the bench and, still robed, tidied up the courtroom by moving 
chairs around and stacking papers neatly on a desk while participating in legal 
discussions. No one seemed surprised. That was just him. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders what will become of Timothy Murphy, who presides with passion in a 
fluorescent-lit domain of muted emotions, and who worries about the loneliness 
of those he judges. He doesn't know whether his tour as a commissioner will 
lead to a larger judicial future. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope it does . . . though, given his intense capacity for caring, sitting in 
judgment on all those lonely people may turn out to be the loneliest place of 
all.

LOANS TO REBUILD QUAKE 'GHOST TOWNS' OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of five damaged apartment buildings located in so-called ghost 
towns created by the Northridge earthquake will get $7.75 million in federal 
loans to rebuild the structures, the Los Angeles City Council decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest-free loans are the first from a $109-million pool of emergency 
funds provided by federal housing officials to help owners of apartments, 
condominiums and single-family homes who were turned down for Small Business 
Administration loans after the quake. The city's Housing Department is managing 
the loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 About $20 million of the pool has been set aside for severely damaged 
apartment buildings within clusters of vacant buildings that have been overrun 
by criminals and the homeless, areas known by housing officials as ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already launched a multi-phased plan to eliminate 13 ghost towns 
in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and Mid-City areas. Private security 
guards have been hired by the city to keep vandals out of damaged buildings 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Teherani, who was awarded a $1-million loan Friday, owns a 59-unit 
apartment building in Chatsworth that he said was "lifted and thrown down 
again" by the temblor. It now sits vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was in dire straits when the SBA rejected his application. But now 
Teherani says he will be able to repair and rent out his apartments within four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this wasn't available, believe me, not only the building would have been 
destroyed but all our work and effort would have been destroyed," he said after 
the council decision. "I've been on my knees praying about this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest loan -- for $2 million -- went to Jean Weir and Richard Fuchs, 
co-owners of a 61-unit apartment building on DeSoto Avenue in the same 
Chatsworth ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir said the federal loan provided through the city was a welcome relief 
after the SBA rejected their application. "There wasn't any other alternative," 
she said. "You kind of expect the SBA to be helpful in this but we didn't get 
their help." 
</P>
<P>
 The city may have saved itself some money and problems because without the 
federal loan, Weir said, the city probably would have been left with the task 
of demolishing the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of 3,400 other apartment units who failed to get SBA loans have also 
lined up for the 30-year loans. A housing committee of the council recommended 
Friday that the city give the next $1.1 million loan to the owner of a heavily 
damaged Northridge apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is expected to loan $30 million of the federal money by mid-August 
and the entire $109 million by fall, said Gary Squier, general manager of the 
city's housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 But the loan money is expected to fall about $375 million short of the total 
needed to cover all the repair work rejected by the SBA, he said. City 
officials do not yet know how that gap will be filled, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans have one catch: Apartment building owners must set aside 20% of the 
units for affordable housing. But Squier said the owners have not complained 
about this requirement. "We don't see this as a problem," he said.

STATE CITES PASADENA FIRE DEPARTMENT; SAFETY: CAL/OSHA FINDS IMPROPER TRAINING 
AND EQUIPPING OF PERSONNEL DURING LAST FALL'S WILDFIRES. CITY SAYS IT WILL 
CORRECT THE PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH and RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-month investigation, state safety officials have cited the 
Pasadena Fire Department for improperly training and equipping firefighters, 
including failing to provide firefighters with personal fire shields during a 
devastating blaze in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety problems, which resulted in citations Thursday, also have sparked a 
claim by a former city inspector that he was fired after telling supervisors 
about the alleged deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 30 days to take action to correct the eight citations issued by 
the State Division of Occupational Safety and Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA spokesman Rick Rice said Friday the state agency cannot fine a public 
fire department. But if a private facility had the same violations, it could 
have been fined as much as $56,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could significantly impact on the safety or life of an employee," Rice 
said. "They're serious violations." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Councilman William M. Paparian, chairman of the council's Public 
Safety Committee, said he has ordered City Manager Philip A. Hawkey to prepare 
a report on the Cal/OSHA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the department is working to correct the problems. They 
blamed record-keeping for many of the violations. Firefighters had received 
adequate training but the training was not properly documented, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are areas we need to pay attention to, particularly 
record-keeping," Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol said. "I was pleased there were no 
serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 These violations were cited: 
</P>
<P>
 * Firefighters had not been provided with fire shields when fighting brush 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Fire Department did not properly train all firefighters in techniques to 
avoid injury when battling wildfires, including proper deployment of fire 
shields. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department did not properly train all firefighters for rescues in 
confined spaces and trenches, where collapse is a possibility. Nor did the 
department have a written safety program addressing all the hazards faced by 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department failed to replace protective clothing that had become worn or 
had holes that could get caught on branches or other objects and prevent a 
firefighter from escaping advancing flames. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department did not properly inform firefighters of the dangers of and 
precautions in handling fire-retardant or chemicals encountered in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA began its investigation last April after an unidentified firefighter 
filed a complaint, said Fire Capt. John Tennant, president of the Pasadena 
Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most significant violations was the failure to distribute the fire 
shields during the Oct. 27 fire, which burned 5,700 acres and 123 homes in the 
Altadena and Pasadena area. 
</P>
<P>
 Pekerol said his department had the shelters in storage but they were not 
issued, largely because a Fire Department committee had not approved their use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no injuries and only lost two homes (in Pasadena) and 500 homes were 
in the face of the fire so we did something right," Pekerol said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tennant said the situation could have turned deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a claim is pending against Pasadena alleging that the city's safety 
officer, George Leverette, was fired for pointing out the safety problems to 
Hawkey, Pekerol and other top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said Leverette was dismissed from his $49,000-a-year job 
on June 3 for failing to first report problems to his immediate supervisor.

VATICAN SEEKS ISLAMIC ALLIES IN CLASH WITH U.N. OVER POPULATION CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Vatican spokesman says the Catholic Church is seeking out allies in the 
Islamic world to defend the family and, especially, the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, a Colombian, the Vatican will 
hold a large interreligious conference on the family at the end of September, 
in which several Islamic delegations will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome has already sought assistance from Islamic countries to work at the 
United Nations Conference on Population and Development to be held in Cairo 
Sept. 5-13. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting is expected to turn into a kind of showdown between the Holy See 
and its allies -- mostly developing nations -- on one side, and the United 
Nations, the United States and other wealthy nations on the other. The main 
point of contention is access to abortion and artificial contraceptives 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Islamic teaching condemns abortion," Lopez Trujillo said in an interview with 
the Rome daily Il Tempo. "But some Arab governments are subject to the 
influence of political pressure from the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials have on a number of occasions decried the practice of tying 
aid for developing countries to birth control programs as a new kind of 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The cardinal said a number of heads of states from underdeveloped countries 
are in agreement with the Holy See and skeptical of the U.N.'s plans for 
population control. But their hands are tied, he said, by the funds they 
receive from international agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all the presidents were free from these kinds of pressures, certainly a 
greater number of countries would be more consciously against the unacceptable 
and ambiguous points of the preparatory document for the Cairo conference," 
Lopez Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the World Council of Churches, General Secretary Konrad Raiser, 
last week attacked the Vatican's constant campaign concerning the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiser argued that the Vatican's repeated worries -- widespread access to 
abortion and contraception -- risked clouding over another important Catholic 
interest: social development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catholic leaders have argued precisely that point: More than 90% of the 
preparations for the meeting have been about population control, they claim, 
and less than 10% about development. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez Trujillo was especially strong in his attack on the United States, which 
he said wants to make abortion accessible to all the countries of the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government adds that this should be 'safe and rare,' " the cardinal said. 
"But what does this mean? Safe for the health of the mother. But what about the 
child conceived, shouldn't it be equally respected?"

<P>
 Why are there so few religious institutions that can compete academically with 
America's premier colleges and universities? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question that two Pepperdine University researchers will attempt 
to answer in a yearlong nationwide study of Christian higher education funded 
by a $106,000 Lilly Endowment grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Christian institutions of higher learning determine that their religious 
commitment is a detriment to serious scholarship and eventually shed their 
Christian orientation," said Richard Hughes, a professor of religion at 
Pepperdine, who will direct the project beginning Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harvard, Yale, Vanderbilt, the University of Chicago and a host of other 
major research institutions that began with a distinctly Christian foundation 
are examples. At the same time, conservative church-related institutions 
sometimes find it difficult to reconcile first-rate scholarship with their 
faith commitments," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he added, there are few religiously oriented colleges and 
universities that measure up academically with the nation's most elite 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of religious schools that are quite good but very few that 
are just sterling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the Catholic university Notre Dame and the Jewish-affiliated Brandeis 
University as two outstanding exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Protestantism doesn't have a major flagship institution," he noted, "perhaps 
because it is divided into so many denominations." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the Reformed-affiliated Calvin College in Michigan for producing an 
"amazing number" of first-rate scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps it is because the Calvinist heritage takes very seriously the notion 
that everything is a part of God's creation," he said, "and has an intellectual 
tradition of not being afraid of looking at any particular idea, even if it may 
seem threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to speculate on a possible explanation for the apparent dearth of such 
schools, Hughes said: "I think that sometimes people in all faiths -- not only 
Christians -- think, 'My world view is the only world view.' Yet the essence of 
a university is the opposite. First-rate scholarship means taking the world 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said the study would ask whether certain faith traditions sustain 
serious scholarship better than others because of their outlook on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will examine how religious missions and academic quality can be 
effectively integrated at 15 Christian institutions of higher learning that 
represent seven faith traditions: Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, 
Mennonite, Wesleyan/Holiness, Evangelical/Interdenominational and 
Baptistic/Restorationist. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faith category will include a school from the West Coast and one from the 
rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars at each institution will write a narrative history that examines 
their school's efforts to integrate faith and learning from its founding to the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 They will explore how the institution conceives of the tasks of teaching and 
scholarship, and the relationship between the two; and a host of issues ranging 
from the way the institution portrays itself to its internal and external 
constituencies to religious patterns of student recruitment and financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The narratives will be edited by Hughes and William Adrian, a former 
Pepperdine provost and director of the university's London Program, who will 
serve as a consultant to the project. The articles will be published in book 
form and circulated widely among Christian colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hughes: "We hope it will stimulate serious conversation about these 
issues." OTHER GRANTS

 Surrounded by sand, slathered in sunscreen and holding the coldest of beers in 
your hot hand, you are sprawled out and gulping down the California Dream.

 Until an ominous shadow blocks your sun, pours out your beer and hands you a

 If Los Angeles beaches are known nationwide as the place to catch West Coast 
rays and a summer beer buzz, law enforcement officials are going out of their 
way to change one-half of that image. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to drink on all public beaches and at the hundreds of city and 
county parks in Los Angeles, they point out, and -- unlike the openness of a 
decade or two ago -- officers no longer let a little tan-time imbibing slide.

 At Malibu beaches, lifeguards patrol on four-wheelers and in pickups, and

<P>
 And when they do, it's often the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department they 
call. No leniency should be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have zero tolerance," said Sheriff's Sgt. Marty Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies will write about 45 citations -- typically costing $50 apiece -- at 
Malibu-area beaches on an average weekend day, and hundreds more on a big 
holiday. For every person cited, four or five others are warned, have their 
alcohol taken away and are sometimes even booted from the beach, Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the majority of those interviewed at beaches and in Valley parks this 
past week were in favor of the alcohol ban -- which has been in effect in most 
places for decades -- others called it a perfect example of overzealous 
American law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, who ever heard of a French police officer pouring out a picnicker's 
bottle of Bordeaux? 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a Chatsworth park, sipping noontime Budweisers, a couple who 
identified themselves only as John and Ellen said they and other responsible 
drinkers are needlessly punished for the irresponsibility of a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about getting plastered," Ellen said. "Leave people alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The enforcers of the law say a blanket ban became more and more essential 
because for years all too many beach- and park-goers were indeed getting 
plastered. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come to the beach, drink all day, and by afternoon become pretty 
nasty," said Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinances banning alcohol from parks and beaches are nothing new, with most 
initiated as early as the 1950s, said Malibu lifeguard Lt. Steve Wood. But many 
Southlanders -- and tourists to the area -- still aren't aware of the laws, he 
said. Others knowingly violate them because doing so used to be a rarely 
punished offense. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1970s, though, alcohol-related drownings, assaults and post-picnic 
car accidents had become a serious problem, and agencies began cracking down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, park rangers and lifeguards now patrol Southland hot spots regularly, 
searching for the telltale glint of a beer bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers eye open coolers and ask to look in closed ones. (They must ask -- 
and you can say no -- unless they have probable cause to believe a violation 
has occurred, according to the American Civil Liberties Union). They have even 
taken to sniffing at cups in an attempt to distinguish apple juice from beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerted effort has driven drinking sun seekers to resourcefulness, as 
they now attempt to camouflage their alcohol by swigging from coffee thermoses 
or Styrofoam cups, or even sucking on alcohol-soaked fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a small cottage industry. . . . They have a small cellophane wrapper 
that says 'Pepsi' on it and you wrap it around your beer can," said Department 
of Beaches and Harbors spokesman Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The keen-eyed cop, however, can spot the fake, and the punishment can range 
from a metaphorical slap on the wrist to the literal jailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, those ignorant of the no-alcohol law -- usually evident by their 
chugging away openly -- will lose their contraband and may be asked to leave 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Those caught trying to hide their drinking will probably receive a citation of 
about $50 and a court date. And arrests are possible for those with prior 
violations or those who have been involved in a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the penalties seem harsh, officials say the payoffs have been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because several agencies are involved in enforcing the laws, no comprehensive 
statistics exist, but officials consistently say that alcohol-related problems 
-- ranging from drownings to automobile accidents to assaults and even murders 
-- have decreased considerably from the freewheeling times of 15 or 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less fights, less traffic accidents, less injuries," said Chief John 
Zrofsky of the L.A. County Park Police. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is far from complete, however. Alcohol remains "probably our biggest 
problem" at parks, said Zrofsky. "It takes up a major portion of my officers' 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 For those dead-set on drinking at a park, special group permits are available. 
They are not easily obtained, however. Among other things, the group must hire 
at least one security guard during the event and purchase a minimum of $1 
million in liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 While the no-drinking laws certainly leave some with a bad taste in their 
mouths, it's not only law enforcement types who think such regulation is a good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors waiting for clouds to burn off at Zuma Beach one recent afternoon 
overwhelmingly supported the ban, saying an alcohol-and-ocean mix is especially 
dangerous because of the potential for drownings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't belong on the beach," said Gabriel Gagnon of North Hollywood. 
"I've been to beaches where they allow alcohol, and it isn't worth it."

20TH CENTURY DEFENDS CANCELLATIONS; INSURANCE: THE COMPANY PRESIDENT SAYS 
HOMEOWNERS' COVERAGE COULD BE DROPPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNDERWRITING 
STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to a California Department of Insurance investigation of its 
practices since the Northridge quake, 20th Century Industries said Friday it is 
not violating the state's June 9 order by canceling some of its homeowners' 
policies ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 James O. Curley, president of the Woodland Hills-based insurer beset by quake 
losses and angry policyholders, defended the cancellations made before the end 
of the two-year grace period promised under the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi declined through a spokeswoman to 
comment on 20th Century's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said earlier this week that the Insurance Department was 
investigating whether 20th Century was violating the department's order -- or 
at least the spirit of the order -- by not renewing all of its existing 
homeowner policies for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley said, "Although existing homeowner and condominium owner policies will 
be renewed for two years, 20th Century will continue to apply its usual 
underwriting standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That process may result in the company canceling some homeowners policies 
midterm, as provided by the California Insurance Code due to reasons such as 
fraud, misrepresentation or non-payment of premiums," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also may not renew a policy, said Curley, "based upon careful 
evaluation of the risks and may consider factors such as claim frequency and 
substantial change in the insurable condition or use of the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the January disaster, 20th Century has canceled some homeowners' 
policies, saying quake damage made their homes no longer insurable. One 
cancellation notice obtained by The Times is dated June 14, five days after the 
company agreed not to leave its policyholders stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would really like to know what the quid pro quo was in that agreement," 
said Michael Ramirez-Mares, president of the 20th Century Policyholders Quake 
Action Group. "It's not clear from the order why the commissioner agreed to it, 
or why he agreed without holding hearings to allow our neighbors to tell the 
commissioner face to face what the impact would be on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached after 20th Century said claims from the Northridge 
quake had left the company's cushion against future losses dangerously 
depleted. Since then, many other companies have limited the number of new 
homeowners policies they will issue in California -- or have stopped selling 
them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its deal with the state, 20th Century is supposed to gradually get out 
of the quake insurance business during the next 12 months and out of 
homeowners' insurance in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 That will leave the company with just its lucrative cut-rate auto insurance 
business, the main engine that has driven its growth and earnings for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But 20th Century's car insurance business could be vulnerable to a consumer 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 A high percentage of the company's homeowner customers also have 20th Century 
auto insurance. At a meeting last week, more than 100 of those homeowners said 
they were thinking about canceling their car insurance because they believe 
20th Century has treated them shabbily since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They negotiated their extraction from the homeowners market in part because 
they saw their auto business was viable," said Ramirez-Mares, a criminal 
defense lawyer forced out of his Granada Hills home by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if 20th Century wants to stay in our neighborhood and be our local 
carrier, they have to finish the business of taking care of our damaged homes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th Century policyholder group also intends to keep the pressure on state 
regulators, who have met several times with insurance industry executives and 
consumer advocates recently to seek possible solutions to the insurance crisis. 
Another meeting is scheduled next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wants Garamendi to guarantee replacement coverage -- including 
earthquake protection -- for 20th Century customers dropped by the company 
before they have settled their claims from the Northridge quake and made the 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it unconscionable that an insurance company that collected premiums 
over time from its customers would leave the insured in a condition where they 
are unable to obtain (replacement) insurance," said Kathy Trapani, president of 
CARe, a Northridge-based consumer group formed to deal with quake-related 
insurance problems. It now has more than 2,000 people on its mailing list, most 
of them San Fernando Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a moral obligation that needs to be fulfilled here," Trapani said. 
"If 20th Century doesn't have the finances to do it, someone needs to carry 
these people until they are insurable."

SCHOOL ANIMAL FARM CLOSED OVER POOR CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An animal farm at Grant High School was closed and the 26 animals sent to 
other facilities because of "deplorable conditions" at the campus, including 
filthy pens without shade that were littered with trash, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals were seized by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals/Southern California Humane Society, whose investigators were 
alerted to the problems by a parent whose young child had seen a sick goat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the investigators, two goats were in the worst physical shape. 
One goat was walking on its knees. Other animals taken from the small farm 
included a dozen chickens, six sheep, three pigs, two goats, two ducks and a 
calf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a horrendous educational example," said Madeline Bernstein, the 
executive director of the Los Angeles SPCA/SCHS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason you have animals on the campus is to teach care and 
responsibility for other living things. When you have the opposite -- when you 
have conditions like this -- you're teaching that it's OK that a goat can't 
walk, that it's OK they're not regularly fed or cleaned." 
</P>
<P>
 The animal husbandry program no longer will be offered at the school and 
animals no longer will be permitted on campus, said Eve Sherman, principal at 
Grant. She said the teacher who oversees the farm is out of town and that she 
allowed the officials to remove the animals. "We basically relinquished them 
(the animals) because they weren't getting the care they should have -- 
especially during the summer," Sherman said. "The facility just wasn't prepared 
for them -- that's really the biggest part of it. We feel we've taken care of 
it in a responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The school had been cited by the city two years ago for problems with the 
animal pens and told to remove the litter and debris. Sherman, who has been 
principal at the school for a year, said she knew of the previous problems but 
that she was giving the teacher a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're new, you give everyone the benefit of the doubt, a fair shake," 
Sherman said. "But I'm very disturbed by this. I'm an animal lover and I don't 
want anything to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The school avoided criminal charges because the animals were relinquished and 
no more animals will be kept at the facility, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's animal husbandry program was small and was part of a bigger, 
horticultural program, Sherman said. The farm facility now will be used for the 
horticultural classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals were supposed to be cared for during the summer but that 
responsibility obviously had been shirked, Sherman said. She said she plans to 
investigate the situation further with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who attend a summer program at Valley College, adjacent to the Grant 
campus, noticed the animals through a fence, Bernstein said. She said the 
children were upset when they saw the goat that couldn't walk, and one of the 
mothers called her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goat is 1,000% better with simple veterinary treatment," Bernstein said. 
"It absolutely is a shame. Kids really benefit a lot from taking care of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do so much more damage when you allow this to happen."

KINGPIN SHIPPED COCAINE IN COMPUTERS, AUTHORITIES SAY; CRIME: ERICK BOZEMAN IS 
ACCUSED OF RUNNING A VAST DRUG OPERATION. HIS LEONA VALLEY HOME MAY HAVE BEEN A 
STAGING AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many have made their fortunes in the booming business of computers and 
information technology, but no one, authorities say, did it quite like Erick 
Bozeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Bozeman, operating under many aliases and shell 
corporations in the Cayman Islands and other exotic locales, has made more than 
$30 million in the past two years by running a ring that hollowed out 
computers, filled them with cocaine and shipped them nationwide for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman, they say, was living the high life, buying a $680,000 house in Leona 
Valley seven miles west of Palmdale with laundered drug proceeds, and spending 
$150,000 a month on travel, restaurants, business expenses and perks for his 
many associates until earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 6, Bozeman was arrested while staying at a Downtown Los Angeles hotel, 
trying to hide from the FBI after many of his alleged associates had been 
caught, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was three blocks from the courthouse, which we found kind of funny," said 
Janis Gordon, an Atlanta-based assistant U.S. attorney who is leading the 
multi-state effort to prosecute Bozeman and his alleged associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman and 20 others were indicted July 19 by a federal grand jury in 
Atlanta, and there are two related cases: a Los Angeles indictment involving 
alleged money launderers affiliated with the group, and a New York City case 
that fingers alleged lower-level drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Bozeman -- also known as Jason Mitchell, Erick 
Powell, Buddy Jones and Mr. Harris -- masterminded a drug ring that sold more 
than 2,000 pounds of cocaine, racking up at least $30 million in profits since 
1992, then laundering it through more than a dozen offshore bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, authorities say, Bozeman will be shipped back to Atlanta for 
prosecution, where he could be sentenced to a mandatory life prison term if 
convicted under the federal government's so-called "drug kingpin" statute. 
</P>
<P>
 His trial, authorities have hinted in interviews and court documents, will 
shed light on the shadowy world of a jovial criminal genius. Bozeman blurred 
the line between white-collar crime and drug dealing as effectively as anyone 
ever caught by federal authorities, said Kent B. Alexander, U.S. attorney for 
the Northern District of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The case started more than a year ago, authorities said, when federal agents 
in Los Angeles suggested the FBI in Atlanta investigate an alleged 
co-conspirator, who apparently failed to heed her own advice on a to-do list 
she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The note, one of many incriminating documents authorities say they found in 
the woman's trash, said: "Get paper shredder." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, she never did. FBI agents testified in an Atlanta federal court 
that in going through the woman's garbage, they found detailed computer 
printouts of drugs allegedly bought and sold by the organization, including 
prices, customer lists and destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, they say, they began tracking Bozeman on his trips around the 
country and overseas, tapping phones and compiling enough evidence to put him 
away for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Bozeman used Los Angeles and Atlanta as hubs of a 
criminal enterprise that had all the trappings of a major corporation. They 
allege that spreadsheets, payrolls, fax machines, computer e-mail networks and 
other sophisticated means were used to coordinate a drug business that pulled 
in millions of dollars while employing dozens of associates selling cocaine in 
Los Angeles, New York and many cities in between. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the largest cases we have ever prosecuted and one of the most 
sophisticated," Alexander said. "They were not operating out of a file cabinet 
in an apartment room. It was big business." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell Price, a lawyer representing Bozeman, said, "The indictment reflects a 
significant amount of cocaine trafficking, at least allegations of it. But 
proving it is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The allegations don't sound good. . . . The grand jury has concluded there is 
some smoke, but I haven't seen what the grand jury has seen," said Price, who 
added that his client won't enter a plea until he gets to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the 31-year-old Bozeman as an articulate, intelligent man, stocky 
and well-built, with a ready smile and an eye for detail. "He's got a very 
sharp, very quick mind," Price said. "He falls into the smart person category." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Bozeman floated from one place to another and spent a lot of 
time in Los Angeles, although authorities would not say whether the Leona 
Valley house was a base of operations for the organization. At one place where 
he was staying, authorities said they found 107 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lived wherever he felt like living," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of his alleged associates went by names such as "Blue" and 
"Rock," authorities said Bozeman was not involved in gangs. "He's too 
high-class," said one, adding that Bozeman was frequently heard on wiretaps 
saying: "I don't do retail." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman is being held without bail in the federal Metropolitan Detention 
Center in Los Angeles. Authorities say that because of all his aliases -- at 
least eight they are aware of -- Bozeman is a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other defendants were arrested before he was, and I'm surprised that Mr. 
Bozeman didn't leave" the country, Alexander said. "But I'm glad that he will 
be making an appearance" in court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, authorities are moving to seize the Leona Valley property, 
four Georgia properties, 19 bank accounts and $30 million in currency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, three days after a superseding indictment was handed down in 
Atlanta, Gordon and other authorities had little comment on the specifics of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 63-page indictment, and in testimony last month before an Atlanta 
federal judge, Gordon and an FBI agent said authorities have gathered vast 
amounts of evidence against Bozeman and his many alleged co-conspirators 
through the use of phone wiretap surveillance -- and computer records, 
including those found in the discarded garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with hundreds and hundreds of kilograms of cocaine," Gordon 
told U.S. Magistrate Joel Feldman. "This is a very strong case. Each of these 
defendants has been wiretapped directly discussing procedures and transfers of 
money, and on occasion drugs within the Bozeman organization." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Special Agent Bill Lewis detailed how wiretaps caught Bozeman personally 
calling drug sources in Cali, Colombia, and placing orders for up to 300 pounds 
of pure cocaine at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the cocaine made its way to Bozeman, authorities and court documents 
allege, it was packaged into the innards of computers and shipped out to 
various destinations in huge, bulky packages bearing innocuous corporate logos. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents waiting outside one location last November watched as the computer 
boxes were taken inside, then dumped outside after being emptied. The boxes 
were then sent to the FBI crime lab near Washington, where trace amounts of 
cocaine were found, authorities said. Later, several similar "computers" were 
seized at an Atlanta airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine would be split up and sold and drug money would be transferred out 
of the country to the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Antigua, laundered and 
shipped or carried back to Bozeman and his lieutenants, court documents and 
authorities allege. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some records obtained from the trash, the organization's Atlanta 
operation made about $1 million between May 10 and July 27, 1993, and spent 
well over half a million dollars on administrative and office expenses, 
including cellular phones, pagers, salaries and "family support," the 
indictment reads. 
</P>
<P>
 When FBI agents began following Bozeman around the country and listening to 
his cellular phone conversations, authorities said, they learned a lot about 
his many girlfriends -- he has several children but no current wife, they 
believe -- and his taste for the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 On one conversation, authorities allege, Bozeman boasted of winning $50,000 on 
one of his many trips to Las Vegas. They also learned more than they really 
wanted to about his trip to a ritzy Hawaiian resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so expensive, we freaked out when we heard," said one official 
familiar with the case. "It was unbelievably expensive. It would be a lifetime 
before we could spend that much money."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; HOSTING PARTIES MORE LUCRATIVE FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Party planners may soon have a new venue to consider: public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A shift in Los Angeles Unified School District policy to allow campuses to 
keep most of the revenues collected by renting out their facilities is giving 
public schools an incentive to polish their party-hosting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one already has. The West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland 
Hills is marketing its four-acre landscaped garden as a serene, park-like 
setting ideal for a wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, funds collected from renting school sites for parties, 
conferences and other functions went directly to the district and were 
earmarked to be used for class-size reduction. When the budget crisis worsened 
several years ago, the money -- about $500,000 a year -- went directly into the 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in response to recommendations from an Arthur Andersen & Co. audit of the 
district last year, the district will allow schools to keep about 70% of their 
revenues and use the money however they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited," said Bob Niccum, director of the district's real estate 
division. "This gives schools money that goes over and above what they would 
normally get." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to let every school keep all it makes, but given the current 
budget crisis, Niccum said, that is not yet possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of its unique park, the West Valley Occupational Center negotiated 
a deal with the district to keep 100% of its income. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a win-win situation," West Valley Principal Harlan Barbanell said. 
"It's putting money back into our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Niccum said the district is trying to identify other schools with special 
features that would be eligible for such an arrangement. One campus is already 
under consideration for a cellular antenna and another for use of its parking 
structure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupational center will put the $50 an hour it earns by renting its 
mini-park directly back into the landscape architecture program that maintains 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a good break for an occupational program because it allows us to 
teach entrepreneurial skills," Barbanell said. "This gives students the skills 
of running a little business." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbanell said renting the park could be just the beginning of business 
ventures on campus. He said he hopes to one day host a wedding reception with 
cosmetology students fixing the bride's coiffure, bakery students making the 
cake, photography students shooting the video and automotive students driving 
the limousine. SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DISTRICT FACES NEW BIAS COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Burbank Unified School District is facing a racial discrimination 
complaint from Latino parents upset over a sudden, midyear change to their 
children's elementary school bilingual program. 
</P>
<P>
 A Burbank human rights group filed the federal complaint early this month on 
behalf of the parents, who say they were left out of the district's 
decision-making process at William McKinley Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Language arts lessons at McKinley used to be taught in bilingual classrooms 
that included Spanish-speaking students with limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the district moved those students -- and not other 
limited-English students -- into separate classrooms during the two-hour 
sessions, as well as during some math classes. All other lessons remained 
integrated, school officials say. "Parents generally want kids in English 
classes as soon as possible," said Lila Ramirez of the Burbank Human Relations 
Council. "If they (Latino parents) had an option, they'd prefer all English. 
But they weren't given the English-only option." 
</P>
<P>
 School Supt. David Aponik declined to discuss the case, and the Burbank school 
board met in closed session Thursday to review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the school system contend that district officials were only looking 
out for the best interest of students and teachers, and modified McKinley's 
bilingual program to resemble those at other district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students' instructional program wasn't changed," said Andrea Canady, 
director of curriculum and bilingual programs. "They are still receiving the 
same exact materials and the same instruction received in the past." VIVIEN LOU

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 3% BUDGET INCREASE OKD; TAXES HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In contrast to their counterparts in neighboring cities, Calabasas City 
Council members this week approved a budget for their city that is slightly 
larger than last year's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Wednesday night, the council unanimously approved a 
$6.9-million budget for next fiscal year -- up 3% from the previous year -- 
that will not raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase includes doubling the amount the city had set aside for legal 
fees to $200,000, mostly due to the cost of battling the proposed Ahmanson 
Ranch project in court. 
</P>
<P>
 It also includes more funds for police insurance, library hours and books and 
an emergency-preparedness program. 
</P>
<P>
 To the west in Agoura Hills, by contrast, the City Council recently staved off 
a budget disaster by approving a tax on the use of utilities and making large 
cuts in the budget. In Los Angeles to the east, the annual budget process has 
become synonymous with yawning deficits, hiring freezes and hotly contested 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas officials concede that their city, which incorporated three years 
ago, may be enjoying a financial honeymoon. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR DISASTER RESPONSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The outpost city of Westlake Village is recruiting volunteers for a disaster 
response team, modeled after a successful program in neighboring Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," said Councilwoman Kris Carraway, "we are on the edge of Los 
Angeles County, and when an earthquake or fire hits, we have found it important 
to be able to take care of ourselves until the Red Cross or Fire Department 
arrives." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in learning about emergency preparedness or volunteering for 
a disaster response team is invited to a meeting scheduled for 7:30 p.m. 
Thursday at the First Neighborhood Community Center, 31830 Village Center Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Red Cross, Los Angeles County Fire Department and the Agoura 
Hills Disaster Response Team are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carraway said the city hopes to recruit several residents who want to 
spearhead a group of up to 50 people, who will be trained in first aid, fire 
suppression, treatment of hazardous materials, radio communication and search 
and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also is seeking at least one ham radio operator to be trained to help 
the city in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program in Agoura Hills has sent dozens of trained volunteers 
door-to-door during recent fires and after the Northridge earthquake, looking 
for injured or trapped citizens, burning buildings and leaks. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; SHUTTLE PLAN COULD DASH TROLLEY HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community leaders say they are unhappy with the DASH-type bus the city wants 
to use when the Sherman Oaks shuttle service begins this winter and favor 
instead a vehicle resembling an old-fashioned trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why (the vehicle) is even being considered as a DASH bus, I'm stunned," said 
Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board. "Time 
after time (the Transportation Department) has come up with concerns and we've 
addressed them. They have a policy against trolleys. They come up with 
opposition to whatever we've proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brain and other community activists prefer a minibus that resembles an 
old-fashioned trolley to the natural-gas-powered DASH bus, predicting that the 
charming appearance of the trolleys will attract more riders and lend an 
appealing ambience to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Transportation, on the other hand, favors DASH 
(Downtown Area Short Hop) buses, saying that trolleys are more difficult to 
maintain, less comfortable for riders and less interchangeable with the other 
DASH buses the city owns in the event of a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to hundreds of my customers," said Don Shain, owner of Shain's 
restaurant. "A lot of research has gone into this. The customers say, 'I'd love 
the trolley.' But a DASH bus? It's like they immediately lose interest." 
</P>
<P>
 "(DASH buses) are just not rider-friendly," said Ellen Vukovich, a member of 
the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "They don't invite you to get on and take a 
short hop." 
</P>
<P>
 A trolley system "is what the community wants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior transportation engineer Mike Uyeno said trolleys are more expensive to 
purchase than DASH buses, and their wooden design features -- which he said 
must be refinished at least twice a year -- make them more difficult to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 The city experimented with trolleys in the Fairfax District, Uyeno said, but 
they proved unpopular because riders found them difficult to board and 
complained that the wooden seats were too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain, however, said that trolleys can be made without wooden touches and that 
the vehicles have been used successfully in Santa Barbara and Whittier. KAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS APPLY MATH ON BIG PROJECTS IN FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A toothbrush, a Monopoly board and a box of Winchell's doughnuts are all part 
of the Math-O-Rama exhibit at the San Fernando Valley Fair's Youth Education 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 But this wasn't just any old toothbrush or doughnut box, but large replicas -- 
sometimes 10 times their normal size -- made by junior high mathematics 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit features the "spectacular results" of Patrick Henry Middle School 
students' math projects, said Sheila Berman, math department chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tremendous amount of work and it allows students to use math on a 
real level," said Berman, who also teaches eighth-grade math and algebra at the 
Granada Hills school. "And you look at some students you never thought would do 
much better and they do a great job. It's like, 'ah ha.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Math-O-Rama program, in its 13th year, was created to allow students to 
put their math skills to creative use, Berman said. Students must measure the 
item they plan to replicate and make it on a larger scale with paper, wood, 
felt cloth or anything else they can find, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we keep the best of the best over the years and show them here," Berman 
said. "It creates a legacy. The older students will have their projects shown 
for many years and it helps other students get new ideas for their projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Other items featured at this year's fair include a pink eraser, a pack of 
Wrigley's spearmint gum and a box of Q-Tips. This year's grand prize winner, 
the Monopoly board, was also on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Darya Stewart, 15, of Granada Hills, came to visit her former math teacher and 
peak in on her prize-winning toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun to make it," said Darya, who worked on it with a classmate for a 
week. "I am a tooth freak and I just picked to do a toothbrush." 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 5-foot-high toothbrush, with drinking straws for bristles, won 
Darya first prize in her class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more fun than algebra," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair runs through Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PEACEKEEPING YOUTHS REWARDED FOR EFFORTS

<P>
 They walk away from fights and pull their friends away from arguments. They 
are peacemakers, and Sunday they will be rewarded for keeping out of gangs and 
away from violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are doing a lot of great things," said Abel Sedillo of the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education's Friday Night Live program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedillo will take about 40 youths from tough neighborhoods in the San Fernando 
Valley to the Great Western Forum in Inglewood to meet with the members of the 
Los Angeles Blades, a professional roller blade hockey team formed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades will play the Edmonton Sled Dogs at 4 p.m. In its second season, 
the team has a 10-3 record and a current six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths also will meet ice hockey player Bobby Hull, who will be a guest 
assistant coach for the Blades. Hull's son, Bobby Jr., is the Blades' head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have earned this trip," said Carol Adams, who is with the 
Acknowledge Reward Kids program, which works with Friday Night Live to 
encourage youths to be peacemakers rather than gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the 40 youngsters Sedillo will take to meet the Blades come from 
the troubled Blythe Street neighborhood in Van Nuys, the rest from the projects 
in Sylmar. Blythe Street is an area with a reputation for crime and gang 
activity, but Sedillo and others working there say that what the youths need 
are more activities and programs to give them alternatives to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in the Friday Night Live program also try to raise money for trips. 
Today, the group of Blythe Street kids will hold a carwash at 7555 Van Nuys 
Blvd., Van Nuys, from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. to raise money for a trip to Magic 
Mountain. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: TUJUNGA; POLICE SUSPECT LINK IN ARMED ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service and Los Angeles police are investigating the holdup of 
a Tujunga post office that bears similarities to several other recent armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1,500 in cash and money orders was taken from the post office at 10209 
Tujunga Canyon Blvd. on Wednesday, according to a police report and a Postal 
Service spokeswoman.The lone thief, wearing a ski mask and armed with a 
semiautomatic handgun, confronted two clerks on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as a 25- to 30-year-old white man, between 5 feet, 
10 inches and 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and 150 to 170 pounds. He was wearing 
green pants, a black T-shirt beneath a white, long-sleeved shirt, and white 
cotton gloves, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the robber may be the same man who has held up a bank, 
convenience store and gas station on Foothill Boulevard; a bank on Mount 
Gleason Boulevard, and a gas station on Sunland Boulevard -- all since June, 
said Police Lt. Joseph Garcia. LESLIE BERGER

HUBER INVESTIGATORS FOCUS ON 9-DAY STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Denise Huber vanished on the Corona Del Mar freeway, she left behind a 
smudged whiskey shot glass, an abandoned blue Honda and a baffling riddle: 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the vivacious 23-year-old waitress in the frantic hours and 
days after her disappearance on June 3, 1991? 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are focusing on the nine-day period between the time the former 
Northridge woman was abducted and the time a bespectacled painter named John J. 
Famalaro took delivery of the Montgomery Ward freezer in which her body was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as authorities allege in an indictment, Famalaro killed Huber, then where 
was she slain? Famalaro bought the freezer seven days after her disappearance, 
and it was delivered on July 12. One question is whether she was kept prisoner 
before being bludgeoned to death and frozen. If so, for how long? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the mystery may be resolved when a medical examiner in Arizona issues 
a report next week. Other riddles may be clarified by a high-tech search for 
clues in a Laguna Hills storage unit that Famalaro rented several months before 
Huber vanished and where he apparently lived for much of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Huber disappeared, police detectives, private investigators and even 
psychics have tried to solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huber, a part-time cashier and waitress whose family moved from the San 
Fernando Valley to Orange County several years ago, disappeared, she was on her 
way home to Newport Beach from a Morrissey rock concert in Inglewood. She and a 
friend, Robert Calvert, later had drinks in a Long Beach bar and she dropped 
him off at his Huntington Beach home about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, another friend, Tammy Brown, spotted Huber's blue 1984 Honda Accord 
on the shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs of a struggle. The car doors were unlocked, the trunk 
undisturbed. There was a shot glass under the seat. The car keys were missing 
and so was Huber's purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always truly believed that it was someone she knew or someone 
pretending to be a police officer, someone with access to a uniform. If you're 
pretending to be a cop then you've got time to handcuff someone and take them 
off their guard," said Logan Clarke, of Clarke International Investigations, 
whose Lake Arrowhead agency was hired by Huber's parents to help in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke speculates that Huber was abducted but survived for a period. Other 
investigators have refused to publicly discuss the question of whether she was 
kept prisoner for some time or was killed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we're trying to determine for the jurisdictional question," said 
Thomas Lindberg, deputy Yavapai County, Ariz., attorney. "Circumstantially, 
there are a number of things that seem to put the events" of her death in 
Orange County, he said, which would mean that Famalaro would face trial in 
California, not Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Huber's body was found jammed in a freezer stored in a stolen 
rental truck next to Famalaro's home in Prescott, Ariz. A search of the home 
uncovered a bloodied crowbar and Huber's purse, including clothing and the 
silver dolphin ring and gold heart she was wearing when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Also found was a homemade Los Angeles County deputy sheriff's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 The contents of Huber's stomach may provide a clue, said Cullen Ellingburgh, 
supervising deputy coroner in Orange County. Huber's companion, Calvert, said 
Huber ate pretzels in the Mexican restaurant where they drank the night she 
disappeared, and if the pretzels were not digested that would indicate she died 
shortly after they parted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Costa Mesa investigators have been examining receipts and work 
orders and interviewing people who had contact with Famalaro, a painting 
contractor, to determine what he was doing that week in June three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months earlier in March, 1991, he had been evicted from a Lake Forest 
house for failure to pay the rent. By that June, Famalaro was camping out in a 
small office in a huge warehouse in Laguna Hills, according to one of his 
former workers, Ygnacio Santos Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz remembers working for Famalaro that month, but noticed nothing out of the 
ordinary, except Famalaro's stark quarters. Cruz never noticed the freezer 
chest that Famalaro purchased on July 10 and delivered the 12th. There were 
parts of the warehouse workers were not allowed to enter, Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost a year to the day after Huber vanished, Cruz said Famalaro 
himself disappeared, leaving Cruz and other employees unpaid.

$1.2 MILLION SET ASIDE FOR CAHUENGA PASS STUDY; TRAFFIC: THE TRANSIT AUTHORITY 
WILL FOOT THE BILL FOR AN EXAMINATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS NOW AND IN THE 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority has allocated $1.2 million to conduct an 
environmental impact study of present and future traffic conditions on Cahuenga 
and Barham boulevards in the Cahuenga Pass, a major link between the San 
Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will try to determine whether it makes sense to replace the Barham 
Boulevard Bridge with a wider version, among other options. The bridge crosses 
the Hollywood Freeway in the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway runs over the Santa Monica Mountains from Hollywood to Universal 
City, where the Hollywood Freeway intersects the Ventura Freeway. The bridge 
over the freeway connects Cahuenga Boulevard West to Barham Boulevard, which 
leads directly into Burbank's Media District. Cahuenga Boulevard parallels the 
freeway, and is used as an alternate route by many motorists when the freeway 
is congested. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahuenga and Barham boulevards, and the Hollywood Freeway, are used by more 
than 300,000 vehicles a day coming through the pass. An estimated 80,000 of 
those vehicles travel on or near the Barham Boulevard Bridge, and the surface 
streets are becoming as congested as the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freeway itself is a source of problems because it doesn't connect well to 
the (Ventura Freeway) and spills a lot of traffic onto this corridor, traffic 
it wasn't meant to carry," said William Lundgren, Burbank's transportation 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Any improvements to the Barham Boulevard Bridge are subject in part to whether 
three jurisdictions -- the cities of Los Angeles and Burbank, and Los Angeles 
County -- will provide the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the MTA approved more than $2 million for preliminary engineering 
studies to be done on the bridge. Then the agency changed its mind when it 
became clear not enough money was available for the studies, said Larry Zarian, 
vice chairman of the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency reconsidered, and on July 13, allocated $1.2 million, a portion of 
which was reserved for design work on the project, he added. "I had to fight 
like crazy for it," Zarian said.

<P>
 Burbank and Los Angeles city transportation officials hope to widen the Barham 
Boulevard Bridge and add a second bridge just north of it at the turn of the 
century, for an estimated $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups are keeping a close eye on the bridge study: residents who want 
controlled growth and relief from traffic gridlock, and every major film and 
television studio in Burbank and Universal City that needs wider roadways to 
accommodate developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic situation is very difficult and exacerbated by growth at MCA, 
particularly the CityWalk and special events at Universal City," said Tony 
Lucente of the Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very delicate balance and it doesn't take much to tip the balance. We 
support a coordinated effort to deal with this very difficult problem. The 
impact is felt beyond one community." 
</P>
<P>
 T.K. Prime, a senior transportation engineer for the city of Los Angeles, said 
preliminary studies have been done on the Cahuenga and Barham boulevard 
widening projects, but the city has not yet looked for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing is done to alleviate traffic congestion through the Barham-Cahuenga 
corridor, those streets will no longer be a useful alternative to the Hollywood 
Freeway, Lundgren warned. Gridlock, he said, "would continue until the travel 
time on those streets is greater than on the freeway, and people would take the 
freeway again."

TUJUNGA MAN CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF GIRL IN RESEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of wounding a 3-year-old girl while shooting at the child's 
mother was charged with four counts of attempted murder Friday and held in lieu 
of more than $2-million bail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manolo Cienfuegos, 24, of Tujunga was also charged with the special 
allegation of causing great bodily injury, said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Carole Chizever. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, Vanessa Barcenas, is recovering from the wound, which does not 
threaten her life, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only the child was hit, Chizever said prosecutors filed the 
additional attempted murder charges Friday because Cienfuegos allegedly fired 
five or six shots during the attack, which endangered three other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cienfuegos will be arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Thursday afternoon outside a Reseda apartment building 
where Cienfuegos' ex-girlfriend, Christina Stevens, 21, lived until earlier 
this summer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cienfuegos and Stevens were at the complex, a dispute erupted between 
them and one of the building's tenants, Eileen Cortez, 21, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the dispute was not determined, but it caused Cienfuegos to fire 
at a group of people outside the apartment building, which included Cortez and 
her child, said LAPD Detective Rick Swanston. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Cienfuegos, Stevens and 24-year-old Angel Lopez, who had 
accompanied them, left the scene in a pickup truck, but were later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were not filed against Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, of Glendale, was held on an outstanding felony warrant, but authorities 
declined to say what the warrant was for. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Stevens said she had moved out of the building because 
she feared for her childrens' safety. On Thursday, she returned with 
Cienfuegos, her ex-boyfriend, so he could help carry furniture and protect her, 
she said.

EVICTION NOTICE SERVED FOR STUDIO CITY GOLF COURSE; LAW: THE OWNERS OF THE 
PROPERTY HAVE SOUGHT A WAY OUT OF A 'MISERABLE' 1955 LEASE. A COURT BATTLE IS 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of the Studio City Golf Course have been served an eviction notice 
by the property's owners, initiating what both sides agree will probably become 
a lengthy legal wrangle over the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weddington Investment Partnership served the golf course -- a 17.2-acre 
swath of green near the intersection of Whitsett Avenue and Ventura Boulevard 
-- a 30-day termination of tenancy notice July 15, said Los Angeles attorney 
Jerald Gale, who is representing the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Local golfers have nothing to fear, however, said an attorney representing the 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to move out," said John Clayman, predicting that when the 30 
days were over, the case would wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The property's owners have for years searched for a way out of a "miserable" 
lease signed in 1955 that brought in just $1,000 a month on 17.2 acres of prime 
urban real estate, according to co-owner Guy Weddington McCreary. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes his partnership will be able to nullify the lease because 
the golf course has been operating nearly a decade without a conditional use 
permit. The partners have claimed the original contract with the golf course 
requires it to have a current conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the discovery of the expired permit in June, the partnership put 
the property on the market for $10 million, saying it was entitled to a "fair 
market price" for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Area real estate experts have called the asking price a bargain, and Studio 
City realtor Mort Allen said several developers and golf course operators have 
expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 While attorneys for the golf course admitted Friday that its conditional use 
permit had indeed expired in May, 1985, they insisted that the expiration did 
not in any way nullify the lease, which, under the original contract, stretches 
to the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very plain language of that contract says the city must refuse to renew 
or extend the (conditional use permit)" in order for the lease to be nullified, 
said attorney Larry Iser. "The city never has, and we believe they never will." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the golf course has now applied for a new permit, Iser said, adding 
that the application will likely appear before city zoning officials in 
October.

DRIVER HELD AFTER OFFICER RAMMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck driver who allegedly rammed a Burbank motorcycle officer to escape a 
traffic ticket, and possible arrest on other charges, was taken into custody 
Friday on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, Chris Topolovich, 47, was treated at St. Joseph's Medical Center 
in Burbank for back and neck injuries and released Friday in fair condition, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topolovich stopped Mario Andrade, 22, of Los Angeles for speeding in the 2700 
block of San Fernando Road on Friday. Before Topolovich could get off his bike, 
Andrade shifted his truck into reverse and "intentionally rammed the 
motorcycle," Burbank Police Lt. Larry Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade was spotted by other officers as he tried to escape the scene in 
reverse and a brief high-speed chase ensued on city streets and the Golden 
State Freeway, Koch said. Andrade crashed as he left the freeway on Verdugo 
Road. He ran from officers and threw away what appeared to be drugs, Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recovered a white powdery substance and there is an ongoing 
investigation," Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade was booked on suspicion of attempted murder at Burbank City Jail and 
no bail was set because he is on parole, Koch said. Other felony charges are 
expected to be filed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade will be arraigned in Burbank Municipal Court on Monday.

SERVICE SET FOR DRIVER KILLED BY PIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service for a single father killed this week when a 2,000-pound 
pipe tore off the roof of his vehicle as he drove on the Golden State Freeway 
is scheduled for 3 p.m. today at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, 6657 Sunset 
Blvd., Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Fedorko, 46, died Tuesday afternoon when a truck carrying 27 of the 
heavy pipes lost its load on a Foothill Freeway transition ramp 45 feet above 
traffic on the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an executive with Keystone Communications in Los Angeles, which 
distributes television programs nationwide by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko had lived for the past two years with his 14-year-old son, David, in 
the Stevenson Ranch housing complex just west of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

AMUSEMENT PARK EMPLOYEE ASSAULTED IN RESTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are searching for a man who assaulted and attempted to rape a 
female employee in a restroom at Six Flags Magic Mountain, causing her to be 
treated for multiple injuries at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old victim told sheriff's deputies that she believes a maintenance 
employee at the park is responsible for the attack, said Sgt. Howard Fairchild 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild said the assailant apparently was wearing an employee uniform, but 
investigators are unsure if the assailant worked at the amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred about 10:30 a.m. Thursday when the victim went into an 
"out of the way" restroom for women employees, Fairchild said. The restroom was 
empty except for the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got thrown around the room quite a bit," Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fled and the woman stumbled out of the restroom and notified another 
employee about the attempted rape, Fairchild said. Deputies and park officials 
questioned employees on duty, but none matched the description provided by the 
victim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where she was 
treated and released, said Susan Mandy, a hospital spokeswoman. She was briefly 
readmitted for treatment Friday, but a Six Flags official said the woman 
suffers from a stomach condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe the suspect as a 36- to 40-year-old Latino, 5 feet, 8 inches 
tall, 165 pounds, with straight collar-length dark hair.

5 ARRESTED ON SOLICITATION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from residents and business owners, undercover 
sheriff's deputies arrested five women on suspicion of soliciting acts of 
prostitution along Sierra Highway and Palmdale Boulevard in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said four of the women were arrested 
along Sierra Highway in Lancaster between Avenues L and M. The fifth was picked 
up on Palmdale Boulevard near 15th Street East in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep by the Antelope Valley station's Street Criminal Apprehension Team 
was conducted Thursday night. The women, all residents of Palmdale and 
Lancaster, were cited for misdemeanor offenses after conversations with the 
undercover deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Ron Shreves said the deputies conducted the sweep after 
residents and business people complained that suspected prostitutes were 
walking along the street, hailing male motorists and annoying customers outside 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 He said these locations are long-standing trouble spots for prostitution and 
that deputies conducted about half a dozen such sweeps in the area last year.

D.A. TO WAIT ON CHARGES IN KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of kidnaping a Val Verde real estate agent will not face charges 
-- for now -- from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office because a 
federal case against him already covers most of the allegations, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, is accused of abducting Paula Harrington, 26, at 
gunpoint June 29 by posing as a prospective home buyer.She was found tied up in 
an Arizona motel room two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was indicted Thursday on federal kidnaping and weapons charges. 
Double-jeopardy laws prevent the district attorney's office from seeking 
charges related to those alleged acts, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the cost of a trial on lessor charges might be impractical since 
Shue could receive life in prison without parole on the federal charges, Stone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors expect Shue's trial to end before Christmas and will turn 
him over afterward to authorities in Michigan or Oregon, where he is wanted for 
similar crimes, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said the district attorney's office may seek robbery charges against 
Shue if he receives less than a life sentence, since he allegedly forced 
Harrington to withdraw money with her ATM card. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are united in the sense that, no matter which agency gets him, we 
want Mr. Shue to spend the rest of his life behind bars," Stone said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; CATHOLICS DEBATE ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA'S TREATMENT OF THE 
ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last fall, Catholics in Media, based in Studio City, honored "Picket Fences" 
as the most outstanding television program of 1992-93 for its thought-provoking 
way of handling moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights blasted the 
CBS series, saying two programs were rife with anti-Catholic bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharply divergent Catholic responses to the Emmy-winning series arise 
partly from the fact that Catholics in Media is a 2-year-old group of 
entertainment professionals trying a positive tack -- encouraging and pointing 
out worthy efforts by their peers in Hollywood, while the league is a 
22-year-old "media watchdog" organization formed to combat perceived slurs 
against Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed partly to offer mutual spiritual support, Catholics in Media's 
20-member executive committee is also focused on pumping new life into the 
annual Communion breakfast (now a luncheon) for Los Angeles-area Catholics in 
the entertainment business. The next one is scheduled for Oct. 9 at the Beverly 
Hilton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fledgling organization also gives the Catholic Church -- whose defunct 
Legion of Decency issued film ratings that made it a Hollywood force from the 
1930s to the early 1960s -- the potential for new, more cordial access. 
</P>
<P>
 Following informal contacts with industry officials last year, Cardinal Roger 
M. Mahony's nuanced pastoral letter on films and television affirmed principles 
of creative freedom while urging responsible, enriching entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Television director Jack Shea, who co-founded Catholics in Media with his 
wife, Patt, a comedy writer, said: "Too many churches, not just Catholic 
churches, have a tendency to be negative in their approach to films and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is a lot of good out there as well as the not so good," he 
said. The Sheas have worked on many of Norman Lear's series. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, Patt Shea said, but television programs today seem to be 
incorporating more talk about religion and more characters involved in 
spiritual matters than they did, say, five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to watch 'Northern Exposure' to see all the religious themes 
and the integration of spirituality in a program like 'NYPD Blue,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Sheas are bucking prevailing opinion outside the entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Patt's impression appears to conflict with a report made public in March by a 
conservative watchdog group, the Media Research Center in Alexandria, Va., 
which said that during 1,000 hours of prime-time TV entertainment in 1993, 
religious issues came up only 116 times and mostly in an unfavorable light. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's chairman, L. Brent Bozell III, a Catholic, said he was cautiously 
optimistic about a shift in attitude after "L.A. Law" added a conservative 
Christian lawyer to the firm and CBS scheduled the series "Christy," about a 
devout schoolteacher in Appalachia. "L.A. Law" was eventually canceled, but 
"Christy" producer Ken Wales, after the trial run of six shows, was asked for 
13 more episodes as a replacement candidate in the fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 An emerging ease with religious issues is also sensed by Jack Shea, who has 
directed "The Jeffersons," "Hawaii Five-O," "Designing Women" and "704 Hauser 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for many years that networks were afraid to touch religious stories 
because they were afraid of offending people -- they didn't want to create 
controversy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that religious institutions and practices are now going to 
receive favored treatment, he said. "I think it's OK to have characters 
criticize religion as long as they're fair about it and it's spread around to 
different religious groups," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheas did not comment directly on the criticism that the Catholic League 
for Religious and Civil Rights aimed at "Picket Fences," except to say they 
felt the shows in the 1992-93 season (which won the Emmy last year for best 
dramatic series and was among the 1994 nominees announced Thursday) contained 
intelligent conversation on difficult subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not pick easy solutions," said Patt Shea, whose credits include "All 
in the Family," "Happy Days," "Lou Grant" and "The Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic League, based in New York City under new President William 
Donohue, termed the "Picket Fences" episode on April 29 "a textbook case of 
anti-Catholicism in the media" and accused writer-producer David Kelley of 
bigotry. The story, which included dialogue critical of the Catholic Church's 
requirement that priests be celibate, included a priest who almost loses his 
parish over the revelation that he masturbates using women's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley wrote a long rebuttal in which "he defended himself and said (the 
depictions) were not due to anti-Catholic bigotry," Donohue said. The two may 
meet to discuss the issue further in Los Angeles or New York, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley was unavailable for comment, a representative said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood producer-writer Ron Austin, a member of the Catholics in Media 
executive committee, defends Kelley's right of free expression in Sunday's 
National Catholic Register newspaper while agreeing with Donohue that the story 
line showed "gross insensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, best known for "Charley's Angels" and "Mission Impossible," said he 
hopes that bad taste won't extinguish hope that religion will be portrayed as 
an influence in most Americans' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us pray for Kelley and the network chiefs that they might discover the 
virtue of, if not tolerance, at least civility," Austin writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agent Christine Foster, a network and studio executive for 18 years 
and a member of the Catholics in Media executive committee, said specific 
criticisms of "Picket Fences" may have some merit but do little to outweigh the 
program's qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would also say to a lot of people out there: 'Lighten up!' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catholicism has a sense of humor. Jesus had a sense of humor. I don't expect 
I'm going to agree with every scene or conclusion on a program," said Foster, 
who was an Immaculate Heart nun for five years before entering the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Catholics in Media do not all agree on specific cases or 
sociopolitical issues, but they tend to take their religion seriously, the 
Sheas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's hillside home displays a collection of angel figures, and family 
room and bedroom windows offer a view of St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church 
in Sherman Oaks, where they are active parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 They were chosen by Mahony and the U.S. bishops' Committee on Pro-Life 
Activities to make a video aimed at teen-agers promoting alternatives to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute narrative shows a young women being talked out of an abortion by 
her fetus (or her conscience), depicted through special effects as a floating 
ball of light. The video, shown at last year's World Youth Day in Denver, is 
being distributed by the bishops' committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics in Media leaders said they hope to hold a short spiritual retreat 
each year. This spring's retreat drew about three dozen industry people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is remarkable how closely we have bonded as a group," said Ralph Sariego, 
vice president for television production at Universal Pictures, a parishioner 
at Our Lady of Malibu Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious faith is a subject rarely broached in studios or network offices, 
"because people tend to be shy and protective about their beliefs," Sariego 
said. "But there are many, many good individuals in the business, and sometimes 
you will find agnostics and atheists showing more kindness than believers." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea hasn't caught on yet, but Catholics in Media organizers have urged 
that parishes on both sides of the Santa Monica Mountains help form similar 
groups of Catholics in the entertainment profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the television business, where I spend most of my time," Foster said, "I 
feel a particular need to give and receive spiritual nourishment. We all face 
questions of ethics, right and wrong, making or breaking a deal. One needs 
faith and a spiritual foundation to deal with these things."

or leaping out of the moving vehicle, Debra Zellis chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it couldn't be any worse than going with him," the 41-year-old 
Oxnard woman said. "I didn't know what he was going to do. He could have been 
planning to torture me or rape me. I thought, I'm not going anywhere with this 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellis, a secretary at Mary Law Private School in Oxnard, said she was sitting 
in her '84 Chrysler in the school's parking lot, taking a break about 11:40 
a.m. Friday, when the man approached her open window. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked her for directions to the mall -- which she obligingly gave -- then 
pulled out a gun and told her to move over. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I scooted over," Zellis said. "I was very calm. I didn't want to act mad 
or irritate him." 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker told her not to touch anything or he would shoot her, then asked 
her to adjust his seat for him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he pulled out of the school's parking lot and headed down Albany Drive, 
Zellis decided to make a break for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tumbling out onto the road, Zellis said she bruised and scraped her hips but 
otherwise was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 A fellow employee who witnessed the incident from inside the school called 
police, telling them someone is "stealing our secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellis said she did not think her actions were particularly brave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky," said Zellis, who described the carjacker as about 6-foot-2 and 
220 pounds. "Somebody was watching out for me up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Officer Terry Burr said the carjacker had not been located 
Friday and that an investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have only been about a half-dozen carjackings in Oxnard since 
September, two auto thefts in June heightened fears in the county of such 
crimes. One of the incidents involved two teen-agers who were killed in a 
head-on collision after stealing a car in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In her case, Zellis was back at work Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do?" she said. "I didn't want to sit at home. I figured he might 
get into my house, he's got my keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the traumatic experience of having a gun pointed at her and briefly 
sharing the front seat with a car thief, Zellis was quite composed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't even break a nail," she said, waving a complete set of fingers topped 
with shiny pink nails.

BENEFIT TO HELP REPAIR HISTORIC SITES; QUAKE: SANTA CLARITA VALLEY GROUP NEEDS 
$30,000 TO FIX HERITAGE JUNCTION BUILDINGS DAMAGED IN THE JAN. 17 TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While considerable attention has been focused upon earthquake damage to Santa 
Clarita's newer buildings, another group of residents has been concerned about 
damage to some of the city's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society say they need at 
least $30,000 to repair historic buildings at Heritage Junction. The site at 
William S. Hart Park in Newhall is filled with 19th-Century structures, 
including the 1887 Saugus Depot, an old schoolhouse, an adobe building and a 
handful of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the buildings, including the Newhall Ranch House and Mitchell Adobe 
School House, suffered structural damage in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
according to Jo Anne Darcy, a city councilwoman and field deputy for Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Ranch House was built in the 1860s and became the homestead for 
the Santa Clarita Valley's founding Newhall family. It was relocated to the 
park to make way for the expansion of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy is co-chairwoman of a Thursday dinner fund-raiser to benefit the 
historical society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's vitally important," Darcy said. "They don't have the money necessary to 
make the repairs. We're so afraid that the rain and the inclement weather are 
going to cause more damage." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to damaging the buildings, the earthquake deprived the Santa 
Clarita Valley Historical Society of its regular Old Towne Days fund-raiser, 
said Dave Lyerla, the society's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Towne Days is a living history event that uses Heritage Junction as a 
backdrop and has participants dressed in historically accurate clothing. 
Organizers were concerned the buildings were unsafe for the public to enter 
until repairs were made, so the program was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical society officials said they hope to make the dinner fund-raiser an 
annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have on-going needs besides the earthquake damage," said Lyerla. "We seem 
to always be looking for funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner fund-raiser is scheduled for 7 p.m. at Le Chene French Cuisine 
restaurant, 12625 Sierra Highway. Admission is $75. Antonovich and KABC radio 
personality Roger Barkley are scheduled to speak.

12-3 LOSS IS MOVING FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi has resisted the temptation, wanting so badly to 
believe the Angels can win the weak American League West title without making 
any moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he acknowledges, he might be left with no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take Connie Mack to figure out that if the Angels really are 
serious about contending, even in this division, changes must be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, 12-3 losers to the New York Yankees in a game Friday night that 
was not as close as the score indicated, sent 34,750 away from Anaheim Stadium 
realizing the disparity between the two clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are veterans that we feel who'll fit in," Bavasi said, "we'll make 
the move. We've got some things working, and I can tell you that we're trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is not going to be a problem. Ownership says that if it makes 
sense, and it will help us win, they have no problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very willing to pay for talent, but I won't overpay to an extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were involved in serious negotiations with the Philadelphia 
Phillies for veteran pitcher Shawn Boskie, but decided to pass, holding out for 
a better deal. They instead tried their hand with rookie Andrew Lorraine, who 
graduated five weeks ago from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 It took only four pitches for the Angels to realize it might be a mistake. 
Leadoff hitter Bernie Williams hit the fourth pitch of the game over the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels then watched Mike Stanley hit the first of his two home runs in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 They watched Lorraine's moment of glory in the third when he struck out Don 
Mattingly with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, they couldn't bear to watch, pulling Lorraine after only 4 2/3 
innings in his first big league start, yielding eights hits and seven earned 
runs, including three homers and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I attribute it to jitters," Lorraine said, "it's an excuse. From the 
outset, I'd make a good pitch, and a bad pitch, that's not my game. I'm usually 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "If he learned a lesson today, and he 
learned he can trust his stuff, maybe then he will be around here for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, 42-56, not forgetting their manners, comforted Lorraine in a way 
only they could, demonstrating how something like this could happen to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees tormented every pitcher the Angels threw into the game, scoring 
two more runs in the fourth, two runs in the fifth, three runs in the sixth, 
and two more in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, the Angels' best closer of the night was the Yankees' appalling 
base-running. They were thrown out three times on the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
 It enabled Angel rookie right fielder Jim Edmonds to produce three assists, 
one shy of the major league record. The last major league outfielder to have 
three assists in a game was Cleveland's Sam Langford on May 1, 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, who finished the game with 17 hits, had 14 -- including four home 
runs -- through the first six innings alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee designated hitter Stanley had two home runs that traveled nearly 800 
feet by the fifth inning. Yankee third baseman Wade Boggs equaled his 
season-high of four hits by the sixth inning. Yankee center fielder Williams 
had a season-high four hits by the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Scott Kamieniecki yielded only four hits through seven innings. His 
only mistake was a two-run homer to Bo Jackson, who hit his third in as many 
games.

DODGER ANTHEM: OH NO, CANADA; BASEBALL: EXPOS CONTINUE DOMINANCE IN OLYMPIC 
STADIUM WITH 8-2 VICTORY THAT DROPS L.A. TO .500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The game wasn't 15 minutes old Friday night when the first meeting occurred on 
the mound. Whatever was said, it didn't do any good. Pedro Astacio wasn't only 
getting hit, he was getting drilled. Nine Montreal Expos came to the plate in 
the first inning, and when it was finally over, they had four doubles and four 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game was over, the Expos had eight doubles in an 8-2 victory at 
Olympic Stadium, where the Dodgers have won only five games in the last five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about anything else, but for the bullpen alone maybe we have to 
call in a witch doctor," Jim Gott said. "We can burn uniforms, balls, hats, 
underwear, whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 The only consolation for the Dodgers, who dropped to 48-48, is that the 
Colorado Rockies and the San Francisco Giants also lost, allowing the Dodgers 
to maintain a three-game lead in the National League West. Even this, they 
know, is but a brief respite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are leaving the park tonight scratching our heads, saying we are in first 
place, but we sure don't deserve it," said Gott, who was one of five Dodger 
pitchers Friday. "But the enlightening fact also is that we are where we are. 
We are a first-place club, but we need to play like it. We believe we have one 
of the most potent offenses in the National League. And if the bullpen does the 
job half the time that we didn't do it, we have a 10-game lead." 
</P>
<P>
 That offense couldn't do much of anything against Expo starter Ken Hill 
(14-4), who became the first pitcher in the league to win 14 games. He held the 
Dodgers to one run and four hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go all the way, but we have three games (against the Atlanta 
Braves) and we will need every bullet," Hill said. "The key for me was when I 
went 3-and-0 against Brett Butler in the first inning and came back to get him 
out. You don't want to let them get on base. They will steal off me, not 
(catcher Darrin) Fletcher. They are horses when they get on the basepaths -- 
they get hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss is the Dodgers' sixth in eight games, all on this trip, which ends 
with a three-game series against the Giants. This Eastern swing is 
traditionally bad for the Dodgers, but this one is reminiscent of the disaster 
of 1991, when the first-place Dodgers went 2-9 after the break and let the 
Braves climb from 9 1/2 games out to 3 1/2 out. Atlanta ended up winning the 
division title by one game over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-one was the biggest nightmare -- we were there and all of a sudden, 
boom," Gott said. "We should have been playing Pittsburgh in the playoffs. 
(That trip) took us out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio (6-8) gave up six runs in 2 1/3 innings his last start and lasted only 
two innings this time. He was behind nearly every hitter, and when he wasn't, 
it's because they hit the first pitch. By the time Astacio was in the trainer's 
room icing his right arm, the Expos had seven hits -- Larry Walker hit his 
second double in the second inning -- and were ahead, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach's run-scoring single in the ninth inning extended his hitting 
streak to 10 games, but it was little satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not satisfying when you don't win," Wallach said. "I'm not satisfied at 
all when the team isn't winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler scored the Dodgers' first run in the fourth inning on a single by Mike 
Piazza. But he will best be remembered for what occurred in the eighth inning, 
when he fouled off a pitch and shattered the glass on the camera room behind 
the home plate, causing a seven-minute delay. Butler said that was the first 
time he had ever broken glass, except for in another sport.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dunking," said Butler, who is 5 feet 10.

MORNING BRIEFING: TOP DRAFT PICK SPECIALIZES ON THIRST DOWNS

<P>
 Last year, Willie McGinest was a big man on campus at USC. This year, he's a 
6-foot-5, 252-pound gofer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all New England Patriot Coach Bill Parcells' way of welcoming the team's 
first-round draft choice to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "During our off-season conditioning program, (Parcells) told me he had some 
special tasks in mind for me that I'd better be ready to perform at training 
camp," McGinest said. "He told me it would be my job to bring him his Gatorade 
and that he didn't like the orange stuff. He likes the green stuff with ice. 
What am I going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly as he's told, and in a time that would rival the 4.7 clocking he has 
had in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is repeated twice daily, during the Patriots' double sessions at 
their Rhode Island training camp. A coach blows his whistle, players pause to 
catch their breath, and McGinest dashes for the Gatorade. He quickly returns 
with two cups in hand. 
</P>

 Trivia time: Who was the first American to win a world motorcycle road racing 
championship? 
</P>
<P>

tonight at the El Prado Country Club in Chino.

<P>
 The student-body president that year was Gene Mauch, who went on to manage 26 
years in the major leagues. Classmate Doug Hays of Glendale recalls that Mauch 
could not play baseball or football for the Pathfinders his senior year because 
he had signed a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers in the summer of 1943 and 
played minor league baseball before his senior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming soon: Relax, NFL fans. The regular season is only six weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Logical choice: Actor Bradford Dillman, a football fanatic, is coming out with 
a series of books published on each NFL team. The first, "Inside the New York 
Giants," will be available in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Why were the Giants the first? "Because they're 3,000 miles from where I 
live," said Dillman, a Santa Barbara resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1974, the Dodgers' Steve Garvey -- a write-in 
starter -- singled and doubled to lead the Nationals to a 7-2 victory over the 
Americans in the All-Star game in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Some whine with that?Former British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia was not 
happy at the price of food during his recent stay at the Turnberry Hotel in 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 "You eat a nice dinner and it costs you 100 pounds," he said. "When you're 
charged that kind of money, the food doesn't taste so good. You're thinking, 
'One bite of duck will cost me seven pounds.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Changing sports: Jack Clark, who generated a lot of power as a home run 
hitter, hopes to generate a lot more when he makes his top-fuel drag racing 
debut this weekend in Denver. After hiring drivers such as Tom McEwen and John 
Andretti to drive his "Taco Bell Express," Clark decided he wanted to drive the 
300-m.p.h. dragster himself.

 The car's number is 340, which is the number of home runs Clark hit in his 
major league career.

GOLF / SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AMATEUR; WOODS TAKES 36-HOLE LEAD WITH ROUNDS OF 68 
AND 70

 Kemp Richardson of Laguna Niguel might have been the loneliest co-leader in 
the history of the Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 His morning round of 68 at Hacienda Golf Club on Friday tied him for the early 
lead, a position he might have hoped would draw him a small gallery for his 
afternoon round. 
</P>
<P>
 But not when the other 68 belonged to Tiger Woods, the three-time U.S. Junior 
Amateur champion from Cypress.  
</P>
<P>
 At least 25 Woods fans, some wearing "Team Tiger" T-shirts, followed the 
18-year-old through his afternoon round, and Woods brought in an even-par 70 to 
lead the tournament at the halfway point at two-under 138. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson wilted in the afternoon heat to shoot a 77 for a 145 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Left to chase Woods through the final rounds today and Sunday are a group of 
five bunched at par and one over. 
</P>
<P>
 Closest is Mark Johnson of Helendale, who had rounds of 70-70 to finish at 
140, tied with Tom Kroll of San Marcos, who shot rounds of 71-69 in his first 
appearance in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied at 141 are Don Baker of Canoga Park, Chad Wright of Ventura and Charlie 
Wi of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroll credited his putting for his afternoon improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been putting so good the last couple weeks it's scary. I just came from 
the public links championships, and those greens were real slick," Kroll said. 
"These are a little slower and they were tamped down in the afternoon."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CLAIRE LOOKING FOR A YOUNG LEFT-HANDER 
</P>

 Fred Claire might not want to give up any young, quality players to acquire a 
veteran left-hander such as Randy Myers or John Franco, but the comments made 
by the club's executive vice president Friday indicate that he is searching for 
a young, quality pitcher for the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked with every American League and National League scout the last 
couple of days who have been out looking at our needs," Claire said. "The ideal 
move for any club is to make a move involving young quality players. If I had 
the choice of a quality veteran player or a younger one, I would take a younger 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, when asked if the search included any left-handers said: "I know all 
their names."

 Orel Hershiser played catch for the third time since straining a muscle in his

will pitch tonight, making his third appearance in eight games. During his last 
two appearances, which came two days apart, he gave up only two unearned runs 
in 13 innings for a 1.38 earned-run average. Those are the only two games the 
Dodgers have won on this trip.

 Jeff Treadway was ejected from Friday night's game during the sixth inning by 
third base umpire Larry Vanover, who didn't appreciate a comment made by 
Treadway from the dugout. One of the Dodger relievers had yelled something to 
Vanover after he called a ball hit by a Dodger foul. Vanover walked over to the 
end of the dugout, where the relievers were sitting, to find out who made the 
comment. Meanwhile, the game continued. "He had called time out, but the game 
was still going on," bullpen coach Mark Cresse said. None of the Dodger 
relievers would confess, and Treadway, walking toward that end of the dugout, 
yelled to Vanover that the game was going on. "He was over there while the 
pitch was being thrown, so I yelled, 'Hey, the game is going on,' " Treadway 
said. "He said, 'One more word and you are out of here.' I still don't know why 
he threw me out." MARYANN HUDSON

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; VINTAGE BLUE JAYS SHOW HOW TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly, success is coming in bunches to the Toronto Blue Jays. There are 
victories, six in a row after an early season mostly spent floundering. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are home runs, most of them hit by Paul Molitor. He hit a two-run 
homer in a 3-2 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night at Toronto and 
has three two-run homers in his last four at-bats. Molitor has three hits in 
each of his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The beneficiary of Molitor's power was Dave Stewart, who pitched a four-hit 
shutout for eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys are winners and have been winners all their lives. I have a lot of 
respect for those two guys. So do their teammates and the rest of the league as 
well," Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston said. "They're two 37-year-olds, and two 
great 37-year-old baseball players." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart (7-8) matched his longest outing of the season, striking out four and 
walking one for his first victory at home since May 18. Darren Hall gave up 
Jose Canseco's 26th homer and a run-scoring infield single by Doug Strange in 
pitching the ninth inning for a save after Stewart strained a groin muscle 
covering first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart is 2-0 in three starts against the Rangers this season, yielding only 
two runs and 15 hits over 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've faced Stewart a few times the last couple of weeks and he's got his 
excellent fastball back," Canseco, his former teammate with Oakland, said. 
"It's just like the Stew of old. He's mentally tough and knows how to pitch to 
certain hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 9, Chicago 8 -- Jim Thome hit three of the Indians' six home runs 
and Albert Belle homered for the fourth game in a row in a victory at 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' power surge stopped Chicago's five-game winning streak and drew 
Cleveland within two games of the first-place White Sox in the Central 
Division. The teams do not play after this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thome homered in each of his first three at-bats. He grounded into a double 
play his fourth time up. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle's home run was his 30th of the season, making him the first player in 
Cleveland history to hit 30 three seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Morris (9-6) won for the eighth time in his last 10 decisions, 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 6, Boston 3 -- At home on the road in Boston, Randy Johnson gave up 
five hits and struck out 11 in 6 2/3 innings and Jay Buhner had three RBIs for 
the Mariners in the opener of a weekend series moved to Fenway Park because of 
falling ceiling panels in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (11-5) rode a four-run third inning against Boston starter Aaron Sele 
(7-6) as the Mariners won for the second consecutive time after a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Kansas City 2 -- Kirk Gibson hit a two-run home run in the eighth 
inning and Mike Moore scattered five hits over eight innings to lead the Tigers 
to a victory at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson's home run, his 20th of the season, came off Rusty Meacham (1-3), and 
followed a run-scoring double by Cecil Fielder that broke a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 6, Milwaukee 5 -- Jeff Reboulet hit a run-scoring double in the 13th 
inning at Milwaukee where the Twins snapped an 11-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Leius, who had homered in the fifth, doubled with one out off Jamie 
Navarro (3-7) in the 13th. He went to third on Matt Walbeck's groundout and 
scored on Reboulet's double off the left-field wall as the Twins also ended a 
five-game overall losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Oakland 4 -- Rafael Palmeiro and Chris Hoiles hit two-run homers 
in the third inning and the Orioles held on at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina (14-4) pitched eight innings of seven-hit ball, but walked a 
career-high six. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith pitched the ninth for his 31st save. Shortstop Cal Ripken made a 
diving stop of Troy Neel's grounder with the tying run on second to end the 
game.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ SAYS HE'S UNHAPPY IN VANCOUVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Third baseman Eduardo Perez figured he would be back to the big leagues within 
two weeks. He didn't even bother to get an apartment in Vancouver, figuring it 
was senseless to get a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, two weeks have turned into three, which have turned into a month, which 
has now turned into seven weeks since he was optioned on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, batting .299 with one homer and 15 RBIs, remains at Vancouver, where he 
will probably stay until September, in no small part because of the play of 
veteran Spike Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 It has left Perez frustrated, agent Brian Goldberg bitter, and the Angels 
wondering what the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, neither Eduardo or I feel comfortable that what the Angel 
front office is telling us is 100% the truth," Goldberg said, "because of what 
they've said in the past. It has become very, very confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to be the griping agent, but I have to be honest about it. I don't 
know who to believe, and what to believe from that front office. If they don't 
like what I'm saying, they should be more honest, or we wouldn't feel this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's primary complaint is that Perez says he was told that he was going 
to the minors for a few weeks. Yet, Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
vehemently denied that anyone told Perez that, saying instead that Perez would 
come up only when he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no timetable," Bavasi said. "Nothing was ever said about two weeks. 
I'm sure he's frustrated. Nobody likes staying in the minor leagues, but I can 
tell you that I've been very honest and very fair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon probably will be out of the starting lineup until at 
least Tuesday because of his strained right hamstring. He tested the hamstring 
for the first time while jogging before Friday night's game and was in more 
pain than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure thought it would be further along than this," Salmon said. "It feels 
like I have a pulled hamstring. I know I have to be careful, or else I could be 
done for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, but the thing that is helping is that we're playing pretty 
well offensively. I feel like I'm being missed, but it's not as bad as it could 
have been." BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES; HARRY CARAY RETURNS TO 
BROADCAST BOOTH 
</P>

<P>
 Harry Caray returned to Wrigley Field, his first appearance in the broadcast 
booth in nearly a month, saying he feels good but that he will not make a trip 
until September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been lying on my back, not able to do anything or say anything," said 
Caray, 74, who was hospitalized after falling June 23 in Miami when he was 
overcome by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Caray, who doctors found had an irregular heartbeat, was the center of 
attention before the Cubs' 7-6 victory over Cincinnati, greeted by cheering 
fans as his limousine pulled up outside Wrigley Field. He has not attended a 
home game since June 12, the day before Ryne Sandberg announced his retirement.

 Tony Tarasco of the Atlanta Braves sprained his neck making an awkward dive 
while stealing second base against the St. Louis Cardinals. He was removed on a 
stretcher in the first inning of the second game of a doubleheader at St. Louis 
and was released from Jewish Hospital a little more than an hour later. After 
walking with two out, Tarasco appeared to hit his head on the bag as he went 
into second base. The game was delayed for several minutes while trainers 
applied a neck brace and carried him off the field. . . . Umpire Ken Kaiser, 
making his first appearance since being injured in a Boston traffic accident 
nearly two months ago, aggravated a neck injury and had to leave during the 
second inning the game between the Seattle Mariners and the Boston Red Sox. Red 
Sox trainer Charlie Moss said that Kaiser, the home plate umpire, apparently 
aggravated the injury when he twisted his neck on a foul ball. Moss said that 
Kaiser complained of weakness and pain in his left shoulder and neck and is 
doubtful for the remainder of the weekend series.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; IT'S STRAWBERRY'S NIGHT, BUT METS' VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like always, Darryl Strawberry played the crowd at Shea Stadium like a violin. 
Many cheered, more booed and, of course, there was the "Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl" chant 
that used to echo through the eight seasons of nights that he was a New York 
Met. 
</P>
<P>
 They hollered when he made a home run-robbing catch and hit a run-scoring 
single. They hooted when he was called out on strikes. They hoped for more when 
he was left on deck to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's debut for the San Francisco Giants at his former home was an 
event -- and a 6-3 loss to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I'll never forget is New York," Strawberry said. "I mean, it's 
memories here. This is where I had all my success in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets' all-time leader in home runs, RBIs and controversy went one for two 
with two walks. Never known for his defense, Strawberry made the play of the 
game in the third inning, reaching far above the right field fence to steal a 
two-run homer from David Segui. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kent hit a grand slam in the first inning, and the Mets never trailed. 
Barry Bonds hit his seventh homer in as many games and his 30th of the season 
-- the fourth season in a row he has done so. He also had a double for the 
Giants, who are 10-2 since Strawberry joined them. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5-3, Atlanta 0-2 -- Rick Sutcliffe (6-4) and two relievers combined 
on a four-hitter at St. Louis as the Cardinals completed their first 
doubleheader sweep in nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, fill-in starter Tom Urbani gave up only five singles in 8 1/3 
innings and Todd Zeile tied his personal best with four RBIs for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a lot of pressure on myself last year and the beginning of this year, 
and it was like every time I went out there I had the weight of the world on 
me," Urbani said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing to lose and went out to have fun and whatever happens, 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Joe Torre said he hoped the game would jump-start Zeile, who has 
struggled all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this is it," Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, who have lost five of their last six, fell from a tie for the NL 
East lead to 1 1/2 games behind Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Houston 1 -- Orlando Merced hit a three-run home run off the 
right-field foul pole in the seventh inning for the Pirates at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelo Manzanillo (4-2) gave up one hit in 1 1/3 innings of relief, and Mike 
Dyer worked the ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Cincinnati 6 -- Mark Grace hit a go-ahead home run in the seventh 
inning and Sammy Sosa hit a two-run homer at Chicago as the Cubs won their 
fourth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 6-6, Scott Service (0-1) relieved to start the seventh and 
Grace hit his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa had tied the score, 4-4, with a two-out, two-run homer in the fifth 
inning, his 24th. He has homered in three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, Colorado 0 -- Pat Rapp (6-5) pitched a three-hitter for his first 
major league shutout, leading the Marlins at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies are 2-8 against the Marlins. Colorado lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing pitcher Lance Painter (3-4) gave up two first-inning runs on a homer by 
Jerry Browne and Jeff Conine's 400-foot run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillies 4, Padres 3 -- Bobby Munoz (6-3) won for the sixth time in seven 
decisions, helping the Phillies hand the Padres their fourth loss in a row in 
the first game of a doubleheader at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The second game was delayed because of rain with the score tied, 4-4, in the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz (6-3) gave up 12 hits in 6 1/3 innings and Doug Jones got his 25th save.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; IN ANOTHER MOVE, JENKINS SIGNS

<P>
 The training camp player shuffle continued Friday at Oxnard with the signing 
of Robert Jenkins, a guard who played with the Rams and UCLA. To make room for 
Jenkins, safety R.J. Kors, a free agent from Long Beach State, was waived. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two weeks they have been in camp, the Raiders have made more than their 
usual amount of roster moves because of the amount of available veterans 
created by the 80-man roster limit rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing things based on the needs on the roster," Coach Art Shell said. 
"The moves are dictated by the depth at certain positions. When people go down 
at this time of the year, you have to move people based on needs of certain 
positions. But we like to bring in people who have a chance to make the team." 
</P>
<P>
 This was evident Friday as wide receiver Alexander Wright, safety Patrick 
Bates, fullbacks Derrick Gainer and Randy Jordan, and offensive tackles Bruce 
Wilkerson and Greg Skrepenak all skipped the afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their last practice before leaving for Barcelona, where they will play 
Denver on July 31, the Raiders will hold their annual training camp scrimmage 
this morning. Shell, who likes to call the scrimmage a controlled practice, 
said the team will get its first work with game officials and will concentrate 
on several areas of the kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really no big deal," Shell said of the scrimmage. "We'll just practice 
under some game conditions with chains when we move the ball. It's really just 
a regular practice." LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; OFFER MEETS WITH GANDY'S APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams said late Friday that they have reached an agreement on a five-year 
contract with Wayne Gandy, their first-round draft choice who is projected to 
start at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a deal," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president."We are 
going to meet with them (today) to finalize the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy, a 6-4, 290-pound selection from Auburn, arrived in Orange County on 
Friday as a gesture of good faith and will be ready to join two-a-day practices 
at UC Irvine as soon as paper work is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The club offered Gandy $5.13 million earlier in the day, an increase from 
previous proposals. The Rams were so eager to sign Gandy that they offered to 
pay him more than tackle Bernard Williams, who had been selected just ahead of 
Gandy by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy's agent, Neil Schwartz, initially rejected the Rams' proposal because 
under the present collective bargaining agreement a five-year contract would 
allow the Rams to maintain Gandy's rights for a sixth season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller, the quarterback hired during the off-season to replace Jim 
Everett, ran through two practices at UC Irvine without even wearing a brace on 
the left knee that has required surgery twice in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels so good right now . . . it feels normal," Miller said. "We don't 
even need to talk about it. I don't know too many guys who aren't getting hurt 
in the NFL. It's not like I'm the only extreme out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably put the brace on when we go in full gear only for the fact that 
if someone were to roll into me. Sure, I'm hoping to stay healthy, and if I can 
great things are going to happen." T.J. SIMERS

ANTLEY TO RIDE IN HOLLYWOOD JUVENILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Antley has picked up the mount on Sierra Diablo in Monday's $100,000 
Hollywood Juvenile, according to trainer Mark Hennig. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Diablo has raced just once, but it was a memorable effort.The son of 
Conquistador Cielo rallied strongly to post a one-length victory over Chief 
Capote in a maiden special weight race on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye was aboard as Sierra Diablo timed 58 seconds for five 
furlongs in the victory. Delahoussaye, however, is out of action until later 
next week after undergoing surgery to correct a sinus problem, and the mount on 
Sierra Diablo opened up for Antley. 
</P>
<P>
 Antley began Friday in fourth place in the jockey standings with 60 wins and 
tied with Chris McCarron for first in stakes wins at seven apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The probable field for the Juvenile Championship, to be decided at six 
furlongs: Cold N Calculating, Pedroza; Cyrano, Corey Nakatani; Fox Mountain, 
Garrett Gomez; Mr Purple, Chris McCarron; Serena's Song, Gary Stevens; Sierra 
Diablo, Antley, and Tyson's Revenge, Fernando Valenzuela.

SEEING RED OVER SILVER AND BLACK; RAIDERS: SOME OXNARD LEADERS CALL DEAL THAT 
LANDED TEAM'S TRAINING CAMP ONE OF CITY'S WORST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been described by some Oxnard leaders as one of the worst deals in city 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 When city officials lured the Los Angeles Raiders' summer training camp to 
Oxnard in 1985, promising the team a practice field and a hotel, they knew the 
team would never be a source of profit for the city -- not directly anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But civic leaders thought the football team would help put Oxnard on the 
national map, attracting tourists from as far as San Diego to watch the Silver 
and Black practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that caught Oxnard officials by surprise, however, Raiders owner Al 
Davis erected a large black tarp around the entire practice field, preventing 
outsiders from watching the team train. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Radisson Suite Hotel, partly underwritten by Oxnard in exchange 
for playing host to the Raiders for six weeks in July and August, ended up 
costing the cash-strapped city almost $1 million annually and is currently in 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders hold only one open practice a year in Oxnard -- Raiders Family 
Day, which takes place today at Channel Islands High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of original expectations, some Oxnard leaders say they believe the 
annual visit by more than 100 Raiders players and officials has had a positive 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the recognition that Oxnard has the Raiders is enough," said Carol 
Lavender, executive director of the Greater Oxnard and Harbors Tourism Bureau. 
"(The Raiders) have press conferences from their training camp every day, and 
people all over the world know where Oxnard is now." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone thinks Oxnard has gotten its money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any direct commercial influence from the Raiders being here," 
said Steven Kinney, president of the Greater Oxnard Economic Development Corp., 
a city-funded agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And one Oxnard official, who asked not to be identified, said that in a recent 
staff analysis of city projects, the Raiders deal was ranked as the worst ever. 
</P>
<P>
 William Fulton, a Ventura-based essayist on urban planning, said that Oxnard, 
like many smaller cities in the mid-1980s, exercised poor judgment when faced 
with the prospect of luring a major sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al Davis was willing to take a deal from the city knowing full well that he 
didn't want any tourists around. The city was too caught up in the mystique of 
having a major sports team to think effectively," Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that they're businessmen, and they are looking to get 
the best of you, so you can't get starry-eyed because they're the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton likened the 1985 Oxnard-Raiders deal to the current effort to build a 
minor-league baseball stadium in Ventura County, despite warnings that the 
facility could be a drain on city treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard isn't the first small city to get involved in a bad deal with a sports 
team," Fulton said, "and it sure won't be the last." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez, who was a City Council member at the time of the deal, 
said city officials expected a surge of tourism and publicity to follow the 
arrival of the Raiders. Name recognition has improved, he said, but the tourist 
dollars never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not know the practices were going to be closed," Lopez said. "We 
really expected the Raiders to be more a part of the community . . . but the 
Raiders have never lived up to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez added that city leaders also expected the hordes of journalists who 
cover the Raiders to stay in Oxnard, but most simply commute from Los Angeles 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Oxnard sold $9 million in bonds to purchase land and build a parking 
lot near the River Ridge Golf Course, and solicited a developer to build the 
Radisson on city property to house the football team and its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders built two football fields and a field house on the land. The team 
is charged a $1 yearly fee to use the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials originally hoped that the Radisson would generate enough 
revenue to pay off the bonds, but the hotel was unable to deliver its annual 
$985,000 payment, and the city has since had to foot most of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard renegotiated the Radisson deal in 1989, allowing the owners of the 
hotel, Westland Co. of Ventura, to pay a minimal annual rent of $30,000 the 
first year with steadily increasing payments again reaching $985,000 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Westland Co. has made its minimal payments -- about $300,000 over the past 
five years -- in accordance with the new contract, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the hotel owners currently face foreclosure after failing to repay 
$18.8-million in loans to Manufacturers Bank, and it is unlikely that they will 
ever be able to repay the city for the bond payments, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its problems, the Radisson is the busiest hotel in Oxnard, with an 80% 
occupancy rate in the past three months, said Vern Heitzenrader, the hotel's 
general manager. He said the Raiders have always been good business for the 
hostelry, bringing in about $275,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the practices of many professional football teams, Raider camps have 
been closed to the public since Al Davis took over the club in 1963, said Gil 
Lafferty Hernandez, the Raiders' director of marketing. The secrecy allows the 
team to experiment with trick plays and new formations, safe from observation 
by opposing scouts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had an open practice to the public. We've always had the 
mystical black tarp around the field," Hernandez said. "It's part of the Raider 
mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Raiders' rabid local fans, having the team in Oxnard is better than 
nothing -- they can always mill around for autographs and catch a peek of the 
practices from several small openings in the infamous tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a gate over there that opens just so wide. We just look through 
there," said Ricky Guzman of Oxnard, 24, who brought his six nieces and nephews 
to the Radisson Friday in search of autographs. "You just have to try and see 
if you can see something." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Raiders will open their training camp to the public today 
during Raiders Family Day. The entire Raiders team, along with coach Art Shell 
and the Raiderettes, will sign autographs and pose for pictures. The free event 
will take place at Channel Islands High School, 1400 Raiders Way in Oxnard, 
beginning at 11:15 a.m. About 2,500 people attended last year's event. For 
information call (310) 322-5901.

WOMAN LEAPS FROM CAR TO ESCAPE THIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the options of going for a ride with the 220-pound man stealing her car 
or leaping out of the moving vehicle, Debra Zellis chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it couldn't be any worse than going with him," the 41-year-old 
Oxnard woman said. "I didn't know what he was going to do. He could have been 
planning to torture me or rape me. I thought, I'm not going anywhere with this 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellis, a secretary at Mary Law Private School in Oxnard, said she was sitting 
in her '84 Chrysler in the school's parking lot, taking a break about 11:40 
a.m. Friday, when the man approached her open window. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked her for directions to the mall -- which she obligingly gave -- then 
pulled out a gun and told her to move over. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I scooted over," Zellis said. "I was very calm. I didn't want to act mad 
or irritate him." 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker told her not to touch anything or he would shoot her, then asked 
her to adjust his seat for him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he pulled out of the school's parking lot and headed down Albany Drive, 
Zellis decided to make a break for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tumbling out onto the road, Zellis said she bruised and scraped her hips but 
otherwise was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 A fellow employee who witnessed the incident from inside the school called 
police, telling them someone is "stealing our secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellis said she did not think her actions were particularly brave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky," said Zellis, who described the carjacker as about 6-foot-2 and 
220 pounds. "Somebody was watching out for me up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she wondered why anyone would want her car that badly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why he'd want that piece of junk I don't know," Zellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police have an answer to that question: About 50 feet away from the 
school's parking lot they found another stolen car, this one from Los Angeles 
County. It had apparently broken down and the carjacker needed a quick 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Officer Terry Burr said the carjacker had not been located 
Friday and that an investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have only been about a half-dozen carjackings in Oxnard since 
September, two auto thefts in June heightened fears in the county of such 
crimes. One of the incidents involved two teen-agers who were killed in a 
head-on collision after stealing a car in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In her case, Zellis was back at work Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do?" she said. "I didn't want to sit at home. I figured he might 
get into my house, he's got my keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the traumatic experience of having a gun pointed at her and briefly 
sharing the front seat with a car thief, Zellis was quite composed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't even break a nail," she said, waving a complete set of fingers topped 
with shiny pink nails.

HOME BUILDING VOTE STIRS GROWTH DEBATE IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, some developers are expected to get 
permission Monday to construct homes in the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of who gets to build and when has become especially contentious in a 
town where council elections usually divide between slow-growth and 
pro-business camps, and where many residents bear sentimental attachments to 
the open agricultural lands that crisscross the east side. 
</P>
<P>
 "This topic touches a central issue in this city, and that is how fast are we 
going to grow?" said Councilman Steve Bennett. "Land use and the rate of growth 
are the driving issues in Ventura politics." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's housing allocation process is especially difficult because the 
General Plan allows a maximum of 1,018 allocations through 1999 -- but 
developers want to build about 2,600 units. 
</P>
<P>
 And some council members, who consider 1,018 allocations too many to 
distribute in one year, would like to hold that number down to a couple hundred 
allocations annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Awarding an allocation does not mean a house automatically can be built on the 
designated site. Rather, it means the builder can apply for permits to 
construct the specified number of apartments, condominiums, mobile homes or 
houses. The city still gets to review the development design, a process that 
can stretch over months or even years. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven developers have applied for allocations. Aside from two proposed 
developments near Ventura Avenue, all the projects would be built in the middle 
or east end of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The two proposals with the most council support have also excited the most 
public controversy, turning neighbor against neighbor, inciting threats of a 
lawsuit in one instance and a possible ballot initiative in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposal to build 200 homes, office buildings, bike paths and a park on 
Ventura Avenue seemed destined to sail through the contentious allocations 
process. But threats of a lawsuit from small property owners on the site, who 
did not want their land rezoned from heavy industrial to lighter industrial and 
commercial uses, persuaded one of the three main development partners to drop 
out of the project this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the Huntsinger family's land, the other property owners involved 
in the project -- the Neel family and Kinko's, the national copy service giant 
headquartered in the area -- say they still hope to make the deal work at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Equally controversial is a proposal by developer Ron Hertel to swap his land 
at Telephone and Kimball roads for a city-owned lemon grove at Telegraph Road 
and Petit Avenue. To sweeten the deal, Hertel has offered to give the city $2 
million toward building a regional park on his 94-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the city's land and Hertel's property, however, lie within Ventura's 
agricultural greenbelt -- sites designated to remain farmland until the year 
2010 under the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal has pitted local sports enthusiasts against neighbors of the proposed 
development and greenbelt preservationists. Opponents are circulating petitions 
for a ballot initiative that would not allow any development in the city's 
greenbelt without approval from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals include a plan to build 60 apartments at Darling and Wells 
roads, a project calling for 467 homes at Telegraph and Hill roads, and a 
request to construct 227 homes at Telegraph and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Planning Commission, meeting to review the proposals last week, 
recommended awarding allocations to the 60-unit apartment complex, a mobile 
home park at Copland Drive and Telephone Road, and a condominium project at 
Cedar and Kellogg streets, for a total of about 170 allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members have shown the most interest so far in single-family home 
developments, particularly the Neel-Kinko's project on the Avenue and the 
Hertel land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect Monday night's meeting to be so heated that they have 
decided to start it at 6 p.m., an hour and a half earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Vincent, who devotes about four hours a week to gathering signatures for 
the greenbelt ballot initiative, said she hopes to pack the council meeting 
with as many as 50 people opposing the land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sparks are going to fly," she said.

JUDGE REJECTS BID TO DELAY LEGAL CASE OVER LANDFILL; COURTS: PROPONENTS OF 
WELDON CANYON DUMP WANTED TO POSTPONE DECISION UNTIL AFTER NOVEMBER ELECTION. 
HEARING IS SET FOR AUG. 22. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The legal case against the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative will be argued 
before a judge in one month, giving the courts a chance to settle the matter 
before it goes to Ventura County voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing Friday, retired Appeals Judge Richard W. Abbe rejected a move by 
landfill proponents to delay the decision until after the election. Instead, he 
set a court date for Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this matter should go forward," Abbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials opposed to the initiative, which would ask voters to approve zoning 
and land-use rights for a landfill, said the expedited schedule was essential 
to their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very, very important to the county that this matter be heard and 
determined by the end of August," Assistant County Counsel William Moritz told 
the judge. That would leave time for appeals before the county prints its 
ballots for November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative in our view asks the voters to pass a law that would be 
unconstitutional," Moritz said. The county is expected to support the lawsuit 
filed by the Ojai and Ventura city councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the landfill said the schedule would leave them little time to 
prepare a case. And it could deny voters a chance to speak on the matter, they 
argued. Residents throughout the county signed petitions this spring, putting 
the Weldon Canyon matter to a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with a constitutional right," said Wes Peltzeran attorney 
representing supporters. "It's up to the voters to decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Peltzer also argued that the judge should add Taconic Resources, the San Diego 
County partnership pushing the ballot initiative, to the lawsuit. Currently, 
the suit names only Eloise Brown, the Moorpark activist who started the 
petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe refused to add Taconic, saying it would only delay the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe, a retired justice on the 2nd District Court of Appeals, was picked for 
the case after five Ventura County judges removed themselves or were 
disqualified from hearing the politically divisive matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill issue pits communities in the western half of the county against 
neighbors to the east. Fearing that the west county will begin shipping its 
trash to the Simi Valley Landfill, many east county residents want to see a 
site developed in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan for Weldon Canyon was dropped last summer when it became clear that the 
Board of Supervisors would not approve it. A new group, Taconic Resources, is 
asking the voters to grant the needed approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe said he was unaware of the political machinations surrounding Weldon 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a bumper sticker on the way in that says 'Dump Weldon.' I don't know 
what that means," he told the lawyers assembled before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about Ventura County," he said. "I live in Santa 
Barbara County. I like it down here, though. I'd hate to see it covered with 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
 The issues before him in next month's hearing will focus on the legality of 
the ballot initiative. Lawyers for Ojai and Ventura argue that the measure 
violates the law in at least a dozen ways. Chiefly, they say an initiative 
cannot be used to grant land-use rights to a specific company. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltzer and Taconic officials say the measure is legally defensible and should 
go to the voters in November. Peltzer said a similar case, involving a ballot 
initiative and land-use rights, is coming before the state Supreme Court this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge should wait for a decision in that matter before ruling on the 
Ventura case, Peltzer argued. "There just isn't any reason not to allow the 
voters to vote on this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe rejected that reasoning and set a four-week schedule for filing briefs 
and preparing arguments. The county has not officially joined the suit, but is 
expected to file a brief in support of the Ojai and Ventura suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of five supervisors oppose the measure, and the county counsel has 
declared it legally invalid.

BOARD TO STUDY NEW PERFORMING ARTS SCHOOL; EDUCATION: SIMI VALLEY TRUSTEES 
AGREE TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED MAGNET, AS WELL AS CONSIDER A FOUR-YEAR HIGH 
SCHOOL PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two days of brainstorming and some bickering, the Simi Valley school 
board has agreed to study a proposal to transform a junior high school into a 
high school emphasizing performing arts and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The study would also examine turning Simi Valley's two existing high schools 
into four-year programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither idea is new, school board members said they want to see the 
proposed changes become reality -- possibly as early as the fall of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see spending another year hashing this around," trustee Diane Collins 
said. "I think this should go to the very first board meeting when school 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
 The board will review a proposal outlining exactly what the study will cover 
at its meeting Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of restructuring the district's two high schools and creating a new 
performing arts high school sparked hours of discussion Thursday and Friday 
during the board's summer retreat. Twice a year, the trustees meet informally 
with Simi Valley Unified School District administrators and educators for a 
two-day planning workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the board reviewed the results of a survey of parents conducted 
in the spring that revealed that 55% of 4,863 families in Simi Valley were 
interested in reorganizing the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is support in the community, rather strongly, for four-year high 
schools," Assistant Supt. Susan C. Parks said. Royal and Simi Valley high 
schools currently serve grades 10 through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a third "magnet" high school, probably on one of the district's four 
junior high school campuses, would alleviate crowding at the high schools and 
improve learning, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Educationally, it is what ought to be done," trustee Doug Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say ninth-graders entering high school have more opportunities for 
counseling and advanced classes to better prepare them for college. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford warned the board that the restructuring would require 
a lengthy study of the district's facilities that would have to be started 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to do it, we have to start right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the study will examine which junior high school site could house a 
magnet high school, which would enroll between 600 and 800 students, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members agreed that if Simi Valley's ninth-graders were to move to 
four-year high schools, the decreased population at the junior high level would 
warrant transforming one of the junior high schools into a magnet high school 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real key is how are you going to restructure the middle grades?" Collins 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Carla Kurachi and Doug Crosse said the high school restructuring 
would provide an opportunity to establish a middle school for grades six 
through eight -- a plan that was approved by the board last fall and later 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a heated debate over whether to revisit the middle school issue, the 
board decided to limit the study to high school restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the parent survey indicated support for both a magnet school and 
four-year high schools, some parents are against the idea.

 "I think that all sounds wonderful, but they're trying to do all these 
programs that cost money," Simi Valley parent Coleen Ary said. "I really 
question the priority here." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is still facing about a $2.8-million deficit. Because the 
plans for a magnet high school and four-year high schools are still in the 
conceptual stages, district officials are uncertain how much the changes would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The feasibility study, which will examine the potential costs of the changes, 
could be completed by the end of the year, district officials said.

HEART ATTACK, NOT CRASH, KILLED SIMI MAN; AUTOPSY: FRANK PLAICE DIED FROM 
NATURAL CAUSES, CORONER RULES. HE WAS THE SUBJECT OF A TWO-WEEK SEARCH AFTER 
DISAPPEARING JULY 7.

<P>
 A heart attack, not a car crash, killed the Simi Valley accountant who was 
found dead in his wrecked coupe after being missing for two weeks, the Ventura 
County coroner ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Plaice, 57, died of ischemic heart disease -- a general term covering 
heart attacks -- said Dr. Ronald O'Halloran, the Ventura County coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's investigator Zelmira Isaac said Plaice died instantly, before his 
car plunged off the Simi Valley Freeway two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling that Plaice died of natural causes confirmed his family's 
suspicions that he was suffering some kind of medical emergency when his 1994 
Ford Probe careened over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 His ex-wife, Jeanette, said she believed Plaice was rushing to get treatment 
at Kaiser Hospital in Woodland Hills, where doctors had earlier diagnosed his 
complaint of abdominal pains as indigestion. She declined to comment on the 
diagnosis Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends and family last heard from Frank Plaice about 5 p.m. July 7 when 
he left the Simi Valley Elks Lodge where he served as secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 When Plaice did not go to work the following day or meet his girlfriend for 
dinner that evening, friends and family reported his disappearance to Simi 
Valley police. Then they launched an all-out search, handing out dozens of 
flyers and searching by car and plane the route Plaice often drove from his 
Chatsworth office to visit clients in Fillmore, Santa Paula, Ojai and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plaice's body was not found until Thursday because his car had plunged off 
the Simi Valley Freeway and landed out of sight in a thick stand of oak trees 
at the bottom of a 100-foot embankment. Two Simi Valley police investigators 
riding in a sheriff's helicopter spotted the car about 10:35 a.m. Thursday 
while flying over rugged terrain along the freeway near Rocky Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Even friends and family who had been pushing police to search harder admitted 
no one could ever have spotted the Ford from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely satisfied that's the case," said Wayne Myers, grand knight of 
the Elks lodge. "He couldn't have been spotted unless somebody happened to be 
hiking that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood among Plaice's lodge brothers is "pretty solemn," Myers said. "At 
least there is a finality to it. It's sad to see him pass on, but at least we 
don't have to worry any more that he met with foul play." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaice's family and fellow Elks have planned a memorial service for him at 2 
p.m. Monday at the United Methodist Church, 2394 Erringer Road in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Elks Major 
Project for Crippled Children, care of Simi Valley Elks Lodge 2492, at 1561 
Kuehner Drive, Simi Valley, 93063.

MEDICAL CLINIC COULD OPEN BY END OF THE YEAR; MOORPARK: NEW FACILITY FOR THE 
POOR WOULD REPLACE ONE THAT WAS CLOSED IN 1993. SUPERVISORS WILL VOTE NEXT WEEK 
WHETHER TO APPROVE THE LEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new medical clinic for the poor could open in Moorpark by the end of the 
year if Ventura County supervisors approve a lease on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic would replace a dilapidated facility on High Street that was 
closed in October. Since the closure, Moorpark residents who are on Medi-Cal or 
who lack insurance have had to go to Simi Valley for care, Supervisor Vicky 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to open a new clinic almost immediately after the old one was 
closed," Howard said. "But we had more problems trying to get this lease then I 
can tell you. It was like dealing with New York lawyers, all the negotiating 
that went on." 
</P>
<P>
 The county worked with Moorpark officials to find a building large enough to 
contain examining rooms, a records room and a reception area. The site also had 
to be near public transportation. Officials were frustrated after negotiations 
over vacant space in the Moorpark Town Center fell through a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally had to give up and start over," Howard said. "I think, though, 
that we've finally found the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The county plans to open the clinic in the Campus Park neighborhood near 
Moorpark College. City leaders wondered whether the proposed site, at the 
Varsity Park Shopping Center off Princeton Avenue and Campus Park Drive, was 
the best location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really sure if that area is the right niche for this kind of clinic," 
said Councilman John Wozniak. "I would think somewhere downtown would be more 
appropriate, but they do have bus service that goes right by there and they are 
within walking distance of the Virginia Colony." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Henkels, manager of the Simi Valley Clinic, estimated that of the more 
than 3,000 patients that the Simi clinic has seen in the last six months, 700 
to 800 came from Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "There definitely is a need," he said. "And from my experience in Simi, once 
it is open I imagine they will find an even greater need than they imagine as 
people (from Moorpark) who can't make it to Simi will go to the new clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 The county plans to spend about $220,000 constructing the examining rooms, 
records room and reception area at the new site. Rent for the 4,400-square-foot 
storefront is $5,000 a month, Health Care Agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details have not been disclosed about how many days a week the facility will 
be open or the number of doctors and nurses who will work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Clinic is open six days a week and is staffed by two doctors, 
a family nurse practitioner, and another nurse, Henkels said. He said the 
Moorpark site might not be open as many days, but would have a similar number 
of doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is hopeful that the clinic will open soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been expecting it to open for some time, and I expect that the board 
will easily approve the proposal," she said.

DIVINE HORSEMAN HOLDS REINS AT JEWISH INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun was just rising over the Brandeis-Bardin ranch near Simi Valley as 
Johnny Varble began the day's jumble of chores. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he fell into bed that night, Varble had herded 100 head of cattle, 
baled hay, re-jiggered a faulty electrical line and supervised a kitchen crew 
making lunch for 100 student campers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typical day for the fourth-generation Ventura County resident, who 
has been caring for the 3,100-acre property for more than 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My title is ranch manager, but looking after the cows is a pretty small part 
of what I do," said the 66-year-old Varble. "My job is really to keep this 
place running." 
</P>
<P>
 The place in Varble's care is the Brandeis-Bardin Institute, a Jewish 
educational center founded by noted educator Shlomo Bardin and Supreme Court 
Justice Louis D. Brandeis in Hancock, N.Y., in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brandeis died, Bardin decided to move the institute to California in 
1947, where weather would allow year-round operations. The arid climate and 
rolling hills south of Simi Valley reminded Brandeis of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now hundreds of Jewish people from around the world gather at the center each 
year for educational programs on religion and culture. The institute also has a 
summer camp for children. 
</P>
<P>
 While visitors and students attend lectures and enjoy the sweeping vistas and 
rural atmosphere, Varble tools around the property in a faded red 1958 Jeep, 
making sure everything is going smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come in here with all their worries and they're all wound up and 
tense," Varble said. "My job is to take care of all the problems so they can 
relax and be themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Varble's work at the institute does not go unnoticed. Over the years he has 
gained the respect and admiration of the institute's administrators, taking on 
a sort of living legend status. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, he is the best horseman in the U.S.," said Jerry Novorr, who serves on 
the institute's board of directors. "You ought to see him out there herding 
cattle. This is his ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Mars, executive vice president of the institute, also has high praise 
for the ranch manager. "Johnny is my colleague and my teacher and my best 
friend here at Brandeis," Mars said. "Without Johnny, this place would not 
exist. He knows every inch of this place and he takes care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mars is especially proud of the horseback-riding and cattle-branding skills he 
has learned under Varble's tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what I'd expect to be doing with a Ph.D. in Jewish education," Mars 
said. "But that is one of the things that makes it so delightful. This is a 
very special place, and a big reason for that is Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to caring for three dozen horses and 100 head of cattle, Varble 
acts as an all-around handyman. He fixes everything from faulty sewer lines to 
leaky roofs on the institute's aging buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 64 structures at the institute date back to the early 1900s, when 
a millionaire beer maker named Eddie Maier owned much of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest, a two-story Spanish-style house built in 1914, was 
destroyed by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Varble is helping with plans for a replacement that will house the 
institute's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "One minute I'm out in the barn," Varble said. "The next minute I'm talking to 
a county planner about how we're going put this new building together." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in boots, Levi's, snap-button shirt and 10-gallon hat, Varble looks 
more like a cowboy than a building designer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ability to juggle a range of tasks runs in his family. It began with 
his great-grandfather, Sam Easley, a beekeeper who moved to Simi Valley and 
became the first clerk of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a little ranching too," Varble said. "We all learned a range of skills 
because we didn't have much money, and if we wanted something done we had to do 
it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Varble is sharing his expertise with one of his sons, John Jr., 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty to do around here and I'm glad to have all the help I can 
get," Varble said. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is an especially busy time. In addition to tending the ranch and its 
buildings, Varble and his staff of 15 must cook and care for the hundreds of 
students who flock to the institute for summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Varble, a longtime single father who reared his three children, said the 
experience gives him insight into the needs of the youths who gather at the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see these kids running around here today and it all comes back, the growing 
pains, the craving for privacy and freedom from restrictions," Varble said. 
"This is the kind of place where kids can run free. I used to let my kids camp 
out in the hills. I didn't know exactly where they were, but I knew they were 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 When things get really hectic at the ranch, Varble retreats to a dark, cool 
barn that once belonged to Maier. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the company of his 11 snorting quarter-horses, Varble can relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I go to get away from it all," Varble said, as he threw a 
saddle on a 6-year-old mare named Rosarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Varble spends much of his free time riding and training his horses. For the 
past 18 years, he has competed in the rodeo event called reining. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of award saddles and belt buckles line the barn's walls, attesting to 
his skill. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon Varble demonstrated the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 With a slight twitch of the rein and touch of the spur, he coaxed Rosarita 
into a series of gallops and prances. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking measured steps, the horse glided backward, forward and side to side. 
</P>
<P>
 Then after a brief pause and another slight twitch of the rein, Rosarita spun 
in place, twirling around and around as rocks scattered and dust flew. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the best I ever had," Varble said, patting the horse between the 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 When the day's work is done, Varble retires to a cozy, whitewashed cottage on 
a hill overlooking much of the ranch. He and his wife, Wendy, restored the 
1940s house after they were married eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are really fortunate to have this place," Wendy Varble said. "It's 
like being on a permanent vacation."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISTRICT TO REVIEW VALEDICTORIAN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following protests by a small group of students and parents, the Oxnard Union 
High School District board has agreed to consider changing how it chooses 
valedictorians at four of its high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided at a meeting Wednesday to review its policy of giving equal 
weight to both honors and regular classes when calculating the grade-point 
averages for valedictorian candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came following a public plea at the meeting by Ryan Jimenez, an 
honor student from Channel Islands High School. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue came to a head earlier this summer when two friends of Jimenez 
at Channel Islands complained that they had been unfairly passed over in the 
school's selection of its two valedictorians this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The graduates, Olivia Arboleda and Errol Nillo, each took more than a dozen 
honors classes at the high school and earned nearly all A's, giving them the 
highest grade point averages on a 5.0 scale at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were passed over for valedictorian in favor of two other graduates -- 
Christopher Ingel and Julio Coronado -- who took fewer honors classes but who 
made slightly better grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands and other Oxnard district high schools give honors classes 
more weight by grading them on a 5.0-scale, with an "A" earning five points, a 
"B" four points and so on. The 4.0-scale treats all classes the same: "A" equal 
to 4.0, "B" equal to 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the schools except Hueneme High choose valedictorians based on the 
4.0 scale. Hueneme High recognizes its highest achievers from both the 4.0 and 
5.0 scales. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON NEW TROLLEY FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Ventura wants to keep its new downtown-harbor trolley past March, it will 
have to invest nearly $20,000 in the venture, according to a report to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote Monday night on whether to spend $19,249 on the purchase 
of a new trolley.A $76,996 grant from the Federal Transit Administration will 
make up the rest of the purchase cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Ventura has issued a franchise contract to Madison and Associates 
to operate a gasoline-fueled trolley from July 1, 1994, to March 1, 1995. That 
is the same company that operates trolleys in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley runs between downtown, the Pier and Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare, good all day, is $1 for adults and 50 cents for seniors. Children 
under 5 years of age, residents over 75 and guests of the hotels whose 
advertisements are plastered on the sides of the trolley for free. CONSTANCE

 Carlos Munoz was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical Center at 3:34 
p.m. Thursday, about an hour after he was found at the bottom of an 8-foot pool 
at his aunt's condominium complex in the 1200 block of Miramar Walk in Oxnard, 
authorities said. 
</P>

 A 44-year-old Oxnard woman died of an unknown cause while in custody at 
Ventura County Jail, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gloria Mendez, an unemployed seamstress, was pronounced dead at Ventura 
County Medical Center at 11:32 p.m. Thursday, about two hours after she was 
discovered unconscious in the medical ward at the jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said an autopsy performed Friday 
did not reveal the cause of death. Authorities are waiting for results of 
toxicology and tissue tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was arrested for using drugs and booked by Oxnard police on a warrant 
about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was under the influence of alcohol and heroin at the time and was put 
in the jail's medical ward, Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had medical problems related to drugs, and abscesses on her leg, and they 
wanted to monitor her," Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was put into a single-person cell and given medication to relieve her 
pain, Husband said. Nurses checked her vital signs periodically and monitored 
her through an intercom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they checked her vital signs about 9 p.m. Thursday, they appeared normal, 
Husband said. Nurses then continued to monitor her through an intercom and in a 
routine check about 45 minutes later, Mendez was found unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 She was then taken to Ventura County Medical Center, where she died. PEGGY Y.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS GOLF COURSE BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider soliciting 
bids from developers for two 18-hole golf courses at Happy Camp Canyon Regional 
Park in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark officials complained to Supervisor Vicky Howard this week that they 
haven't been given access to the bid proposal, and thus will have a difficult 
time making comments at the board meeting.The park is outside the city limits, 
but falls into Moorpark's area of interest and mandates that the county notify 
the city about proposed developments there. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the county's Recreation Services department said the city was 
not notified about the plan due to a clerical oversight. The city was rushed 
copies of the proposal Thursday and will be able to comment on the proposal at 
the board meeting and later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very preliminary," said Robert Amore, the lease manager of the park 
for the Department of Recreation Services. "All we're doing at this point is 
asking for proposals. There will be plenty of opportunities for the public and 
the city to comment when we actually have a proposal to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors on Tuesday will consider changing the county's Master Plan to 
allow the two golf courses, and allowing the Department of Recreation Services 
to open up bidding for their development. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB REOPENS AFTER 6 
MONTHS 
</P>

<P>
 Outside the Boys & Girls Club of Simi Valley on Friday morning the sun was 
shining and a cool breeze blew, but no children were in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 They had all squeezed into the main clubhouse, which opened Friday for the 
first time since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake shook the lights loose and cracked the walls, causing more than 
$124,000 in damage at the club, housed in an old schoolhouse on Kadota Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The club moved into another building while repairs were made, but it just 
wasn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids had no pool tables, no water fountain, no soda machine," said 
Program Director Paula Mackelburg. "It didn't really feel like their place." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Gina Jimenez agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty bad," she said. "We like this place because we can just hang 
out and feel really comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 youngsters crammed into the club on Friday, playing energetic games 
of Foosball and air hockey or waiting for a turn on one of three tattered pool 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 young people between the ages of 7 and 15 use the club each day, 
Mackelburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, additional repairs will be made, including the installation 
of new carpet and drywall. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Breeann Leverich said she is glad the club has reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was waiting for a long time," she said. "I think it's pretty cool." SARA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE REPORT SLIGHT HIKE IN SOME 
CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thefts and burglaries in Simi Valley increased slightly, while robberies and 
assaults decreased in the first six months of 1994 compared with the same 
period last year, according to statistics released Friday by the city's Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 869 thefts and 311 burglaries reported between January and June 30 
of this year.But in the first six months of 1993, residents reported 832 thefts 
and 301 burglaries -- a drop of about 4% in both types of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The police report also says that robberies decreased from 25 to 19, a drop of 
about 24%, and that assaults fell by 8.4% from 204 to 187 incidents reported in 
those periods. Residents also reported 185 car thefts, a decrease of 7.1% from 
last year's six-month total of 199. But forcible rapes increased from seven in 
the first half of 1993 to nine during the same period of 1994, a 28.6% rise, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one slaying in the first six months of this year -- the February 
stabbing of teen-ager Chad Hubbard -- but none in the same time last year, the 
report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also shows that the value of property stolen in the first half of 
1993 went from $2,135,620 to $2,178,666 in 1994 -- a 2.1% increase. And it 
shows that the value of recovered property increased by 62.5% over the first 
half of last year, from $367,772 to $597,347. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that there's really that big a change in the statistics," said 
Sgt. Mike King, spokesman for the department. "There's nothing we can attribute 
that to except that no crime trends caused a dramatic increase, and our 
aggressive anti-crime efforts continue to keep the crime rate low." MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; FINES TO BE INCREASED FOR FALSE-ALARM 
CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to cut down on the number of false alarms that sheriff's 
deputies respond to in Moorpark, the city has decided to levy higher fines for 
bogus calls. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10% of the nearly 8,000 calls for service the department's 20-member 
Moorpark Enforcement Division received last year were for burglar and fire 
alarms, according to the division's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically the Moorpark division has three patrol cars in the city at any given 
time, and department policy requires that two of those cars respond to burglar 
or fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every response takes up two-thirds of our deputies in the field," said Lt. 
Martin Rouse. "About 99% of the (burglar and fire) alarms are false, but as a 
precaution we send out two patrols, and it typically takes at least half an 
hour to straighten things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the alarms are triggered accidentally because either they are of poor 
quality or the people setting them lack proper training, Rouse said. SCOTT

<P>
 A plan to complete a housing tract in eastern Moorpark, left unfinished in 
1992 when the original developer went bankrupt, was approved by the Moorpark 
City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the plan by Warmington Homes of Costa Mesa to 
build 87 houses in the 494-home Campus Hills development. Members of the local 
homeowners association voiced support for the project at a meeting earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmington made its proposal after the council last month rejected another 
developer's plan. Homeowners in the neighborhood were opposed to the proposal 
made by Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad to build smaller homes than 
originally planned for the area. SCOTT HADLY

VETERANS DIRECTOR TO MAKE PLEA TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's top official for veterans affairs on Friday said he will join 
local veterans next week as they plead with Ventura County supervisors to 
retain funding for the county's Veterans Services Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Marine Col. Jay R. Vargas, director for the California Department of 
Veterans Affairs, said he will make a special appeal to supervisors at a public 
budget hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To trim costs, county officials have proposed eliminating the $116,000 the 
county now spends a year on veterans services. They said local veterans and 
their families will have to seek assistance from state and federal veterans 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the county's estimated 78,000 veterans say the services 
offered by the county office are sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping veterans and their families file claims for government 
benefits, the office provides counseling for veterans and arranges for their 
transportation to Veterans Administration health-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who was in Ventura on Friday for a general board meeting of the state 
Department of Veterans Affairs, said eliminating funding for the county office 
"is the most disgraceful thing the supervisors could do to veterans." 
</P>
<P>
 Many local veteran leaders agree. They are rounding up opponents and hope to 
make a strong showing at the budget hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boards respond to eyeball-to-eyeball contact with people much more than 
they respond to letters," said LeRoy Andrews, 73, of Ventura, a World War II 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to be there, and I hope a lot of other veterans show up too." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Sanderlin, commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 1679 in 
Ventura, said he has contacted other veterans groups in the county and urged 
their members to attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the county is in a tight spot, but this is important to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, the agency reduced its operating hours at its Oxnard 
office and cut two full-time staff members to save money, said Charles 
Lowrance, the county's veterans services officer. They also shut down satellite 
offices in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Ventura, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the office, which opened in 1937, still has four full-time workers to 
handle 5,000 open files. 
</P>
<P>
 James E. Isom, director of the county's Public Social Services Agency, has 
recommended that the veterans office receive no funding because the county is 
not mandated to run it. By pulling county funding, the veterans office would 
also lose the state's annual $54,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Isom's recommendation came after the supervisors asked department managers to 
trim their budgets by 18%. Isom suggested the office could continue to function 
by incorporating as a nonprofit organization and seeking private donations or 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But some vets, like LeRoy Andrews, believe the office will close if the county 
withdraws its funding. Andrews said he has sought the office's service many 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done a tremendous job for veterans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk is bracing for Monday. "The least pleasant thing 
is to have a bunch of old veterans come down to the boardroom and get your 
patriotic heart beating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said their anger should not be directed at the board. Rather, they 
should look to state and federal programs for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Local veterans counter that the Veterans Administration employs only one 
part-time staff member for the entire county to help process claims.

THEY'RE STILL PLAYING DIRTY POOL IN RUSSIA; GOODWILL GAMES: SWIMMING 
COMPETITION POSTPONED A DAY. RAVELING THREATENS WALKOUT OVER PRACTICE COURT 
FOUL-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a decade into glasnost, or openness, some Russian officials apparently 
are still not comfortable with the concept. During a news conference Friday to 
discuss the Goodwill Games, St. Petersburg's deputy mayor was asked about the 
SKA swimming pool, where competition was scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
 After Vitali Mutko was overheard through a sensitive microphone whispering to 
his colleagues on the stage that discussion of the pool was off limits, he 
finally announced, "I don't think we should raise this question at the press 
conference today." 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that Mutko's non-response response had set off an alarm in the room 
filled with reporters, the Goodwill Games' president, Jack Kelly of Atlanta, 
interrupted, acknowledging that a mishap during the filtration process this 
week had turned the water in the newly renovated pool black. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Kelly's employer, Ted Turner, is the king of colorization, not 
even he had a solution to save the schedule. After U.S. and Russian swimming 
officials inspected the water late Friday and discovered that it was still a 
murky olive green, they announced that all 20 events would be held on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mutko's defensiveness earlier in the day revealed, the controversy is an 
embarrassment to organizers in St. Petersburg as they attempt to stage the 
first international multisport competition in Russia since the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union. They were hopeful that President Boris Yeltsin would 
arrive in the city for tonight's opening ceremony at Kirov Stadium to find the 
Games progressing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no chance of that, although not all of the bumps are the organizers' 
fault. In the only sport played Friday, France's opponent in team handball 
became Sweden after the South Koreans missed their flight from home. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organization appeared suspect when men's basketball teams from the 
United States and China arrived at the Lenin Sport and Concert Complex for 
practice at the same time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was determined after a long argument that the hour belonged to the 
Chinese, U.S. Coach George Raveling was so agitated that he threatened to take 
his players home. Instead, he calmed down and ran them through drills on 
gymnastics mats next to the court while waiting for the Chinese to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 And although only the pool is not ready for use, some of the other venues are 
in various stages of refurbishment. Sprinter Carl Lewis said he visited almost 
every bathroom Thursday at the site for track and field, Petrovsky Stadium, 
before finding one that was functional. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers, however, remain optimistic that the situation with the pool will 
be their low-water mark during the 17-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 The SKA swimming pool, best known as the training home of former Soviet 
champion Vladimir Salnikov, was built 30 years ago and had become unsuitable 
for international competition before organizers approved a major reconstruction 
project last year. Confident that they had produced one of Europe's fastest 
pools, they refilled it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed that the water was not as clear as expected, they tried to speed 
up the process by having charcoal specially treated for pool filtration 
imported from Sweden. But a worker misunderstood the instructions and released 
the briquettes into the water, turning it black. 
</P>
<P>
 The filter has been working overtime since Thursday, but officials still could 
not see lane markers on the bottom of the pool Friday afternoon. Organizers 
expect the water to be blue, or at least a lighter shade of green, by this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please do not exaggerate the problem," Mutko said when he, taking Kelly's 
lead, finally addressed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, no one except the organizers seemed too put out by the schedule 
change. ABC, which is televising the games over three weekends, planned to 
feature swimming today, but a spokesman for the network, Mark Mandel, said it 
would be easy to redirect the cameras toward boxing and beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. swimmers, they seemed pleased to have another day to prepare. 
They did not arrive from the United States until Wednesday and, still battling 
jet lag, had to spend more than three hours on a bus Thursday en route to and 
from an alternative pool at a naval base outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe that pool was still open," said U.S. assistant coach Bud 
McAllister of Irvine. "If it were in the United States, it would be condemned. 
A lot of people thought the Russians were playing games with us. Then, we saw 
the Russians training there too." 
</P>
<P>
 They located a more modern -- and more convenient -- practice pool Friday.

BROADCASTER JIM HEALY DEAD AT 70; RADIO: HIS NIGHTLY HALF-HOUR SHOW, COMPLETE 
WITH CATCH PHRASES, WAS A LOCAL STAPLE FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Healy, longtime Los Angeles broadcast personality, died Friday morning of 
complications of liver cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Healy had lost weight in the last year, he had told only his closest 
friends of his illness, which was diagnosed about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hospitalized last Sunday at Cedars Sinai and died there. According to 
family members, his illness had not taken a turn for the worse until about a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy's last live show, after 43 years on the Los Angeles airwaves, was heard 
on April 29. His station, KMPC, under new ownership, dropped its all-sports 
format that week. At the time, Healy said he was working on other broadcast 
possibilities. In recent months, however, he spent most of his time with Pat, 
his wife of 45 years, at their second home in Coeur d'Alene, Ida.  
</P>
<P>
 After his last show at KMPC, he assumed a low profile, and despite frequent 
inquiries about his broadcast career from listeners and reporters, he generally 
avoided contact with the public. He left a voice-mail message a couple of weeks 
after he went off the air, saying only that he had probably done his last show. 
After that, no phone calls were returned. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by Pat, and his son, Patrick, a reporter for KNBC-TV, Channel 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy created a new lexicon for his listeners. His show was as unique as it 
was entertaining, and he produced it like nothing ever seen or done before in 
radio.  
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he had compiled more than 500 tapes, all filed and easily 
accessible. He would use as many as 50 on a half-hour show. And Healy did 
everything himself. He had no researchers, producers, engineers, writers or 
even a secretary. When he was on the air, he ran the show himself, right down 
to punching the buttons that triggered the tapes.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more popular Healy-isms, some from actual tapes of sports 
personalities, included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Who goofed? I've got to know." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "He's gone the Leonard Tose route." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Bad, team, man. Bad . . . team." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I don't give a . . . about the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Goldberg would love to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Jim Raveling, George Raveling." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The USC brain surgeons." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all Healy's frequently used tapes, perhaps the most memorable was from May 
14, 1978, the day the Dodgers and Chicago Cubs played a 15-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hot Sunday afternoon and the game went 5 hours 2 minutes. The Cubs 
won, 10-7, as Dave Kingman hit three home runs and drove in eight runs. His 
three-run homer in the 15th was the game winner. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Paul Olden, then a young news assistant for radio station 
KLAC, set his tape recorder on Manager Tom Lasorda's desk and asked: "What's 
your opinion of Kingman's performance?" The next day, an edited version of the 
1-minute 35-second response was played on Healy's show, which was then on KLAC: 
</P>
<P>
 "What the . . . do you think is my opinion of his performance. I thought it 
was . . . horse . . . ." And Lasorda was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, that was mild compared to other Lasorda tirades that found their way 
onto Healy's shows over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1982, Dodger pitcher Tom Niedenfuer was fined for beaning Joe 
Lefebvre of the San Diego Padres. The next day, Kurt Bevacqua, Lefebvre's 
teammate, was quoted in the papers as saying, "The guy they should have fined 
was the guy who ordered Niedenfuer to throw at Joe, that fat little Italian." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters asked Lasorda about Bevacqua's comment. The edited response: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never, ever, told a pitcher to throw at anybody, nor will I ever. But 
I especially would never have a pitcher throw at a . . . .130 hitter like 
Lefebvre, or a guy like Bevacqua. Bevacqua couldn't hit water if he fell out of 
a . . . boat. I'll guarantee you one thing. When I was pitching, if . . . guys 
like Lefebvre and Bevacqua were in the lineup, I'd send a limousine to make 
sure they made it to the park." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lasorda response that required the most bleeps was uttered in 1987, when 
former Times writer Sam McManis asked why Mike Scioscia had been sent home from 
third on a hard-hit ball to first. Lasorda was the acting third-base coach at 
the time. By sending Scioscia, who didn't have a chance of scoring, Lasorda 
reasoned that he had prevented an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, which the Dodgers won, McManis, somewhat facetiously, asked, 
"Are you going to fire the third-base coach for sending Scioscia?" Lasorda's 
reply to McManis, in which he told the writer several times to "learn the . . . 
game," lasted 1 minute 40 seconds. The tape included 27 bleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lasorda was hardly Healy's only target. And it was fairly well understood 
by all that Healy, for the most part, was simply striving to entertain. 
</P>

 Dan Dierdorf, a.k.a. Dan "Dierdork," or simply "the Dorkster," was in Los 
Angeles recently and inquired about Healy. Told that Healy was not well, 
Dierdorf said, "You know, he's beaten me up pretty good, but I'm sorry to hear 
that. I really am. I understand radio, because I've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Healy ended his long broadcasting career where he started it -- at 
KMPC -- he took some side trips along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Spokane, Wash., Healy moved to Beverly Hills with his family when 
he was 6. He attended Beverly Hills High and UCLA. At UCLA, he was the sports 
editor of the Daily Bruin. The newspaper's editor was Pat Campbell. They 
married in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy's first job after college was as assistant sports editor of the old 
Hollywood Citizen-News. He also did some spotting work on Ram broadcasts for 
KMPC. The play-by-play announcer, the late Bob Kelley, ended up hiring Healy in 
1951 as his writer, for $75 a week. It wasn't long before Kelley had Healy 
occasionally filling in on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy worked for Kelly and KMPC for 10 years, until 1961, when he left for 
KLAC, where he replaced Sam Balter. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy began working two jobs in 1962, also doing the nightly sports for 
Channel 7. He was fired by KLAC in 1965 because station management, as is often 
the case in broadcasting, wanted a change. Healy was replaced by Chuck 
Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, while still at Channel 7, Healy, for nine months, did a sports talk 
show for radio station KABC. Leo Durocher and Jimmy Piersall had preceded him. 
Healy quit the KABC job, even though it paid more than $800 a week. "I couldn't 
stand the idiots who call those kind of shows," Healy often said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Healy was replaced at Channel 7 by Stu Nahan, who later went to 
Channel 4 before eventually landing at Channel 5. Healy went back to KLAC, then 
returned to KMPC in 1985, where he continued to be a 5:30 listening habit for 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 The family will hold private services Monday at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood 
Hills. Those wishing to make donations in Healy's name are asked to do so to 
the charities of their choice.

CLIPPERS MUST PAY THE PRICE OF LOSING WILKINS TO CELTICS; BASKETBALL: ALL-STAR 
FORWARD'S SHORT TENURE IN L.A. ENDS WITH A THREE-YEAR, $11-MILLION DEAL FROM 
BOSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, the Clippers' leading scorer last season, 
signed an $11-million, three-year contract as a free agent with the Boston 
Celtics on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kauffman, Wilkins' agent, said he tried to reach the Clippers to inform 
them that they were on the verge of losing Wilkins without getting 
compensation, but the Clippers didn't return his call. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do?" Kauffman said. "It's laughable. It's a shame, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never made an offer over $8 million, guaranteed. I gave them another 
chance to do so just out of courtesy, but it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, had originally 
sought a $21-million, three-year deal from the Clippers, who balked because of 
his age, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 After being turned down by Wilkins on an $8-million, two-year contract, the 
Clippers came back with a $7.5-million, three-year deal with an $800,000 yearly 
bonus if the club made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 After being contacted by 11 teams, Wilkins narrowed it to four, among them the 
Lakers, before signing with Boston, which is rebuilding after missing the 
playoffs for the first time since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Wilkins told the Associated Press from Chicago, where he is 
practicing with the team that will represent the United States at the World 
Championships in Toronto next month. "Just the tradition alone there gets you 
ready to play. I always loved playing in the Boston Garden and now I'll be 
playing there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who acquired forward Malik Sealy of the Indiana Pacers and 
rookie forwards Lamond Murray of California and Eric Piatkowski of Nebraska to 
replace Wilkins, had already decided that Wilkins was expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said all along that we will do what we think is in our best 
interests," Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said. "Our offers to Dominique were 
proportionate to those interests. We wish him the very best." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who recently met with free-agent forward Horace Grant of the 
Chicago Bulls, can sign a free agent with Wilkins' 1993-94 salary slot of $3.5 
million available under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who was acquired from the Atlanta Hawks along with a first-round pick 
in the 1994 draft for disgruntled forward Danny Manning last February, averaged 
29.1 points, seven rebounds and 2.2 assists in 25 games with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great year despite the senseless trade," Wilkins said. "I'm feeling 
as good as I've felt in my career and now I think I'll end my career with the 
Celtics." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins is the NBA's leading active scorer with the recent retirement of Moses 
Malone. Last season, he became the ninth player in NBA history to score more 
than 24,000 points. He has scored 24,019 in his 12-year career, an average of 
26.5 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, the leading scorer in Hawk history, helped the Hawks get off to their 
best start last season. He was stunned by the trade to the Clippers and accused 
the Hawks of mishandling the trade because the deal was announced before he was 
informed by team management. 
</P>
<P>
 He was diplomatic after joining the Clippers, saying he felt he would end his 
career in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers won five of their first eight games after Wilkins joined the 
team. But they lost 17 of their final 21 games after contract negotiations with 
Wilkins broke down. 
</P>

CARAY IS BACK IN THE BOOTH; BASEBALL: CUBS' BROADCASTER MAKES HIS RETURN TO 
WRIGLEY, BUT SAYS HE WON'T GO ON THE ROAD FOR A WHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Caray returned to Wrigley Field on Friday, his first appearance in the 
broadcast booth in nearly a month, saying he feels good but will not make a 
road trip until September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been lying on my back, not able to do anything or say anything," said 
Caray, 74, who was hospitalized after falling June 23 in Miami when he was 
overcome by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Caray, who doctors found had an irregular heartbeat, was the center of 
attention before the Cubs' 7-6 victory over Cincinnati on Friday, greeted by 
cheering fans as his limousine pulled up outside Wrigley Field. He has not 
attended a home game since June 12, the day before Ryne Sandberg surprised 
baseball by announcing his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg also was back at Wrigley Field on Friday to take part in ceremonies 
for the "Walk of Fame," a collection of plaques on the sidewalk outside the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good, I'm happy and having fun," Sandberg said. "I'm doing a lot of 
things that I've wanted to do in the summer with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Caray went right back to work, taping his pre-game radio show with Tom 
Trebelhorn, and the Chicago Cubs manager signed off saying, "Harry, 
everything's in place. I'm ready, you're ready -- let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 Caray said he's received cards and letters from around the country, although 
not as many as when he had a stroke in 1987. His fans knew he would be back 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might be my chance to thank everyone for the Mass and cards and letters 
and all the prayers," he said. "I can't acknowledge everyone individually. I 
just want everyone to know how much I appreciate their gestures." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs announced they will celebrate "Harry Caray Day" on Aug. 27 before 
their game with the New York Mets. Caray began his major league broadcasting 
career in 1945 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He joined the Cubs in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy the people still like me," he said. "Let me tell you one thing, 
I love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have ordered Caray to restrict his travel, but he was expected to make 
the Sept. 2-4 trip to Philadelphia, and the Sept. 16-21 trip to San Diego and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He also must curtail his alcohol consumption, which means no more cold beers, 
unless they're the non-alcoholic kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reduced to drinking O'Doul's," Caray said. "Can you imagine Harry Caray 
unable to drink a martini? Without a cold Budweiser? It's not me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to imagine Wrigley Field and the Cubs without Caray, who is 
celebrating his 50th year of broadcasting.

BETTIS' NUMBER IS UP FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: WITH EVERETT GONE, THE SECOND-YEAR 
RUNNING BACK BECOMES KEY PART OF NEW OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, the woman standing behind the ropes watching the Rams at play was 
wearing a white, blue and gold jersey with No. 11 emblazoned front and back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the closet," said Heather Hansen, still a Ram fan, but wearing No. 36 
Friday for the opening of training camp at UC Irvine. "Jerome Bettis: He's the 
man now." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Everett has gone to New Orleans, leaving behind Bettis as the 
main hope for a team looking to finish with more victories than losses for the 
first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get my own ride from the airport when I got here, so it's not to the 
point where Coach (Chuck) Knox is picking me up yet," Bettis said. "But let's 
see what happens after this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis started his rookie season slowly, played despite a separated shoulder 
that he kept secret from reporters until Friday and gained 1,429 yards in 294 
carries, finishing as runner-up to Dallas' Emmitt Smith for the NFL rushing 
title. Smith gained 1,486 yards in 283 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, the consensus NFL rookie of the year, has already been featured on 80 
playing collectors' cards, a record of sorts according to the team's public 
relations staff, and will soon will be seen on a shoe commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch it," Bettis said, smiling. "At the end -- listen to me, you're going to 
love this -- at the end I ask, 'You're showing this commercial in Dallas, 
right?' 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is 2,000 yards this year, and if Emmitt is setting his goal anything 
short of that, then he's going to be a little short when it comes time for 
someone to win the rushing title. If someone can get 2,100 yards, they are 
going to lead the league, but if they don't get 2,000, they are going to be 
behind me, I'll tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can average 20 to 22 carries a game, I think I can easily do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not give the ball to Bettis on every play? 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was the case I don't think they would have spent the money they did 
to get quarterback Chris Miller," Bettis said. "We can't be a one-dimensional 
football team. We showed that last year and got beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense, which once belonged to passing expert Ernie Zampese, will now 
be guided by former running back coach Chick Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the NFL knows Jerome Bettis is going to get the ball," Harris 
said. "What we have to do is implement a passing game and find other personnel 
to complement him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' attack will have Miller handing the ball to Bettis or faking the 
handoff to Bettis and throwing high-percentage passes to tight ends or running 
backs. On occasion, Miller will look long to Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the offense that San Francisco and Dallas run," Miller said. "It's a 
high-completion offense. If linebackers are dropping back, boom, then just get 
on your backs and let them run. That's what Moose (Daryl Johnston) and Emmitt 
Smith and Marc Logan and Tom Rathman did . . . they just killed people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an offense with a lot of play action and when you have a back like 
Jerome, it's going to hold a lot of linemen and linebackers and result in more 
zone coverages downfield." 
</P>
<P>
 The team worked on the new attack the last two weeks in voluntary workouts at 
Rams Park, but there was one obvious no-show: Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little miscommunication there," Bettis said. "I had arranged my 
training schedule around that time with my personal trainer in Denver, and I 
knew (the voluntary drills) were not going to get me in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "My focus was on training camp, and I worked out twice a day for the past 
three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis was angry after being chastised by coaches for reporting to an April 
mini-camp at 250 pounds. On his first day of training camp he weighed 239. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't overweight . . . that's my natural weight," Bettis said. "I've been 
a fullback all my life and they asked me to be a tailback last year and I lost 
the weight to play there. I came in at the same weight I came in last year for 
mini-camp, and now I'm overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me a little bit upset with the coaches' perception that I was going 
to eat my way out of a job and become a Craig Heyward. I'm a player and I know 
my responsibility and I'm not going to come here at 248. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an intricate part of this team and I wouldn't do that to the team. I 
wasn't overweight, I was getting to the weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis was everything the Ram coaches have been counting on in his first 
workouts -- quick, sharp and full of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny and scary to be considered the (main threat)," Bettis said. "It's 
funny, because for me it's not a problem. But it's scary because you know when 
that gun goes off, you have to be ready. You can't say, 'I'm not having a great 
day.' There's none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see people wearing my jersey number . . . that pushes me. When I was a 
rookie I was thinking they should be wearing my jersey. Now that they are, I 
have to give them a reason to wear it. There's always something there to make 
you take it to a different level. Now I just have to keep people from putting 
my number on the shelf."

BRAZILIANS NOT HOME FREE AFTER ALL; SOCCER: GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT VICTORIOUS 
WORLD CUP TEAM MUST PAY TAXES ON EXCESS LUGGAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's government, bowing to a storm of protest and reversing an earlier 
decision, ordered Friday that 17 tons of luggage brought home by the Brazilian 
World Cup soccer team be inspected and taxed by customs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economy Ministry said in a statement it was opening an investigation into 
the incident late Tuesday in which players and team officials refused to allow 
their luggage to be inspected by Rio de Janeiro customs officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if this meant the 17 tons of boxes and crates -- including 
refrigerators, televisions, videos, washing machines and microwave ovens -- 
that returned with the soccer team would now be subject to customs duties, a 
ministry spokeswoman said: "Yes, they will." 
</P>
<P>
 This move effectively reversed an initial dispensation granted by President 
Itamar Franco late Tuesday. The president ordered the baggage to be released 
uninspected to prevent a threatened boycott of a victory parade in Rio de 
Janeiro by the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup baggage controversy became an embarrassment to Franco's 
government Thursday when Brazil's top tax official, Federal Revenue Secretary 
Osiris Lopes, resigned. Lopes said he believed the law should be equal for 
everyone, even soccer heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident provoked a storm of criticism against the government and the 
Brazilian Soccer Confederation (CBF), whose leaders had blocked customs 
officials from checking the luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all losers in this sorry episode," O Globo newspaper said in an 
editorial. A commentary in Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said federal tax chief 
Lopes' resignation "was a moral slap in the face for President Itamar Franco." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over the luggage threatened to sour the national mood of euphoria 
that had gripped Brazil since the team beat Italy last Sunday on penalty kicks, 
3-2. Leading political figures also chastised the government for its handling 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the team are four-times world champions, if they bring fridges back 
as contraband booty then they have to pay the tax," Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials in Rio de Janeiro said the amount of duties due on the 
excess luggage brought back by the squad, which left the country with only two 
tons, could total $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian customs laws require the payment of duties on any purchases made 
abroad over the value of $500 per person.

CLIPPER COACH SEARCH GOES ON; BASKETBALL: FORMER LAKER PFUND HAS BEEN 
INTERVIEWED, BUT SPOKESMAN SAYS: "THERE IS NO LEADING CANDIDATE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clippers, who have been without a head coach for 66 days since firing Bob 
Weiss on May 16, have talked to former Laker Coach Randy Pfund and former 
Minnesota Timberwolves Coach Bill Musselman, and veteran coach Bill Fitch 
expects that he'll be interviewed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no leading candidate," Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said. "And if 
there was, I think it would be inappropriate to designate somebody as that. 
It's premature to call anyone a leading candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund, who was replaced by Magic Johnson in March, was interviewed by Clipper 
General Manager Elgin Baylor on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund didn't return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant to Pat Riley and Mike Dunleavy for seven seasons, Pfund succeeded 
Dunleavy in 1992 and led the Lakers to a 39-43 regular-season record. There was 
speculation that he would be fired at the end of his first season, but he saved 
his job after the Lakers nearly upset the Phoenix Suns in the first round of 
the playoffs, losing in overtime in the fifth game of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund was replaced by Johnson after compiling a record of 66-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Musselman said he spoke with Baylor about the job last month at the NBA 
predraft camp in Chicago but hasn't been asked to come to Los Angeles for an 
interview. He was interviewed by the Clippers last year before they hired 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know at this point what they're doing," Musselman said. "I wish I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Musselman, who coached the Minnesota Timberwolves during their first two 
seasons in the NBA, has coached in the Continental Basketball Assn. for the 
last three seasons after being fired by Minnesota, where he compiled a 51-113 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers haven't interviewed Fitch, and a team source indicated that he's 
not a legitimate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked to anybody from the Clippers," Fitch said. "I've had people 
tell me that I was going to be contacted, but I haven't talked to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who has coached in Cleveland, Boston, Houston and New Jersey, said he 
would be interested in coaching the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always interested in a challenge. . . . That's how I've made my living 
(rebuilding teams)," Fitch said. "It's hard work. You've got to have a plan and 
you've got to follow it. If they do that, nothing's impossible. I've seen too 
many teams rise from the ashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who led the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA title and guided the Houston 
Rockets to the 1986 finals, hasn't coached for the last two years after being 
fired by the New Jersey Nets. He's the fifth-winningest coach in NBA history 
with a record of 845-877 over 21 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 " I've had other (teams) talk to me and up until now I said I wasn't going 
back," Fitch said. "But I'm done playing golf. You can only do that so long." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers denied that they have contacted Georgetown Coach John Thompson.

WRESTLING PROMOTER MCMAHON ACQUITTED OF STEROID CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promoter Vince McMahon, who transformed wrestling into a multimillion-dollar 
industry during the 1980s, was cleared Friday of charges that he fueled the 
sport's growth through a widespread steroid conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury acquitted McMahon of conspiring to distribute steroids among 
his heavyweight charges in the World Wrestling Federation.The panel deliberated 
16 hours over two days before reaching its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated. Just like in wrestling, in the end the good guys always win," 
said McMahon, 48, of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's family and friends joined wrestling fans in wild applause as the 
verdict was announced in a crowded courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the verdict, the trial did damage the reputations of both McMahon and 
one of the prosecution's key witnesses -- Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan, appearing smaller than when he ruled the WWF at 302 pounds, took the 
stand July 14 before a courtroom packed with wrestling fans and autograph 
hounds. The blond wrestler admitted that he had injected and popped steroids 
for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan said McMahon never encouraged him to take steroids, although he 
acknowledged that they shared the drug during the 1980s.

 The Philadelphia Eagles released defensive end Tim Harris to free enough money 
sign defensive end Greg Townsend and stay under the salary cap. Harris, who 
signed a three-year, $5.4-million contract last year, was scheduled to earn a 
base salary of $1.5 million this season. Townsend, the former Raider, signed 
with the Eagles on Thursday.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams increased their offer to tackle Wayne Gandy of Auburn, their No. 1 
draft pick, to $5.13 million for five years, but refused to budge on the length 
of the deal, thereby earning Gandy's disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, if Gandy signs a 
five-year deal, the team will maintain his rights for a sixth season.Gandy has 
demanded a four-year deal that would leave him an unrestricted free agent at 
the expiration of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Bernard Williams, who was selected ahead of Gandy by Philadelphia, 
signed a five-year deal for $5.7 million. The Rams offered Gandy a similar deal 
and then added an additional $60,000 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they did a five-year deal that set him free after five years we'd do it 
right now," said Neil Schwartz, Gandy's agent. "We'd go back to the numbers the 
Rams proposed earlier. I told them not to come up in money. It's not the money, 
it's the length of the contract." T.J. SIMERS

SWIMMING; EVANS SETS A MEET RECORD IN WINNING THE 400 FREESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was not much question who the featured performer was in the Janet Evans 
Invitational at USC on Friday when Evans set a meet record in the 400-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, a four-time Olympic gold medal winner, is the world record-holder in 
the 400, 800 and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time in the 400 on Friday, 4:12.25, shaved .01 off the meet record, which 
she set last year. It was nowhere near her world-record time of 4:03.85, which 
she set in 1988, and slightly slower than the goal of 4:11 which she had set 
for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Evans swam far in front of the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good for me because I learn how to pace myself and swim against the 
clock," said Evans, 22, who trains with USC coach Mark Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans won a timed final of the 800 on Thursday in 8:35.32 but said she felt 
sore during the event. Evans said she felt better during the 400 on Friday and 
will compete in the 200 freestyle today and in the 100 backstroke on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Thompson of Stanford won the 100 freestyle in 57.39 in her first 
competition since suffering a broken hand in May on a water slide in Palo Alto. 
In 1992, Thompson set the world record in the 100 meters, 54.48. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the competitors are using the invitational to gear up for the U.S. 
national championships Aug. 14-19 at Indianapolis, where they will compete to 
represent the nation at the World Championships in Rome in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet continues today with preliminaries beginning at 9 a.m. and finals 
beginning at 5 p.m.

PREP FOOTBALL; SHRINE GAME MOVES AGAIN, TO GLENDORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Shrine North-South all-star high school football game is on the move once 
again, having switched sites for the third time in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43rd Shrine game will be played tonight at 7 at Citrus College in 
Glendora.It was played at Long Beach Veterans Stadium the last two years and at 
the Rose Bowl before that. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, a benefit for the Shriners' Hospital for crippled children, matches 
32 graduated seniors from Northern California and 32 from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it has come down to money, and we've tried to find the most 
economic place possible," Dan Smith, the game's director, said of the move. 
"We're saving almost $10,000 by moving to Citrus College." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 64 players in tonight's game, 47 have received scholarships to Division 
I colleges. Eight players are headed to USC, six to Arizona State and four each 
to California and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The South is coached by Tom Hoak of Rialto Eisenhower, whose team won the 
Southern Section Division I championship last season. Jim Erickson of Pinole 
Valley is the North coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The South roster includes such standouts as kicker Adam Abrams of La Jolla 
Bishop's, running backs Rodney Sermons of La Puente Bishop Amat and George 
Keiaho of Ventura Buena, quarterback Steve Campbell of Norco and defensive 
lineman Brandon Whiting of Long Beach Poly.

ALL'S RIGHT IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHEN SARATOGA OPENS ITS SEASON; HORSE RACING: 
IT'S BECOME A RITE OF SUMMER PASSAGE. EVEN AN OVERNIGHT RAIN AND A SLOPPY TRACK 
CAN'T DAMPEN SPIRITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They came. They bet. And, as usual, most of them lost. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Saratoga Race Course was open again Friday, for the 126th time. 
Julie was back and all seemed right with the world -- even if those pocketbooks 
and wallets were a little bit lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, it seems, can dampen the spirits of racegoers when the New York 
Racing Assn. packs its 1 million pounds of equipment and moves it north to the 
rolling foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. Not even raging thunderstorms, 
which soaked the track overnight and left a thin layer of water over the sloppy 
surface when the horses lined up for the first race. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even that dreaded 3-H weather -- it was hazy, hot and oh-so-humid Friday, 
with temperatures approaching 90. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there was 81-year-old Marie Evans of nearby Fort Ann, N.Y., with her 
trusty lawn chair at her side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left an air-conditioned house to come out here," Evans said from her 
customary spot at the head of the line on Union Ave. "We've got to live while 
we can live." 
</P>
<P>
 NYRA printed 25,000 programs for the earliest opening day in track history -- 
the meet was expanded four days this year -- and Arthur DeStefano of Brooklyn 
had one of them. He was resting easily in his wheelchair under the shade of the 
maple trees in the picnic area, enjoying his 14th consecutive Saratoga season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing the horses since I was 13," said DeStefano, who suffers 
from polio. "I came here 30 years ago and I liked it. I used to go to Jersey, 
now I come up here. I want to put the money in New York. I can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 After a quarter of a century in the shadows, track guard August Silipo finally 
got his moment in the spotlight. He grabbed his whistle at 11 a.m. and sounded 
it. The eight gates on the Union Ave. side swung open and patrons scrambled 
through, hell-bent on getting the best seat in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I got to do it," said Silipo, 77 and a fixture here since 
Arts and Letters won the Travers Stakes in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 An early-morning storm kept the breakfast crowd down, but maitre d' Manny 
Alvarez was still smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did more than 400," said Alvarez, starting his 38th season at the track. 
"It would have been double that if it hadn't rained, but we did good. It was 
nice. For a day like this, it was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the field was scratched in the first race, won by Eye Catching 
with Jose Santos aboard. NYRA pegged attendance for the day at more than 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you if there are 16,000 out there or 24,000," NYRA president 
Gerard McKeon said. "But everybody's got a big smile on their face, the women 
are beautifully dressed and people on the street have smiles. I think that 
bodes well for the rest of the meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Julie Krone, who was nearly killed in a violent spill on the final day 
of the season here last August, was scheduled to ride in only one race Friday 
after 25 scratches were announced because of the wet conditions. Hundreds of 
fans cheered her in the paddock before the fifth race, where she finished third 
aboard Lil Mis Gia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a special thing to be part of," said Krone, who fell off a mount at 
Belmont Park last Saturday and bruised a knee. "I might not have a 
leading-rider kind of meet, but just being here makes you feel so good. 
Anything like that makes you feel so fulfilled and genuine. You want to thank 
every person individually because it makes you feel so special as an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they take you away on a stretcher and tell you you might never be able 
to ride again, you have to put your feelings in perspective. Just coming here 
makes me feel like the leading rider already."

CHICKY BOOM; ROTISSERIE CHICKEN IS RED-HOT IN RESTAURANT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No chicken in its right mind would cross Brookhurst Street in Fountain Valley 
to get to the other side -- not with Boston Chicken, Kenny Rogers Roasters, 
Kentucky Fried Chicken and El Pollo Loco all perched there and crowing about 
their menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden proliferation of roasted chicken restaurants at Brookhurst and 
Garfield Avenue -- a Boston Chicken, making its Southland debut, opens Monday 
-- reflects a boom nationwide as competitors race for a share in one of the 
restaurant industry's most rapidly growing segments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rotisserie chicken is probably the hottest food category in restaurants and 
supermarkets," said Steve Provost, a vice president at Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
which controls about half the $7-billion market for fried chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 The PepsiCo subsidiary has spent more than $100 million recently to introduce 
its Rotisserie Gold line at 5,000 stores nationwide. But the competition is 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters, which takes its name from the country singer, is run by 
John Y. Brown Jr., a businessman and former Kentucky governor who three decades 
ago turned Kentucky Fried Chicken into a nationwide chain. 
</P>
<P>
 And Boston Chicken, whose stock more than doubled in value on the first day of 
public trading in 1992, boasts a management team top-heavy with executives who 
helped Blockbuster climb to the top of the video rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-stakes game of chicken also has a strong California connection. 
Irvine-based El Pollo Loco holds a good part of the Southern California market. 
And Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants, which owns the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, 
plans to open as many as 300 Boston Chicken franchise restaurants in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those, a host of other eateries are also clucking about their chicken 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great healthy alternative," said Curtis Creek, marketing director 
at Polly's Tasty Foods & Pies, a Santa Fe Springs-based chain that serves 
rotisserie-style chicken. "The high heat defats the meat but keeps the juice, 
which gives you great taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Great taste and the promise of less fat are an appealing combination. 
According to the National Restaurant Assn. in Washington, per-capita U.S. 
consumption of chicken and turkey in 1990 for the first time matched that of 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers still love finger-licking-good fried chicken. But while restaurant 
orders for fried chicken grew at an annual rate of 2% from 1989 to 1993, orders 
for non-fried chicken grew at a whopping 13% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to be seen, KFC's Provost said, is "whether it's a fad or an enduring 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
 The chains don't pitch their chicken as health food. But they are responding 
to consumer demand by providing details about the nutritional makeup of their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken offers easy-to-read charts that describe the nutritional value 
of its entrees. El Pollo Loco reports that one of its meals "contains 30% less 
fat and 20% less sodium than a comparable fried-chicken meal."  
</P>
<P>
 And menu boards at Kenny Rogers Roasters note that several entrees meet the 
fat, cholesterol and sodium guidelines of an independent company that rates 
restaurant food. 
</P>
<P>
 Fad or not, roasted chicken is definitely in favor now. KFC expects first-year 
sales of Rotisserie Gold to reach $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken, which now has 340 restaurants in 23 states, hopes to have 525 
by year's end. The company, which reported $154 million in fiscal 1993 sales, 
hopes to open as many as 300 locations in Southern California through its 
franchise arrangement with the Carl's Jr. chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited because this is good, wholesome food -- food that's relatively 
easy to replicate at many locations," said Kerry Coin, general manager of 
Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants' Boston Pacific subsidiary. "And it's almost the 
reverse of Carl's (traffic flow) because we do most of our business at dinner, 
while Carl's is heaviest at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away from Boston Chicken's new restaurant is the first Orange 
County location for Kenny Rogers Roasters. The company, based in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., plans to have 165 stores open in 31 states and five foreign 
markets by the end of this year, including locations in Corona, Northridge and 
Palm Desert.  
</P>
<P>
 It is now readying stores in Santa Ana, Lakewood, Anaheim, Brea, Hemet, Simi 
Valley, Santa Barbara and Vallejo. It also agreed Friday to acquire 11 stores 
in the Southeast operated by Miami-based Clucker's Wood Roasted Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the competition is El Pollo Loco, which offers flame-broiled 
chicken and Mexican-style food at 200 locations in California, Nevada, Arizona 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to compete head to head with Boston Chicken," said Ray Perry, El 
Pollo Loco's chief operating officer. "Our objective is to continue to grow in 
Southern California through company and franchise development." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry veterans El Pollo Loco and KFC are betting that their lower prices 
will prevail over those of newcomers Boston Chicken and Kenny Rogers Roasters, 
which offer costlier meals and a wider variety of side dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Perry argues that consumers at Boston Chicken will pay more than $3 for 
"exactly the same size piece of chicken that we sell for $1.99. That's what 
makes me feel we'll be able to acompete very strongly." 
</P>
<P>
 Provost is betting that KFC will also benefit if roasted chicken proves to be 
more than a fad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boston Chicken will get Biff and Buffy Yuppie, the couple with the Mercedes 
that thinks alfalfa is a neat veggie to go with their meal," Provost said. "We 
want Joe and Jane in middle-class America. . . . And there's an awful lot more 
Joes and Janes out there." Hold the Grease

varieties. Percentage change in customers' entree orders: 06,30,06,06,06,06,11

RALPHS SETTLES NEW COUNTS OF OVERCHARGING; TO PAY OUT $38,500; SUPERMARKETS: IT 
IS CHAIN'S SECOND SUCH CASE IN TWO YEARS. DISPARITIES BETWEEN SHELF AND 
CHECKOUT PRICES WERE TARGETED. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time in two years, Ralphs Grocery Co. has pleaded no contest to 
criminal counts of overcharging customers at some of its stores and has agreed 
to pay fines and a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges involved disparities between the posted shelf price on some 
products and prices registered at the checkout counter.  
</P>
<P>
 The accusations followed inspections by the Los Angeles County Department of 
Weights and Measures at 10 supermarkets in the San Fernando Valley and central 
and West Los Angeles. City Atty. Jim Hahn filed the case in April, charging 
Ralphs and the managers of the 10 stores with 17 counts of false advertising 
and seven counts of overcharging customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain with prosecutors entered in Van Nuys Municipal Court, the 
supermarket chain agreed to pay a fine of $5,000 and a penalty of $8,500. 
Ralphs also agreed to donate $20,000 in food to two food banks for the poor and 
$5,000 in Ralphs gift certificates to be divided among five Los Angeles 
shelters for battered women.  
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Hahn dropped all but five misdemeanor overcharging counts against 
the company. He also dismissed all charges against the 10 store managers. The 
managers could have faced fines ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 and up to six 
months in jail if they had been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The managers were charged because the violations occurred despite the fact 
that they had all taken part in a price-accuracy training program imposed on 
Ralphs in the 1992 settlement, said Richard Schmidt, a deputy city attorney in 
the Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs paid $3,500 in fines to settle the 1992 case. The fine, penalty and 
donations for the 1994 violations amount to $38,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to a settlement because this is a significant amount of money and a 
significant disposition," Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs -- Southern California's third-largest grocery chain -- said four of 
the charges involved shelf label pricing that did not match the actual prices. 
However, the label prices on those items also had expiration dates, and those 
dates were printed on the shelves, said Jan Charles Gray, senior vice president 
at Ralphs. Gray said the fifth charge involved a product that carried an 
inaccurate bar -- a manufacturer's error. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the settlement, which reflects a lower cost than 
litigating the case -- which we were prepared to do," Gray said. "Ralphs has 
been in business in this community for 121 years, and we have one of the 
highest levels of pricing accuracy in the industry."

 Greenspan Says Dollar a Priority: The Federal Reserve Board chairman told 
Congress that the central bank and the Clinton Administration are working 
closely to protect the dollar in the face of battering from world currency 
traders. Alan Greenspan went out of his way to emphasize that the Fed and the 
Administration are in total agreement that the United States would benefit from 
a stronger dollar. He did not say specifically what the Fed will do to defend 
the greenback, but, as he did in congressional testimony Wednesday, Greenspan 
said the dollar's plunge is especially worrisome because it indicates 
inflationary worries among foreign investors.

STOCKS INCH UP ON SOLID EARNINGS REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks inched higher Friday in a quiet summer session, as the downward 
pressure of higher bond yields was offset by solid earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average opened the session higher in tandem with bond 
prices, but it turned south in midmorning as bonds and the dollar lost ground. 
The index was nearly unchanged for most of the afternoon but sprinted into 
positive territory near the end of the session. The blue chip average closed at 
3,735.04, up 2.59 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues edged out decliners by about 9 to 8 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where 261.6 million million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes posted modest gains. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.18 
to 250.24. The Nasdaq index climbed 1.13 to 716.16. 
</P>
<P>
 While some issues got a boost from good earnings reports, the overall tenor 
was cautious about a potential increase in short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional testimony Friday by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan did nothing to allay those fears. Greenspan reiterated comments he 
made Wednesday before Congress that led market officials to expect another rate 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting to listen to him talk and watch bonds fall," said Trude 
Latimer, a stock trader at Ferguson Andrews in Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. On the Frankfurt bourse, the 30-share DAX average 
finished 36.96 points higher at 2,150.26. London's financial Times 100-share 
average ended up 19.6 points at 3,114.7 after reaching a high of 3,123.3 for 
the day, while Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 67.85 points to close at 
2,300.66. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended at 20,462.89, down 160.03 points. 
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's led the action on the NYSE and fell 2 to 26 1/4 after Merrill 
Lynch downgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks were higher after USX-US Steel reported second-quarter earnings 
of 65 cents a share, much higher than the 48 cents analysts had expected. 
USX-US Steel rose 1 3/4 to 37. Inland Steel added 1 1/8 to 38 7/8 and LTV rose 
7/8 to 18 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer rose 3 to 31 after the company reported third-quarter net 
earnings of 50 cents a share, while the mean estimate was 35 cents. Microsoft 
rose 2 13/16, Quantum Corp. added 7/16 to 15 5/16 and Seagate Technology 
climbed 1 3/16 to 25 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * But IBM, which added more than 6 points Thursday, fell 1 to 61 3/8, and 
Compaq lost 1 1/2 to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kellogg fell 1 1/2 to 52 1/2 after its profit failed to beat Wall Street's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico rose 1 1/2 to 57 on strong results. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the bellwether 30-year bond ended at 7.56%, up from 7.54%, 
while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 7/32 point, or 
$2.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities ranged from 1/16 point to 3/32 point 
lower, and intermediate maturities were down 1/8 point to 7/32 point, the 
Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was described as extremely light, with participants lacking a clear 
reason to buy or sell bonds amid a dearth of fresh economic data. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also started firmer and ended higher against the German mark but 
lower against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the greenback closed at 1.598 marks, up from 1.593 on Thursday. 
It fell to 98.90 yen, down from 99.20.

L.A. CHEFS FIND CULINARY CLAIMS TOUGH TO SWALLOW; FOOD: RESTAURATEURS DISPUTE 
NEWSWEEK STORY THAT FIRE, QUAKES, ETC., HAVE SENT CALIFORNIA'S BEST DINING 
EXPERIENCES NORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Who's eating whose lunch around here? 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe a story in the July 18 Newsweek ("S.F. Eats L.A.'s Lunch"), the 
seat of California's restaurant power has moved to San Francisco, the Los 
Angeles scene is dead and our best chefs are heading north. The evidence: 
L.A.'s recent spate of restaurant closings following several disasters -- "a 
riot, earthquake, fires, recession," and a few L.A. chefs who "have decided to 
follow the money." 
</P>
<P>
 But several local restaurateurs are countering the story, and America's most 
famous chef, who has long had restaurants in both cities, says it's all so much 
rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think L.A. is getting a bad rap," says Wolfgang Puck. "Maybe business is a 
little bit harder now, but just because a place is doing less covers per night 
doesn't make the food any less good." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Keller, who once constructed towers out of tuna and sculptures from 
foie gras at L.A.'s Checkers Hotel and has recently become chef-owner of the 
historic French Laundry in the Napa Valley, admits he misses Southern 
California. "The only reason I came up here is because of the French Laundry," 
he says from his unique Yountville restaurant. "If the French Laundry had been 
in Los Angeles, I would have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 And Santa Monica restaurateur John Sedlar, whose quake-damaged Bikini will 
finally reopen next week as Abiquiu, wouldn't leave Los Angeles for anything. 
"I love the energy level here," Sedlar says. "Life in Los Angeles really 
sizzles." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlar was one of the L.A. chefs noted by Newsweek -- along with Puck and 
Citrus' Michel Richard -- who have a San Francisco presence. Sedlar told 
Newsweek: "The beauty of San Francisco is that it's very concentrated with 
hotels and businesses, so lunch is very strong. . . . At lunchtime in Los 
Angeles you need to have secretary's prices, but in San Francisco you can have 
banker's prices." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newsweek failed to note that the recently opened San Francisco-based 
branch of Sedlar's Abiquiu, named for the town near Santa Fe where the 
restaurateur grew up, was developed by the Kimpton Group. Sedlar is its 
consultant and has no stake in the Bay Area restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Newsweek nobody is leaving Los Angeles," Sedlar says. "We just find 
it's good business to have a presence up north." 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? The economy is a bit better in the Bay Area, and by now it's been 
almost five years since the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dining dollars are not as green as Newsweek makes them out to be. 
According to the California Restaurant Assn. figures quoted in the magazine, 
San Franciscans spent $1,536 per capita eating out in 1992 (the latest figures 
available), while Los Angeles diners spent only half that amount. But Newsweek 
didn't consider median income. According to 1993 U.S. Government figures, the 
median income for a family of four in L.A. is $44,600, while San Francisco's is 
$54,300. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco has a huge single, white, gay population that has money and 
goes out all the time," says Bruce Cost, who closed his formal Monsoon 
restaurant there in 1992 and now runs the lower-priced Ginger Island in 
Berkeley. "The streets of San Francisco are lined with BMWs." 
</P>
<P>
 The article also didn't point out that liquor sales were included in the per 
capita figures. "In San Francisco everybody takes taxis and drinks a lot more," 
says Bruce Marder, who owns the West Beach Cafe in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Also excluded from Newsweek was the fact that the per capita numbers were 
based on resident population only. "If you added in the number of tourists," 
says CRA's Scott Read, "it would have more of an impact on San Francisco than 
Los Angeles. It would definitely lower the San Francisco's per capita figure." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the thousands of tourists who continue to visit, San Francisco 
also does a tremendous convention business. "Whenever there's a doctors' 
convention (in town), restaurants are packed for three or four days," says 
Traci Des Jardin, who cooked at Patina in Los Angeles and is now chef at 
Rubicon -- a new, celebrity-backed French restaurant in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, the really adventurous diners are in Los Angeles. "People are 
heartier eaters in San Francisco, but they are more grounded in tradition. They 
still order sweet breads and oxtails and things like that, while L.A. diners 
are open to an eclectic style of food." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that Monsoon would have done well in Los Angeles," says Cost 
about his short-lived innovative Chinese restaurant. "We had a lot of L.A. 
people flying up here to eat whole catfish and tea-smoked duck." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller is still counting on his former home for business at his new Napa 
Valley digs. "If Los Angeles was dead, I'd be dead up here," he says. "L.A. has 
that much impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has lost some of its better restaurants due to attrition, the 
recession and other troubles, but a good many have also survived: Rex, 
Michael's, Chaya Brasserie, Chianti, Dan Tana's, Morton's and the Grill have 
all been around more than 10 years; Musso & Frank has been a Hollywood hangout 
forever. And there are now a number of unpretentious, new places where one can 
eat well at friendlier prices too: Drai's, Twin Palms, Jackson's, Vida, 
Woodside, Nouveau Cafe Blanc, Reed's and Descanso, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't consider ourselves second to anybody," Puck says. "There's no 
better French restaurant around than L'Orangerie. And our Spago and Chinois are 
as good as any. Everyone from all over the world comes here to eat. And look at 
our Japanese restaurants -- Nobo's (Matsuhisa) and Ginza Sushi-Ko are as good 
as any in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to believe in ourselves and then everybody will believe in 
us."

CULTURE HEALS THE HEARTS, MINDS IN WAR-TORN SARAJEVO; ARTS: REMNANTS OF 
HUMANISM CLING TO LIFE AND OFFER ESCAPISM TO CITIZENS IN THE BESIEGED CITY OF 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Latin strains squeaked out over a battered sound system, pelting out the 
chorus of "Espagnola," while a mirrored disco ball reflected fractured red 
light against a blackened wall. Chic couples in leather and heels pressed up 
against the stage, straining to get a better look during a moment of escapism 
that transformed the shabby theater into an oasis of exotic rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonidos Barbaros (Barbarian Sounds) can lay claim to being the only salsa band 
in Sarajevo, but not the city's only cultural diversion. Music, art, theater 
and other remnants of humanism cling to survival, fighting to remain viable 
amid two years of claustrophobic siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off from opportunities, many artists have fled for the safety promised by 
the West. But those who remain play to audiences starved for something magical 
amid reality. Those searching to escape -- if for but a moment -- include Amra 
and Sida Beganovic. The two sisters are among 200 or so Sarajevans who recently 
paid three times their average monthly salary to hear Sonidos salsa and dance 
till the 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that you can kill the physical self, but not the spiritual self," 
Sida Beganovic said, as her sister nodded effusively. "This shows people can't 
be broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists here believe their battle throughout Bosnia's war has been not only to 
dodge the shelling that killed randomly and the snipers that lurked in the 
concrete apartment blocks, but to retain the essence of Sarajevo's spirit that 
characterized the city before the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that spirit more evident than in the collection of streets housing 
a handful of arts centers that might be dubbed, humbly, the theater district. 
This area at the center of the city, loosely referred to as the Obala, is a 
dreary-looking collection of buildings pockmarked by the devastation of mortar 
shells. Among them is Kamerni Theatre-55, a smallish upstairs artistic mecca, 
performance center and cafe where the nation's leading actors -- all of them 
unknown outside of the former Yugoslavia -- gather to drink coffee, prepare 
productions and reminisce about better times. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors huddle around small round tables, while news reports from Bosnia's war 
fronts blare from the cafe's sound system. The radio seems to fade and 
conversations pause, though, when Gradimir Gojer, the theater's general manger, 
hustles in. Sitting down heavily, the heavy-set balding director feigned 
interest in a light brown Nescafe faux espresso, making the best of an 
imperfect situation. He ticked off KT-55's accomplishments: nine premiere 
concerts, eight dramatic premieres, seven art exhibitions, more than 1,100 
other performances of various sorts. The value of the theater, in his 
estimation, could be compared only to that of Sarajevo's hospitals: "They 
healed the wounds," he said, "and we healed the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching out to audiences also has become a matter of personal survival for 
many of the artists who work at KT-55, some of whom have turned down chances to 
escape because they wanted to stay to share their art with their native 
audience. Performing has become the reason to endure, say artists like Dzevad 
Sabanagic, the 49-year-old first violin and leader of the theater's string 
quartet. Sabanagic knows loss well: Half of his ensemble's original members 
died during shelling in the fall of 1992. Mortar attacks nearly took his own 
life as well. But during the moments of music, the horrors of war dropped away: 
"Every time I left home, when grenades were falling, I knew that I could die. I 
always thought when I got to the concert hall that this might be the last time 
I played. So I thought I'd play with all my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabanagic's need to express his emotions mirrored the efforts of other 
artists, some of whom risked their lives to simply display their work. Enes 
Sivac, 29, and three friends suspended a wire sculpture of a bicyclist over the 
Miljacka River. The surging current of the river below divides Sarajevo in some 
places between the Bosnian Serb army and the Muslim-led government forces, and 
people have come to see the sculpture as a symbol linking those separated by 
opposing forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were shooting all day, so (the Bosnian Serb army) probably figured no 
one would be outside," Sivac said of the day he erected the work. "But I had to 
do that more than I had to get water or food." 
</P>
<P>
 Sivac shrugged when asked about the interpretations of his work, saying he 
intended the cyclist to be a link between water and sky, not a bridge between 
opposing armies. He liked the tenuousness of the cyclist, comparing him to a 
human trying to reach his destiny, subject to any strong gusts that might 
topple him. "It's destiny," he said. "At any moment the wind can blow you over, 
and you are nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Sivac said the cyclist searches for equilibrium, but is unstable. "That," he 
said, "is what war is like." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans have responded to the courage of Sivac and others by attending any 
exhibit, any production, any movie -- en masse. There is a fever for literature 
as well, with poets like Ferida Durakovic enjoying a success she never knew 
before, despite several published volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time people want to read my poems," Durakovic said. "It was 
kind of a pleasant surprise....(But the interest) was a kind of inner 
resistance to the horrible situation we've been through. People are trying to 
prove themselves to be living and creative persons." 
</P>
<P>
 So intent were Sarajevans to read Durakovic's work, that strangers have 
stopped her on the street and begged to borrow copies of her books. 
</P>
<P>
 Durakovic and other artists realize, though, that much of the art and culture 
that has risen from Sarajevo's destruction would not necessarily be appreciated 
by outsiders, many of whom might not appreciate their defiant message without 
the backdrop of ongoing war. But the artists are loathe to criticize the 
amateurs, noting that the quality works will survive when stability and free 
market forces return after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans don't believe that real peace is possible, though the city is now 
suspended in relative calm. The state of neither lasting peace nor constant war 
continues to strain the imagination of Sarajevans, most of whom scarcely dare 
make plans for the future. Even if a peace deal were to be signed, artists like 
Gojer believe that planning and execution for the next stage will be as 
laborious as performing in the time of war. With so much of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
destroyed, the daunting prospect of reconstruction seems overshadowed only by 
the conviction that the maintenance of art in Sarajevo during its worst moments 
might provide the spiritual underpinnings on which to build the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say the (arts) are stronger. The war has been hard on the arts. 
But an actor who has passed through this Golgotha has to be a richer actor," 
Gojer said. "This will be a thing that will help us pass the hurdles of the 
future. Everything we're building from zero will be hard. We're building so 
much from nothing. Even though Bosnia had 1,000 years of tradition, the war has 
destroyed the cultural infrastructure, so that to revitalize it one can't 
expect a quick reincarnation." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there's no definite deal for peace, the more difficult it is for 
younger artists to imagine a future in their native land. Yet some, like the 
musicians and singers of Sonidos Barbaros, refuse to go, choosing to play to 
audiences that appreciate their presence rather than escaping to an outside 
world that will consider them to be but more members of a teeming mass of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, musicians like Selen Balic of Sonidos have used the war years to grow 
professionally. Never mind that they've often had to work without light or 
electricity and that one of the bedrooms in the flat where they practice was 
once blown up by a shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this war, I'm not afraid of anything except dentists," said Balic, who 
struggles on by organizing small concerts and by dreaming of one day playing 
the ultimate concert with the Gipsy Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can ruin our wish to make music," he said. "Nothing."

 Those snobby Brits kept calling this the TV show that would never be seen in 
America. Too outrageous for all those politically correct Yanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, here it comes anyway -- so there.

<P>
 True, "Absolutely Fabulous" is not exactly the kind of sitcom the U.S. 
networks are churning out these days. When was the last time a hit comedy 
centered on two 40ish women who chain-smoke and guzzle booze for breakfast? 
They even smoke dope without having to suffer horrible consequences -- that is, 
other than looking a bit pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 And the British Broadcasting Corp., which is currently filming its third 
season of the program, did have one heck of a time finding an American TV 
company willing to air it -- even though it won an International Emmy last 
year, along with bushels of other awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the programmers at the Comedy Central cable network ultimately decided it 
was their kind of show and will begin airing it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we saw it, we knew it was absolutely right for us," says Mitch 
Semel, senior vice president of programming at the cable channel. "For us, it's 
dead on target." 
</P>
<P>
 "AbFab," as its legion of British fans know it, centers on Edina and Patsy 
(Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley), a pair of trendoids in London's fashion 
world, who are desperately fighting off the aging process with an endless whirl 
of shopping, champagne and all-night clubbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Edina is a hedonistic, neurotic fashion publicist who leaps at the first hint 
of a fad, trying everything from colonic irrigation to isolation tanks to 
Buddhist chanting. She considers adopting a Romanian orphan and asks if someone 
can "send up a selection." 
</P>
<P>
 She has two ex-husbands and a teen-age daughter named Saffron who, as a key 
comedic element of the show, is far more sensible and adult than her mom. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy, Edina's best friend, is a wrinkling glamour queen who theoretically 
works as the fashion director at a women's magazine, but can't quite remember 
where her office is located. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saffron questions Edina one morning about how Patsy manages to keep her 
job, her mother tells her, "Pats has got that job for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Saffron, incredulously, "You don't mean to say she's actually good at 
something?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, darling," says Edina. "She slept with the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm bloody good at it," Patsy pipes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy then boasts about the importance of her work: "I decide what goes in the 
magazine. One snap of my fingers and I can raise hemlines so high, the world is 
your gynecologist." 
</P>
<P>
 In another scene, Edina tells her daughter how disappointed she is that the 
teen-ager hasn't had her first sexual experience yet. Says the mother, "Have 
you read that Kama Sutra I gave you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders, who plays Edina, also writes "AbFab," which developed out of a short 
sketch she wrote for a series she was doing with sometime comedy partner Dawn 
French. 
</P>
<P>
 When "AbFab" first aired, the BBC placed it on its out-of-the-mainstream 
channel, BBC2, thinking that it might build a modest cult following. But 
supported by critical raves, the show drew such high ratings that it was moved 
to the more Populist channel, BBC1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe one of the things about comedy is that if you set out to make something 
of huge mass appeal, you're less likely to make something that really catches 
fire," says Jon Plowman, who produced "AbFab" and has since been promoted to 
head of comedy at the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when they started work on "AbFab," there was concern that "an 
audience outside the square mile of Soho" -- the trendy district of London -- 
"would not know what this was about." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, that did not turn out to be a problem, as it is now one of the 
highest-rated shows in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But for American viewers, there is the added consideration that references to 
certain people and places will make no sense. Not to worry. There are enough 
jokes to keep everyone entertained. Meanwhile, here's a tip: The frequent 
mention of Harvey Nichs is a reference to the posh Knightsbridge clothing store 
Harvey Nichols, a shop that looms large in the lives of Edina and Pats. 
</P>
<P>
 Semel, of Comedy Central, doesn't think his channel's viewers will be bothered 
by foreign references and accents and says every episode will run uncut. The 
cable network will run the first two seasons of "AbFab" (12 episodes in all) 
and has made a deal for rights to the third, which will air in Britain later 
this year. Some of those shows were shot in New York recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the word in Britain was that no U.S. channel would ever run "AbFab," 
producer Plowman says he felt they would eventually find an outlet "because 
it's been so successful and there are so many channels in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same, however, he said he was "not hugely surprised" by the reaction 
from the big U.S. networks, where executives repeatedly told him, "We think 
it's wonderful, but we could never show it." 
</P>
<P>
 As diplomatically as he can, Plowman notes that the British have always felt 
that Americans lack a sense of irony -- a circumstance, he says, that was 
reinforced by the reaction to the show by some U.S. broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 One American programmer told Plowman that the lead characters were not very 
good "role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Plowman, "You just want to say, 'Yes, that's the point.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * All 12 episodes of "Absolutely Fabulous" will be shown back-to-back Sunday 
on Comedy Central, beginning at 3 p.m. Next week, two episodes will play Monday 
through Friday from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. Then the episodes will be aired at weekly 
intervals, with airings Saturdays at 4:30 p.m., Sundays at 11 p.m. and Mondays 
at 8:30 p.m.

BENEFIT WILL AID REFUGEES

 After a couple of quiet years, the UC Irvine students behind Project Ngoc have 
brought back their annual fund-raiser in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Ngoc was founded on the campus in 1987 to assist Southeast Asian 
refugee camps by sending money and volunteers. During the project's first 
years, annual summer benefits featured mostly student talent in campus 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But this summer the group has booked some of the top entertainers in Little 
Saigon and will mount the show in the upscale Irvine Barclay Theatre. The show, 
Sunday at 2 p.m., will feature about 15 pop singers, including Cong Thanh, 
Lynn, Phuong Hong Que and Don Ho (not to be confused with the Hawaiian Don Ho), 
doing two songs each with a house band. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the program: traditional Vietnamese music and dance, along with 
acrobatics and a short drama performed by the group Club O'Noodles. The show 
will be hosted by Viet Dzung and Minh Phuong, disc jockeys with Little Saigon 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to revive the tradition (and) we're trying to take it to another 
level," said Tuan Ho, a UCI graduate directing the event's organizing 
committee. "This time," he noted, "we have all professional singers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho estimates that the show could raise more than $10,000. All the performers 
are donating their time and all proceeds will benefit Project Ngoc, which was 
named for a Vietnamese boat person killed by Thai pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of the show, though, is to "spread awareness of the refugee 
issue," Ho said. The camps are scheduled to close in the next year, and 
remaining refugees are to be returned to their countries, which is one reason 
the organizers decided to make this year's show more ambitious than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho said only single seats remain on the theater's main level but that tickets 
to the balcony will be available at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 * A benefit for Project Ngoc takes place Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. $15 to $25; $12 for students. (714) 
854-4646.

 Arnold Answers Charges: Arnold Schwarzenegger responded to criticism Friday on 
ABC's "Good Morning America" that his latest action movie, "True Lies," is 
discriminatory against Arabs and women. Speaking with Joan Lunden, 
Schwarzenegger said any discrimination was unintentional. "This is really to be 
taken lightly," Schwarzenegger said, adding that "Hollywood does sometimes type 
. . . groups of people . . . (but) there's no disrespect on our part."

 Expensive 'Kiss': New Line Cinema, recently acquired by deep-pocketed media 
mogul Ted Turner, paid a record $4 million Thursday in a three-way bidding war 
with Columbia and Warner Bros. for the movie script "The Long Kiss Goodnight," 
penned by one of Hollywood's hottest action writers, Shane Black ("Lethal 
Weapon," "The Last Boy Scout"). The project, which is being put on the fast 
track to production, will be directed by Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger") and will 
star his actress-wife Geena Davis. The action-thriller is about a Midwest 
housewife suffering from amnesia who, after eight years, begins to recall her 
previous life as a government assassin. The huge purchase price sets a new high 
for "spec scripts" -- material sold on the open market -- surpassing the $3 
million that Carolco Pictures paid for Joe Eszterhas' "Basic Instinct" in 1990.

 Pee-wee and Pals Perform: Paul Reubens hasn't been onstage since 1991, but 
he's about to trod the boards once again. The actor, a.k.a. Pee-wee Herman, 
will appear in a staging of Stephen Temperley's "Mercy," directed by Vivian 
Matalon at the Stella Adler theater on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to an 
item reported by Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd. The production is part 
of HBO's New Writers Project, a series of 25 workshops at the Hollywood 
theater. Ten of the 25 scripts will be chosen for the first HBO Festival of New 
Writers, a showcase of one-act comedies to be presented at an as of yet 
unannounced venue this fall. Other well-known actors participating in the 
workshops include Chad Lowe and Sara Gilbert in Robert R. Kerr's "The Potato 
Creek Chair of Death" (also on Tuesday and Wednesday), and Arye Gross in Susan 
Kim's "Rapid Eye Movement" (Thursday-Friday). The 7:30 p.m. performances are 
free to the public, but seating is very limited.

the Cartier Foundation's move to new quarters in Paris designed by French 
architect Jean Nouvel on the site of the old American Center building on 
Boulevard Raspail. When she assumes her new position on Sept. 1, Beaud will 
move to the American Center's new building, which opened in June in a complex 
designed by Los Angeles-based architect Frank Gehry. Beaud will succeed Henry 
Pillsbury, who has been named director emeritus of the center.

 Allen Eyes Venetian Home: Film director-actor Woody Allen is reportedly 
thinking of buying Ca Dario, a splendid Venetian palace on the Grand Canal, 
despite the building's reputation for bringing misfortune upon its owners. The 
Italian newspaper Il Messaggero claimed this week that Allen was planning to 
tempt fate by buying the property from the family of Raul Gardini, the 
petrochemicals entrepreneur who committed suicide a year ago today after being 
caught up in Italy's corruption scandal. Vanni Ballestrazzi, a journalist and 
close friend of Gardini, said: "It's a stupendous house, one of the 10 most 
beautiful residences in the world." The marble-faced palace was built in 1487 
by Giovanni Dario, a Venetian merchant and diplomat. Allen reportedly became 
smitten with the Ca Dario during a recent visit to Venice with companion Soon 
Yi Previn. ANNE BERGMAN

KPFK DROPS TWO PROGRAMS ACCUSED OF USING HATE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public-radio station KPFK-FM (90.7) has axed two weekly programs dealing with 
African American issues that had been accused by several organizations of 
broadcasting hate speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropped from KPFK's lineup this week were "Family Tree," hosted by Jan 
Robinson Flint, and "Freedom Now," hosted by Marcus Lewis and Ken Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, the Hillel Foundation and the 
Center for the Study of Popular Culture had charged that slanderous and 
anti-Semitic attacks were made during the two programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been problems with those programs," KPFK general manager Clifford 
U. Roberts acknowledged in an interview. "I felt that they were using language 
in those programs in a way that was counter to our mission, which is to bring 
people together. (Dropping them) was not a capricious or punitive act. It was 
an action that was part of my job as manager to keep our license and keep our 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the month, the Anti-Defamation League filed a complaint with the 
Federal Communications Commission charging that "Freedom Now" had violated the 
agency's "personal attack" rule during its June 22, 1994, broadcast. That 
program accused the ADL of, among other things, founding the Ku Klux Klan and 
refusing to speak out about the denigration of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ADL maintained that KPFK had failed to follow FCC rules that require a 
station to inform a person or organization whose character, honesty or 
integrity has been attacked about what was said and to offer them an 
opportunity to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the ADL did not cite "Family Tree" in its complaint, KPFK said 
that it too had been the subject of "numerous complaints." Roberts said he had 
issued a memo last year and had spoken repeatedly to the programs' volunteer 
hosts about their use of inflammatory language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we use language can direct many emotions in people," said Roberts, 
who, like the three hosts, is African American. "I spent an awful lot of time 
trying to get (the hosts) to understand about the use of language. I couldn't 
find common ground, and I had taken all the time that I could allocate to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Flint, of "Family Tree," denied that she broadcast hate speech and 
contradicted Roberts' account, saying she had never been told what she had said 
that was offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliff (Roberts) and I have not had meetings about this programming," Flint 
said. "He's lying. There were no discussions, no written notification and no 
specific allegations. If they had a grievance with 'Family Tree,' why was there 
no verbal warning, no suspension, no due process?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and Carr could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' decision won praise from the complainants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Roberts is to be commended for making this commitment," said David 
Horowitz, president of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. "I think 
his actions are definitely a step in the right direction toward more balance 
and more fairness in public broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased and we think it's been a long time coming, but it's 
certainly welcomed," said David Lehrer, regional director of the 
Anti-Defamation League. "We hope that KPFK and Pacifica will fulfill a positive 
and constructive role in our community and not be a vehicle for the 
dissemination of hate." 
</P>
<P>
 KPFK has come under fire from the ADL in the last few years for other 
programming that the organization found inflammatory. The ADL filed a complaint 
with the FCC in February, 1992, regarding a program called "Afrikan Mental 
Liberation Weekend," charging that the show broadcast "a lengthy diatribe 
against the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 That complaint led to the cancellation of the program, hosted by Kwaku 
Person-Lynn, and to the development of several multicultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Listener-sponsored KPFK prides itself on its liberal perspective and its 
efforts to give a platform to viewpoints that traditionally have not had access 
to the mainstream media.

SISTERS MAKE LATINO CULTURE THE ORDER OF THE DAY; FESTIVAL: THE SUNDAY EVENT 
WILL FEATURE FOOD, MUSIC, A COMMEMORATION OF CESAR CHAVEZ, A PLAY AND MORE.

 El veinticuatro de julio (July 24) is not a date commonly associated with 
celebrations of Latino culture. Nonetheless, the Sisters of St. Joseph, an 
international order based in Orange, have chosen Sunday to throw a party 
featuring Latin American music and foods at their Center on South Batavia 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta Latina will be the third annual event hosted by the Roman Catholic nuns 
to celebrate the ethnic diversity of Southern California. Last summer's fete 
highlighted African American culture; the previous year focused on Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show the community at large that we live in a pluralistic 
society," said Norm Anderson, a spokesman for the order, "and that one way to 
get along with our neighbors is to learn about each other's cultures and 
backgrounds. We hope this event reminds people of the very positive things that 
people of other ethnic backgrounds have brought to Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph expects about 500 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities will range from educational to just plain entertaining. It all 
starts at noon with the planting of a grapevine in memory of Cesar Chavez, the 
late activist for migrant workers' rights. Traditional music by the group 
Rondalla del Sol will be played. A performance by the folkloric dance troupe 
Relampago del Cielo will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events will include a slide show on the ancient history of Latin 
America, compiled by docents of the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana, 
and a presentation by Amigas de la Cultura, a group formed by Garden Grove 
schoolteachers to promote understanding of Latino culture, on Dia de los 
Muertos , a day set aside to remember the dead. The presentation will feature 
costumes, toys and pastries traditionally used on the Day of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Friends/Dos Amigos," a one-act play, will be performed at 2:30 p.m. by a 
theater troupe from Los Angeles. It is the story of two young men -- one Latino 
and one Anglo -- who, despite language barriers, become friends on the 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Alturas, a band from Anaheim, will play modern pieces using homemade 
instruments, including flutes, strings and rain sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 A quinceanera Mass, the traditional "coming out" for Latinas on their 15th 
birthdays, will be celebrated in the sisters' chapel at 5 p.m. After the Mass, 
guests can sample Mexican foods catered by the Don Chucho Restaurant in Costa 
Mesa. Mariachis will play. The fiesta will end at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sisters of St. Joseph are an order of about 170 throughout the world. 
Forty live at the headquarters in Orange, where the order owns and operates St. 
Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fiesta Latina takes place Sunday from noon to 7:30 p.m. at the St. Joseph 
Center, 480 S. Batavia St., Orange. Adults $3, children $1.50 (a maximum of $10 
a family; food and drinks extra). (714) 633-8121, Ext. 110.

TV ACADEMY IS SNUBBING 'ROSEANNE'; COMMENTARY: HOW COME THE POPULAR, 
PEABODY-WINNING SERIES HAS NEVER BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY FOR BEST COMEDY 
SERIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "We're dumbfounded," says Tom Werner, co-partner of the company that produces 
ABC's "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 Werner is responding to Thursday's Emmy Award nominations, in which "Roseanne" 
was shut out again in the category of best comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 In its six seasons of huge popular success -- and despite such accolades as a 
Peabody Award, widely regarded as broadcasting's highest honor -- "Roseanne" 
has never been nominated for a best comedy series Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about an Emmy Award here -- just a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's lousy," ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert says of the 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also curious because the show's star -- who now calls herself just 
Roseanne because of her split with husband Tom Arnold -- won last year's Emmy 
as best comedy series actress and was nominated again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other performers in the series -- John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf and Sara 
Gilbert -- have also won nominations over the years. And Metcalf has received 
two Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Zilch. 
</P>
<P>
 The series that beat out "Roseanne" in Thursday's nominations are all worthy 
-- "Frasier," "The Larry Sanders Show," "Seinfeld," "Home Improvement" and "Mad 
About You." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to believe that the voters of the Academy of Television Arts & 
Sciences actually chose "Mad About You" over "Roseanne," which has earned major 
points for blending earthy comedy with social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 And if "Roseanne" is based on the controversial star's pointed comedy from her 
stand-up days, how can she be nominated and the show not? 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne," which debuted in 1988, was immediately significant as perhaps the 
first comedy series to drive home the point that the idealized family humor of 
TV, epitomized by NBC's long-dominant "Cosby Show," was taking a sharp turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" seemed to be saying: Welcome to the post-"Cosby" era and take a 
look at the down-and-dirty blue-collar class that is trying to struggle by in a 
tough world. 
</P>
<P>
 Another series, Fox's "Married . . . With Children," was apparently saying the 
same thing but far more crudely and with none of the comic vision or insight of 
"Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne ticked off plenty of people in Hollywood with her outspokenness, 
often-sensational behavior and obvious lack of concern for the phony rules and 
niceties of Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's the case, how come she has won Emmy nominations while the series 
has been ignored as an awards contender? 
</P>
<P>
 Are some academy voters still holding back their full blessing because of her 
flamboyant public behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 Does the TV industry -- which has no qualms about sinking to impossible depths 
with Amy Fisher movies and trashy newsmagazines -- think that somehow the 
blue-collar atmosphere of "Roseanne" does not project an image that is classy 
enough for the medium at awards time? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the blue-collar raucousness of "All in the Family" and "The 
Honeymooners," just to name a couple of examples? 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens I'm not a huge fan of "Roseanne," but the hypocrisy of academy 
voters toward the show is blatant and more than a little unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's the best show on television," says Werner. Imagine, he says, a 
series that has been "honored with a Peabody but has never even been nominated 
for an Emmy. We think the academy doesn't like us. But we think the people do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" tied with "Seinfeld" last season as the second most popular 
entertainment series on TV, trailing only "Home Improvement" -- another show 
with blue-collar appeal but with a less flamboyant star, Tim Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbert says, "The only speculation I would offer (about the "Roseanne" snub) 
is that this is a show about what it is like to live in mid-America on a lower 
income and facing all the struggles that may be unrelatable to the fortunate 
people who work in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps people think it is hipper to be represented by a 'Seinfeld' than a 
'Roseanne' because of the upper-income, educated patina." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is moving the red-hot "Frasier" directly against "Roseanne" this fall in 
hopes of cutting down the ABC hit. And Harbert says he's "giving thought" to 
having "Home Improvement" take over the "Roseanne" slot to blunt the strategy. 
If that happens, "Roseanne" presumably would move into the "Home Improvement" 
time period. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the lack of a best-series nomination for "Roseanne" is another slap 
in the face. Says a source close to the television academy: "Clearly the 
performer branch is very enthusiastic about Roseanne the actress. The performer 
branch is approximately 15% of the entire voting membership. But somewhere 
between the enthusiasm of her peers and the overall membership of the academy, 
something happens." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's wrong.

WILL THE NAMESAKE RETURN?

 The star and namesake of ABC's hit "Roseanne" is expected to return next 
season despite reports that her split from husband Tom Arnold, who is the 
show's executive producer, may impact her involvement with the comedy. The 
actress, who recently dropped her married name, said in court papers filed in 
her divorce action that she wasn't sure she would return to the show because of 
a contractual dispute with the Carsey-Werner Co., which produces the sitcom. 
But representatives for the actress and for ABC both said Friday that those 
court documents and statements were filed early in the divorce proceedings, and 
that Roseanne is fully expected to return to the show. GREG BRAXTON

'THREE TENORS' A PBS FUND-RAISING HIT; TELEVISION: THE CONCERT HELPS RAISE 
PLEDGES OF MORE THAN $1.9 MILLION FOR SEVEN OF THE LARGEST AFFILIATES. BY 
MIDWEEK, KCET HAD THE MOST, WITH $653,300. 
</P>

<P>
 "Encore! The Three Tenors," a hit with its audience at Dodger Stadium last 
Saturday, also performed mightily backstage -- in the fund-raising rooms of 
public-television stations across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No figure was available as to how much the program with Luciano Pavarotti, 
Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras raised among PBS' 346 stations, but a survey 
of seven of the largest public-TV outlets found that more than $1.9 million has 
been pledged thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET-TV Channel 28 in Los Angeles is leading the pack with $653,300 and 6,408 
pledges. The response was so strong that KCET reprised the program again 
Thursday night, a month before the next broadcast had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Goen, KCET's vice president of public information, suggested that 
"community pride" as well as strong listener support helped account for the 
high donation numbers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at other stations were equally ecstatic. "This is definitely 
something out of the ballpark," exulted Tina Bachemin, a spokeswoman at KQED in 
San Francisco, which reported a record 4,000 pledges last weekend for $361,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's WHYY raised $174,046; Washington's WETA, $163,073; Boston's 
WGBH, $102,000, and Chicago's WTTW $47,000. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's WNET raised $414,786 over its pledge weekend, which included the 
live broadcast at 11 p.m., a rebroadcast the following night at 8 and a repeat 
airing of the first "Three Tenors" concert from March, 1990, in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Most PBS stations usually have a pledge drive in August, but stations took the 
opportunity to raise money now, perhaps because "The Three Tenors" concert is 
scheduled to be released on video and laser disc Aug. 30. KCET's Goen, however, 
denied that the video release had anything to do with the station's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a ratings hit, by PBS standards. The network said that "The Three 
Tenors" was seen by 18 million people in the United States during its various 
telecasts last weekend. The live broadcast Saturday even beat the three major 
commercial networks in San Francisco, San Diego and Phoenix, PBS said. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS President Ervin S. Duggan hailed the event as "a brilliant success that 
underscores the power of public television to bring the best to enthusiastic 
millions who love the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising and ratings did not come without a price, however. PBS 
spokesman Harry Forbes said the network had "paid more for (rights to the 
concert) than for any other program acquired specifically for fund-raising." He 
declined to say how much, as did the concert producer, Tibor Rudas.

POP BEAT: THREE DAYS OF PUNK, MOSHING AND FELLOWSHIP; POP BEAT: 'SUMMER 
NATIONALS' -- SIX BANDS FOR $6 EACH NIGHT -- IS EPITAPH RECORDS' WAY OF SAYING 
THANKS TO ITS FANS. IT'S COSTING THE LABEL $100,000, BUT MONEY ISN'T THE POINT. 
</P>

<P>
 Very soon thousands of people will gather for a festival of life-affirming 
music dedicated to fellowship and community, riding a wave of a youthful social 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not the Woodstock reunion with its "two more days of peace and 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Epitaph Records' "Summer Nationals," with three days of punk and 
moshing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out event at the 3,500-capacity Hollywood Palladium starts Wednesday. 
Among its 18 acts are the L.A. independent label's stalwarts Bad Religion, the 
Offspring, NOFX and Pennywise -- considered the cream of the crop of a rising 
tide of young California punk bands. 
</P>
<P>
 But to hear the talk of Brett Gurewitz, the owner of Epitaph and guitarist for 
Bad Religion, it's his show that sounds like the real heir to Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of a deeper cultural phenomenon that crosses boundaries from 
music to a sort of liberalism to a style of dress to a lifestyle," the lanky 
32-year-old says. 
</P>
<P>
 A mosh pit may not look like a love-in, he says, but there are some 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these kind of shows, even though there's a pantomime of violence, 
it's more of a ritualistic thing and everyone has fun," he says. "When a kid 
falls down, another one helps him up. There's a general feeling of fellowship." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a growing fellowship. Epitaph's steady growth since its founding in 
the early '80s has exploded in the last year. Bad Religion's last album, 
"Recipe for Hate," sold about 400,000 copies on the label, precipitating the 
band's signing with Atlantic Records. This year, "Smash," the latest album by 
Huntington Beach band the Offspring, has sold more than 500,000 copies and is 
currently No. 20 on the Billboard national albums chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The style of music of these bands is very fast and catchy," says Jim 
Lindberg, singer for Pennywise, which headlined its own sold-out show earlier 
this year at the 4,500-capacity Shrine Exposition Hall. "And there are a lot of 
adrenaline junkies out there, people who like surfing and skateboarding and 
like music that pumps them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to put out a positive message in our music," continues the 28-year-old 
Hermosa Beach native. "It's a movement of people sick and tired of violent 
lyrics and stuff that's all glorification of violence in our culture. We're 
into things that are positive. There's plenty of depression out there. We like 
to put out songs that reinforce autonomy and thinking for yourself. Instead of 
dragging things down, we like to boost them up." 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy is applauded by even some who have had concerns about past 
punk shows at the Palladium. Joe Shea, president of the Ivar Hill Community 
Assn., welcomes these events as vital to the cultural and economic health of 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our concerns is that the Palladium continues to be a place where 
alternative music can find a home," says Shea, who attributes past problems at 
the venue to shows being oversold and people being angered about not getting 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing's a definite contrast to Woodstock '94: the ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 The tab for two days of Woodstock comes to $135 a pop. The "Summer Nationals" 
run just $6 a ticket per night. And while Woodstock has multinational 
corporations drooling at the potential profits from the show's recording and 
television rights, the Epitaph show is actually costing the label close to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thank you to all the people who supported Epitaph over the years," 
says Gurewitz. "The groups are grateful and I'm grateful and we want to give 
something back to the fans -- six bands for $6 each night, T-shirts for $5 and 
super lights and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might say, 'Oh yeah, you're getting a lot of publicity for it,' but 
that's not what this is for. I always dreamed of doing this kind of show." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Epitaph "Summer Nationals" at the Hollywood Palladium starts Wednesday 
with a show featuring the Offspring, Down by Law, Claw Hammer, Ten Foot Pole 
and Red Aunts. Thursday's concert includes Pennywise, Rancid, Total Chaos and 
the Other. Friday's show features NOFX, RKL, SNFU, Gas Huffer and a special 
appearance by Bad Religion. All three shows are sold out. L.A. POP DATE BOOK

ACCENTS; LETTING SIMPLE IDEAS BLOSSOM IN BOUQUETS; SEEK THE BEST MATERIALS FROM 
YOUR OWN BACK YARD, AND ARRANGE THEM CASUALLY, ADVISES FLORAL DESIGNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you have great ingredients, there's no need to get fancy. That principle, 
true in cooking, also applies to flower arranging, says floral designer Tom 
Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start with materials that are perfectly beautiful, perfectly natural and 
perfectly fresh, and flower arranging is a piece of cake," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The first place to look for those "perfect" materials is your own yard or 
garden, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flower arranging doesn't have to be anything difficult or complicated," says 
Pritchard, who has co-authored a book he hopes takes the fear out and puts the 
fun into amateur flower arranging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four or five garden roses in a crystal vase by themselves is an arrangement. 
So is one flowering branch from a fruit tree. So are a bunch of sweet peas 
stuffed into an enamel pitcher. Or a single wildflower in an old-fashioned 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these hysterical floral arrangements you see are merely attempts to 
disguise mediocre materials. Just like heavy French sauces were originally 
devised to disguise the taste of poor meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard and partner Billy Jarecki are authors of "Madderlake's Trade 
Secrets" (Clarkson Potter, 1994. $40), which is based on their experience as 
co-owners of the Manhattan-based flower shop of the same name.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to coming up with great arrangements, says Pritchard, is 
florist flowers. Like supermarket produce, they are primarily bred to ship well 
and last a long time, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And their stems are always perfectly straight, and their colors perfectly 
uniform. That's why they're boring. Garden flowers have more character and 
personality and are always preferable." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians have no excuse for not using garden flowers in their arrangements 
either, concludes Pritchard, back in Manhattan after a recent book promotion 
stint in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have beautiful plants around you year-around," he says. "But you take 
them for granted because growing them is so easy. You don't realize how much 
material you have for arrangements right in your own yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Madderlake does not use florist foam or frogs in most of its arrangements. 
"When you use an oasis (foam block), you can put any flower anywhere, " says 
Pritchard, "but the results aren't as interesting as when an arrangement occurs 
more naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 So the shop begins mixed floral arrangements by wedging a branch from a tree 
or shrub into a container and allowing the crotches of that branch to provide 
the support system for the remaining flowers. (Choose a piece slightly wider 
than the vase so that pressure against its sides will hold the branch in place, 
suggests Pritchard, and one with a structure complex enough that you have 
plenty of options for flower placement.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The restrictions imposed by the branch create a certain logic," he says. "You 
put in the first flower, spin the vase around a bit, see where you need 
something else, and you just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the most dramatic flowers and work toward the more ephemeral ones, 
Pritchard advises. Select the flowers that you want to spill over the edge of 
the container early in the game, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding flowers that will create a beautiful bottom edge is more difficult 
than finding flowers that will carry the top," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of California's workhouse landscaping plants, the common garden geranium, 
is one of Pritchard's favorites for beginning arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lipstick colors of the flowers -- pink, vermilion, orange, coral -- are 
incredible -- and the foliage is often interesting, too. I don't understand why 
more florists don't use geraniums. We love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandevilla vine is another Southern California garden staple Pritchard likes. 
"Little bits of that amazing hot pink here and there in a mix really livens it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Other common Southern California flowers treasured by Madderlake but generally 
overlooked here as arrangement material are agapanthus, nasturtiums, 
bottlebrush and firethorn. 
</P>
<P>
 If his shop were here instead of New York City, Pritchard might even have 
trouble following his own advice: "Know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't use filler flowers, and we don't add extraneous foliage," says 
Pritchard. "Where other florists would add those things, we leave empty space. 
And the more dramatic shape the flower has, the more space we leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Start with interesting flowers, and you don't need much else, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to recommend the Madderlake approach, says Janelle Wiley, who 
teaches her own version of floral design at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact they're trying to get people to lighten up and take chances," 
says Wiley. "That's what I try to do in all my workshops, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so uptight about expressing creativity. They're afraid they're 
going to do things wrong or won't be as good as their neighbors. So anything 
that encourages people to let go of those fears, I'm all for." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley manages the various color beds at Sherman Gardens in addition to 
teaching floral design classes there. Previously, she ran a floral design 
business out of her home and before that worked for other floral designers. All 
in all, she has 14 years of experience in the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Madderlake, Wiley also prefers to make arrangements without foliage. 
"Roses look especially good that way. All fully open and cut the same length so 
all you see is rose. Nothing looks more romantic," Wiley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Branches from fruit trees are good solo performers, too, she says. "A branch 
with five or six lemons on it looks great in a big ceramic pot." Other citrus, 
apples, pomegranates or persimmons also work well. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley also often uses branches rather than frogs or foam to create the 
framework to hold together her arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have some wonderful things we could use for that purpose right in 
our own gardens -- Indian hawthorn, camellia foliage, azalea foliage, myrtle, 
all the citrus, waxy begonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't want to use a branch, an alternative mechanic (flower holding 
device) is crisscrossing four or five pieces of foliage with strong stems to 
form sort of a mesh." 
</P>
<P>
 As to the flowers themselves, Wiley suggests placing darker flowers in the 
center of the arrangement and lighter ones toward the outside. "Because they 
recede, dark flowers at the center make a bouquet seem larger," she says. She 
also likes to include at least three sizes of flowers and odd numbers of each. 
But, Wiley stresses, these are guidelines, not rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of free-style arrangement is not her sole style, however. Wiley also 
likes arrangements dense with foliage -- a style she calls "English cottage 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, she says, is to create the illusion that you've brought a patch of 
the garden indoors, background foliage, ground cover and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley likes foliage so much, in fact, she sometimes creates arrangements of it 
sans flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foliage in a variety of colors, textures and shapes can be very satisfying 
all by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She does not share Pritchard's aversion to "filler" flowers either. "I think 
they add softness and finish," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley and Pritchard are in full agreement that floral arranging should be fun, 
not fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than therapy once you relax," says Wiley.  
</P>
<P>
 "Be playful," urges Pritchard. "People like it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they both believe the best materials for arrangements are often those 
nearest at hand. "I used to use bougainvillea in bridal bouquets a lot -- 
something I didn't see anyone else do -- but everyone liked," says Wiley. "And 
there are lots of plants like that around us -- things you're so used to 
looking at you don't see anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pritchard: "Open your eyes and look around." 
</P>
<P>
 SH Tips to Pump Up Flower Power 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how Madderlake handles flowersbefore using them in arrangements:  
</P>
<P>
 * Cut flower stems at an angle to maximizethe amount of surface open to water. 
Scissors can pinch stems shut; a sharp knife is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scrape the side of the stem for about an inch above the cut to open up more 
surface for water intake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Woodier stems need to be split by making two or three cuts and crosscuts 
with a knife or pruning shears. Also scrape away the bark an inch or two up the 
stem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immerse all stems in water immediately after cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove all damaged and excess foliage, including any that will fall below 
the water level.

FURNISHINGS; BARBARA BARRY LOOKS HOMEWARD TO ALTER INTERIORS; LANDSCAPE 
INSPIRES DECORATOR TO MAKE TRANSITION FROM ARRANGING TO CREATING

 Barbara Barry's furniture designs are a natural progression -- "like stepping 
out of a boat onto a landing," she says -- of her work as an interior designer 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tables, sofas and chairs are inspired by the personality, history and 
architecture of Southern California: the lines are simple, the uses versatile, 
the sitting comfortable. She has named the pieces after the likes of San 
Marino, Catalina and Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, 40, is based in Los Angeles but has worked throughout the region (one 
of her first jobs was in Orange County, doing a home on Lido Island). Her 
interior work has included a Richard Neutra garden home and a steel and glass 
home on Balboa Peninsula designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there will be Barbara Barry furniture -- a whole line of it -- 
produced by a national firm based in North Carolina, the center of furniture 
manufacturing in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 Hickory Business Furniture had sought a pared elegance or "new tradition" for 
its contract furnishings. The firm had admired Barry's work and approached her 
about designing the collection in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract furnishings -- produced for offices, hotels and businesses -- must 
meet specific strength and safety codes not required of other types of 
furnishings. The design of the pieces has traditionally been oversized and 
blocky. The pieces Barry has designed are a marked departure, and her sofas, 
chairs and tables work equally well in the home.  
</P>
<P>
 Crisp, no-nonsense silhouettes, with meticulous attention to detail, such as 
her trademark oval-shaped covered buttons and "X" stitching, give Barry's line 
a tailored, graceful feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contract furniture has to pass strict fire codes and has always been clunky 
and masculine looking. My designs feminize it, and I think that's what appealed 
to HBF," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having her work produced for national distribution by a mainstream firm -- HBF 
is part of the Lane Corp. -- is a major break for Barry, who has worked in the 
design field about eight years. "They honor the artist in every design, and 
that was important to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the firm debuted Barry's seven chair and three table groupings, 
each named after towns and communities in Southern California. Her pieces, 
which range from around $750 for a side chair to $2,500 for a chaise lounge, 
are available through HBF at (704) 328-2064 or at its Los Angeles Pacific 
Design Center showroom, (310) 652-5344. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry seldom chooses patterned fabrics for her pieces. She'd rather see the 
furniture shapes, fresh flowers in a simple vase and even the people themselves 
create the patterns and the focus of a well-composed room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a room that ranges wide in historical references," she says. "This 
grab-bag approach can be seen throughout our culture today -- in fashion, in 
art, even table settings." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tables are characterized by the juxtaposition of straight lines and subtle 
curves. The Avalon table and console has curved legs and a pillbox top; the 
Balboa table has a solid wood top carved and fluted with tapered legs; the 
thick top of the Catalina table draws on proportions of the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her chairs and sofas are comfortable and versatile. Influenced by the lines of 
a woman's bustier, the Santa Barbara chair, fully upholstered, with solid 
cherry arms and legs, has an optional, contrasting oval button at the center of 
the chair back. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressmaking details also are the focus of the San Marino chair, which has '40s 
appeal and '90s sensibility. The chair, with a reeded front leg, has a deep 
seat and a down cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood series, inspired by the works of 1930s French designer 
Jean-Michel Frank, features a central oval button and optional "X" stitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The great ocean liners of the 1930s come to mind in the Venice chair. The 
arched back leg and angled arm give the chair surprising wit with a retro feel. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Fluting on the face of the front leg and a gently splayed back leg bring 
together Old World and contemporary styling in the Montecito chair.  
</P>
<P>
 The San Simeon series, named for Hearst Castle, is tailored yet stately, with 
delicate legs and over-scaled body. Key to the architectural look of the chair 
is a "cap" that stretches across the top length of the seat back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena series, with its elegant curves, tapered legs and thin arms, 
includes a pull-up chair, a semi-club, a full lounge and two- and three-seater 
sofas. The "drop front" upholstery on the club chair gives the look of a 
slipcover. 
</P>
<P>
 While each grouping has a distinctive look, one constant throughout is 
simplicity, something Barry strives for in everything she creates. To her, 
simplicity is the ultimate luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Less is more' is a very modern concept," Barry says. "I like just a few 
carefully chosen things on a table or a mantel. I prefer visual tranquillity, 
no clutter."

PLANTS; IVY'S ROOTS RUN DEEP IN TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 English ivy is more than just a nice, but not particularly exciting, plant 
that makes a cool green mat. Delve a bit deeper and you learn that ivy mutates 
readily, giving rise to a number of forms, the best of which are named 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an English ivy for everyone, and the American Ivy Society is 
promoting this plant while maintaining the names of more than 400 different 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy leaves come in an array of colors and forms. The variety Goldheart, for 
instance, has green leaves with yellow centers. Glacier's leaves are mottled 
gray and green, with a pink edge; and Triloba has purplish-green leaves. A 
variety such as Little Diamond has miniature leaves. The leaves of Shamrock, 
Irish Lace and Itsy Bitsy are both small and deeply incised. 
</P>
<P>
 Some varieties of ivy have flat leaves, heart-shaped (the Sweetheart) or curly 
(Dragon Claw). 
</P>
<P>
 Not all ivy plants have lanky, creeping stems. Erect stems of Arborescens, 
Conglomerata and Erecta make these varieties shrubs rather than creeping vines. 
</P>
<P>
 A plant as variable as ivy can have many uses. Most commonly, it is grown as a 
ground cover or to clamber up tree trunks, walls and arbors. Ivy is not for 
clapboard siding, though, because the stems will work their way under the 
boards and push them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy is one of the few plants commonly grown outdoors and indoors in temperate 
climates. Indoors, it can play the role of a potted foliage plant, a living 
wreath or a green accent to flowering plants. Indoors or outdoors, ivy can be 
trained to fanciful three-dimensional forms as topiary. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the oldest gardens in this country, ivy looks very much at home. 
This is not because the plant is native to America, but because it was carried 
across the ocean by colonists as a remembrance of England. (Baltica and 
Hibernica, the variety reputedly brought over by the colonists, are probably 
the most widely planted.) Its proliferation in this country is proof of the 
ease with which it is propagated and grown.  
</P>
<P>
 If you claim to lack a green thumb, try rooting ivy. Just stick some young 
stems in a glass of water, and roots will form in a couple of weeks. The only 
way to fail is by taking cuttings from adult portions of a plant. 
</P>
<P>
 After a number of years, often decades, the uppermost portions of an ivy plant 
undergo the transition to adulthood. Besides being difficult to root, adult ivy 
has flowers and only slightly lobed leaves and is shrubby rather than vining. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a plant has been propagated from adult shoots, in which case the whole 
plant is adult, the lower portions of old plants remain juvenile, so are easy 
to root. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, ivy likes a soil that is rich and moist. But the plant is 
accommodating and tolerates poor soil conditions when grown in shade.

ENVIRONMENT; IT ALL COMES OUT IN THE WASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN McGRATH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doing the laundry again? In half an hour, 35 gallons of detergent-laden water 
will have cascaded down your drain. Have you ever wondered what exactly is in 
those liquids or powders that you contribute to the great outdoors, courtesy of 
your wash water, every week? Is your laundry detergent safe for the 
environment? 
</P>
<P>
 Many modern detergents are a high-tech cocktail of chemicals. When you dump a 
cup of detergent into the water, you mobilize an efficient little army: 
Compounds that make the water wetter, disarm the calcium, disperse the dirt, 
control the alkalinity, make your clothes smell good and coat them so that they 
wash clean a little more easily next time. Some detergent formulas even make 
your clothes fluoresce a little in sunlight, so that they look, yes, whiter 
than white. 
</P>
<P>
 Most detergents are not very toxic, carrying a caution label, at most. 
However, according to Poison Control, they are responsible for more household 
poisonings than any other substance. Keep them out of the reach of small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important ingredient in any laundry detergent or soap is the 
surfactant, short for surface active agent. Surfactants reduce water's natural 
surface tension, letting it wet surfaces more effectively. They remove dirt. 
And they dissolve oil and grease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soap is a surfactant made from natural fatty acids, either from plant 
material, such as coconut oil, or from tallow, rendered animal fat. Soap has 
one major drawback: It does not work well in hard water, where it leaves a 
residue on the wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Most modern detergents use synthetic surfactants derived from petrochemicals. 
In fact, "detergent" generally refers to any surfactant other than soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Phosphates are added to detergent as "builders," so-called because they build 
up the effectiveness of the surfactant. They do this by inactivating calcium 
and other minerals that make water hard. Builders also disperse dirt and 
maintain the alkalinity of the water. Other ingredients added to detergent may 
include bleach, fabric softener, stain-eating enzymes, perfumes and colorants. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to all these ingredients after they sluice through your clothes? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major surfactants in use today biodegrade in the sewage treatment 
process. The fate of trace ingredients such as whiteners and colorants is not 
really known. 
</P>
<P>
 Phosphates are another matter. These chemicals are not removed by conventional 
sewage treatment processes. In some areas of the country, special chemicals are 
added during treatment to remove phosphates. If discharged along with treated 
water into lakes and streams, phosphates promote the growth of algae, clogging 
the water with more vegetation than it can handle. This speeds the evolution of 
lakes into swamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this serious problem, phosphates are banned in laundry detergent in 
many states and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What else is in your laundry detergent? In Seattle, the water treatment 
utility recently asked the nonprofit group Washington Toxics Coalition to take 
a look. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things the researchers looked for was toxic metals, such as 
arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury, which earlier studies had found 
in high concentrations. These metals don't biodegrade in water treatment. 
Instead, they concentrate in sewage sludge or are discharged with treated 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition didn't find tons of metals but did find a surprising 
correlation: The more phosphates a detergent contained, the more arsenic it was 
likely to contain. In fact, the coalition calculated that if everyone used 
high-phosphate detergents, that would account for 20% of all the arsenic that 
comes down the city's drain pipes -- about 200 pounds of the deadly stuff a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 (Detergent manufacturers don't add arsenic to their product. The metal is 
simply attracted to the same materials phosphates are. When phosphates are 
mined from the earth, arsenic comes along, too.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for the average launderer? Washington Toxics Coalition's 
Philip Dickey (whose office is awash in cleaning products) suggests that, if 
you're concerned about the environment, your best bet is to use as low-tech a 
phosphate-less laundry detergent as possible. Or just use laundry soap. And use 
the minimum amount called for by the manufacturer. In fact, try using a little 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquid laundry detergents are all free of phosphates. However, most people 
aren't able to recycle the big plastic jugs they come in. If you use a powder 
instead, look for one that advertises itself as phosphate-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean you are doomed to be dingy? Consumer Reports evaluated 
detergents in its July, 1987 issue and concluded that phosphates don't make a 
huge difference in how clean your clothes get. Buy some enzyme stain remover 
and spot this on your clothes as needed. And cultivate a bias for cotton 
clothes. They are easier to clean.

INSIDE & OUT: HAUTE CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a Rolls-Royce, a Rolex or court-side season tickets for the Lakers, the 
La Cornue stove is the ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
 La Cornue, a professional French stove, is meticulously crafted. Made of 
hand-polished stainless steel, nickel-plated steel and solid brass, the stove 
has no visible screws for an absolute heat seal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two ovens is always gas (for moist cooking and less shrinkage of 
meats and poultry) and the other is always electric (which provides a dry heat 
for pastries, souffles, meringues and breads). 
</P>
<P>
 La Cornue, imported by the Purcell-Murray Co. in Brisbane, Calif., is offered 
in 13 colors, including pistache , a pale shade of green. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all of this luxury has a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the nearly 250 owners -- including actors Danny Glover and Jamie 
Wyeth and comedian Robin Williams -- who have purchased one in the three years 
the stove has been available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For a mere $10,000 to $17,000, depending on the custom features you desire, 
you can add your name to the list. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to order, call (800) 892-4040. Resin Wicker 
</P>
<P>
 This furniture can weather the storm -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest casual outdoor collection by El Monte-based Brown and Jordan, South 
Bay combines classic contemporary styling with the technology of weatherproof 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Resinweave, Brown and Jordan's patented weaving process, involves extruding 
polyolefin resin with ultraviolet inhibitors into wicker or cane. The material 
is handwoven one strand at a time over the aluminum frames of the furniture for 
a wicker-like quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually maintenance-free, the furniture is lightweight, sturdy and 
rustproof, and it will not crack, fade or peel. Thus, you can leave it outside 
all the time, and it will maintain its elegance, rain or shine. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the line are dining and lounge chairs with cushions, an ottoman, a 
love seat and chaise with cushions and several table styles. Pieces range in 
price from $600 for a chair to $1,700 for a chaise and can be purchased in 
Orange County at Roger's Gardens, Anaheim Patio and La Paz. Under Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Some like it hot. Some like it cold. Some like it in between. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter your preference, when it comes to bedding, the Somma Mattress Co. is 
making it easy to do it your way. 
</P>
<P>
 The EurForma collection, a line of flotation, foam and innerspring mattresses, 
allows you to pick from a choice of zipper tops in foam, wool or down. 
</P>
<P>
 The tops can be mixed or matched for just the right comfort combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bedding innovation is comparable to serving up your own good-sleep 
sundae," said Angie Echevarria, president of Somma, which is based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The mattresses and tops range in price from about $800 to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the nearest Orange County dealer to you, call Charles Falk at (714) 
548-0437, or call (800) 227-6662 for more information.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; LIGHT RELIEF FOR A SPOT OF TROUBLE IN FLOORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: We had a one-piece floor installed in our kitchen three years ago, and 
since then large black spots have appeared on it, particularly in the high 
traffic areas. We're planning to replace the floor, but how can we prevent this 
from happening again? 
</P>
<P>
 M.O.,Mission Viejo * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's not an uncommon problem, and there are two causes for black spots, 
says Becky Gonzalez of Anaheim Centsible Tile. In some cases, it's mold that is 
appearing up from the subfloor. It's appearing in areas where you walk the most 
because those areas get pushed down into the mold. To prevent this, all mold 
has to be removed from the subfloor and a mildewcide applied. It could also be 
caused by what's called "cut back adhesive." This happens when the old cement 
that adhered to previous floors is black and is showing through the new floor. 
If the problem is traced to the old adhesive, an underlayment is generally 
applied before the new floor is installed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'd like to find out about how to dry flowers and greenery for 
arrangements. I've heard that the flowers must be soaked in water prior to 
drying; is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 E.W.O.,Irvine * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Drying flowers is fairly easy, says Vivian Moreno of Ben Franklin Crafts in 
Fountain Valley. Hang the flowers and plants you want to use upside down in a 
dry place. After they've completely dried, you can lay them in a silica gel, 
which is available at most craft supply stores. The silica will preserve them 
so they can be used in arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to paint my anodized aluminum window frames and screen frames. What 
should I use, and how are they prepared? 
</P>
<P>
 J.U.,Mission Viejo * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The problem with painting galvanized or anodized aluminum is that it's hard 
to get the paint to adhere, says Andrew Carter of Sinclair Paint in Costa Mesa. 
First you'll have to etch the surface. There are commercial products available 
at most paint stores that can etch smooth aluminum, but you can also try 
rubbing plain vinegar on the surface. After the surface has been prepared, use 
a good metal primer. A red oxide primer is good for metal that's exposed to 
moisture, such as that in a bathroom. Then apply your finish coats, sanding 
with light paper in between each coat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're considering putting wood floors in our entryway and living room. 
We're concerned by all of the scratches that can occur on the floor because 
it's near the front door, and people will be tracking pebbles and grit from 
their shoes. Even homes I've seen with a mat inside the door have lots of 
scratches. What kind of floor will prevent this? 
</P>
<P>
 D.D., Brea * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Wood floors are vulnerable to scratches, so no floor is safe from pebbles 
and grit, says Gidon Adlan of Bob's Shades & Linoleum in Orange. Your best 
defense is to have good mats both outside and inside the door. You also may 
want to consider a floor that has beveled edges. This will create a groove 
between each plank where grit can collect, which keeps it from being scraped 
across the floor. Take care to clean it frequently so that grit and pebbles 
don't collect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We had a ceramic tile floor put down in one of our bathrooms last year, 
and, although grout sealer was applied, there are several areas where the grout 
has been stained. I've tried cleaning it but haven't had any luck. What's the 
key to cleaning it and resealing it so that it won't stain again? 
</P>
<P>
 F.E.,Huntington Beach * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Bathroom floors are generally tough on grout because they are subject to a 
lot of moisture, says Gloria Richey of Tile Importers in Anaheim. Use a good 
quality commercial grout cleaner. If your grout is white, there are special 
white grout cleaners that may be more effective. After it's completely dried 
out, apply two or three coats of a sealer, and make sure that you reapply the 
sealer every six months to prevent future staining.

LINENS; BEDS MADE LIKE THEY USED TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In France, it's traditional for the bride's parents to provide a monogrammed 
linen trousseau. But these fine linens may never be used by the couple. Rather, 
they'll be put away for their progeny, while those of the bride's mother or 
grandmother will be unpacked and cherished for a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, fine European bedding can last a lifetime because it generally is made 
of pure linen. And a lot of what isn't in the hands of heirs is finding its way 
to antiques shops in the United States. Along with reproductions, old linens 
are enjoying a renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Fisher, a New York antiques dealer who specializes in vintage quilts and 
linens, says some of her best clients are designers for the domestics and home 
textiles industries who buy old linens to copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reproductions lack the weight, body and intricacy that late 19th-Century 
and early 20th-Century linens had, so some consumers are looking for the real 
thing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Old sheet sets as well as single pillowcases and table linens are popular as 
wedding presents, Fisher says. As these linens become rarer, linens of more 
recent vintage take up the slack. Hand-embroidered pillowcases from 1940s 
America are showing up in antiques shops. Imports include square pillowcases 
with lace edging, many of German and Swiss origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are not necessarily higher for vintage linens than for high-end copies. 
For example, Fisher sold a set of old muslin sheets with simple crochet for 
$145. A linen set with cutwork trim might be about $550. A queen-size set of 
Ralph Lauren embroidered eyelet-trim white cotton sheets retails for about 
$215. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with old bed linens is that they predate queen- and king-size 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some old sheets are outsize, so they can fit a queen-size bed," Fisher says, 
"but don't try to find old bed linens for a king-size bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a gift of fine old linens, you might include "The Book of Fine 
Linen" (Flammarion, $45). Author Francoise de Bonneville provides a 
wide-ranging history of the production, use and care of linens for bed, bath 
and table. Tucked into the text are answers to questions such as: Who invented 
that infernal contraption, the iron? 
</P>
<P>
 According to De Bonneville, smoothing tools date to neolithic times, and 
Egyptians added the handle sometime around 2000 BC. The shape of the modern 
iron, which resembles a ship's prow, evolved around the end of the 17th 
Century, when solid iron bases were introduced. Many methods were tried to keep 
irons hot until electric irons arrived early in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of America's bedding style and tradition is European, the United 
States has made significant contributions. The first packaged laundry soap was 
marketed by the Lever Co. in 1888 under the name Sunlight. A French ad for the 
product is reproduced in De Bonneville's book. By mid-century, American 
manufacturers also introduced no-iron sheets and fitted sheets. Along with 
colored sheets, they are slowly gaining favor in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for old linens is far more laborious than caring for modern percales in 
no-iron cotton and blends. Use a mild soap -- and a net bag if there is lace or 
other trim that might tear. Old linens should be ironed damp with a heavy, hot 
iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "In France, they are starting to make heavy, old-fashioned irons again," De 
Bonneville says. "But many household helpers refuse to use them, so there are 
special services to iron old linens in the old-fashioned way."

DO-IT-YOURSELF: FORCE THE ISSUE AND CLEAR THE DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soap, hair, food particles and cooking grease all help to clog drainage lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally a fixture trap will accumulate a blockage that can be forced 
clear with a plunger, compressed air or a blow bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Most blockages build up inside pipes over an extended period of time, however, 
and must be cabled, or "snaked," to be opened. The method you choose will 
depend on the fixture involved and the size of the drainage line. 
</P>
<P>
 Plungers, blow bags and cans of compressed air can all be used to free simple 
trap clogs. When forcing a trap with any of these, be sure to plug any 
connecting airways. 
</P>
<P>
 When plunging a lavatory, for example, use a wet rag to plug the overflow hole 
in the basin. When forcing the trap of a two-compartment sink, plug the 
opposite drain. 
</P>
<P>
 After the clog has been forced through the trap and into the drain line, run 
very hot water through the line to move the clog into the main stack or soil 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 If drain water backs up into a tub or shower from another fixture, it probably 
means that the main sewer line is clogged. If a tub or shower drains slowly or 
not at all, snake the tub or shower trap and drain line. 
</P>
<P>
 To snake a tub, remove the cover plate from the overflow valve and push the 
cable into the overflow pipe. Do not attempt to cable through the drain 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 To clean a shower drain, start by removing the drain screen. If the screen is 
fastened to the drain with screws, remove them and pry the screen up with a 
knife. If the screen snaps in place, pry it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a flashlight to look into the trap. If the trap is clogged by soap and 
hair, you can usually pick the clog out with a wire hook. If the trap is clear 
but the line is clogged, push the cable through the trap and cable the line to 
the main stack or nearest soil line. 
</P>
<P>
 When you wish to clear the drain line of any fixture with a snake, you first 
have to remove the trap. Use a pipe wrench or adjustable pliers to loosen the 
nuts at the top of the trap and at the drain connection near the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 With S-traps, loosen the nuts near the floor and at the trap weir. To avoid 
cracking or breaking a P-trap, hold it firmly and turn the nut with steady, 
even pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 With the trap removed, slide the snake cable into the drain line until you 
feel resistance. Then tighten the lock nut on the snake housing and slowly 
crank and push the cable deeper into the line. All bends in the line will offer 
some resistance, but slow, persistent pushing and cranking will force the cable 
around bends. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cable comes up against a blockage and begins to kink inside the line, 
back up a foot or so and try again. If you feel steady resistance, keep pushing 
and cranking. Every three feet or so, stop, pull the snake back a little and 
then crank forward again. 
</P>
<P>
 Try to determine how many feet it is from the trap to the main stack and cable 
all the way to the stack, even if you break through the clog. When pulling the 
snake out for the final time, crank in a clockwise direction. 
</P>
<P>
 If the clog was caused by a foreign object, such as a piece of sponge or 
dishcloth, the clockwise coil on the end of the cable will hang onto the object 
and pull it out as well. 
</P>
<P>
 After you have snaked the drain, replace the trap. If the trap washers seem 
hard and brittle, replace them with new washers. Because much of the debris 
from the clog will remain in the line, flush with plenty of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fixture drain backs up, plunge it thoroughly and flush the line again.

GARDENING; HUE COLORS DEBATE OVER '95 ROSE WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1995 All-America Rose Selections seem likely to provide a never-ending 
debate. It has nothing to do with the winners themselves, two free-blooming 
floribundas -- Singin' in the Rain and Brass Band -- that continue easy-care 
domination of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But no two people are likely to agree on the coloration of Singin' in the 
Rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, AARS describes it as "cinnamon apricot" and says the flowers 
"gently shift tempo to golden and blushed hues of apricot." The flower color is 
quite pleasing but seems to change by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil and Kathy Edmunds, co-owners of the introducer, Edmunds' Roses of 
Wilsonville, Ore., were asked for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a tough question," said Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not real easy to describe," said Phil. "I'd say it has coppery orange 
buds opening to a cinnamon apricot color, depending on the heat and amount of 
sun and changing through the season. The color definitely moves." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's upcoming advertisements straddle the question, providing in a 
single poster four different color pictures of Singin' in the Rain, each with a 
slightly different hue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brass Band, introduced by rose-selling giant Jackson & Perkins, grows about 3 
1/2 feet tall, is spreading, with dark green, glossy foliage and orange 
flowers. Fragrance is a moderate damask. Flowers are up to four inches across, 
with 30 to 40 petals. The hybridizer was Jack E. Christensen, who also produced 
the 1994 winner, Midas Touch, for J&P. 
</P>
<P>
 Singin' in the Rain is more upright and free branching, reaching as high as 
five feet. Foliage is dark green and glossy. Fragrance is sweet musk. The 
hybridizer was New Zealand's Sam McGredy; this is his seventh AARS winner. 
Flower size is up to 3 1/2 inches, with 30 petals. Edmunds says "it's 
absolutely disease-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Each All-American is evaluated in test gardens across the country for two 
years. It takes about eight years from propagation until designation by AARS, a 
nonprofit organization whose members produce most of the nation's roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcements are not made until two years after selection to give growers 
time to produce sufficient plants for public sale. So the 1995 winners will be 
available by next spring in most of the country and somewhat earlier in warmer 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951 there was no winner, and some years only one is selected. Scoring is 
based on bud and flower form, vigor, hardiness, growth habit, disease 
resistance, foliage and fragrance. Originated in 1938, the competition is 
designed to improve the vitality, strength and beauty of roses. 
</P>
<P>
 AARS President Larry Burks says the 1995 winners "offer unusual, head-turning 
colors on good landscape plants" and calls them "the perfect way to perk up a 
variety of spots around the yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds Roses was started in 1949 by Fred Edmunds Jr., Phil's father and a 
former president of both AARS and the American Rose Society. Fred Edmunds Sr. 
had been curator of the world-famous Washington Park Rose Test Garden in 
Portland. Fred Jr. and Wini, his wife and partner in the business, retired in 
1992, some 15 years after Phil joined the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the company's fourth AARS winner. The others were Amber Queen, 
Sundowner and Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 AARS offers a 16-page brochure on rose selection, planting and care. It also 
includes a list of its public gardens throughout the country. For a copy send a 
check for $1, plus a stamped, self-addressed, business-size envelope to AARS, 
Dept. 95FS, 221 N. LaSalle St., Chicago, IL., 60601.

EQUIPMENT; WITH A TV-VCR IN THE KITCHEN, COOKS LOOK BEYOND BOOKS 
</P>

<P>
 It is widely believed that the best way to learn is by hands-on experience, 
and yet many would-be chefs sit in their living rooms, watching videos on how 
to perfectly poach salmon or concoct a marvelous meringue. 
</P>
<P>
 Because manufacturers recognize that cooking requires equipment other than a 
remote control, and senses of taste and smell as well as sight, they are 
bringing food preparation videos and VCRs into the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur gourmets can now chop and saute along with all their television role 
models using a product such as General Electric's new KitchenVision TVCR, which 
combines a television and two-head videocassette recorder. With a list price of 
$499, the 13-inch unit rests on a 180-degree swiveling base for versatile 
viewing and comes complete with a recipe tape and a catalogue of 200 cooking 
videos. It is marketed in one color, kitchen white. 
</P>
<P>
 As 20 million Americans regularly watch TV in the kitchen anyway, a TVCR could 
easily become another commonplace kitchen appliance.

TO REPLACE A ROTTED SILL, REMOVE ALL THE GLASS FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sill is a fundamental part of a window frame, and one attacked by rot can 
mean major repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 A window frame is constructed in the same way as a door frame and can be 
repaired in a similar way. All the glass should be removed first, preferably by 
removing the sashes. Be sure to check the condition of the subsill (part of the 
rough frame). 
</P>
<P>
 Rot can extend into this region also if the opening was not covered with 
building paper. After repairs have been made, be careful to thoroughly 
weatherproof the window frame to prevent moisture from entering again. 
</P>
<P>
 Reapply fresh 15-pound asphalt-saturated building paper around exposed parts 
of the rough frame, then caulk all seams where the window frame itself contacts 
the exterior of the house. Repairing sills is difficult and time-consuming, so 
plan to do such work during good weather when window openings can be covered 
with polyethylene while work progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, to replace a rotted window sill you should remove the entire window, 
carefully disassemble the old sill from the jamb sides, use it as a template, 
then cut and fit a new sill and replace the window. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sills may be replaced with the window in place, provided you work 
patiently and have some skill at scribing and shaping wood with a chisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by carefully splitting out the old sill. Cut through it crosswise in two 
places with a saw to remove the middle portion, then gently pry the end 
sections away from the jambs. Hacksaw any nails holding the sill to the rest of 
the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a piece of cardboard to make a template for the new sill, shaped to fit 
between the jambs but beneath the casing on the outside. Cut a 10-degree bevel 
along the upper outside edge of the sill, extending to the inside edge of the 
sash, then bevel the sash area so it is level when the sill is installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill the area beneath the sill with insulation, install the sill with 16d 
finishing nails, then thoroughly caulk the seams.

REPAIRS; OPEN-AND-SHUT TREATMENT FOR STICKY WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's frustrating to have windows that stick, especially during the hot days of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most homes today have double-hung windows. These have two frames or sashes 
with panes of glass. The upper or outside sash slides down and the lower or 
inside sash slides up. The movements are controlled by pulleys with cords (or 
chains) and weights hidden within the frame. A double-hung window usually 
sticks because: 
</P>
<P>
 * It's painted shut. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paint or dirt has accumulated in the grooves or on the edges of the 
moldings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Humidity has caused the wood to swell. 
</P>
<P>
 * The weatherstripping fits too snugly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 If paint has sealed the window sash to the frame, insert a wide putty knife -- 
never a screwdriver -- between the parting strip (the strip between the window 
frame and the sash). Work the putty knife up one side of the sash and down the 
other. You may have to tap the handle with a hammer to coax the blade in. If 
that doesn't work, place a block of wood in the channel just above or below the 
stuck sash. Tap the block a few times with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've opened the sash and are able to freely move both sections, use a 
narrow putty knife or chisel to carefully cut away all the gobs of dried paint 
from the sash and parting strip. Sand the scraped areas, vacuum the sash 
channels, and lubricate them with stick paraffin, paste wax, hard soap, 
petroleum jelly or a spritz of silicone spray. Wipe off the excess. 
</P>
<P>
 If weatherstripping is too tight, lubricate it with a bit of stick paraffin or 
hard soap. If that doesn't work, carefully remove and refasten it to allow more 
clearance. Don't move it too far from the sash or you'll negate the cold-air 
protection the weatherstripping provides. 
</P>
<P>
 A casement window, which is hinged on the side, operates by turning a crank 
and seldom needs repairs. If if becomes increasingly difficult to open and 
close a casement window, remove the screws from the crank assembly and inspect 
the gears. If they are badly worn, replace the whole assembly with a new one 
available from a window dealer. However, if the problem is caused by old, 
hardened grease, wash the assembly in solvent and re-lubricate with fresh 
grease. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that the operator arm slides smoothly in its tracks as the window is 
opened and closed. If it doesn't, remove and straighten it. Or clean out the 
accumulated debris. Then apply a generous dab of fresh grease and reassemble. 
</P>
<P>
 If you feel a draft with a casement window closed tightly, adjust or tighten 
the locking handle. Or install a thin layer of self-adhesive foam 
weatherstripping between the sash and the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some sliding windows are made of wood, most are aluminum. They move 
along a closely fitted track at top and bottom. If you have trouble sliding the 
sash or storm window, remove both as well as the screen. Clean out debris and 
clean the metal weatherstripping, its groove and the edges of the storm window 
and the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply either stick paraffin or paste wax to the edges. Then reinstall the 
three components in the reverse order that you removed them.

FOCUS SHIFTS TO TRIAL LOCATION IN HUBER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 If he had his druthers, the Arizona defense attorney for the man accused of 
killing Denise Huber and carting her body around in a freezer for three years 
said Friday that he does have a preference of where his client should be tried: 
in California, where it's tougher to execute someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware that in the applicability of the death penalty, it's apparent 
that California has more lenient provisions," defense counsel Thomas K. Kelly 
said. "That's clearly an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's father, Dennis, sees it differently: "I want Arizona," he said. "I 
think if you get the death penalty there they carry it out. It's a joke here." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, 10 days after John J. Famalaro was arrested at his country club home, 
the issue of where the 37-year-old bearded house painter will be tried began to 
take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid growing indications investigators may be able to show the 23-year-old 
Newport Beach woman was murdered in Orange County, a task force of county 
prosecutors and forensic specialists rendezvoused in Phoenix on Friday with 
their Arizona counterparts to examine evidence and discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your gut tells you it's likely that Huber was kidnaped and murdered (in 
Orange County)," Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said. "But 
we're looking at whether we can prove she was abducted and moved. You need more 
than a gut instinct to prove that in court -- you need witnesses or physical 
evidence to prove it to a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tests on what appears to be blood found at a Laguna Hills storage complex 
could be completed by Monday, Conley said. Famalaro was renting the storage 
space at the time of Huber's disappearance. Crime lab specialists were expected 
to work through the weekend in an attempt to determine if the substance is 
human blood and, if it is, if it matches Huber's type.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sources close to the case revealed Friday that Famalaro painted homes 
belonging to members of the Orange County law enforcement community, including 
two Newport Beach police officers and one prosecutor, who may have hired the 
handyman around the time Huber vanished in June, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, in an odd twist, may be called as a witness in 
the case to testify on what could be a key issue: Investigators say Paer has 
told them that he remembers Famalaro being clean-shaven, as opposed to the 
bearded figure whom police arrested in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's appearance during that period is significant because some have 
speculated he posed as a police officer in luring Huber to her death, and it's 
generally known that most law enforcement officers don't sport beards. Handmade 
replicas of Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy shirts turned up in a search of 
Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense counsel Kelly won court approval to hire an independent pathologist 
to examine the body, as long as it does not interfere with the family's plans 
to bury Huber later this month in South Dakota next to her grandfather. The 
defense's independent exam is scheduled for Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weary of being inadvertently placed in the media spotlight, the roommate of 
Famalaro's brother Warren, who lives in Lake Forest, moved out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have interviewed Warren Famalaro, a convicted child molester, 
several times, saying he was being considered as everything from a "witness to 
a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 As prosecutors from both Arizona and Orange County weighed their cache of 
evidence in the case Friday -- including a possibly bloodstained crowbar seized 
from Famalaro's home -- authorities were turning their attention to the issue 
of jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in both states have conferred on the issue and, at least publicly, 
have agreed that justice should be dispensed where the crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Orange County officials await the results of tests on a 
blood-like substance found in a Laguna Hills storage locker rented by Famalaro 
during the time of Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test confirms investigators' suspicions the substance is Huber's blood, 
that would provide evidence of a potential murder site. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators already say they have evidence that Famalaro lived in Lake 
Forest at the time of Huber's disappearance, bought a freezer from a Montgomery 
Ward & Co. store in Orange County several days later and had it shipped to the 
Laguna Hills storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the freezer was transferred in 1992 to a San Clemente storage bin, 
where Famalaro requested that power be on 24 hours a day. Sometime early this 
year, authorities say, Famalaro rented a Ryder truck, put the freezer in it and 
relocated to his country club home in Dewey, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 When investigators opened the freezer July 13, they found Huber's frozen 
corpse inside, her head bludgeoned, her hands cuffed, and her eyes and mouth 
covered in cloth and sealed in duct tape.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said the Orange County "team" included Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Christopher J. Evans, investigator Don Null, pathologist Richard Fukumoto 
and three additional law enforcement officers. They arrived in Phoenix to meet 
with officials from the local medical examiner's office and the local 
prosecutor, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County prosecutors arrived too late to see some evidence. The Ryder 
rental truck, for example, has been released back to the truck company, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of information they are not privy to, but that is because it 
is not their case," said Yavapai County prosecutor Tom Lindberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will, however be kept up to date on all developments because it is 
important for them to keep abreast of things. There will be no jurisdictional 
squabbling in this case. We all want the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the representatives from the Orange County district attorney's 
office were sent to Arizona to act as "backup" prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley also stressed that there was no "competition" for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in any way acting like the big bad prosecutors from the big city 
coming in to take over," Conley said, alluding to the fact that Yavapai County 
(population 120,000) is not used to such high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a breakthrough in the next day or two and it can be proven she 
was murdered in Orange County," he added, "we would have to pick up the ball 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Arizona officials say their laws dictate that Arizona has 
jurisdiction unless it can be shown the murder took place in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As the defense has already pointed out, transferring the case back to Orange 
County may benefit the defendant if Famalaro is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 California prosecutors can seek the death penalty -- via gas chamber or lethal 
injection -- only if the murder was accompanied by "special circumstances," 
such as a kidnaping or other felony. 
</P>
<P>
 To execute someone by lethal injection -- the sole means in Arizona -- 
prosecutors have more leeway; they must simply prove the murder of Huber was 
"depraved" and heinous, a burden that investigators say is easily met in the 
Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Friday that the number of blows Huber suffered 
was underestimated. It appears that instead of eight to 10 blows to the head -- 
possibly with a hammer or crowbar -- Huber might have suffered more than 12 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kelly made his comments concerning his preferences on 
jurisdiction in an interview from his office in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hoping either way, but I am trying to anticipate each potential 
defense and where it could work better," Kelly said. "I have discussed with my 
client the advantages of trying this case in California rather than Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what he knows, Kelly predicted that Famalaro, who was indicted on 
first-degree murder charges Thursday, would probably be returned to face trial 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly also expressed concerns about the level of publicity the case has 
garnered, adding, "We have to consider that impact both in California and in 
Arizona in terms of selecting a fair and impartial jury." 
</P>
<P>
 In his motion to have an independent forensics expert appointed, Kelly argued 
that it would be crucial in preparing his defense to fix a time and cause of 
death. At the same time, Kelly said he understood the prosecution's concerns 
about releasing Huber's body to the family for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made every effort to meet our needs without infringing on the 
family's grief," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Friday, Yavapai County Counsel Charles Hastings offered no 
objections to the defense request for a private pathologist's examination -- so 
long as the family's plans to bury the Huber next week are not delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hastings, "I think the family deserves that."

HOMEOWNERS SAY DEVELOPER RENEGED ON PACT; MOTION: BUYERS WHO BELIEVED THEIR 
HOUSES WERE IN LAGUNA BEACH, NOT ALISO VIEJO, SAY THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN SECOND 
SETTLEMENT PAYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners who settled with a development company in 1990 after claiming they 
were duped into thinking the homes they bought in Aliso Viejo were actually in 
Laguna Beach now allege the company hasn't made a nearly $700,000 settlement 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment from the Laguna Audubon partnership, which includes the Kathryn G. 
Thompson Development Co., was not received despite "several oral and written 
demands," according to a motion seeking payment filed in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money was due on Dec. 28," John Haag, a Los Angeles attorney representing 
the homeowners, said this week. "They owed it unconditionally." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Irvine attorney Joel Kew, who represents the developers, denied the 
payment is late. He said his clients are simply following a procedure outlined 
in the original settlement and will pay after a scheduled court hearing Friday 
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute is the latest between the development company and the owners of 
about 180 homes in the Laguna Audubon planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are located off El Toro Road, across the street from Laguna Beach in 
unincorporated Aliso Viejo. However, an early billboard, sales brochures, signs 
and sales documents identified the development as being in the city. Property 
owners bought their homes in the late 1980s and in 1989 sued the company for $5 
million, which they contended was the difference between the property values in 
Aliso Viejo compared to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement granted homeowners $1.5 million in cash and up to $2.5 million 
more over four years if Laguna Beach did not annex the neighborhood. Although 
the settlement is confidential, some terms have been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents say the payment of $683,000 is the second of three 
installments promised in the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag said the homeowners also needed a judge's order last year to get the 
first payment as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's ever said we're not entitled to the money but when it comes to 
actually opening up their wallets and paying . . . we start having problems," 
Haag said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kew maintains that the payments aren't automatic and that homeowners must seek 
a court order each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the plaintiff's counsel has to do is wake up, smell the coffee, make the 
application," Kew said. "Every time he does the things set forth in the 
agreement, he gets the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Haag argues that the payment should have been made earlier and that he has had 
to "jump through all these hoops so our clients can get this money." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of waking up and smelling the coffee, it's a matter of 
meeting your obligations when they come due," Haag said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners also contend the developers have not tried hard enough to 
persuade Laguna Beach to annex Laguna Audubon. The city rejected that option 
last year, saying it would detract from the city's ambience to extend its 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said this week that a 
lawsuit has been filed by a Laguna Audubon resident trying to force the city to 
annex the area. That homeowner was not involved in the Laguna Audubon 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $1.5 million cash payment, the settlement held the 
developer would have to pay $500,000 more if the tract wasn't annexed in two 
years, plus another $500,000 if the city didn't claim it within three years. If 
the development is not annexed within four years, the company is required to 
make a final payment of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If Laguna Beach never annexes the area, the maximum that would be paid to 
homeowners under the settlement is $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure payments, the development company purchased a bond. Haag said the 
current motion is intended to force payment through the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current court action, the homeowners say the development company missed 
the December payment of more than $423,000 to residents who did not take a 
"seller's option" and another $260,000 to homeowners who did. 
</P>
<P>
 The seller's option compensated the homeowners who decided to sell and move 
elsewhere after learning they weren't living in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners are requesting the company pay the amount they contend is due, 
plus interest and attorney's fees.

MAN SENTENCED TO 4-YEAR TERM IN STALKING CASE; CRIME: JON VAN DEMARK BECOMES 
THE COUNTY'S FIRST PERSON CONVICTED BY A JURY UNDER THE STATE'S STALKING LAW. 
HE PROFESSES CONTINUED LOVE FOR EX-GIRLFRIEND AS HE IS REMOVED FROM COURTROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first person in Orange County to be convicted by a jury under the state's 
stalking law was sentenced to a maximum four years in prison Friday following 
an emotionally charged hearing in which he declared his continuing love for his 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg ordered that Jon Van Demark, 25, of 
Long Beach be tested to determine if he should serve his sentence in a state 
mental hospital. The judge also ordered Van Demark to make absolutely no 
contact with the victim, Kendra Brown, for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Demark, hands in shackles, yelled out to his mother in the courtroom at 
the end of the hearing before struggling with bailiffs who moved him back to a 
holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in an emotional, sometimes angry statement to the judge, Van Demark 
apologized to Brown for any "trouble, embarrassment and humiliation" he may 
have caused. The woman was not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why, but I still love you," he said, breaking down in sobs as he 
read from a lengthy letter, printed in small lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Demark said he has tried to stop his love, "but it seems the more I try, 
the closer to you I become." 
</P>
<P>
 He started the letter by criticizing the prosecutor, a Huntington Beach police 
detective and county jail staff for the treatment he was accorded, saying that 
a felony conviction and prison time in a state hospital was not going to help 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have only added more fuel to the fire," he said, reading from a section 
of the letter directed to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say Van Demark, who attended high school in Fullerton and last 
worked as a truck driver, sent hundreds of letters and made hundreds of calls, 
some threatening, to Brown after the breakup of their eight-year relationship. 
He was also accused of vandalizing her car numerous times, following her and 
harassing her friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to court and gained a three-year restraining order in July, 1993, to 
try and keep him away -- to no avail, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Chris Jensen told the judge that Van Demark has "never shown 
any violence at all" and has never harmed the woman physically. Jensen said it 
appears that Van Demark is being punished for something he may do, instead of 
something he has actually done. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Froeberg said Van Demark has caused great "emotional injury" and has 
shown no remorse or any sign of staying away from his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a small step from piercing tires to piercing skin," Froeberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrest in mid-January, Van Demark sent Brown more than 200 letters, 
according to a sentencing report prepared by the Orange County Probation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're stuck with me forever," he wrote in one. "The court system will not 
solve our problems, just put them on hold until I get out," he wrote in 
another, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, the prosecutor said Van Demark's "irrational" and 
"obsessive" behavior during the hearing reinforced her contention that he's a 
"danger to society." Shade said she remains worried about Brown and hopes Van 
Demark gets effective treatment at a state hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the only thing we can do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown submitted a written statement to the court expressing her fears of Van 
Demark and urging the maximum sentence and state hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's mother, Bonnie Van Demark, said her son has been punished 
unfairly and expressed doubt that a state hospital will help him at all. Her 
son had asked for a probation sentence that would include counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's losing it," Bonnie Van Demark said. "I'm very scared. I don't know 
what's going to happen to him."

BROWN APPLAUDS SANTA ANA EFFORT ON JOB TRAINING; CAMPAIGN: CANDIDATE FOR 
GOVERNOR SAYS PROGRAM SHOULD BE STATE'S MODEL FOR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown stopped here Friday to praise the 
school district's job training program as a model for the state and promised to 
help California make a transition to a new economy centered on high technology 
and global competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work you are doing here is the absolute linchpin of how we will 
transition to that new economy," Brown told panelists and a small audience 
gathered at the Santa Ana offices of the Central County Regional Occupation 
Program, which works in partnership with local business and the Santa Ana 
Unified School District's job training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the kind of public-private partnership that should and can and must 
bring California's job market into the 21st Century," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown talked to program directors and city business leaders and interviewed 
students who have graduated from the Business Education Network -- a four-year 
Santa Ana school district program that introduces them to careers and 
ultimately provides training, mentors, internships and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Quintanilla, who just graduated from Century High School, told Brown 
that Santa Ana students need the program in order to be exposed to the 
corporate world and the diversity of careers available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a summer internship with FHP and I learned a lot," Quintanilla said. "A 
lot of our parents, they don't have a college education. We're not around that 
many people in the corporate world." 
</P>
<P>
 The visit came as part of a swing through Southern California to highlight 
Gov. Pete Wilson's "broken promises," according to the Brown campaign. She made 
a morning stop in front of the U.S. Courthouse in San Diego to speak about 
Wilson's immigration record. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the anti-Wilson billing of the event, Brown did not mention her 
opponent's name as she asked Santa Ana officials, high school teachers, school 
administrators and others for input on how the state can help implement 
"job-ready" programs in every high school and encourage partnerships between 
schools, local government and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn from you," she said. "I want you to share with me what role 
you think state government can play in this transition to a new economy." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments to the media after the panel discussion, however, Brown settled 
into her "broken promise" theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson promised longer graduation lines and shorter unemployment lines. 
He accomplished just the opposite," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Brown toured two classes offered by the Regional Occupation Program, 
which works with school districts in Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove as well 
as with other career-preparation programs to offer hands-on training by 
industry experts in everything from automotive work to medical assistantships. 
</P>
<P>
 She stopped to chat with Jose Torres, 20, of Santa Ana, who told her he was 
taking the center's computer applications class to better himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is real life here," Torres told Brown, praising the program. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown wished him luck, he heartily wished her the same, with a twist. 
"What are you running for again?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 During Brown's panel discussion, three Orange County prosecutors sat in the 
back row awaiting their chance to blast her record on crime and public safety, 
but they had to leave before the panel concluded, and a Wilson campaign 
volunteer was unable to grab the media's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the bus tours of the world aren't going to fool the voters of California 
or the voters of Orange County," Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur said later in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Her speaking tours are "not going to change the fact that she's against the 
death penalty, she's against a one-strike initiative for violent sex offenders, 
and that she has no credible record on issues of crime and public safety," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur also challenged Brown's criticisms of Wilson's education record: 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown only tells you part of the story," he said. "What she doesn't 
tell you is that after criticizing Pete Wilson for three years for not 
investing in education, when Kathleen finally came out with her alternative 
budget last month, it did not allocate a single dollar more to K through 12 
education than Pete Wilson's did."

ZAP! CHOP! FIZZLE. . . ; POWER CUTS OUT AS VIDEO GAME JUNKIES SHOOT FOR U.S. 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Video game junkies who journeyed here Friday to zap, nuke and karate-chop 
their opponents for the coveted title of Nintendo Master were left without much 
action when a power failure blackened dozens of screens 20 minutes into the 
first day of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matthew Petrikas, an 11-year-old from Norco, didn't mind much. He led the 
competition with 961,050 points after one round. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there was still two days of competition left, Petrikas could 
imagine himself as regional champ. "That would be cool!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 PowerFest 94, the first national promotional tour by Nintendo, drew a slim 25 
young followers to the parking lot of the Central T.V., Furniture and Appliance 
store here for the start of local competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they expect about 8,000 people to attend over the three days 
of the tournament. Players can either sample Nintendo's latest game for fun or 
they can compete against each other for the regional title. The eight highest 
scorers will do battle for that honor here Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no limit to the number of times a person can play. The event runs 
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday, at 2120 S. 
Bristol St. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana is one of 150 cities nationwide to participate in the tournament. 
The national competition will be held at Sea World in San Diego this November, 
said Brian Ray, a field manager of Nintendo. A National Video Game champion 
will be crowned then. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's competitors gathered at a purple trailer, which housed a bank of 
television monitors displaying Nintendo's latest games. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a generator supplying power to the trailer failed shortly before 2:30 
p.m. Competition didn't resume until about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As they waited for the generator to be repaired, the young contestants 
gathered around the trailer to talk shop. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful contender, Robert Johnston, 16, of Pasadena, was disappointed with 
the spectacle of blank screens and sparse crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought there would be more than this," Johnston said. "And it doesn't 
help to have the power go out." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston and two of his friends killed a few hours dissecting the art of 
"Mortal Combat," a popular video game that dominated discussion among the small 
group of contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It requires strategy, hand-eye coordination," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pedro Negron, 13, and his pals from Santa Ana mostly like the game's blood 
and guts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bloody. It's fun. It's cool," Negron declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the game is to be the best bad guy, they explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can rip their heart out, take out their spinal cord and head, take their 
soul, cut them in half," Negron said. "My sister gets mad 'cause I waste too 
much electricity (playing the game)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although popular, "Mortal Combat" wasn't among the three games included in the 
competition, which combines scores from three other popular games: "Super Mario 
Bros. The Lost Levels," "Super Mario Kart" and "Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major 
League Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Games such as "Super Bomber Man," "Street Fighter II," "Battle Cars," "Ren and 
Stimpy" and dozens more also were available for those who preferred not to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an 8-year-old girl in Tennessee set a record of 1,196,000 points 
during competition, but she will not be going to San Diego because she lost 
during a subsequent elimination round, Nintendo officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; RETIREMENT SYSTEM ASKS CITY TO PAY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Public Employees Retirement System demanded Friday that the city pay 
a $918,796 bill to cover the costs of city employees who retired with inflated 
pensions, often called "spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement system warned the city that if it did not comply, the city's 
contribution rate would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the retirement system had earlier sought payment from the city, 
but the City Council voted to not pay the bill. In June, the city sent a letter 
to PERS informing it that the city would not pay for spiked pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking occurs when an employee gets the city to inflate the worker's last 
year's wages -- on which a pension is based -- by allowing the employee to 
forgo vacation days, car allowances and other benefits and take them as wages. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the city's June letter, PERS officials said the state "cannot 
relieve the city from payment of its unfunded liability" and that the city "may 
be billed subsequently." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's bill from PERS totaled $918,796 to cover a portion of the costs for 
spiked pensions of 39 retired employees. To partially pay for the bill, PERS 
said it would take $175,164 from the city's surplus account. The retirement 
system demanded payment of the remaining $743,632 by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, an opponent of pension spiking and chairman of the 
council's subcommittee investigating spiking, said Friday afternoon that he had 
not seen the letter and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard also said that the city has no 
statement regarding the letter from PERS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legal counsel is reviewing the content of the letter and is preparing an 
analysis of it," Barnard said. He said the council will meet soon with an 
attorney hired to advise the subcommittee on the spiking issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city rejected the PERS bill because a council majority believes spiking is 
illegal and that the city is not obligated to pay for pension spiking. The 
subcommittee that is investigating pension spiking may ask a court to rule 
whether the practice is legal. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AT THE ZOO, KIDS OF ALL KINDS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County schoolchildren are learning to appreciate exotic and domestic 
animals this summer during a series of behind-the-scenes instructional programs 
at Santa Ana Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zoo Camps and animal training sessions for kindergartners through 
15-year-olds are designed to be fun for the children while fostering care and 
concern for all animals, said Kent Yamaguchi, the zoo's curator of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids just aren't exposed to animals" other than dogs or cats, 
Yamaguchi said. He said even the zoo's barnyard creatures are a big hit with 
the young students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always amazing to me how excited they get about seeing the chickens or 
the rabbits," he said. "It's real fun. It's very satisfying to be able to give 
them that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, children in Junior Zoo Camp spent part of their morning brushing the 
goats and raking a corral in the petting zoo area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, they're zookeepers," Yamaguchi said. "They're learning about the 
importance of keeping the zoo clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Older children in Zoo Camp scientifically examine "pellets" regurgitated by 
owls, and use stethoscopes to hear the heartbeats of snakes, goats, chickens, 
rats and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a bone lab for the campers, who attempt to reassemble "Fred," a 
full-size plastic model of a human skeleton. When the bones get mixed up, Fred 
sometimes ends up with "very long arms," said Yamaguchi. "It can get really 
funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior camper Caroline Wilkinson, a 6-year-old from Santa Ana, said her 
favorite experience was "being one of the zookeepers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We cleaned up the goat pens and brushed their hair," she said. She said some 
of the goats tend to "butt their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindy Tober, 5, of Newport Beach, said petting the animals was her highlight 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the goats and the lambs," she said. "I really made a lot of friends 
with the animals. I don't know their names." 
</P>
<P>
 Tober said she and the other campers learned about species that are 
endangered, and about some that have already vanished from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us what scientists think the dinosaurs died of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the junior campers were outside playing a game, Yamaguchi was working 
over a stove making a "bird nest" mixture out of butterscotch, peanut butter, 
chocolate and shredded wheat. In what has become a tradition, the children 
create "little nests" out of the sticky concoction as edible souvenirs of their 
week in Zoo Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the fun is watching them lick their fingers after they're done," 
Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong summer programs for children are continuing through Aug. 26. 
Junior Zoo Camp is for kindergartners to age 7, Zoo Camp I and II are for ages 
8 to 14, and Animal Training in Zoos is for ages 12 to 15. Field trips are 
conducted to the Los Angeles Zoo and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is available by calling Santa Ana Zoo at (714) 836-4000. Parents 
can also register their children through the community education departments of 
Cerritos, Golden West, Irvine Valley, Orange Coast and Rancho Santiago 
colleges. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SOCCER GROUPS GIVEN WORLD CUP BANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 World Cup banners displayed on street lamps around South Coast 
Plaza during the soccer tournament have been donated to youth soccer groups in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Henwood, general manager of South Coast Plaza, and Anton Segerstrom, 
general manager of Crystal Court, presented the banners Friday to 
representatives of the American Youth Soccer Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawthorne-based group coordinates tournaments for nearly 500,000 soccer 
players ages 5 to 18 around the country, including about 50,000 in Orange 
County, according to Lolly Keys, AYSO public affairs director. 
</P>
<P>
 "These may be the ultimate World Cup souvenirs," Keys said. "It's a nice way 
to carry on the excitement generated by the World Cup to our next season 
starting in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Keys said that the banners will be distributed to 12 AYSO regions in Orange 
County. The flags could be used as raffle items for fund-raisers, or displayed 
during games and at local AYSO headquarters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will keep soccer in the public eye," said Jack Minter, regional 
commissioner in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. World Cup team trained for more than a year in Mission Viejo and the 
players were treated as members of the community, Minter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that more than 3,000 children participate in AYSO tournaments in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The banners depict soccer players and the World Cup mascot, Striker. They were 
taken down from the lamp posts July 18, a day after the finals. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STORE TO PAY PENALTIES FOR 'SALE' ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office Friday announced settlement of a 
lawsuit that charged the Leather Center in Costa Mesa with misleading customers 
by advertising "sales" on furniture when in fact the alleged discounts were 
regular prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leather Center, which has nine stores throughout the state, agreed to pay 
penalties of $45,000, stop certain advertising practices related to the sales, 
and pay investigation costs, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Wendy Brough of the 
consumer protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brough said the investigation began about a year ago in response to a consumer 
complaint over the price of a leather sofa, and focused on advertisements that 
the Costa Mesa Leather Center placed in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsale prices were exaggerated in order to make customers believe they should 
hurry and purchase furniture, when in fact the sale prices remained in effect 
after the sale date expired, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think that something is on sale and you feel the urgency to buy it 
this week or next week, that forces you into making a purchase that you might 
not otherwise make," Brough said. "It's pretty common. But that still doesn't 
make it OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The practices violate the California Business and Professions Code, she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STAKING A CLAIM ON FUTURE OF OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors describe Fairview Park as an oasis -- a quiet patch of rugged open 
space set upon a mesa overlooking the Santa Ana River and Pacific Ocean. On a 
clear day, the views extend to Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, a group of Costa Mesa residents has fought to keep the 
250-acre park basically the way it is -- covered with native vegetation and 
free of athletic facilities, baseball diamonds and turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you are totally removed from all the high-rises and pollution 
when you are out there," said Richard J. Mehren, who heads the Fairview Park 
Citizens Committee. "The views are beautiful. It's like a beautiful field." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehren and other residents have been largely successful in thwarting 
development at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to spend $25,000 later this year to create a master plan for 
the area, and committee members expect to have an influential role in the 
process. Eventually, the residents would like the city to pay for a full-scale 
cleanup of the park and plant more native brush and grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the park's secluded location off Placentia Avenue, illegal garbage 
dumping has been a problem, Mehren said. Neighborhood cleanup campaigns have 
turned up a discarded car as well as chunks of concrete, furniture and tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing some of the things we found in there," Mehren said. "Man has 
degraded it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview Park has a colorful history. Archeologists last year discovered 
evidence that Native Americans used the area hundreds of years ago to store 
ocean shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this century, the area was used as farmland to grow grain for cattle. 
Later, the county took possession of the land and planned to develop it into a 
regional park through the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents opposed the county proposal, which called for the 
construction of baseball fields and a fishing lake. Several years ago, the land 
was purchased by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in Costa Mesa wants to keep Fairview Park in its current 
condition. Some residents who criticize the lack of sports facilities for young 
people have suggested building baseball and soccer fields at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 They point out that Fairview Park is the city's largest park and one of the 
few locations in Costa Mesa that can accommodate a sports center. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Van Holt, Costa Mesa's director of community services, said the city 
might consider some sort of an athletic development there if it cannot secure 
new sports facilities elsewhere. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; RESOLUTION ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson says Huntington Beach and other Orange County 
cities are paying a big price to provide assistance to illegal immigrants -- 
and she wants it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities can no longer afford to pay the cost of illegal immigrants -- and we 
have no control," Moulton Patterson said."The federal government should pay for 
any costs incurred. It's important that cities let the federal government know 
the impact to Orange County cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor this week asked her colleagues to support a resolution requesting 
that the federal government increase financial assistance to cities to help 
them "in providing services to immigrants so that many of the problems the city 
has experienced due to their presence can be alleviated." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution also states that the city wants tighter control of the nation's 
borders to stem illegal immigration while honoring basic human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to adopt the resolution, with Councilman Jim Silva 
opposed. Councilmen Earle Robitaille and Victor Leipzig were absent. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; D.A. SAYS NO DEAL IN DOG BEATING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for a Fountain Valley man who is charged with beating the family 
collie portrayed his client Friday as "not the type of person who abuses 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Eugene Griffith Jr., 36, was arrested May 6 after a neighbor captured 
on videotape the alleged assault of his 1-year-old dog, Jazzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith was charged on two felony counts of cruelty to an animal and has 
pleaded not guilty. Deputy District Atty. James W. Hicks said Griffith faces a 
maximum three years and eight months in prison and a $20,000 fine if convicted 
on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, he shouldn't go down on a felony count," Griffith's attorney, 
Mark N. Phillips, said Friday. "The dog was never injured. . . . I think it's 
emotions that are running the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, an insurance broker, appeared in Municipal Court in Westminster for 
a pretrial hearing Friday. But the case was continued until Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work out a disposition for both sides," Phillips said, adding 
that Griffith "cares for the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the videotape shows the dog, with its mouth taped shut, being 
beaten with a wooden-handled garden tool in the back yard of Griffith's house 
on La Carta Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did some of those acts -- but the motivation behind the acts that led to 
what they're calling cruelty to an animal is the question," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips added that the dog's mouth was taped closed because she had just 
"nipped" Griffith's daughter, and he was trying to discipline the dog so it 
wouldn't nip him too. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips contended that because the dog was not physically injured, Griffith, 
who is married and the father of four young children, should not face animal 
cruelty charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog was neither maimed, mutilated, wounded or tortured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks disagreed, saying that "given the nature of the case and the facts of 
the case, I'm not interested in making a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Dann Bean said the dog has been temporarily placed 
with a Garden Grove family, where it is doing "very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog was taken to the county animal control shelter the day after 
Griffith's arrest. Police received a flood of calls from angry dog lovers that 
prompted authorities to remove it from Griffith's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said that while the dog was at the county shelter it lost weight and was 
distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the dog will live permanently will depend on the outcome of the case.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY TO BILL PROPERTY OWNERS FOR CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to recover money spent clearing lots after the October firestorm, the 
city will place special assessments on the property tax bills of lot owners who 
have not sought reimbursement from their insurance companies on the city's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 While vowing to "bend over backward" to cooperate with the fire victims, the 
City Council voted unanimously Thursday to insist that property owners help 
shoulder the financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 30, the city was out more than $400,000 it spent to clear hazardous 
waste from the burned lots and later to remove other debris. Since then, more 
residents have paid. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lot owners' insurance companies reimburse them between now and 
December, Deputy City Manager Cindy King said the property owner can simply pay 
the special assessment when it comes due. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment would become a lien on the lot owner's property only if it is 
not paid with the normal property tax bill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has taken steps to cooperate with the residents on this issue, but 
the reimbursement has caused some confusion partly because the city first 
intended to bill the insurance companies itself but then learned the bills had 
to be submitted by the property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The city waived the fee for people who were uninsured. In those cases, the 
city hopes to get reimbursed from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA 
will not reimburse the city without proof that the property owner is uninsured 
or that full reimbursement was not received. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, the city hired workers to clear hazardous waste 
from the lots and billed property owners $612 per lot for the work. The city 
then offered fire victims the option of clearing the remaining debris from 
their properties or having the city do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people chose to let the city do the work. The cost to residents was 
$2,000 to $4,000, depending on the size of their lot and the difficulty of 
clearing it, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 King said she sent notices to 282 people telling them they owed the city for 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen fire victims addressed the council at Thursday's meeting. Most 
protested the $612 charge for hazardous waste cleanup. Some complained at being 
charged a flat rate when they felt they had little or no hazardous waste on 
their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This $612 just blows me away," John Rattelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattelman said he was frustrated that he would be expected to pay as much as 
residents with much larger lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank said the charges were justified, whether or not the lot owner had 
hazardous materials -- such as paint, asbestos oil or propane -- on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still had to go through the rubble and take a look to see if there was 
hazardous material," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to help residents work with their insurance companies 
and to mail them another notice advising them of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to bend over backward and explain things to people," 
Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MORE HEARINGS SET ON CIGARETTE BAN 
</P>

 The City Council has postponed a vote on an ordinance that would ban cigarette 
vending machines in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a half-hour discussion this week, council members decided to hold 
another public hearing Aug. 2 to solicit ideas from the community and business 
people who may be affected by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have the ability to get cigarettes away from children," said 
Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater, who supports the ordinance. He said vending 
machines offer unrestricted access to teen-agers who often become addicted to 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked it up as a young man and it took me 15 years to get rid of it," 
Broadwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Frank Kessler said the ordinance is another intrusion into the 
privacy of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a little tired of government sticking its nose in everything on 
the basis it's good for my health," said Kessler, who smokes. "I want big 
government to get out of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes suggested a less-restrictive ordinance that would limit 
cigarette vending machines to bars and nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as tobacco use is legal, people have some rights," Leyes said. He 
could support an ordinance prohibiting cigarette vending machines in public 
places easily accessible to children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point and Laguna Beach have banned 
cigarette vending machines. In Santa Ana, they are allowed only in bars and 
nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Traktman, executive director of the Garden Grove Chamber of Commerce, 
said that the city should not impose a total ban on cigarette machines, but 
allow them "where alcohol is exclusively sold. People who drink (alcohol) 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. John Shaw said the city can ban cigarette machines, citing a 1993 
court ruling upholding an ordinance passed by the city of Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw said the Westminster ordinance could become useless if a state 
initiative sponsored by the tobacco industry passes in the November ballot. The 
initiative would eliminate the power of local governments to regulate the sale 
of tobacco products. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; JUDGE OKS SPECIAL ELECTION IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special election will be held Oct. 18 to replace three city officials who 
were recalled last month, an Orange County Superior Court judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Donald E. Smallwood sided with the Fullerton Recalls Committee, which 
sued City Clerk Anne M. York and the city, seeking a special election in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 York had combined the special recall election with the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the clerk is obligated to perform her ministerial duties," 
Smallwood ruled. He said that once the canvass of votes of the June 7 recall 
election was completed by the county registrar of voters in mid-June, York 
should have immediately called for the special election instead of waiting 
until July 5 to set the election. 
</P>
<P>
 York declined comment, directing questions to City Attorney R. K. (Kerry) Fox, 
who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip D. Kohn, the attorney representing York and the city, argued that the 
canvassing of the votes was not complete until York legally certified the 
results at the July 5 City Council meeting. By doing so, York made a special 
election in October impossible because the election must be held 114 to 129 
days after the day the results are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood ruled that York should have certified the results in June so that 
the special election would not be consolidated with the general election. He 
said, "The legislative purpose here is to enable the electorate to have an 
election as soon as possible to replace officers who have been recalled." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn also argued that an October special election would be a waste of 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smallwood, in ruling from the bench, said, "I think that one has to assume 
that the electorate had in its mind that there might very well be some 
expenditures, even though (the special election) would be relatively close to 
the November election." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Kohn could seek a stay on his order, which included a suggestion that 
the filing period for the Oct. 18 special election be open from July 26 to Aug. 
11. Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don 
Bankhead were recalled and cannot run in the special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn said he would discuss filing an appeal with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 committee members left Smallwood's courtroom happy with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled," said Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the recalls committee. 
"We're ready for a special election and if the city gets a stay, then we'll 
petition the court to have the stay lifted." MIMI KO

STADIUM FUNDING PROSPECTS FAIL TO GET GLOWING REPORT; FINANCING: BONDS WOULD 
PAY FOR ONLY A THIRD OF THE $188 MILLION NEEDED FOR A NEW RAMS FACILITY IN 
ANAHEIM, CONSULTANT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Local political and business leaders struggling to keep the Los Angeles Rams 
in Orange County are downplaying a consultant's report that could further dim 
prospects of retaining the team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report by Public Financial Management in Newport Beach for 
county supervisors, public financing could pay for just one-third of a new 
football-only stadium in Anaheim. Bonds could muster only $60 million of the 
estimated $188 million needed, and it is improbable that private sources could 
make up the difference, according to the May report, which was released this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question it would take a major private commitment to achieve new 
funding on a stadium, but that doesn't mean it's impossible," said Newport 
Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of Save the Rams. "A 
public/private partnership financing plan could still achieve the necessary 
economics." 
</P>
<P>
 Made up of about 45 local political and business leaders, Save the Rams 
expects to unveil a final Rams proposal at the team's annual booster luncheon 
Aug. 19. Until then, it's "premature to judge our ultimate package," Steinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier this week, the group shifted its focus from proposing a 
football-only stadium to an ambitious remodeling of the 28-year-old Anaheim 
Stadium. The group discussed using $50 million to $70 million in public funding 
to renovate the stadium. That proposal also would call for a public and 
privately funded new baseball stadium nearby for the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know John Shaw and the Rams want a new stadium," said Orange County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner, a member of a subcommittee looking at new 
stadium possibilities. "But the (remodeling) would be much more than just a 
face lift." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Shaw, the Rams executive vice president, expressed disappointment 
with the remodeling proposal, saying it would not generate fan excitement the 
way a new stadium would. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, Baltimore and Hartford, Conn., have offered the Rams football-only 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams executives expect to announce a decision in September about their future 
in Orange County.

<P>
 Board of Education President Sal Mendoza, 36, and plumbing contractor John M. 
Raya, 41, have taken out papers to run for mayor in Santa Ana's November 
election, joining two others who did so when election season opened this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential candidates must return the nomination papers to the City Clerk's 
office by Aug. 12 with the signatures of at least 20 residents to officially 
enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven people so far have taken out nominating papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also announced as mayoral candidates are businessman and Mayor Pro Tem Miguel 
A. Pulido Jr., 38, and Arthur A. Castro, a 24-year-old sales representative who 
made a last-minute decision to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood activist Alberta Christy, 49, and Tony Espinosa, 26, a deputy 
probation counselor, have said they intend to run for the seat that Pulido will 
vacate on the seven-member City Council. Christy, a banking officer who has 
waged a campaign to close a nude dancing establishment in the city, and 
Espinosa have taken out nominating papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Patricia A. McGuigan is running to retain her seat against three 
potential candidates: real estate consultant Sean Mill, 27; U.S. Postal Service 
worker George F. da Corte, 57, and Henry Drew, a 36-year-old planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert L. Richardson is running unopposed to retain his council 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have announced their intention to run for office in November but have 
not yet pulled nominating papers. They include Randell Young, a businessman and 
musician who has declared his candidacy for mayor, and former City Councilman 
John Acosta.

NOTEBOOK LANDS ATTORNEY IN HOT SEAT; PROBE: NEWPORT BEACH POLICE SAY HE MAY 
HAVE MISLED THEM WHEN HE RETRIEVED ITEM FOUND IN TRUCK STOLEN FROM O.J. 
SIMPSON'S GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The notebook could have been John Stewart's slice of the O.J. Simpson drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it has mired the Orange lawyer in his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach police said Friday that they are investigating whether Stewart 
misled them when he retrieved a notebook reportedly found in the stolen truck 
belonging to O.J. Simpson's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The white, ruled notebook was among the items police impounded from Paula 
Barbieri's stolen Toyota truck on Jan. 31 after the arrest of William Wasz, 31, 
of North Hollywood. Wasz pleaded guilty to armed robbery and theft and was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all before the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson publicity made Wasz remember the notebook -- which news reports 
have said includes a log of Nicole Brown Simpson's schedule last winter -- and 
consider its news value, Stewart said. Wasz hired Stewart this month to help 
sell his story to the world -- for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Stewart's first acts was to retrieve his new client's belongings from 
the police on July 12. There, along with a bagful of clothing, was a notebook. 
Wasz identified it the next day as the one he remembered, and Stewart handed it 
over to Los Angeles police on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Beach police said they would have kept the notebook as evidence if 
Stewart had told them about a possible link to the Simpson case. A spokesman 
also said Stewart had no right to retrieve Wasz's belongings, since he was not 
the defense attorney during the robbery case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had that knowledge and never said anything," said Newport Beach Police 
Sgt. Andy Gonis. "He misled us when he stated he was the attorney of record and 
when he claimed to be retrieving his client's personal belongings." 
</P>
<P>
 And police said Stewart tried to sell the notebook's contents to the media 
before handing it over to Los Angeles investigators -- a charge the lawyer 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said the investigation could result in criminal charges against Stewart 
or in a complaint to the State Bar of California, which reviews attorney 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe at the very least his conduct was inappropriate," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he was acting as Wasz's attorney when he picked up the 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he gave the notebook to authorities as soon as he determined its 
possible link to the Simpson murder case. While he acknowledged copying the 
notebook, Stewart denied trying to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never tried to sell the notebook," Stewart said Friday. "But I was trying 
to see if there was value to the story." 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to say what was in the note pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting," he said. "If it's legit, it's interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart is no stranger to controversy. A Christian activist who once hosted a 
religious radio talk show, he helped represent Jessica Hahn, a former church 
secretary who accused televangelist Jim Bakker of coercing her into having sex 
with him, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Stewart said he and Wasz, who is currently living at the Orange 
County Jail, have decided to give up selling Wasz's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, this is too aggravating and not worth it," Stewart said. "Time 
for me to move on and get back to my law practice and get out from in front of 
the cameras."

2 EX-FRIENDS, BOXING PROMOTERS BEGIN LEGAL SKIRMISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two boxing promoters who had been friends and business partners are duking it 
out in a legal battle that could cost one of them more than $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 James Browning filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court this week 
against Ted Luckow, who Browning claims damaged his reputation and thwarted 
future business ventures by sending what he alleges was a libelous letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning says Luckow wrote the letter to the Nevada Athletic Commission, 
urging the agency not to issue Browning a boxing license in the state. He is 
asking for $11 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June 21 letter, Luckow alleged that Browning accepted monetary bribes 
from fighters' managers. He also alleged that Browning, his former partner in 
Brown Kow Promotions, used the business's account to get free merchandise from 
advertisers after he no longer worked for the company. Further, Luckow told 
Nevada officials in the letter, Browning ruined a relationship Luckow had with 
a longtime sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been personal differences between us, but they have been put 
aside," Luckow wrote. "I feel the state athletic commission has a right to know 
the character of this man." 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of Luckow's handwritten letter to the Nevada commission was included in 
Browning's lawsuit. The dispute between the Newport Beach men began after 
Luckow hired Browning to promote a boxing show at the Irvine Marriott in 1992. 
Their business relationship ended about 1 1/2 years later. During that time, 
Luckow claims in the letter, Browning "managed to destroy all credibility of 
the promotion of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckow, who owns a boxing show at the Irvine Marriott called "Ballroom 
Battle," declined to comment except to say that the two men had once been good 
friends. Attorneys for both sides did not return calls and Browning could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Browning claims that he asked Luckow for a retraction but that 
Luckow "ignored" that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckow said this week that he had not ignored the request, but had "personal 
problems" to deal with first. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning is suing Luckow for $1 million for "loss of reputation, shame, 
mortification and hurt feelings" and $10 million for possible jobs lost due to 
the letter and other expenses incurred during the suit.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER WORKS OUT WITHOUT A NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' battle cry this year: "If Chris Miller stays healthy . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the quarterback hired to replace Jim Everett, ran through two training 
camp practices Friday at UC Irvine without wearing a brace on the left knee 
that has required surgery twice in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels so good right now; it feels normal," Miller said. "We don't even 
need to talk about it. I don't know too many guys who aren't getting hurt in 
the NFL. It's not like I'm the only extreme out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably put the brace on when we go in full gear only for the fact that 
if someone were to roll into me. Sure, I'm hoping to stay healthy, and if I can 
great things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox, who watched Everett fling footballs all over the place a 
year ago, was impressed with Miller's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miller put on quite an exhibition," Knox said. "That was impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd expect an injury-prone Miller to be packing a rabbit's foot, but no, he 
wears No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback T.J. Rubley wears No. 12, Miller's number while in Atlanta, and 
Miller said he wasn't about to buy the numeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this is a fresh start, a new number," Miller said. "Hell, I'll try 
13. It's supposed to be unlucky, but I'll make it lucky." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Shane Conlan Award for being the first player to come up injured on the 
opening day of training camp goes to cornerback Steve Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, who has been promoted to starting right cornerback, lasted about 35 
minutes before removing himself with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan, who injured his knee on the first day of practice a year ago, was 
still standing at last glance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed veteran Darryl Ashmore, who is projected to start at right 
tackle, and released tight end Bob Brasher. The team also placed wide receiver 
Todd Kinchen on the physically unable to perform list. T.J. SIMERS

RAMS, GANDY REACH ACCORD ON CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams said Friday night they have reached an agreement on a five-year 
contract with Wayne Gandy, their first-round draft choice who is projected to 
start at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a deal," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president. "We are 
going to meet with them (today) to finalize the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy, a 6-4, 290-pound selection from Auburn, arrived Friday in Orange County 
as a gesture of good faith and will be ready to join two-a-day practices at UC 
Irvine on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we came here for; I'm just glad to get it done," said Gandy, who 
will receive a $2 million signing bonus as part of the deal. "I definitely 
believe I can be the starting left tackle. It just takes patience, confidence 
and keeping your composure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had Clarence Jones at left tackle to open training camp, a free agent 
who had not started a game in three years with the Giants. Irv Eatman, who 
started for the Rams a year ago on the left side, did not receive a contract 
offer from the team and subsequently signed with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The good health of quarterback Chris Miller, who has had two operations on his 
left knee, might well rely on the effectiveness of the team's left tackle. 
Coach Chuck Knox has said left tackle might be the most difficult position for 
a rookie to learn, and historically rookie left tackles have not fared well.  
</P>
<P>
 Gandy chose to bypass June conditioning drills at Rams Park because of 
contract negotiations. His absence Friday had become a considerable concern for 
Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 The team offered Gandy $5.13 million earlier Friday, an increase from previous 
proposals. The Rams were so eager to land Gandy that they offered to pay him 
more than tackle Bernard Williams, whom Philadelphia selected just ahead of 
Gandy.  
</P>
<P>
 Gandy's agent, Neil Schwartz, initially rejected the Rams' proposal because 
under the present collective bargaining agreement a five-year contract would 
allow the Rams to maintain Gandy's rights for a sixth season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money isn't the problem and we told the Rams not to come up with more 
money," Schwartz said. "It's the length of the deal. We're interested in four 
years or a fifth year with the Rams agreeing to make him an unrestricted free 
agent (at the expiration of his contract)." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, however, said he reserved the right to consult with his client, and 
after further discussions with Zygmunt, the two sides apparently came to an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have," Zygmunt said, "but it's been a crazy one, I'll tell you 
that."

LORRAINE START FINISHED EARLY; YANKEES HIT THREE HOMERS, CHASE EX-HART PITCHER 
IN FIFTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, it was a start. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lorraine has it under his belt once and for all. He can exhale now and 
go from here. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was a start, Lorraine's first in the major leagues, and if not for 
those crippling home runs and that pesky Wade Boggs, it might have turned out 
better for both Lorraine and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, the former Hart High and Stanford left-hander lasted 4 2/3 innings, 
allowing the first seven runs in the Angels' 12-3 loss to the New York Yankees 
before 34,750 Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Williams led off the game with a home run and Mike Stanley hit a 
two-run homer in the second inning. Stanley, the Yankees' designated hitter 
against left-handed pitching, homered again in the fifth, ending Lorraine's 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The balls were out over the plate," said Lorraine, alternating between sips 
of beer and spoonfuls of frozen yogurt. "All the balls hit out were up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was a start, and not Lorraine's last, that from Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann, who said the 21-year-old rookie will get at least "a few" starts, 
Friday's outcome notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a start, and that's all it was, although Lorraine probably couldn't be 
convinced today, his one-year anniversary of signing with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate and fellow left-handed pitcher Chuck Finley might offer some counsel: 
This game will become a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really remember my first start," said Finley, an eight-year veteran. 
"I think it came when we traded John Candelaria, but I can't tell you how it 
turned out." 
</P>
<P>
 Should Lorraine opt to focus on something positive, he'll recall a pivotal 
at-bat in the third inning. Two walks helped load the bases with two out, 
bringing up Don Mattingly, whom Lorraine walked on four pitches the previous 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine struck him out looking with a 2-and-2 pitch on the inside corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a plus," Lorraine said. "After I walked the bases loaded, I had to 
make good pitches and I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth inning provided another key moment. A two-out double by Williams 
put runners on second and third and brought up Boggs, who already was two for 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 This at-bat did not go Lorraine's way, although the ball did. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs hit a bullet through the box into center field to score both runners and 
give the Yankees a 5-0 lead. Stanley's second homer came an inning later, and 
that was it for Lorraine. He struck out four and walked four, allowing eight 
hits. All seven runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got ahead of a lot of guys 0-2, 1-2, but then I'd go full count and get 
hit," Lorraine said. "I really thought that if I threw as well as I'm capable 
of, I'd pitch well. But I just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine gave up five runs -- four earned -- and nine hits in his three-inning 
major league debut Sunday, a relief appearance against the Baltimore Orioles. 
Seventeen hits and 11 earned runs in 7 2/3 innings might indicate Lorraine has 
been rushed to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he had only six starts in Class A last season after signing. Sure, 
he was 9-3 with a 3.24 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver this season 
before being called up a week ago, but he's had a grand total of 23 minor 
league starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago it would have been a risk to bring him up so fast," said Angel 
reliever Bob Patterson. "But the way baseball has changed, just look around. 
There aren't enough good pitchers in the game. They aren't going to give up on 
you in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' 5.31 team ERA (before Friday's game) is evidence of the absence of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann insists it is more than wishful thinking that has him giving the 
ball to Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an intelligent kid, he has a good idea of what's going on," he said. "He 
comes from a good college program, that's why he's been able to move up as 
quickly as he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine's biggest believers were in attendance Friday. They would be Mom and 
Dad, who live in Valencia. To them, it's only been the blink of an eye since 
their son was pitching at Hart, where he was The Times' Valley pitcher of the 
year in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the scout who signed him said it would take two or three years to get to 
the major leagues, but he is so successful at everything he's touched," said 
Marlene Lorraine, who proudly pointed out that her son passed his final classes 
while attending spring training this year and graduated from Stanford in June.  
</P>
<P>
 "I get so emotional and he is so intelligent about it," she said. "He tells me 
that winning and losing is not as important as whether he pitched well, whether 
he hit his spots. It's almost like he's the parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Someday soon, maybe Lorraine will be able to offer his mother some perspective 
about this disappointing night, a night that, after all, was only a start.

AFTER GORY START, GORE SHOOTS 69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Gore was dripping with sweat. His statement was dripping with double 
entendre. 
</P>
<P>
 After he completed the first of two rounds Friday in the 95th Southern 
California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship at Hacienda Golf Club, he ducked 
into the locker room. "Have to change my shirt," he said. "I stink." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was pretty much his assessment of his play to that point. He slapped on 
some fresh deodorant, washed his face and cleaned up his act. Presto, 
change-oh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's morning round of three-over-par 73 may not have smelled like a rose 
garden, but his afternoon 69 left him primed for a shot at the leaders with two 
rounds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, 20, a Hart High graduate who plays at Arizona, is one of four area 
players in the top eight at the halfway point of the 72-hole event, which ends 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three area players, Don Baker of Canoga Park, Charlie Wi of North Hills and 
Chad Wright of Ventura are tied for fourth at 141, three shots behind 
18-year-old leader Tiger Woods of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The four were among a group of 10 players from the region who made the 46-man 
cut at 152. Play begins this morning at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, two-time Pacific 10 Conference champion, put together three birdies over 
the final six holes in the afternoon to charge into contention. He is tied for 
seventh and trails Woods, who shot 68-70 -- 138, by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore missed two birdie putts from two feet in the morning, then undressed 
himself before starting anew. "I was almost gonna take a shower," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 It rained birdies for Wright, an 18-year-old sophomore from Buena High and 
USC. He had six birdies during a morning 69, but added four three-putt greens 
for equal balance. He had three more birdies during an afternoon 72, which 
meant he birdied one-fourth of the holes he played. "A roller coaster," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those following Baker, 43, didn't need any such seat belt. A former PGA Tour 
pro who played at USC, Baker put together a solid round, despite making a bogey 
on two of the last three holes for an afternoon 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real consistent, especially in the morning," he said. "I had a lot of 
pars, a lot of fairways and a lot of greens." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker had one troublesome hole down the stretch. On the par-three 16th, his 
tee shot landed in a greenside bunker. He left his first shot in the bunker, 
then scrambled to save bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to hit it sideways," Baker said of his initial sand attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, Wi and Wright will tee off in the same threesome today at 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ladin of Westlake Village, 61, the oldest player in the field, shot 149 
to make the cut with ease, but missed four putts inside two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tickled pink just to have made the cut," said Ladin, the 1993 State 
Senior Amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin and Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth, playing in the same threesome, found 
their Waterloo on the par-five 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 They started the day on No. 10, a tricky 520-yarder. Forsyth, a Cal State 
Northridge product, promptly hit two tee shots out of bounds and took a 10. He 
shot 83-72 and missed the cut by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, Ladin four-putted No. 10 for a double bogey en route to a 
76. He missed twice from two feet on the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, 22, also stumbled on No. 10 in the afternoon, nearly blasting a greenside 
sand shot out of bounds before saving bogey. After a solid 69 in the morning, 
Wi was three over midway through his afternoon round before he caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a senior at California, knocked the ball to within 18 inches on the 14th 
and 15th holes for birdies and finished at 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi produced a spectacular run during a 69 in the morning round when he 
finished the front nine birdie-eagle-bogey-birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Bell of Studio City, another former Trojan, shot 71-73 to land in a 
three-way tie for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tingus of Calabasas was near the lead after a 71, but shot 79 in the 
afternoon. He is in a five-way tie for 29th that includes Dave Sheff of Oakmont 
Country Club in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Kinsel of Glendale (74-77 -- 151) and James Camaione (73-79 -- 152), a 
member of the Crystalaire Country Club in the Antelope Valley, also made the 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who missed the cut were Mike Turner of Woodland Hills and Lawrence 
O'Neil of Camarillo at 155, and Jim Tassano of Camarillo and Steve Holmes of 
Newbury Park at 156. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Leonard of Encino had a 73 in the morning, but skidded to an 81 and 
missed by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sang Hyun of Glendale, Rob Campbell of Simi Valley, Stephen Cutts of Westlake 
Village and Cameron Gray of Camarillo each finished at 162. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Schlender, the state junior college champion from Ventura College, shot 
87-80 -- 167.

BAD INTENTIONS AT GOODWILL GAMES; WHITAKER PLANS TO CONTINUE ASSAULT ON AMATEUR 
BOXING'S HEAVYWEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lance Whitaker has finished his morning run and is lying on a bed in a hotel 
room in St. Petersburg, Russia. The blissful hum of Sade buzzes from his 
portable stereo earphones and her soulful blues have once again served as a 
sedative. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhythmic melodies have had a tranquilizing effect on Whitaker and not even 
a call from an unfamiliar reporter thousands of miles away can jar his peaceful 
demeanor. His tone is low and deep, his delivery slow and smooth like an R&B 
late-night disc jockey who woos listeners into total relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be fooled by this Northridge resident's laid-back persona. He admits 
to a split personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get in the ring, it's a totally different story. Some people say I'm 
too nice," said Whitaker, chuckling softly at the thought. ". . . because I'm 
so mellow. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, once I get in the ring, it's business. I'm gonna take care of you before 
you take care of me," he said, punctuating his statement with another soft 
giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Whitaker, at 6 foot 8, 235 pounds, has taken care of dozens of 
fighters in his short but illustrious two-year career as a super heavyweight 
boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lost only three of 31 amateur bouts and his climb to national 
prominence has been rapid. After his first 10 bouts, Whitaker was the 
California Golden Gloves super heavyweight champion. Five bouts later, he was 
the 1993 national Golden Gloves champion. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the U.S. Amateur Boxing Championships in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 
March, and is currently the country's top-ranked amateur super heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be ranked No. 1 in the world," he said in a near whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, 23, a former football and basketball standout at San Fernando High, 
dreams of boxing in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. That dream is coming closer 
to fulfillment with each powerful jab, uppercut and left hook he lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker has been in St. Petersburg for nearly a week, training and awaiting 
competition in the Goodwill Games and his first international fight outside the 
United States. He will fight Tuesday. Once Whitaker gets accustomed to the 
Russian experience, it should be business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is different," said Whitaker, almost reluctantly. "It's a whole 
different world here. The food is different, the hotel is different, the bed is 
different. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker traded in his football and basketball potential years ago for a pair 
of boxing gloves and has worked diligently at making a name for himself in a 
sport he knew nothing about as a teen-ager. His quick development, however, has 
surprised even his trainer, Charles (Blue) Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a combination of a couple of things," Allen said. "I think it's 
his size and strength, his aggression. And this is something he wants to do. He 
trains hard every day because he wants to be champion of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker's long hit list is no secret in boxing circles. Allen frequently 
receives bids from agents hoping to sign Whitaker to a professional contract. 
Allen's answer is always the same: All in good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of offers from all over the world," Allen said. "I get phone 
calls from all over. I take the cards that are sent or given to me and throw 
them right in the trash. I don't want to mix (Whitaker's) mind up. He' ready 
for the pros (now), but it's a strategy thing to get to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Whitaker: "Money and all that stuff will come. I'm going in the right 
direction and everything is looking good." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker is ahead of Allen's timetable. He has beaten fighters who have more 
than 200 bouts in their careers. Despite his lack of experience in the sport, 
Whitaker looks nothing like a novice. 
</P>
<P>
 He has the broad-shouldered, slim-waisted physique of Ken Norton -- only 
Whitaker is four inches taller than the former World Boxing Council champion. 
</P>
<P>
 If he has a weakness, it's his tendency to pay little attention to where he is 
in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to get in the corner and just sit there and punch," Whitaker said. 
"But I know what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to throw a lot of straight 
punches and stay off the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker will be getting his boxing instruction and training tips from Allen 
via telephone this week. The U.S. Boxing Committee sends its own trainers for 
international bouts, so Allen stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to throw a lot of straight punches, do a little moving and to 
fight with his brains," Allen said. "These guys will run from him. They'll hit 
and run. He can't let them do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's absence weighs on Whitaker, who lost the first two bouts Allen did not 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you worry and wish you were there," Allen said. "It's like a 
father-and-son thing, you know. He knows my voice and (other voices) don't 
click with him, so it sounds foreign to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker received plenty of instruction from Allen before he left, however, 
and Allen is confident his protege will come back with a gold medal. Ditto for 
Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what I'm supposed to do," Whitaker said. "I'm supposed to do my best."

WHITE SAYS BEING CUT BY RAMS WAS ANTICIPATED AND PAINLESS; FOOTBALL: FORMER 
CRESPI AND CAL ALL-AMERICAN WAITS BY THE PHONE FOR A CHANCE WITH ANOTHER NFL 
TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After being cut by the Rams, all Russell White can do is wait by the phone for 
a call from his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Crespi High running back and All-American at California entered 
camp Thursday at UC Irvine for the start of his second year with the team but 
was greeted with a pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of saw it coming in the last two weeks," White said. "They never 
really gave me an opportunity. Just look at how many plays I got to play in 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 White ran twice for 10 yards and finished the season on the practice 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams selected him in the third round of last year's draft and gave him a 
three-year, $830,000 contract and a $205,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be on waivers until noon today, which means his Rams contract will be 
honored by any team that picks him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not we'll just search for another team," said White's agent, Angelo 
Wright. "They could have traded him but they asked him to stay there. I guess 
as long as Chuck Knox is the coach there he will implement a fullback-based 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 White's inability to control his weight, play special teams or catch the ball 
on short passing routes soured the Ram coaching staff's opinion of him last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, his weight was a problem," said Ram offensive coordinator Chick 
Harris. "But no one worked harder than Russell to take that weight off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to a situation of numbers. We have a lot of good backs here. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 White, 23, says he trained hard in the off-season and is in top shape. He 
figured with an abundance of running backs on the team, someone had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Jerome Bettis, the NFL rookie of the year in 1993, the Rams 
have veteran Cleveland Gary, who has signed a two-year, $1-million contract, 
and recently signed free agent Johnny Bailey to a one-year deal. The Rams also 
drafted Auburn's James Bostic in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done everything they have asked me to do," White said. "I worked out and 
did what they said. I went out at 216 (pounds) and I came in at 208. I just 
think the timing isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 "(I'll) just sit and wait and see who picks me up," he said. "That's all I can 
do. It's just like being in the draft again. I'm not disappointed and I'm not 
upset or hurt. I just want to get a job and go wherever I can get one." 
</P>
<P>
 White joined the Rams last year as Cal's all-time leading rusher with 3,246 
yards. He scored 34 touchdowns and was the first player in school history to 
rush for 1,000 yards three different seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In three seasons at Crespi, White became one of California's greatest high 
school backs. He rushed for 5,998 yards, then a Southern Section record. His 
568 points are a section record and he scored 94 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, he led Crespi to a section championship.

SOUTH ARMED FOR BATTLE IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running backs Tyrone Crenshaw and George Keiaho might not get a chance to 
carry the ball as much as they are accustomed to at the 43rd Shrine all-star 
football game tonight at 7 at Citrus College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are powerful running backs headed to NCAA Division I colleges and are 
used to carrying an offense virtually by themselves. But they might be 
frustrated after tonight's game. South Coach Tom Hoak has promised a wide-open 
game with plenty of passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Campbell, 6 foot 7, 220 pounds, from Norco High is expected 
to start. He completed 55% of his passes for 1,674 yards and 21 touchdowns as a 
senior. Mike Good, 6-0, 200, from Los Alamitos is his backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an all-star game, the guys that had better be the stars are our two 
quarterbacks," Hoak said. "We're going to throw the ball more than in a normal 
high school game, so you want your quarterbacks to be the ones who win all the 
MVP trophies." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Romero from L.A. Baptist will be one of their targets. The 5-foot-11, 
175-pound wide receiver caught 87 passes for 1,568 yards and 15 touchdowns last 
season. He will attend Arizona in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing chores will be shared by the South's five running backs, Hoak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to say we're going to take one running back and have him 
carry the ball 30 times," said Hoak, who led Eisenhower to an unbeaten season 
and a No. 2 national ranking last season. "We're going to be changing in a lot 
of positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho, a 5-foot-9, 205-pound fullback from Buena High, ran for 6,585 yards in 
his career, second best in state history. The Washington-bound back gained 
2,249 yards as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, 5-10, 185, ran for 1,785 yards and 24 touchdowns as a senior at 
Sylmar High and is a two-time City Section 4-A Division player of the year. He 
will attend Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Other South team area players are tight end John McLaughlin of Hart, defensive 
end Willie Perryman of Burbank, offensive tackle David Pratchard of Canyon and 
linebacker Keith Schiele of Antelope Valley. Best of the Bunch 
</P>
<P>
 * What: The 43rd Shrine all-star football game. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets: $5 at the gate. $2 for students with an ID.

ELSTER GIVES REALITY BASEBALL ANOTHER TRY; ROLE PLAYER: FORMER MET SHORTSTOP 
RETURNS TO MAJORS WITH YANKEES AFTER LANDING A PART IN A SPORTS MOVIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The only big league experience Kevin Elster expected to have this summer was 
on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Up there, he would be Pat Corning, the somewhat surly veteran in the movie 
"Little Big League," a fantasy about a kid who manages the Minnesota Twins. For 
Elster, whose career with the New York Mets ended after a shoulder injury in 
1992, it was about as close to baseball as he wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 After two surgeries and two comeback attempts, enough was enough. Nothing was 
going to drag him back onto the field. Nothing. It was Hollywood or bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, I'm not one of those people that's in love with the 
game," Elster said. "I don't want baseball to consume me." 
</P>
<P>
 Out at Anaheim Stadium this week, Elster was being consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 He took infield practice as a member of the New York Yankees. He was working 
his arm into shape, getting ready to come off the disabled list. He may not 
love baseball, but he can't seem to leave it. Not just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Elster is giving it one more shot, putting the fledgling acting career on 
hold. It wasn't fame or fortune that dragged him back . . . well, it wasn't 
fame anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was the money," Elster said, smiling. "No, really I want to get a 
World Series ring from the other side of town. I think Yogi Berra is the only 
one to do that (get World Series rings with the Mets and Yankees.) That would 
be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 And it could happen, even without a Hollywood-type script. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elster, who played at Marina High and Golden West College, joined a Yankee 
team that's battling for first with Baltimore in the American League East. His 
experience and fielding abilities were appealing to Gene Michael, Yankee vice 
president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin has good range and the quickest release I've ever seen," Michael said. 
"If he's healthy, he's one of the best defensive shortstops in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster is working on getting healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 He started seven games after being called up June 30 but went on the disabled 
list because of inflammation in his right shoulder. Michael said the injury is 
unrelated to the one that nearly ended Elster's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Elster, 30, was 0 for 20 at the time. Hitting, though, was never his claim to 
fame. He did, after all, hold the major league record for consecutive errorless 
games by a shortstop, which was later broken by Cal Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elster isn't a one-dimensional player either. He was hitting .256 at 
Albany, a double-A team. He won one game with a grand slam in the 10th inning, 
then came back the next night with a game-winning double, also in the 10th. He 
was nine for his last 19 when the Yankees called him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt he could help this team in many ways," Michael said. "That's why we 
were interested. And we know he's a better hitter than he's shown." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster hasn't had much chance to showcase his abilities the past two years. 
Before this season, he had last played in the major leagues April 12, 1992. But 
the pain in his shoulder wouldn't go away and he went on the disabled list. Two 
surgeries later, the Mets gave up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried comebacks with the Dodgers last season and the San Diego Padres this 
spring. A leg injury prevented Elster from doing much in spring training and he 
was released. 
</P>
<P>
 End of career, he thought. But Elster was hardly crushed. He had other 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be a baseball coach," Elster said. "I've seen baseball 
consume so many people. There is so much else out there in life and I wanted to 
start exploring it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Little Big League," Elster's character doesn't care much for Billy 
Heywood, the 12-year old who has inherited the team from his grandfather and 
made himself manager. Elster did have some minor disagreements with Met Manager 
Jeff Torborg in spring of 1992, but this wasn't wasn't typecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went in to read for the part and I thought it was great," Elster said. 
"They called me back to read again, this time in front of other people, and lo 
and behold I got the part." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was shot last summer in Minnesota. Elster, Brad Lesley, a former 
Cincinnati Red, and Leon Durham, a former Chicago Cub, had roles and also acted 
as technical advisers. Other players, including Ken Griffey Jr., Rafael 
Palmeiro and Randy Johnson made cameos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great luxury to be able to ask an actor to hit a line drive down 
third and have him actually be able to do it," director Andrew Scheinman said 
in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Elster had never considered acting before, but took an immediate liking to it. 
It reminded him of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all entertainment," he said. "Acting is not easy, but when everything 
feels right and you're really into your character, it can be easy. It's just 
like hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can talk forever about what's hard about it. But it's a challenge and it 
has its rewards . . . oh yeah, there's the money and the women." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. Acting just seemed like a natural thing to get into after baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 But baseball wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was Shea Stadium, October 1986. On the field, Met fans are running 
amok having just seen their team win the World Series. Elster and several other 
players returned to the field a half hour after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a couple of bottles of champagne and went out to celebrate with the 
fans," Elster said. "It was good for them and it was good for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster couldn't have asked for a better moment. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in only one game during the series and four games during the 
playoffs against the Houston Astros. But he had a ring and his future was still 
ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really relieved, because I was a young kid and I thought I was going to 
get in there and screw everything up," Elster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elster didn't mess up much during the next five seasons. He was the Mets' 
shortstop from 1988-91. He went a record 88 games without an error in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Elster didn't knock down any fences hitting, but he wasn't a pushover at the 
plate either. He drove in 55 runs in 1989 and 45 the following season. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't know how he hurt his shoulder, possibly during a brawl with the 
Padres. But after six games with the Mets in 1992, he was done. The team didn't 
offer him a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a stud back then," Elster said. "I was a rookie touted to go on and do 
everything. Sometimes those things just don't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 When the two comebacks failed, he had had enough. Then his brother, Pat, 
called Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him we would be interested in Kevin if he would go to our minor league 
facility and do the hard work necessary," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Elster: "I got a nice vacation in Florida out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster signed a minor league contract on May 1 and a spent a month in Tampa. 
He lost weight and gained strength in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 He played 19 games at Albany before being called up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never going to play in the minor leagues again," Elster said. "But the 
Yankees really took care of me. They made it worth my while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view baseball as a business and I go about my business professionally. 
Really, I came back for the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Elster then smiled. On his finger is his 1986 World Championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the prospects of another ring sounded pretty good, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A happy ending Elster would like to help write.

<P>
 So much for seedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North, the 10th-seeded team in the American Legion District 20 baseball 
playoffs, beat Van Nuys East, 15-9, Friday at Burroughs High in Burbank, 
becoming the only unbeaten team left in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seedings don't mean anything," Valley North Coach Pete Redfern said. "As far 
as I'm concerned, it's a 10-team season and you get two losses and it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-seeded team still playing is No. 4 Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North (17-8), which is guaranteed a spot in Sunday's final, will play 
Encino (19-6) at 4 p.m. today at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. Sun Valley 
(17-6-1) plays Van Nuys East (17-6-1) in an elimination game at 1 p.m. at 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit for Valley North's surprising run has to go to first 
baseman Tony Montiel, who had his second consecutive three-hit game Friday. He 
also pitched, recording the final two outs of the game with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing a heck of a job and he came in and shut them down," Redfern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel was three for six with a home run and two runs batted in. On Thursday, 
he was three for four with a home run and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling really confident at the plate now," Montiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel's heroics notwithstanding, Van Nuys East did plenty to lose the game 
on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East's pitchers -- starter Andy Lutz (2-2), Matt Egan, Chris Cross 
and Francisco Dongo -- walked 14 batters and threw seven wild pitches. Van Nuys 
East also made seven errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't walk a good team like Valley North and expect to win," Van Nuys 
East Coach Jody Breeden said. "We didn't play catch either. If we pitch and 
play catch, we win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East didn't execute on offense, either. A potential rally was snuffed 
in the fifth when Jabbar Craigwell was called out on appeal for leaving second 
base early on a fly-ball out. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East loaded the bases with none out in the seventh and scored only 
one run. The team stranded 15 runners, leaving the bases loaded three times. 
</P>
<P>
 All the threats kept Redfern uneasy, even though his team led by at least six 
runs from the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know how to describe that game," Redfern said. "There were 
mistakes on both sides. With a six-run lead in the ninth I still didn't feel 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North spent most of the game taking advantage of mistakes, scoring nine 
runs as a result of errors and wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Evanson (2-0) picked up the victory for Valley North, pitching 5 1/3 
innings and giving up eight runs. Dan Martin, making only his second pitching 
appearance of the season, gave up one run in three innings before yielding to 
Montiel for the final two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Crowley had three hits for Van Nuys East. Dongo, Rich Igou, Wes Klain, 
Allen Jerkens and Lutz each had two hits, contributing to Van Nuys East's 
16-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino 18, Woodland Hills West 7 -- Encino racked up 17 hits while Woodland 
Hills West (17-8) committed 11 errors, giving starter Gret Kmet little chance 
at Birmingham. He was replaced in the fourth inning, as was winning pitcher 
Brad Farlow (5-2), who allowed five runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow, who drove in three runs, was one of three Encino players with three 
hits. John Campanella went three for five and knocked in two runs. Brian 
Luderer was three for four and scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley 4, Newhall-Santa Clarita 3 -- Javier Sanchez's two-out single in 
the seventh inning scored Sam Vizcarra from second base as Sun Valley stayed 
alive at Birmingham. Sanchez pitched a two-hitter and did not allow an earned 
run.

RUSSELL WHITE NOT SURPRISED THE RAMS RELEASED HIM; NFL: THIRD-ROUND PICK FROM 
LAST YEAR WAS DONE IN BY AN ABUNDANCE OF RUNNING BACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russell White says getting cut by the Rams on Thursday was not surprising.  
</P>
<P>
 The former Encino Crespi High running back and California All-American would 
have entered his second season with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was released after reporting to the Rams' training camp at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of saw it coming in the last two weeks," White said. "They never 
really gave me an opportunity. Just look at how many plays I got to play in 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 White rushed two times for 10 yards and was on the team's inactive 
list for the final 10 games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams selected White in the third round of last year's draft and gave him a 
three-year, $830,000 contract, including a $205,000 signing bonus. He would 
have received $205,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Ram official, most contracts are not guaranteed, in which case 
White will receive no more money from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 White wouldn't comment on the matter and his agent, Angelo Wright, could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 White's inability to control his weight, play special teams or catch the ball 
on short passing routes soured the Ram coaching staff's opinion of him last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, his weight was a problem," said Ram offensive coordinator Chick 
Harris, who coached the running backs last season. "But no one worked harder 
than Russell to take that weight off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to a situation of numbers. We have a lot of good backs here -- 
Jerome Bettis, Cleveland Gary, David Lang. And we just drafted James Bostic. 
And we picked up Johnny Bailey, who can help us not only as a return man but 
also in nickel (passing) situations." 
</P>
<P>
 But White says he trained hard in the off-season and came back in top shape. 
He believes the team has an abundance of running backs and someone had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done everything they have asked me to do," White said. "I worked out and 
did what they said. I went out at 216 (pounds) and I came in at 208. I just 
think the timing isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Harris think White has a future in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly," he said. "I think he can go to any tailback-oriented offense and 
make an impact. He just needs the right situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, White, 23, will "just sit and wait and see who picks me up." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I can do," he said. "It's just like being in the draft again. I'm 
not disappointed and I'm not upset or hurt. I just want to get a job and go 
wherever I can get one." 
</P>
<P>
 White is still the Southern Section scoring leader with 568 points. In three 
seasons at Crespi he set a Southern Section rushing record (5,998 yards) that 
has since been broken. He also scored 94 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal, he became the school's first player to rush for 1,000 yards in three 
different seasons. He is the school's career all-time rusher with 3,246 yards 
and 34 touchdowns.

ACCENTS; LETTING SIMPLE IDEAS BLOSSOM IN BOUQUETS; SEEK THE BEST MATERIALS FROM 
YOUR OWN BACK YARD, AND ARRANGE THEM CASUALLY, ADVISES FLORAL DESIGNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you have great ingredients, there's no need to get fancy. That principle, 
true in cooking, also applies to flower arranging, says floral designer Tom 
Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start with materials that are perfectly beautiful, perfectly natural and 
perfectly fresh, and flower arranging is a piece of cake," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The first place to look for those "perfect" materials is your own yard or 
garden, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flower arranging doesn't have to be anything difficult or complicated," says 
Pritchard, who has co-authored a book he hopes takes the fear out and puts the 
fun into amateur flower arranging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four or five garden roses in a crystal vase by themselves is an arrangement. 
So is one flowering branch from a fruit tree. So are a bunch of sweet peas 
stuffed into an enamel pitcher. Or a single wildflower in an old-fashioned 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these hysterical floral arrangements you see are merely attempts to 
disguise mediocre materials. Just like heavy French sauces were originally 
devised to disguise the taste of poor meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard and partner Billy Jarecki are authors of "Madderlake's Trade 
Secrets" (Clarkson Potter, 1994. $40), which is based on their experience as 
co-owners of the Manhattan-based flower shop of the same name.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to coming up with great arrangements, says Pritchard, is 
florist flowers. Like supermarket produce, they are primarily bred to ship well 
and last a long time, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And their stems are always perfectly straight, and their colors perfectly 
uniform. That's why they're boring. Garden flowers have more character and 
personality and are always preferable." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians have no excuse for not using garden flowers in their arrangements 
either, concludes Pritchard, back in Manhattan after a recent book promotion 
stint in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have beautiful plants around you year-around," he says. "But you take 
them for granted because growing them is so easy. You don't realize how much 
material you have for arrangements right in your own yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Madderlake does not use florist foam or frogs in most of its arrangements. 
"When you use an oasis (foam block), you can put any flower anywhere, " says 
Pritchard, "but the results aren't as interesting as when an arrangement occurs 
more naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 So the shop begins mixed floral arrangements by wedging a branch from a tree 
or shrub into a container and allowing the crotches of that branch to provide 
the support system for the remaining flowers. (Choose a piece slightly wider 
than the vase so that pressure against its sides will hold the branch in place, 
suggests Pritchard, and one with a structure complex enough that you have 
plenty of options for flower placement.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The restrictions imposed by the branch create a certain logic," he says. "You 
put in the first flower, spin the vase around a bit, see where you need 
something else, and you just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the most dramatic flowers and work toward the more ephemeral ones, 
Pritchard advises. Select the flowers that you want to spill over the edge of 
the container early in the game, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding flowers that will create a beautiful bottom edge is more difficult 
than finding flowers that will carry the top," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of California's workhouse landscaping plants, the common garden geranium, 
is one of Pritchard's favorites for beginning arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lipstick colors of the flowers -- pink, vermilion, orange, coral -- are 
incredible -- and the foliage is often interesting, too. I don't understand why 
more florists don't use geraniums. We love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandevilla vine is another Southern California garden staple Pritchard likes. 
"Little bits of that amazing hot pink here and there in a mix really livens it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Other common Southern California flowers treasured by Madderlake but generally 
overlooked here as arrangement material are agapanthus, nasturtiums, 
bottlebrush and firethorn. 
</P>
<P>
 If his shop were here instead of New York City, Pritchard might even have 
trouble following his own advice: "Know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't use filler flowers, and we don't add extraneous foliage," says 
Pritchard. "Where other florists would add those things, we leave empty space. 
And the more dramatic shape the flower has, the more space we leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Start with interesting flowers, and you don't need much else, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to recommend the Madderlake approach, says Janelle Wiley, who 
teaches her own version of floral design at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact they're trying to get people to lighten up and take chances," 
says Wiley. "That's what I try to do in all my workshops, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so uptight about expressing creativity. They're afraid they're 
going to do things wrong or won't be as good as their neighbors. So anything 
that encourages people to let go of those fears, I'm all for." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley manages the various color beds at Sherman Gardens in addition to 
teaching floral design classes there. Previously, she ran a floral design 
business out of her home and before that worked for other floral designers. All 
in all, she has 14 years of experience in the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Madderlake, Wiley also prefers to make arrangements without foliage. 
"Roses look especially good that way. All fully open and cut the same length so 
all you see is rose. Nothing looks more romantic," Wiley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Branches from fruit trees are good solo performers, too, she says. "A branch 
with five or six lemons on it looks great in a big ceramic pot." Other citrus, 
apples, pomegranates or persimmons also work well. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley also often uses branches rather than frogs or foam to create the 
framework to hold together her arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have some wonderful things we could use for that purpose right in 
our own gardens -- Indian hawthorn, camellia foliage, azalea foliage, myrtle, 
all the citrus, waxy begonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't want to use a branch, an alternative mechanic (flower holding 
device) is crisscrossing four or five pieces of foliage with strong stems to 
form sort of a mesh." 
</P>
<P>
 As to the flowers themselves, Wiley suggests placing darker flowers in the 
center of the arrangement and lighter ones toward the outside. "Because they 
recede, dark flowers at the center make a bouquet seem larger," she says. She 
also likes to include at least three sizes of flowers and odd numbers of each. 
But, Wiley stresses, these are guidelines, not rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of free-style arrangement is not her sole style, however. Wiley also 
likes arrangements dense with foliage -- a style she calls "English cottage 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, she says, is to create the illusion that you've brought a patch of 
the garden indoors, background foliage, ground cover and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley likes foliage so much, in fact, she sometimes creates arrangements of it 
sans flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foliage in a variety of colors, textures and shapes can be very satisfying 
all by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She does not share Pritchard's aversion to "filler" flowers either. "I think 
they add softness and finish," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley and Pritchard are in full agreement that floral arranging should be fun, 
not fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than therapy once you relax," says Wiley.  
</P>
<P>
 "Be playful," urges Pritchard. "People like it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they both believe the best materials for arrangements are often those 
nearest at hand. "I used to use bougainvillea in bridal bouquets a lot -- 
something I didn't see anyone else do -- but everyone liked," says Wiley. "And 
there are lots of plants like that around us -- things you're so used to 
looking at you don't see anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pritchard: "Open your eyes and look around." Tips to Pump Up Flower Power 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how Madderlake handles flowers before using them in arrangements:  
</P>
<P>
 * Cut flower stems at an angle to maximize the amount of surface open to 
water. Scissors can pinch stems shut; a sharp knife is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scrape the side of the stem for about an inch above the cut to open up more 
surface for water intake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Woodier stems need to be split by making two or three cuts and crosscuts 
with a knife or pruning shears. Also scrape away the bark an inch or two up the 
stem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immerse all stems in water immediately after cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove all damaged and excess foliage, including any that will fall below 
the water level.
