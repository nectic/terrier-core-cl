COLUMN ONE; A DILEMMA OF RACE AND GENDER; THE ISSUES OF BLACK WOMEN HAVE OFTEN 
BEEN OVERLOOKED, BY THEIR COMMUNITIES AND BY SOCIETY AT LARGE. BUT FEMALES OF 
COLOR NOW ARE SEEKING THEIR OWN VOICE.

<P>
 Ask Deborah Mack, one of eight black women sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in a 
small apartment, whether she is a feminist and she peers at you with a glare 
that feels hot enough to sear the paint off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the big deal?" thunders Mack, a divorced anthropologist with two 
children who works at the Field Museum of Natural History here. "I can't figure 
out what all the damn uproar is over. I was raised feeling I was equal to men. 
There's nothing unusual or feminist about that. Not where I come from, at 
least." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amen!" shouts Denise Carrillo, 41-year-old entrepreneur who is married and 
the mother of four. "I was always told I had to be self-sufficient to support 
my children because even if I found a good man, he may die, he may be killed. 
So I have always been kind of freaked out by this whole concept that goes 'Oh, 
if you stay at home . . . you're not a feminist.' That isn't a real issue in my 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 A cacophony of affirmation fills the room. Another meeting of the Colored 
Women's Eating Club is in session. Tonight's topic: Do black feminists help or 
hurt black people, especially black men? 
</P>
<P>
 The question has long reverberated among women in the black community who face 
even more complex decisions than white women in deciding how far and how loudly 
to press demands for equal rights. Many have feared, or been warned, that by 
seeking to better their own lot they may harm black men because the white world 
will permit the success of either black women or black men -- but not both. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, larger, problem is that black people are not dealing with gender 
issues, says Michael Dawson, a University of Chicago political scientist. 
"Sexism and gender issues divide the black community at least as much as 
economic issues and the strategy and tactics of black nationalism," Dawson 
says. "Black unity is not possible without the black community squarely 
addressing these issues and listening to voices that have too often been 
silenced." 
</P>
<P>
 Even among the most outspoken black women, the issue of gender differences 
among black people rarely is placed on the table for candid debate. Never does 
it share equal billing with the plight of black men. If and when the subject 
does arise, it goes only so far, remaining within the safety of groups like the 
Colored Women's Eating Club, an ad hoc private gathering of like-minded black 
women in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse than that, say observers, the silence emboldens some black men to 
believe they can escape responsibility for mistreatment of black women by 
appealing to the need to protect black men and to preserve racial solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some claim that was the strategy initially employed by Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., 
fired last weekend as executive director of the NAACP. Confronted with 
allegations that he agreed to pay Mary E. Stansel, a former aide, $332,000 to 
squelch a threatened sexual discrimination suit, Chavis has argued that "forces 
outside the African American community" were trying to destroy his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 While many men within the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
opposed Chavis' decision to use association money to settle with Stansel, none 
pointed to the issue of gender inequality within the organization, said Lulann 
McGriff, president of the NAACP's San Francisco branch and chair of the 
counseling department at City College of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men were more concerned with the money than how he might have been 
treating a woman," she says. "If you look at (Chavis') top deputies within the 
organization, you'll find they were all men. None of the men understand that 
inside the NAACP, women are the ones who build the stage and the men are the 
ones who dance on it." 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff said that by the time the board had decided to fire Chavis the 
concerns involving employment discrimination that triggered the scandal had 
been subordinated to getting the NAACP's finances in order. "The women in the 
(civil rights) movement are fed up and getting tired of having to sacrifice 
justice for us to preserve solidarity for men who don't respect us," she said, 
noting that some women are preparing to nominate candidates to the NAACP board 
to challenge the group's traditional male domination. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Malveaux, a San Francisco economist and writer, applauds any move by 
black women to claim a larger role in traditionally male-led organizations, be 
it the NAACP or the Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are women silent as men make excuses about (their) . . . poor judgment?" 
she asks. "Our failure to step up to the plate may have placed (the NAACP) in 
disarray. In some ways, our silence is as indefensible as Chavis' poor 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of black people to talk about gender issues, even in private, 
causes a significant segment of African Americans to believe "black feminists 
are dangerous" to the cause of black advancement, says Dawson, the political 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, who is looking into gender relations as a part of his research on 
black political opinions, says he was surprised by a recent national survey of 
1,200 black Americans. In it, 29% felt "black feminist groups just divide the 
black community." And, he said, 20% believed women leaders in the black 
community have "the possibility of undermining the leadership of black men." 
Another finding in his study suggests that less than a majority -- 41% -- of 
black Americans believe the problems of black women are the same as those faced 
by black men. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Dawson was at a loss trying to figure out the meaning of the 
study's findings. "Perhaps the problem is in the semantics of the discussion," 
he says. "I believe black people have skepticism about feminist organizations 
and feel they pose a threat to the cohesion of the black community." 
</P>
<P>
 However, more black women are raising their voices at the risk of being 
accused of betraying the African American community. As Georgetown University 
law professor Emma Coleman Jordan sees it, Anita Faye Hill inspired some black 
women to openly confront gender issues. When Hill, a University of Oklahoma Law 
School professor, accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of 
sexually harassing her while working for him, many black women were emboldened 
by her decision to speak out, says Jordan, who served as one of Hill's 
attorneys during the 1991 hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a turning point for a lot of black women," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Jordan Irvine, a professor of urban education at Emory University in 
Atlanta, says she also noticed a pronounced willingness among black women to 
speak out on gender issues after the Thomas confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Anita Hill thing, the tensions (related to speaking out on sexual 
harassment and sexual discrimination) have been high and remained high," Irvine 
says. "It really exposed the black community in ways it had never been exposed. 
Clearly many black women are not happy with their lives and were saying so." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberle Crenshaw, a UCLA law professor who has written on gender relations 
among black Americans for more than a decade, says more than 1,500 black women 
pooled money to publish an ad in support of Hill and with hopes that it would 
lead to a black feminist organization. Not much has come of their effort as not 
enough black women joined their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were outraged that they were in the minority, a distant minority, among 
black women," Crenshaw says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if black feminists feel they are crying in the wilderness, Crenshaw nods 
agreement. "Yes, but the wilderness is coming to us," she says. "Gender is 
central to the issues we in the black community consider the black agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The perception that the white-led women's movement is ambivalent or hostile to 
the concerns of black people scares many black women away, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no framework for talking about feminism in the black community," 
Crenshaw says. "When we talk about race, we are seen to be talking about black 
men and their concerns. When we talk about gender, we're seeing white women. 
That's why the black feminist voice is a lonely one." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has counted the ranks of black feminists. However, few black faces 
generally are seen among the sea of whites who attend abortion rights rallies 
and women's rights demonstrations. Those black women who tend to become 
involved in white-led feminist causes tend to be younger and better-educated 
than the black population in general -- factors that give them the taint of 
elitism and further strains their links with many in black communities who hold 
traditional views. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Collins, a poet and community activist working for the D.C. Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence in Washington, echoing an opinion voiced by more than 
50 black women across the nation interviewed for this article, says black women 
and white women see very different sides of the feminist coin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of feminists, I think of white women fighting for rights that 
black women already have," Collins says. "I also think of lesbianism and male 
bashing. I know better because I know that's an ignorant way of looking at the 
(white) women's movement. But that's what comes to my mind and that's why I 
back away from the 'feminist' label." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason many black women define themselves as womanist -- a 
counterpart of feminist coined by writer Alice Walker in her book "In Search of 
Our Mother's Garden" to distinguish the set of separate gender issues shared by 
women of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Colored Women's Eating Club, where conversation veers wildly from 
topic to topic but always returns to the personal, Deborah Mack defines 
feminism as "a middle-class, white, mainstream cultural concept." She tells the 
group that taking up the cause of white women is as impractical as her thinking 
she will ever be a part of the white men's team at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just remember I'm a black woman in all of this," she says, recalling for the 
group a conversation she had with her boss during her first week at the museum. 
"So whatever I do here I don't think will ever be a part of the team. This is a 
J-O-B for me and you all do not understand what it is for me to join the team 
because of your own history." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, her boss admitted: " 'You know what, Debbie, you were 
right.' I knew all along I was not invested as a member of their team -- 
unfortunately. That is something that is a hard reality, but most black women 
learn it pretty early on." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Crabble, host of a talk show at a black-owned Chicago radio station, 
agrees. "We embrace concepts of family, of unity, of community and we 
understand that is lacking in their movement," she tells the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was founded four years ago because a dozen friends found it difficult 
to find time to talk with each other amid the pressures of careers, families 
and big-city life. Once a month, the women share potluck meals at a member's 
home. Whatever is said during their meetings is never repeated to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Carrillo says the experience of being so close to black women was "rare 
for me. I didn't learn how to really have friends until the last four years. 
It's been wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 A staple of the group's conversations is how to improve the individual plight 
of black women -- whether losing weight, quitting smoking or raising children 
-- as well as making life better for black people in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hating men is not what we're about," says Deborah Mack.

ANOTHER WHALE OF A FIND IN SOUTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulldozers working on the grounds of St. Timothy's Catholic Church on Friday 
had just rolled over a 5-million-year-old whale skeleton too deteriorated to 
save, when 30 feet from the blade a second giant skeleton appeared.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very surprised to see another one," said Marion Kearin, a geology 
student who works for a paleontologist monitoring construction of a parking 
structure at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement mounted, she said, when it appeared that this fossil skeleton, 
which was buried deeper than the first, was much better preserved in a waxy 
clay layer. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the two whales, both probably about 5 million years old, was 
found Thursday in a hard layer of gypsum that once had formed at the bottom of 
an ancient sea. The bones were porous, Kearin said, which indicated they 
belonged to a mammal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of painstakingly chipping away the gypsum, technicians uncovered 
the outline of skeleton at least 28 feet long with a rib cage about 6 1/2 feet 
wide, although the features were not yet clear enough to identify.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Kearin said, the whale's head was missing, which made it 
impossible to determine its species. For that reason and because the fossil was 
not well preserved, Kearin said, the find was not considered important enough 
to warrant excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 So about 11 a.m. Friday, after the whale had been measured and photographed by 
the technicians and filmed by several science teachers from Saddleback Unified 
School District, the bulldozers rolled over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour later, a bulldozer blade hit yet another skeleton about nine feet 
underground. By late Friday, the outline of a skeleton at least 21 feet long 
could be distinguished, although the features were not yet clear enough to 
identify.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is a mammal and encased in marine sediments, so a whale is a real good 
bet," Kearin said, adding that technicians would work through the weekend to 
uncover and identify the skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Gruver, associate pastor at St. Timothy's, said the church had 
agreed to halt further grading through Monday so the scientific value of the 
second skeleton can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gruver said he is concerned about a longer delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are kind of hoping it isn't that valuable," he conceded. The church has 
been waiting years for money to build the parking structure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, Kathy (Liuzz), the office manager, said nothing can stop us 
now unless they dig up a dinosaur. And here they found an ancient whale." 
</P>
<P>
 John Minch, a paleontologist from Mission Viejo who is familiar with the 
region, said the finding of fossil whales in south Orange County is becoming 
almost commonplace.  
</P>
<P>
 Minch said his firm alone, which has been monitoring construction of the San 
Joaquin Hills Corridor, has found at least half a dozen whales in South County 
in the last year, including a 26-foot, perfectly intact skeleton that has been 
placed on public display in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The geologic formation in which these whales have been found, called the 
Capistrano Formation, dates them as having lived 5 to 6 million years ago, 
Minch said, when the ocean's shoreline was along the foothills of the Santa Ana 
Mountains near what is now the community of Rancho Santa Margarita. At that 
time, he said, the location of St. Timothy's, at Crown Valley Parkway and Nueva 
Vista, was under 4,000 to 5,000 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the area abounds with whale remains, Minch said, scientists are 
collecting only the better specimens. Most ancient whales would be very 
recognizable, he said. "They look very much like the whales we have today." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearin, who by Friday evening was exhausted and nursing blistered fingers from 
the work of unearthing fossils, said it had been "an invaluable experience" for 
her as a geology student at Saddleback. "You learn a lot more out in the field 
than in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Kearin said that just watching the dig was special for anyone 
interested in science who happened to walk by. "They may see everything in a 
museum, she said, "but watching them dug up is exciting. It is nice they got to 
see it happening in their own back yard."

CRIME BILL RECEIVES MIXED REVIEWS FROM O.C. OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passage of the Clinton Administration's crime bill this week received mixed 
reviews Friday, with two of Orange County's top law enforcement officials 
predicting the hard-fought measure will provide little benefit to the county 
and others hoping it will add at least 240 new officers to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is just an election-year window dressing," said Dist. Atty. Michael 
R. Capizzi. "It's nothing more than a Trojan horse rather than a gift to the 
public wanting solutions to crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said the estimated $300 million county taxpayers are 
expected to pay toward the $30-billion legislation in the next six years could 
have been more wisely spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be a donor county," he said. "That means because we're a 
financially rich county, we're going to give more to make the crime bill work 
than we'll get back. And the difference will be spent in Georgia or Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) has warned repeatedly that Orange 
County will not receive "anywhere near" $300 million in benefits from the crime 
bill, said a spokesman for his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the county, however, were optimistic that the crime bill will help 
boost crime-fighting efforts here by making federal matching funds available 
for hiring more police officers, banning 19 assault-type rifles and creating 
crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), the county's sole Democratic 
legislator and a former federal prosecutor: "For those who think this is merely 
an election ploy, that's unfortunate. There's no such thing as a 'perfect 
bill.' But this one is going to provide billions of dollars of resources to the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which President Clinton need now only sign, also endeavors to 
add an estimated 100,000 new police officers to cities across the country -- 
240 of them in Orange County, according to estimates by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But making cities apply for federal matching funds through state and federal 
agencies could prove to be the bill's Achilles' heel, said Santa Ana Police 
Chief Paul M. Walters, who is also president of the Orange County Police Chiefs 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather the money just be directly given to the cities in grants rather 
than Washington telling local cities what to do," he said. "Different cities 
have different problems. I don't like to see money get lost in bureaucracy, and 
when you get money from Washington that's what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials are worried that Orange County might be short-changed when the 
time comes to distribute federal funds -- roughly $13.5 billion of which will 
be spent on state, local and federal law enforcement nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that something finally trickled through," said Westminster Police 
Chief James Cook. "I just hope that Orange County gets its fair share. A lot of 
people in Washington think, 'Oh, thats just suburban Orange County, green lawns 
and two cars parked in the driveway.' But this is a sophisticated county with 
crime problems of its own." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the type of reputation the county and its estimated 2.6 
million residents will have to overcome -- even if it does rank as one of the 
lowest in crime among the 10 most populated counties in the state, Capizzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the statistics can be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Orange County, the third-biggest county in the state by population, 
has its share of violent crime. Aggravated robberies, rapes, homicides, 
carjackings and home invasions are up compared to years past, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatal drive-by shootings are also on the rise. In 1992, there were 34, in 
1993, 74, and so far in 1994 there have been 42, Sheriff Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill, in its attempt to put a dent in crime, would also authorize 
the death penalty for more than 50 federal crimes, including killings during 
carjackings and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Irvine Police Officer Jim Blaylock said he has a difficult time 
envisioning federal funds from the crime bill trickling down to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main thrust of the bill is for urban areas and the inner-city 
problems, not what we usually see here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all proportionate to the problem, and our standing as being the safest 
city in the nation (with a population under 100,000) in terms of violent crime 
. . . is unique," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Costa Mesa Police Capt. Rick Johnson said he likes the idea of 
the bill's crime prevention programs, such as midnight basketball, or any other 
recreational activity that will keep at-risk youths off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are doing activities that keep them busy enough that they're not 
out committing crime, it's a good deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Capizzi, the district attorney said he hopes the legislation can be 
paid for in full. He said he still has a hard time fathoming how Congress plans 
to produce the $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they pass an appropriations bill and have the money to pay for it, the 
money will come from a trust fund," he said. "And that trust fund will be made 
up through salary savings from not filling federal positions as they become 
vacant. But we're talking about $30 billion."

BORDER PATROL CHECKPOINT TO UNDERGO FIERCE SCRUTINY; POLITICS: CONGRESSIONAL 
CRITICS QUESTION ROLE THE FACILITY JUST SOUTH OF O.C. PLAYS IN STEMMING ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It opened in 1924, when Calvin Coolidge was President and a slugger named Babe 
Ruth was in his prime with the New York Yankees. Seventy years later, illegal 
immigration has never been a bigger issue in California, but many say the U.S. 
Border Patrol checkpoint just south of San Clemente has outlived its usefulness 
and ought to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional forces on both sides of the aisle, including Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) and Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego), openly question the 
checkpoint's role. And they promise that, when Capitol Hill begins considering 
a new federal budget Oct. 1, the future of the checkpoint will come under its 
fiercest scrutiny ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard, in fact, plans an all-out lobbying effort in South County, which 
encompasses much of his sprawling district. His first public appearances are 
scheduled Thursday, when aides say he will preach in earnest the philosophy 
that all Border Patrol efforts should be redirected to the U.S.-Mexico border 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees no use for a checkpoint that's long been a familiar sight on 
Interstate 5, three miles south of San Clemente and 66 miles north of the 
international boundary between the United States and Mexico, where the Border 
Patrol is waging a frustrating battle to stem illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Packard: "I am not convinced that it is the best use of taxpayer dollars 
to fund a checkpoint miles from the International Border, which does not 
operate round-the-clock, causes severe traffic jams and is the site where 
high-speed chases of illegals often originate." 
</P>
<P>
 A growing chorus of congressional representatives and civic officials in 
Orange and San Diego counties favor redeploying the checkpoint's 100 Border 
Patrol agents to the border. That's a shift in thinking that appears to have 
strong backing within the Clinton Administration, judging by recent comments 
from Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials for the Border Patrol say the checkpoint is vital to the 
agency's efforts. Another inland checkpoint is on Interstate 15 south of 
Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with both the idea and the reality of the (inland) 
checkpoints, and I can tell you right now, they're not about to close -- 
despite what a few of our congressmen keep telling us," said Border Patrol 
spokesman Bryant Brazeley. "The checkpoint will not close. It's too vital to 
our operations. In fact, I'd call it essential to our operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, efforts to close the checkpoint by transferring agents to the 
border appear to be gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Meissner told The Times that if beefed-up efforts at the 
border are successful, by next year, "we will have to look again at whether 
those checkpoints really make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Already shelved is a proposed $30-million plan, first submitted during the 
Carter Administration, to build a new and expanded checkpoint. It called for a 
16-lane, 15-acre site three miles south of the present facility, near the Horno 
Canyon area next to the Camp Pendleton Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent appearance before the House Appropriations Committee, Meissner 
said the INS has no plans of ever building an expanded checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional and governmental sources say Meissner and U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno want to employ agents more effectively -- which means re-evaluating and 
possibly closing the checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the change in policy, Packard said funding for the checkpoint 
expansion was recently shifted to the border, where Reno found bipartisan 
backing to add 400 new agents -- a 40% increase -- and install technological 
improvements, primarily lighting and telecommunications to boost the 
enforcement effort. Rep. Schenk has proposed closing both the San Clemente and 
Temecula checkpoints and transferring their combined 173 agents to the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for an El Paso, Tex.-like blockade -- which concentrates all Border 
Patrol efforts at the U.S.-Mexico boundary, and which critics in that region 
have hailed as a stunning success -- has only intensified the growing criticism 
of California's inland checkpoints, according to Packard and others. Reno said 
last year that she's considering such a strategy in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the San Clemente checkpoint -- long disliked by commuters who are 
often backed up in traffic for miles -- appears to have few fans, other than 
officials for the Border Patrol who continue to call it a valuable "secondary" 
deterrent to illegal migration and smuggled drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the checkpoint has come under attack from what critics say is 
a host of social and economic ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Humanitarians cite the high number of pedestrians who have been struck by 
vehicles and killed while running across the freeway to evade the checkpoint; 
15 died in 1990 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders and politicians in South County say the impact on the region's 
law enforcement and trauma-care systems has been enormous, whether from 
high-speed chases of cars carrying illegal immigrants or patients being treated 
in emergency rooms, in which case taxpayers often pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cities of Oceanside and Carlsbad, civic leaders cite the growing influx 
of illegal immigrants who continue to settle in those areas, partly out of fear 
of challenging the checkpoint farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 And organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union say the 
checkpoint ought to be abolished because it violates the 4th Amendment, which 
protects U.S. citizens against unlawful search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Budd, staff counsel for the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties -- 
and a frequent critic of the Border Patrol's operations in San Clemente -- says 
the checkpoint's modus operandi is racist and unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. Supreme Court decisions dating to 1976 have upheld the 
government's right to stop people and vehicles for immigration- and 
drug-related questioning if agents suspect illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Budd says the agency tends to stop only drivers or passengers who "look 
Latino" or who "fit the profile" of a drug smuggler. He cited the case of an 
unidentified clinical psychologist who commutes from his home in Carlsbad to 
the Orange County Mental Health Department and who recently asked the ACLU for 
legal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to San Diego County in late 1992, the man was stopped every day 
for almost a year, Budd said, often being told to report to a secondary holding 
unit, where he was searched and sometimes made to wait for half an hour before 
being dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, they told him they were stopping him because he 'fit the profile,' 
saying, 'You have a ponytail and drive an old car.' He said, 'But I wear a 
business suit every day.' They said, 'That fits the profile too, because it 
looks like you're trying not to fit the profile.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This went on every day for about a year, and then last October, it finally 
stopped," said Budd. "Coincidentally, the man's car broke down, and he had to 
buy a new one. And since he bought the new car, they haven't stopped him a 
single time." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the Border Patrol declined to respond to Budd's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance, which 
works exclusively with migrant laborers, said her agency recently filed a 
formal complaint against agents at the checkpoint over what she called "the 
harassment and abuse" of two Guatemalans whom she says were legally seeking 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to sleep on cold, tile floors (at the checkpoint) without a blanket 
and were not given food for almost 24 hours," she said. "In fact, they were 
given nothing but water, and they had to get that out of the bathroom. I'm not 
contesting their detention (by Border Patrol agents). Technically, they could 
do it -- but I'm furious about the abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol officials also declined to respond to Smith's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Diehl, the mayor of San Clemente, argues that the concept of an inland 
immigration inspection center is outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that you need a 'secondary' line of defense (against illegal 
immigration and drug smuggling) is like saying that your first defense is 
hopelessly inadequate," said Diehl, who contends that the checkpoint places a 
growing burden on both law enforcement and medical care in San Clemente, where 
two people have lost their lives in high-speed chases and numerous others have 
been injured, particularly in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol officials revised their chase policy after a June, 1992, traffic 
accident in Temecula, in which six people were killed during a high-speed 
pursuit -- an illegal immigrant, a father driving his son to school and four 
students, including the son who died with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the chases stop, Diehl said, innocent people remain at risk. "I'm in 
favor of taking all the money you spend at the inland checkpoints," he added, 
"and putting it at the border, which ought to be your line of defense -- 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 Even INS officials say the checkpoints in San Clemente and Temecula combined 
account for only 10% of the apprehensions in the entire San Diego sector, with 
all others coming at the ports of entry. A letter to Rep. Schenk from Ralph B. 
Thomas, acting director of congressional and public affairs for the INS, 
offered the following figures: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Alien apprehensions" in fiscal year 1992 -- San Clemente, 44,182; Temecula, 
20,780. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Narcotics seizures" -- San Clemente, 353 cases; Temecula, 183 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Currency seizures" -- San Clemente, $713,983; Temecula, $41,287. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Firearms seizures" -- San Clemente, 45; Temecula, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas notes that the San Clemente checkpoint employs 100 full-time agents who 
operate 75 vehicles. The checkpoint's annual operating expenses are listed at 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thomas defends the need for the checkpoint, saying its "primary 
function" is that of a "traffic check," which examines "occupants or vehicles . 
. . as to their right to be or remain in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Without traffic checks, he writes, "our ability to prevent the penetration of 
illegal aliens into the interior of the country would be greatly hampered." 
</P>
<P>
 Budd of the ACLU says the entire concept of "secondary" checkpoints ought to 
be re-examined, regardless of how effective, or ineffective the law enforcement 
community feels they are. He said the question ought to be: 
</P>
<P>
 Are they constitutional? 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole notion of the San Clemente Checkpoint is that you can suspend 
otherwise applicable constitutional protections -- inside your own country, no 
less -- for the greater good of law enforcement. But that's far too high a 
price to pay, and it doesn't even consider whether it's 'effective,' " Budd 
said. "We'll leave that argument to somebody else. If it's failing in that area 
too, then it really ought to be looked at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the question should be: Who really benefits, and how?"

NEWS ANALYSIS; SURPRISE BUYING SPREE STIRS BULL FEVER IN STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A powerful rally in stocks is shaking Wall Street out of its summer stupor, 
amid signs that individual investors -- the market's major money source since 
1991 -- are once again flocking to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a broad market advance pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 
51.16 points to 3,881.05, its highest close since March 18. That followed a 
70.90-point Dow surge on Wednesday, which was the blue-chip index's biggest 
one-day gain since April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The week's surprise buying spree caught many vacationing investment pros 
unaware, and may be setting the stage for an even steeper climb in September 
when they return, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound bullishness, after more than four months in which stock prices 
mostly drifted in a narrow range, appears to be rooted in investors' belief 
that the economy is finally slowing enough to forestall further interest-rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's Wednesday rally, for example, followed the government's report that 
factory orders for big-ticket goods in July took their steepest drop in 2 1/2 
years. On Friday, the government revised its estimate of second-quarter 
economic growth to 3.8%, well below the 4%-plus figure that many economists had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement on Wall Street over weaker economic statistics, while seemingly 
counter-intuitive, reflects the market's hope that the Federal Reserve Board 
has engineered an often-elusive "soft landing" for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising short-term interest rates this year for the first time since 1989, 
the central bank's goal was to keep the burgeoning economy from overheating and 
thus keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Fed rate increase, on Feb. 4, was greeted with pain and anger on 
Wall Street, and sparked the first serious decline in stock prices since 1990. 
The Dow plunged from its all-time high of 3,978.36 on Jan. 31 to 3,593.35 by 
April 4, a 9.7% drop. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed's successive rate hikes, including the fifth one on Aug. 16, have 
increasingly been accepted by most stock investors as a necessary tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 With this week's rally, some market pros say investors are effectively 
declaring the Fed victorious in its quest to maintain a moderately growing, 
low-inflation economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got the best chance for a soft landing that I've seen in my 
lifetime," said veteran market strategist Stefan Abrams at Trust Co. of the 
West, an investment management firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, at least, a moderate pace of growth should stretch out the nation's 
economic expansion, allowing corporate profits to continue rising while keeping 
a lid on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But while that improved scenario is what encouraged money managers to buy 
stocks this week, many were able to do so only because individual investors 
have continued to supply the necessary fuel, in the form of their cash savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the market's harrowing spring dive, relatively few individual 
investors have been shaken out of stock mutual funds, which now hold $800 
billion in assets and which have been the driving force in this nearly 
four-year-old bull market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals didn't run for the exits when we had the market 'correction' in 
the spring," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Corp.'s Outlook 
investment newsletter in New York. "They have stood their ground very nicely." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Americans overall have continued to add substantially to their stock 
fund holdings all year, which has allowed fund managers to build up cash 
reserves that may only now be finding their way into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute, trade group for the funds, said individuals' 
purchases of stock funds exceeded redemptions by $30.8 billion in the second 
quarter, even as the market gyrated wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 And this month, stock fund purchases are surging anew at some fund sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Schwab & Co., the nation's largest discount brokerage and a major 
marketer of other companies' mutual funds, says fund purchases have totaled 
$1.65 billion so far in August, up sharply from $1.27 billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investor redemptions of stock fund shares have fallen to $833 
million this month, versus $1.04 billion in July, Schwab says. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at fund giant T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, stock fund 
purchases this month are up one-third from July's levels. And for the year to 
date, T. Rowe says its net cash flow into U.S. and international stock funds is 
double last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals' continued strong appetite for stock funds has left many portfolio 
managers with ample purchasing power. The Templeton mutual fund group, which 
manages billions of dollars worldwide, holds as much as 35% of some of its 
funds in cash reserves now, said portfolio manager Mark Howlowesko. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides providing new purchasing power, the constant stream of investment this 
year into stock funds -- and the relative lack of redemptions -- has allowed 
fund managers to refrain from selling stocks that they feel comfortable holding 
longer term. That may have limited the market's spring losses. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dutton, manager of the $210-million Skyline Special Equities fund in 
Chicago, has kept his fund almost fully invested this year, and hasn't suffered 
significant redemptions even though the fund's share price was down more than 
4% in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullish analysts point not only to the chances for a soft landing for the 
economy, but also to other positive forces at work in the market. Corporate 
takeover activity is booming, for example, which helps boost stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many traders have been bearish on the market since spring, yet 
stocks have held up remarkably well. Those bears may now have to cover their 
bets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, an unknown amount of this week's buying was by "short sellers," 
traders who had previously sold borrowed shares, betting on a renewed market 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling borrowed stock, short-sellers plan to repay the loaned stock later 
by buying new shares at a cheaper price, assuming the market indeed falls. 
</P>
<P>
 But when stocks rally instead of falling, short-sellers often rush to close 
out their positions by buying shares on the open market, to avoid serious 
losses. That buying can add new fuel to any ongoing rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Wall Street pros admit they are suspicious of this week's rally, 
and of the market's ability to rally to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as the start of something big," said Alfred Kugel, senior 
investment strategist at investment firm Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. He 
worries the economy may slow in the near-term to cause investors new concerns 
about corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Kugel believes the market will be stuck in a relatively narrow range 
well into 1995, as earnings growth catches up with three years of rising stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But he admits that it's hard to be too bearish on stocks as long as small 
investors continue to pump billions into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Few investors are making money in stock funds this year. Through Thursday, the 
average general U.S. stock fund was down 0.4% year-to-date, according to 
fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services.

EARLY START ON DISNEY HALL PROJECT WAS CALCULATED RISK; BUILDING: RELIANCE ON 
COST ESTIMATES, NOT CONTRACTS, IS CITED. COUNTY SAYS IT IS NOT WEDDED TO 
COMPLEX DESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The clock was ticking loudly for the Disney Concert Hall in mid-1992. If 
construction did not begin by year's end, the $50-million founding gift from 
Walt Disney's widow would be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her original promise, planning for the new home of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic had consumed nearly five years. So officials took what they now 
concede was a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Lillian Disney's deadline, they started building the project's 
underground garage before detailed drawings and the total costs for the hall 
were finalized. This so-called fast-tracking meant that officials had to rely 
on a $210-million estimate, not on signed construction contracts, to erect the 
avant-garde design by Frank O. Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, that tactic's true risks became painfully apparent with the 
announcement that Disney Hall will cost an estimated $50 million more, 
potentially jeopardizing what has been described as one of the nation's most 
important cultural and architectural undertakings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a risk we were aware of," said Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of 
the Walt Disney Hall Committee. "We had to do that or else we wouldn't get the 
gift, and we didn't want to lose the gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the Music Center on Downtown's Bunker Hill, Disney Hall is to 
be built on county-owned land. The garage, under construction, is being funded 
with a $110-million county bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials now say they will not allow construction of the 
hall until final, guaranteed costs are determined and 95% of the money is 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas and other Disney Hall supporters say they are confident that the 
extra money can be raised, and the Disney family has said it remains committed 
to the present design. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the county's representative on the project, attorney Richard S. 
Volpert, said the county is not wedded to the complex and costly design, an 
undulating structure of white limestone, glass and steel that has been likened 
to a sailing ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw enough money at it, you can build an atom bomb, fly to the moon, 
build the Disney Concert Hall," Volpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecture and construction experts nationwide say that fast-tracking is a 
fairly common and useful practice that can save time and money. But it can 
backfire, they stressed, especially if the design is as unusual as Gehry's. 
State-of-the-art computer technology is being used to help shape the curved 
materials for the 2,380-seat, wood-lined concert hall and its exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Told of the Disney Hall situation, Bruce Vogelsinger, vice president of the 
National Institute of Building Sciences in Washington, said: "It sounds like 
that's one of the risks they took and they lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney family attorney Ron Gother defended the 1992 decision to proceed, 
noting that four separate cost estimates were "all within a few pennies of each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was built into the budget ample reserves," he said. "It didn't seem as 
risky in 1992 as hindsight would say now." 
</P>
<P>
 When Music Center officials revealed the increased costs Monday, they 
attributed much of the rise to the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They later acknowledged, in response to Times inquiries, that heightened 
seismic safety standards for steel construction account for less than $2 
million of the $50 million rise. 
</P>
<P>
 They continue to maintain, however, that urgent earthquake repair work 
elsewhere has drawn potential contractors away from what would normally be a 
plum job on a landmark building. Industry sources are divided on whether that 
had much impact. 
</P>
<P>
 A Music Center letter to county Supervisor Ed Edelman this week repeatedly 
refers to design complexities as a major cause of cost inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Hall officials said they looked into a simpler Gehry design of boxy 
structures, but decided that it would not save much money, given all that has 
already been spent on the current architectural goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision has been made now that we go with the hall because of what it 
means to the city, and the fact that it's a spectacular, unbelievable design," 
said Nicholas, who volunteers as head of the Disney Hall effort. "This city 
needs this design. It needs this hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Gehry's office said the architect was en route to France and unavailable for 
comment Friday. His associate James Glymph, who is working closely on the 
project, said many other concert halls have had problems in establishing firm 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glymph stressed that Disney Hall delays were the main cause for the cost 
overruns. Groundbreaking for the Downtown concert hall garage was stalled for 
three years by complicated negotiations with the county and acoustical 
considerations that caused numerous redesigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Glymph said he hoped that contractors would lower their bids when they see the 
detailed drawings being prepared by another firm. "Anytime you engage in 
something unique, it is extremely important that a comfort level be out there 
in the marketplace," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources familiar with the project said problems were worsened by the 
cumbersome nature of decision making for the concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the county, the Disney family, Music Hall officials and Gehry, the 
cast includes Dworsky Associates, the architectural firm that is responsible 
for the detailed drawings and oversight; a construction consortium of three 
companies; a separate acoustics firm, and several other management and 
consulting entities. Also involved were the orchestra's managing director, 
Ernest Fleischmann, and music director Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Hall officials said they expected cost overruns of $4 million to $6 
million and insisted they were surprised two months ago to learn of the 
$50-million increase. 
</P>
<P>
 According to committee budgets, some of the biggest increases in construction 
and material costs were in the steel framing, $8.6 million more than originally 
thought; in wood purchases and millwork, up $7 million, partly because of a 
decision to add interior wood; and in drywalling and plaster, up $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drywall designed for this hall has curves and movement that don't have 
any comparison to anything else that's been built in this city," Nicholas said. 
"The people who were bidding the drywall had never seen anything like it, 
hadn't had any experience with it. So they put a lot of contingencies in it and 
they bid it very, very high." 
</P>
<P>
 A bright spot is the purchasing, cutting and installation of the exterior 
Italian limestone -- a process Gehry has closely supervised. Bids on that 
stonework are reported to be $325,000 below its original $22.6-million 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, professional and consulting fees have soared $16.3 million, to 
$56.5 million. Included in that figure are fees to the Gehry office, now 
estimated at $7.1 million, up $1.5 million. That is dwarfed by the sum for the 
Dworsky office, which is expected to have billings of $19.1 million, $7.3 
million more than estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items contributed to the $50-million rise, including $10 million for 
emergencies and contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prabodh V. Banavalkar of CBM Engineering in Houston, the structural engineer 
in charge of Disney Concert Hall, described the Gehry design as "absolutely 
buildable." He stressed that architects have done an excellent job of using 
computer programs to detail construction methods. That, he said, "should 
minimize or limit the factor of fear and get a better price for the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added, "anytime you are exploring some new areas, you are breaking 
new ground, that exposure is always there. Columbus, when he started, didn't 
know where he was going." 
</P>
<P>
 When the original $50-million gift was announced in 1987, a deadline of five 
years seemed more than adequate, officials said. When it crept up, Nicholas 
recalled, "we didn't go back to Mrs. Disney and say: 'Will you extend that 
term,' because we were embarrassed. We had taken so damn long." 
</P>
<P>
 Through accrued interest and additional gifts, the Disney family's total 
contributions to the hall have grown to $93 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement this week, Lillian Disney pledged continuing support, but she 
did not come forward with any additional gifts. Her representatives stress, 
however, that they have not established another groundbreaking deadline and are 
certain current problems can be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building will be built, it's just a question of when," said Disney 
attorney Gother.

NEWS ANALYSIS; GOP'S ELECTION AGENDA RESTS ON RISKY TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They lost on crime and appear to have prevailed on health. But in their 
partisan and sometimes ugly battle against President Clinton's legislative 
program this month, the Republicans have racked up more than roll-call 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 By aggressively attacking the priorities of the President and his Democratic 
allies, the Republicans have sharpened their own midterm election agenda and 
heightened the visibility of two possible presidential candidates, Sens. Bob 
Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Their maneuvers grew from a high-risk strategy that turned conventional 
political wisdom on its head: They came to believe that the electorate is more 
wary of what Clinton and congressional Democrats might do than they are of 
legislative gridlock and Republican partisanship that blocks federal action on 
health care and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this strategy was wise -- or, as the Democrats contend, a blunder 
likely to enrage voters -- will be decided in a battle for public opinion that 
already has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Senate handed Clinton his 61-38 crime bill victory Thursday 
evening, Republicans were vowing to prove that the real issue is runaway 
government. Just as firmly, Democrats were asserting that they will show it is 
a new and dangerous brand of minority-party obstructionism that has hogtied 
Congress through a steamy Washington August. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican strategists asserted that the issue -- epitomized by the 
debate over "pork" spending in the $30-billion crime bill -- could be decisive 
in their battle to regain control of the Senate and to win perhaps two dozen 
seats in the House. It would particularly help challengers in congressional 
elections, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have some examples -- they will look good on a 30-second spot," Dole 
vowed on Thursday, as he conceded defeat on the bill. Across the aisle, Sen. 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the Senate majority leader, was promising that 
Democrats will show voters that they have taken over the crime-fighting issue. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have been privately fuming at what they see as the 
Republican attitude that congressional opposition to Clinton has become a 
risk-free proposition. According to their view, the Republicans believe that, 
if Clinton proposals fail, they won't get blamed and, if he wins, he won't get 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does undercut our system of government when, regardless of the 
substance of an issue . . . a party decides to just take a position in 
opposition to it for solely partisan purposes," White House Chief of Staff Leon 
E. Panetta lamented at a meeting with reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say their target is not all legislation, just bad legislation. But 
in a newsletter this week, Republican strategist Bill Kristol declared: 
"Republicans can only make progress in reframing the national political debate 
in ways that benefit our party and its principles if we are willing to endure 
charges of partisanship and gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm said in an interview that in the face of charges of obstructionism he is 
as comfortable as "Br'er Rabbit in the brier patch." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans gave other signals that the crime bill fight is only beginning. 
Dole vowed that his team will continue to fight against spending in the 
legislation over the next few years in congressional appropriations battles. 
</P>
<P>
 And GOP strategists were talking of plans to bludgeon the Democrats with the 
crime bill next year, if the crime rate does not decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Republican (Capitol) Hill staffer has probably already called the 
Justice Department for crime rate statistics to use as a baseline," said Jim 
Pinkerton, a former Ronald Reagan and George Bush aide who now lectures at 
George Washington University here. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides can claim some evidence that the public sees things their way. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls continue to show that crime is the nation's top concern and that 
Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats for holding up action in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is the No. 1 issue with voters and now the numbers are swinging 
strongly in the Democrats' direction," said Tony Coelho, the former House 
Democratic official who is now advising the national party. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there have been increasing hints in recent months that the public's 
anxieties about Clinton have deepened to the point where many think that a 
little gridlock may not be such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys have shown increasing public anxiety about the Democrats' health care 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there seems to have been a reversal of the view by the public 
about the desirability of having one party control both the White House and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted last spring by the Virginia firm American Viewpoint showed 
that by a 60% to 34% margin, the public believed that it was preferable to have 
different parties controlling the two branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, respondents said by a 48% to 36% margin that it would be better 
for the same party to control the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats have speculated that the Republicans' real agenda as they 
dragged out the crime bill debate was to run out the clock on the even more 
complicated debate over health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Republicans had to worry about the prospect of Clinton ending the 
summer with victories on the crime bill, progress on the new global trade 
agreement and positive votes in the House and Senate on the health bill, said 
Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 "The three would have given the President significant momentum," Matsui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all analysts believe that the Republicans offered convincing evidence of 
their charge that the crime bill was shot through with wasteful spending aimed 
primarily at reelecting Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is receptive to that argument, but I don't think they made it," 
said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst in Washington. "I kept waiting for 
all the examples but they never came." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican analysts believe that their outspoken opposition to the Clinton 
health and crime bills is likely to give Dole and Gramm a boost in the crowded 
Republican presidential field. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gramm's more strident and ideological statements likely turned off more 
moderate voters, it will have a greater appeal to the conservatives he needs to 
mobilize if his long-odds effort is to make headway, Republican pollster Bill 
McInturff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what he needs to jump-start a campaign," McInturff said.

SIMPSON DEFENSE LOSES BID FOR SHARE OF BLOOD SAMPLES; COURTS: RULING CLEARS WAY 
FOR PROSECUTION TO CONDUCT DNA TESTS, BUT DEFENSE MUST BE GIVEN ACCESS TO 
LEFTOVERS. JUDGE REJECTS CLAIMS OF MISCONDUCT IN GRAND JURY PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A major pretrial battle in the O.J. Simpson murder case ended Friday when 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito denied defense lawyers equal shares of blood 
samples for DNA testing by their own experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means that blood samples held hostage by an intense legal debate 
between the defense and prosecution may now be tested at a California 
Department of Justice laboratory in Berkeley. Tests at a laboratory in Maryland 
are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order released Friday, Ito concluded that the DNA tests proposed by the 
prosecution are "reasonably necessary" and may proceed even if they consume the 
samples and make it impossible for the defense to perform a process known as 
genetic fingerprinting. The judge directed prosecutors and their scientific 
experts to give the defense notice of any tests and to conduct them as 
conservatively as possible so that the defense might be able to use any 
leftover samples. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense suffered a second setback later in the day. A judge turned down an 
emergency request that he sanction prosecutors or dismiss charges against 
Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct in their handling of 
a grand jury investigation of the actions of Simpson's friend Al Cowlings. They 
asked the judge to dismiss the case against Simpson because, they charged, 
prosecutors are improperly using the grand jury to gather more evidence against 
their client. 
</P>
<P>
 After rejecting a media request that he hold the misconduct hearing in open 
court, Superior Court Judge J. Stephen Czuleger met behind closed doors with 
the prosecutors and defense attorneys and released an order turning down the 
motion to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no support in fact or law supporting the sanctions which (Simpson) 
seeks at this time," Czuleger wrote. He added that witnesses who testify before 
the grand jury should feel free to discuss their testimony with Simpson's 
attorneys. The judge also required that he be notified before any member of 
Simpson's defense team -- or any defense or prosecution witness in the Simpson 
case -- is forced to testify before the Cowlings grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 While the grand jury presses ahead, Ito's ruling in the Simpson case ended, at 
least for now, the vitriolic debate on splitting blood samples and subjecting 
them to a battery of DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary DNA tests have shown similarities between Simpson's blood and 
samples taken from the scene of the murders. Defense attorneys are challenging 
the integrity of those tests, however, and from the opening moments of the 
investigation have accused authorities of mishandling the samples. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of recent hearings, they had sought independent testing of all the 
blood samples. They argued that the prosecution had engaged in a conspiracy to 
consume all of the samples, improperly withheld some of the samples without 
notifying the defense and significantly mishandled the evidence. They had also 
contended that Simpson could not put on an adequate defense without independent 
testing of the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling Friday, Ito chided the prosecution and the Los Angeles Police 
Department for their handling of some of the tests but declined to accept the 
defense's characterization of those actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was revealed to the court in the course of this hearing was a picture of 
confusion, miscommunication and non-communication between the prosecuting 
attorneys and the LAPD," Ito wrote. "Such conduct, while less than exemplary, 
does not rise to the level of bad faith or misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he cleared the way for the prosecution to continue testing the 
various blood and hair samples, the judge ordered government experts to conduct 
their tests "in a conservative manner" and to "maintain for potential defense 
testing any residual or remaining material." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution also must notify the defense 48 hours before any testing is 
performed so it can have its experts on hand to watch. That requirement had 
already been in effect, but Ito's order extended it to any future tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling resoundingly rejected the defense efforts to secure the samples, 
and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti expressed his satisfaction with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge said it best," Garcetti remarked after reading the ruling. "There 
is no legal basis for the defense to get what they were asking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's attorneys, said: "We're not 
disappointed at all. The motion was well-taken and he ruled." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, law enforcement sources said Friday that the LAPD is preparing to 
take administrative action against a police sergeant who provided security for 
Simpson and who concocted a scheme to help the famous athlete elude reporters 
the day before he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant, Dennis Sebenick of the Harbor Division, is expected to face 
administrative charges growing out of the conflict-of-interest created by an 
LAPD officer providing security for someone under investigation by the 
department. Sebenick has taken vacation time and was not available for comment 
Friday, but he has asked a colleague from Harbor Division to act as his defense 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is ongoing, we know that much," Sgt. Paul Enox, Sebenick's 
representative, said Friday. "I certainly would hope that it will be completed 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sebenick was ordered to testify before the Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
investigating Cowlings, and law enforcement sources say his commanding officer 
has recommended that he be suspended for an undetermined period. If Sebenick 
objects, or if superiors in the department determine that the recommended 
suspension is not appropriate, the sergeant could be forced to face a 
disciplinary hearing known as a board of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the Sebenick investigation, the sergeant 
said he was contacted by people close to Simpson and asked to provide security 
for the funeral of Nicole Simpson. At the end of the funeral, Simpson was 
trying to avoid reporters and photographers outside his home, and Sebenick, who 
runs a private security business, suggested that they use a decoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs of the decoy, accompanied by Sebenick and another man, were 
published and aired on television, tipping off LAPD officials to Sebenick's 
work for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Police Department weighed action against Sebenick, the city attorney's 
office filed its response to the Simpson defense team's effort to secure 
personnel records and other documents related to the background of the four 
LAPD detectives who played important roles in the opening hours of the murder 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In papers filed Friday with Ito, Deputy City Atty. Donna Weisz Jones asked the 
judge to deny the defense request altogether or severely limit it "due to the 
overly broad, vague and improper requests for information." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers have asked for all reports or other materials related to 
citizen complaints, allegations of falsified or mishandled evidence and 
accusations of failure to follow police procedures lodged against Detective 
Mark Fuhrman, and a narrower array of records on Detectives Philip L. 
Vannatter, Tom Lange and Ronald Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also wants any records of contacts between any of the detectives 
and Simpson, his ex-wife and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange and Vannatter are the lead detectives in the case. Fuhrman and his 
supervisor, Phillips, work at the LAPD's West Los Angeles Division and were 
briefly assigned to the murder investigation. Within hours of the killings, 
however, the case was transferred to the Police Department's robbery-homicide 
division and turned over to Lange and Vannatter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion prepared by Simpson lawyer Carl E. Douglas, the defense accused 
Fuhrman of harboring "despicable attitudes and viewpoints toward African 
Americans" and especially toward interracial couples such as Simpson and his 
ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 That motion called the detective a "dangerous officer with a propensity to 
create false information against African American defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's lawyer, Robert H. Tourtelot, has denied that his client ever made 
racist statements or did anything else improper. Tourtelot and Jones will 
oppose the release of the personnel records at a hearing scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, new details emerged about items taken from Simpson's Ford 
Bronco after he surrendered to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier reports had suggested that two sums of cash were taken from the car, 
one from Simpson and another from Cowlings. In fact, sources said Friday, only 
one large sum of money was found in the car. Property reports indicate that 
Cowlings was carrying $8,750 in cash, and sources close to the case say that 
money had been given to him by Simpson -- who asked Cowlings to pass it along 
to Simpson's children. The cash was taken from Cowlings when he was arrested 
and returned to him when he posted bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson also was carrying his passport and a gun, sources have said. 
Authorities said the combination of the cash and the passport in the car 
bolstered their contention that Simpson was hoping to flee prosecution and that 
Cowlings was aiding his friend's flight from justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Simpson and Cowlings dispute that. The money, they say, was meant 
to provide for Simpson's family after he had gone through with a plan to kill 
himself. And, according to them, the passport was merely among Simpson's 
personal effects and papers, which he had gathered to turn himself in.

IN HAITI, LOST HOPES AND LOST CHILDREN; CARIBBEAN: SOME PARENTS ABANDON THEIR 
OWN AS SANCTIONS BITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 She sat quietly on the broken plastic hospital chair in the fading twilight, 
her curly hair tied by a checked blue-and-white ribbon that matched her faded 
dress. There were no tears; only the wide eyes fixed on a visitor showed her 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl, perhaps 3 years old, said her name was Olivia. She seemed 
hungry and had a gasping respiratory problem. Olivia shyly said she was waiting 
for her mother to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia didn't know it, but her mother wasn't going to return. The tiny child 
had been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother had brought her to Haiti's National Hospital early one recent day, 
according to a nurse. Sometime in the hours that followed, the parent left and 
never returned, unable or unwilling to care for the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Olivia's case is not unique. Workers at the National Hospital say two 
or three children are abandoned each day at their facility alone. Other 
hospitals report similar experiences -- another result of the devastating 
international sanctions that are driving Haiti into increasing misery and 
despair in the name of political-diplomatic maneuvers that many of their 
architects acknowledge are not working. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned children were a nearly unknown phenomenon in Haiti before an 
economic embargo was put in place to try to reverse the 1991 military coup that 
overthrew the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first 
democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions, intensified last May after the ruling military refused the 
latest of a series of international demands that it step down, have destroyed 
almost all industry and businesses serving the poor and the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic economists say almost 300,000 jobs have been lost in the three 
years of sanctions. This has been an excruciating development in a country 
where most of the 7 million people had never worked for a regular salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last weeks, the pain became agony when Haiti was overwhelmed by 
inflation that is threatening the most basic survival of the people. According 
to diplomats and Haitian economic experts, inflation is now running about 900% 
annually and worsening daily, if not hourly. It is likely to close schools and 
even stop food distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it is impoverishing -- even killing -- people and "finally touching 
the lives of the elite," according to one diplomat, there is no sign that the 
army and its puppet civilian government will give in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (inflation) is no silver bullet," a U.S. diplomat said. "We're still 
trying to influence a small hard core" of those defying the international 
community. "But it hasn't worked." 
</P>
<P>
 What inflation and the rest of the economic devastation are doing is creating 
the horror of parents deserting their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were always poor here, but children were taken care of by their 
parents and the rest of the family," said Dr. Franz Large, an eye specialist 
who cares for the impoverished here. "Now there is no work, what little money 
they have is becoming worthless, and even rice and beans are beyond most 
people. They can't feed their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, five Haitian gourds, as the local currency is called, bought 
enough rice to feed a large family for a day. Now, it takes close to 100 
gourds. The minimum wage is about 15 gourds a day, although unemployment is 
estimated at close to 85% and even 15 gourds is a dream figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Avocados, mangoes and bananas are still relatively plentiful in street 
markets. But most people don't have money to buy even basic produce and have 
nothing to barter. The fruit is often left rotting in the gutters overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate victims are children, Large said, noting: "They are almost 
always hungry, sometimes desperately so, and their parents leave them here 
because they can't feed them, or they are homeless. They hope we will take care 
of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, the hospital isn't much better off," he said. "There is no 
food here, we can't replace mattresses, and we ran out of bedsheets months ago. 
We (the staff) have to spend our own money to feed the patients, and our money 
is becoming worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 National Hospital and the other clinics that treat all but the rich have been 
suffering serious shortages of medicine for months, even though medical 
supplies and drugs are exempted from the international sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, medical experts and some diplomats say, arises from both the 
international bureaucracy and the direct impact of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of an international aid group said it took her 15 days to get a 
license from the U.S. government to send medicine to Haiti. Even then, she 
couldn't find transport into Haiti because shippers couldn't find enough other 
approved goods to justify a shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave up doing it legally," she said, "and had to smuggle it in. It cost so 
much that we had to cut back on what we could send in." 
</P>
<P>
 Another large obstacle is the impact of the near-total ban on the import of 
gasoline and diesel fuel. Petroleum is being smuggled into Haiti from the 
neighboring Dominican Republic, but the price of $8 a gallon makes it 
unobtainable to all but the rich. That means it is difficult -- if not nearly 
impossible -- to transport such essentials as medicine and food to people 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too expensive to ship goods and it is too expensive for people to 
travel to buy goods, even if they are available," said a Haitian political 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 What once was a two-gourd bus ride in the capital now costs 35 gourds. Even at 
that price, bus owners lose money and have been forced to cut service 
drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to be reduced, if not eliminated, is the opening of schools in October. 
Printers have all but run out of paper, and there is no production of books and 
other school supplies, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is no cloth to make school uniforms, and, most tellingly, without 
affordable public transport, thousands of poor children won't be able to reach 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tracked down some of the parents who have left their children at the 
hospital," Large said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't condone what they have done, but I can tell you most of these poor, 
confused people truly don't know what to do. They give up their children 
because that is their only hope for saving them. They just don't know what else 
to do."

COLUMN ONE; A DILEMMA FOR BLACK WOMEN; MANY WORRY, OR HAVE BEEN WARNED, THAT BY 
SEEKING TO PUSH FOR THEIR OWN RIGHTS THEY MAY THREATEN THE PROGRESS OF AFRICAN 
AMERICAN MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Deborah Mack, one of eight black women sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in a 
small apartment, whether she is a feminist and she peers at you with a glare 
that feels hot enough to sear the paint off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the big deal?" thunders Mack, a divorced anthropologist with two 
children who works at the Field Museum of Natural History here. "I can't figure 
out what all the damn uproar is over. I was raised feeling I was equal to men. 
There's nothing unusual or feminist about that. Not where I come from, at 
least." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amen!" shouts Denise Carrillo, 41-year-old entrepreneur who is married and 
the mother of four. "I was always told I had to be self-sufficient to support 
my children because even if I found a good man, he may die, he may be killed. 
So I have always been kind of freaked out by this whole concept that goes 'Oh, 
if you stay at home . . . you're not a feminist.' That isn't a real issue in my 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 A cacophony of affirmation fills the room. Another meeting of the Colored 
Women's Eating Club is in session. Tonight's topic: Do black feminists help or 
hurt black people, especially black men? 
</P>
<P>
 The question reverberates among black women, who feel they face even more 
complex decisions than white women in deciding how far and how loudly to press 
demands for equal rights. Indeed, many say their struggle is double-edged -- 
they encounter racism from white people (including within the feminist 
movement) and endure sexism from black men. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say they fear, or are warned, that by seeking to fulfill their own lives 
they pose a threat to the progress of black men. Some even admit having pangs 
of self-denial when they speak against the belief among some black Americans 
that the white world will permit the success of either black women or black men 
-- but not both. 
</P>
<P>
 "In trying to be the best we can, we think about whether we are doing the good 
black thing," says Emily Tynes, 45, a Washington communications firm executive. 
"I am a black feminist but it is a conscious decision for me and I weigh the 
decision I make against that yardstick." 
</P>
<P>
 Another, larger, problem is that black people are not dealing with gender 
issues, says Michael Dawson, a University of Chicago political scientist. 
"Sexism and gender issues divide the black community at least as much as 
economic issues and the strategy and tactics of black nationalism," Dawson 
says. "Black unity is not possible without the black community squarely 
addressing these issues and listening to voices that have too often been 
silenced." 
</P>
<P>
 Even among the most outspoken black women, gender differences among black 
people rarely are placed on the table for candid debate. Never does it share 
equal billing with the plight of black men. If the subject does arise, it goes 
only so far, remaining within the safety of groups like the Colored Women's 
Eating Club, an ad hoc private gathering of like-minded black women in the 
Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse than that, say observers, the silence emboldens some black men to 
believe they can escape responsibility for mistreatment of black women by 
appealing to the need to protect black men and to preserve racial solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some claim that was the strategy initially employed by Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., 
fired last weekend as executive director of the NAACP. Confronted with 
allegations that he agreed to pay Mary E. Stansel, a former aide, $332,000 to 
squelch a threatened sex discrimination suit, Chavis has argued that "forces 
outside the African American community" were trying to destroy his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 While many men within the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
opposed Chavis' decision to use association money to settle with Stansel, none 
pointed to the issue of gender inequality within the organization, said Lulann 
McGriff, president of the NAACP's San Francisco branch and chair of the 
counseling department at City College of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men were more concerned with the money than how he might have been 
treating a woman," she says. "If you look at (Chavis') top deputies within the 
organization, you'll find they were all men. None of the men understand that 
inside the NAACP, women are the ones who build the stage and the men are the 
ones who dance on it." 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff said that by the time the board had decided to fire Chavis concerns 
involving employment discrimination had been subordinated to getting the 
NAACP's finances in order. "The women in the (civil rights) movement are fed up 
and getting tired of having to sacrifice justice for us to preserve solidarity 
for men who don't respect us," she said, noting that some women are preparing 
to nominate candidates to the NAACP board to challenge the group's traditional 
male domination. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Malveaux, a San Francisco economist and writer, applauds any move by 
black women to claim a larger role in traditionally male-led organizations, be 
it the NAACP or the Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are women silent as men make excuses about (their) . . . poor judgment?" 
she asks. "Our failure to step up to the plate may have placed (the NAACP) in 
disarray. In some ways, our silence is as indefensible as Chavis' poor 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of black people to talk about gender issues, even in private, 
causes a significant segment of African Americans to believe "black feminists 
are dangerous" to the cause of black advancement, says Dawson, the political 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson says a recent national survey of 1,200 black Americans found that 29% 
felt "black feminist groups just divide the black community." And, he said, 20% 
believed female leaders in the black community have "the possibility of 
undermining the leadership of black men." Another finding in his study suggests 
that less than a majority -- 41% -- of black Americans believe the problems of 
black women are the same as those faced by black men. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Dawson was at a loss trying to figure out the meaning of the 
study's findings. "Perhaps the problem is in the semantics of the discussion," 
he says. "I believe black people have skepticism about feminist organizations 
and feel they pose a threat to the cohesion of the black community." 
</P>
<P>
 However, more black women are raising their voices at the risk of being 
accused of betraying the African American community. As Georgetown University 
law professor Emma Coleman Jordan sees it, Anita Faye Hill inspired some black 
women to openly confront gender issues. When Hill, a University of Oklahoma Law 
School professor, accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of 
sexually harassing her while working for him, many black women were emboldened 
by her decision to speak out, says Jordan, who served as one of Hill's 
attorneys during the 1991 hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a turning point for a lot of black women," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Jordan Irvine, a professor of urban education at Emory University in 
Atlanta, says she also noticed a pronounced willingness among black women to 
speak out on gender issues after the Thomas confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Anita Hill thing, the tensions (related to speaking out on sexual 
harassment and sexual discrimination) have been high and remained high," Irvine 
says. "Clearly many black women are not happy with their lives and were saying 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberle Crenshaw, a UCLA law professor who has written on gender relations 
among black Americans for more than a decade, says more than 1,500 black women 
pooled money to publish an ad in support of Hill and with hopes that it would 
lead to a black feminist organization. Not much has come of their effort as not 
enough black women joined their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were outraged that they were in the minority, a distant minority, among 
black women," Crenshaw says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if black feminists feel they are crying in the wilderness, Crenshaw 
nods. "Yes, but the wilderness is coming to us," she says. "Gender is central 
to the issues we in the black community consider the black agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The perception that the white-led women's movement is ambivalent or hostile to 
the concerns of black people scares many black women away, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no framework for talking about feminism in the black community," 
Crenshaw says. "When we talk about race, we are seen to be talking about black 
men and their concerns. When we talk about gender, we're seeing white women. 
That's why the black feminist voice is a lonely one." 
</P>
<P>
 While no organized black male opposition exists, few black men have vocally 
supported placing gender equality on equal footing with racial equality. One 
exception is Harvard scholar and author Cornel West. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refusal by most black leaders to give weight to the interest of black 
women was already apparent before Anita Hill appeared on the scene," West 
writes in "Race Matters." "The claims to black authenticity that feed on the 
closing-ranks mentality of black people are dangerous precisely because this 
closing of ranks is usually done at the expense of black women." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has counted the ranks of black feminists. However, few black faces 
generally are seen among the sea of whites who attend abortion rights rallies 
and women's rights demonstrations. Those black women who tend to become 
involved in feminist causes tend to be younger and better-educated than the 
black population in general -- factors that give them the taint of elitism and 
further strain their links with many in black communities who hold traditional 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Collins, a poet and community activist working for the D.C. Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence in Washington, echoing an opinion voiced by more than 
50 black women across the nation interviewed for this article, says black women 
and white women see very different sides of the feminist coin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of feminists," Collins says, "I think of white women fighting 
for rights that black women already have," such as the ability to work outside 
the home. "I also think of lesbianism and male bashing. I know better because I 
know that's an ignorant way of looking at the (white) women's movement. But 
that's what comes to my mind and that's why I back away from the 'feminist' 
label." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason many black women define themselves as womanist -- a 
counterpart of feminist coined by writer Alice Walker in her book "In Search of 
Our Mothers' Gardens" to distinguish the set of separate gender issues shared 
by women of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Colored Women's Eating Club, conversation veers wildly from topic 
to topic but always returns to the personal. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was founded four years ago by a dozen friends who had trouble finding 
time to talk amid the pressures of careers and families. Once a month, the 
women share potluck meals. Whatever is said at their meetings is never repeated 
to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Crabble has the floor. "We embrace concepts of family, of unity, of 
community and we understand that is lacking in (the feminist) movement," says 
Crabble, host of a talk show on a black-owned radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Mack defines feminism as "a middle-class, white, mainstream cultural 
concept." She tells the group that taking up the cause of white women is as 
impractical as her thinking she will ever be a part of the white men's team at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just remember I'm a black woman in all of this," she says, recalling a 
conversation she had with her boss. "So what ever I do here I don't think will 
ever be a part of the team. This is a J-O-B for me and you all do not 
understand what it is for me to join the team because of your own history." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, her boss admitted: " 'You know what, Debbie, you were right.' I 
knew all along I was not invested as a member of their team -- unfortunately. 
That is something that is a hard reality, but most black women learn it pretty 
early on."

JUSTICE DEPT. MOVES TO FUND HIRING OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving quickly to make good on President Clinton's crime-fighting pledge, 
Justice Department officials said Friday that they would establish a special 
office to begin distributing funds for more on-the-beat policing of the 
nation's cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's initial move, while modest in scope, is designed to show the 
Administration's commitment after passage of the first crime bill to make its 
way through Congress in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under provisions of the crime legislation, the federal government will pay up 
to 75% of the cost of hiring new officers, with communities paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone conference call Friday with Clinton, Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan and other big-city executives thanked the President for his efforts and 
pledged that they would use the funds to make their cities safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the money will help him accomplish his goal of hiring 4,000 more 
police officers over the next five years, perhaps doing so sooner than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is the No. 1 issue of the people of Los Angeles," Riordan said. 
"The crime bill will help make Los Angeles and other cities safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, referring to funds already appropriated, told the mayors that "in the 
next two months alone we're going to give you the resources to hire 2,500 more 
police officers in cities that were only turned down last year and this year 
because we didn't have enough money." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill is expected to assure the hiring of 100,000 more officers over 
the next six years. The White House said the President would sign it after 
Labor Day when he returns from a vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has yet to appropriate the $30 billion in spending authorized by the 
crime measure. But to help the government "hit the ground running," department 
officials are to begin distributing by October $200 million in previously 
appropriated funds. That money was approved by Congress last year for local 
police hiring for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials said they already have more than 2,400 
applications pending for new police hires. Besides matching funds for police 
officers, the crime bill includes $9.8 billion in grants and matching funds for 
construction of more prison space and reimbursement to states like California 
for incarceration of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, joining Clinton in the conference call, told the mayors 
that she would "make sure this bill is administered the right way (and) that 
it's implemented in a way that can make sure we get resources to you as soon as 
possible and as effectively as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials estimated that California as a whole will receive funds 
to hire 10,560 more police officers and could get as many as 25,470 new prison 
cells through the prison grant program to lock up criminal offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the inmate population now is about 1.4 million, up 55% from about 
900,000 in 1987 and certain to grow larger with new sentencing guidelines. 
About 40 states are under court orders to ease overcrowding and 30,000 violent 
criminals convicted in state courts were released last year without spending a 
day behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 More prisons also will be needed because of the crime bill's popular "three 
strikes, you're out" provision, which requires life sentences for those 
convicted for a third time in federal court of violent crimes and drug 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 No new taxes will be needed to pay for the legislation. The entire $30 
billion, which is to be spent over six years, is to come from a special trust 
fund developed from cutting the federal bureaucracy by 250,000 positions over 
the next several years.  
</P>
<P>
 At the insistence of some Republicans and conservative Democrats, a number of 
crime-prevention programs were stripped from the bill to guarantee its passage. 
But a section that remains in the legislation earmarks $20 million the first 
year for military-style "boot camps" for youthful offenders -- instead of 
prisons -- and other programs aimed at helping youths avoid a life of crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles community leaders rejoiced at the Senate's action. "We're 
ecstatic," said Danny Hernandez, executive director of the Hollenbeck Youth 
Center. "I think that money's going to come down here and keep a lot of kids 
out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said that his organization has survived mostly on private donations 
for several years and that he hopes the federal help will also boost private 
donations to crime-prevention programs. "With both government and private money 
you can work miracles," he said. Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, 
chairman of the council's public safety committee, said that he feels "joy and 
jubilation, relief and a renewed faith that the system works." 
</P>
<P>
 City Legislative Analyst Avak Keotahian predicted that money from the 
legislation will not reach Los Angeles until next June. "But at the very least, 
it's a source of great hope that at long last we will be able to do something 
about crime," Keotahian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials were cautious in their assessment, saying that 
they need to know more about requirements accompanying the legislation, such as 
provisions calling for local matching funds. "We're happy to see it passed," 
said Undersheriff Jerry Harper. "However, we can't be too exuberant until we 
see what the match is, what the guidelines are." 
</P>
<P>
 Greensboro, N.C., Police Chief Sylvester Doughtry, who is president of the 
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said in an interview that he expects 
many police officials to seek federal funds for crime-prevention programs 
through the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A police official in Chicago added: "I'd rather work with an 8- or 9-year-old 
now than have to fight with that child at age 19 in an alley." 
</P>
<P>
 Some mayors expressed appreciation to Clinton for the bill's prohibition of 19 
types of assault-style weapons, a provision also strongly advocated by law 
enforcement officials and championed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to this section, Mayor Emanuel Cleaver II of Kansas City thanked 
Clinton "for the fact that you, pardon the pun, stuck to your guns" on the 
assault weapons ban.  
</P>
<P>
 Noting the President's intensive lobbying for passage of the bill, 
Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell told Clinton: "I think we got through two 
harrowing votes. I can't imagine what you were feeling but I was in agony as 
they were taking the roll call." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied the President: "Just another day in paradise here." 
</P>

Angeles contributed to this story.

SUMMIT'S FAMILY-PLANNING STRATEGIES WORRY MUSLIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dingy suite of offices above the human shouting, bird warbling and 
airborne feathers of a crowded poultry market, Essam Eryan, a physician and 
leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, sits below a poster of an Earth 
ensnared by a giant octopus named the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He has to raise his voice slightly to make himself heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is wrong with big families? My own opinion is: A big family is much 
better than a small family. It gives a very good chance to bring up children 
well, to give them a good education in traditions, to reduce selfishness," 
Eryan says. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the family-planning policy here in Egypt is planned and financed by the 
Americans," he goes on. "The responsible way to stop the population problem is 
to make development and create jobs. So we can welcome the newcomers, not kill 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt has about 60 million people and counts 1 million more every year. About 
96% of its population is crammed onto the small sliver of green valley that 
straddles the River Nile. Poor families are stuffed into tenements that rise, 
bleak and sand-colored, toward a sky fouled by factory and auto emissions. 
Walking down a Cairo sidewalk is like pushing yourself through a human sieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here, where the International Conference on Population and Development at 
Cairo's new conference center will try to set a global population strategy next 
month, a wave of Islamic resistance is mounting on issues of abortion, family 
relations and sex education that are likely to form some of the cornerstones of 
the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim militants around the world are rallying to defeat such a program. They 
believe it is aimed at stemming the birth of new Muslims while leaving them 
impoverished, underdeveloped and unprepared to stand as equals in what many see 
as an impending contest of civilizations between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see the growth of Muslims as a threat to their own interests," said 
Fehmi Huweidi, a prominent writer on Islamic affairs in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the restrained clerics of orthodox Islam have raised a voice of protest, 
arguing that many of the conference's frames of reference on family lifestyles, 
women's inheritance rights and abortion run counter to the teachings of the 
Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has heated to a fever pitch in Egypt as the conference approaches. 
Cairo's biweekly Al Shaab, the voice of the Labor Party and the Muslim 
Brotherhood, published a banner headline this week that read: "The Crimes of 
the Population Conference . . . For the Genocide of Muslims and Oppressed 
Peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 Venerable Al Azhar University, the seat of religious scholarship for the 
Muslim world, weighed in with a strongly worded condemnation of language in the 
conference's draft action program, which it said conflicts with Islamic 
teachings on abortion, homosexuality and traditional family values. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ambiguous expressions, abstract terms and innovative jargon that abound 
in it suggest that it aims to adopt the opposite of the basic precepts which 
Islam has laid down," Al Azhar complained. "It aims to defend sexual relations 
which arise between members of the same sex or between different sexes outside 
legal marriage, which destroys the values to which all revealed religions 
aspire." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has created unlikely bedfellows as some of the most prestigious 
Islamic organizations in the world -- the Muslim World League, the Organization 
of Islamic Conference and the Muslim World Congress -- have joined forces with 
the Vatican to fight for significant changes in the draft action program. It 
will come up for debate at the conference, which opens Sept. 5, when 20,000 
delegates from 191 nations around the world will gather here under the 
sponsorship of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Islam's response to the global population crisis will be crucial to any 
success in curbing human growth. Muslims now make up about 20% of the world's 
population, and birthrates, elevated in all Third World countries, are highest 
in Muslim nations. Islamic birthrates average 2.8%, a figure 22% higher than in 
most developing nations and many times higher than the overall rate in the 
developed world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some Islamic countries, such as Egypt, have been among the forerunners in 
curbing population growth in recent years. Family-planning clinics, funded in 
part with large grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development, make 
birth control and reproductive health information available throughout Cairo 
and in villages in the farthest reaches of rural Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 about 47% of all Egyptian women surveyed -- in a country where 30% of 
the women are illiterate -- were using birth control as part of a national 
program that had reduced the overall fertility rate from more than five births 
per woman in 1980 to 3.9 births. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Islamic nations, including Jordan, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Pakistan and 
Morocco, lead the world in promoting family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's Islamic fundamentalist government is operating one of the most 
successful family-planning programs in the world after seeing its population 
growth rate (adjusted from the fertility rate above by factoring in deaths) 
reach a high of 3.9% in 1985. Now, that has shrunk to less than 2.7% due to a 
campaign that includes television advertising, sermons, family-planning clinics 
and free vasectomies and tubal ligation for those who want them. 
</P>
<P>
 In both Iran and Egypt, abortion is illegal under Islamic law except to save 
the life of the mother but is widely and quietly available on the faintest of 
pretexts. In Egypt, for example, a physician need only certify that terminating 
a pregnancy was necessary for the mental health of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic scholars around the world have stood largely united against abortion 
except to save the mother's life. Egypt's grand mufti, the government's chief 
cleric, opposed Al Azhar this week and issued a ruling saying abortion might be 
sanctioned when a pregnancy is caused by rape, incest or, sometimes, in the 
case of an unwanted pregnancy when a couple has been using contraceptives but 
is unable to support a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the woman should seek abortion the moment she knows she is 
pregnant," said the mufti, Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Catholic Church, which is campaigning against the twin issues of 
abortion and family planning, Islam has a history of tolerance for birth 
control, though it doesn't encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Azhar has issued five fatwas , or religious rulings, sanctioning birth 
control since 1937, although permanent sterilization is forbidden except to 
protect a mother's life or health. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Azhar itself operates four family-planning clinics in Egypt, although the 
Muslim Brotherhood and nearly all other Islamic charity organizations have 
shied from any endorsement of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements opposing the conference, Muslim organizations have returned 
repeatedly to issues of values of terminology, objecting particularly to 
language urging that teen-agers be educated about sex and AIDS and have access 
to sexual health care with assurances of confidentiality, plus references to 
"marriage and other unions" and to "sexually active unmarried individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen the results of the West's sexual revolution and do not want them 
repeated in the Muslim world," the Council on American-Islamic Relations said 
in a statement on the upcoming conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are concerned about is a program that would have agencies, controlled 
and funded by those of Christian/European heritage, seek to limit the number of 
'brown' babies through imposition of Western concepts of family planning," the 
council said. "Abortion and permanent contraception are seen by Muslims as an 
attempt to mitigate the effects of a promiscuous lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and others say the proposed program of action seeks not to 
encourage abortion but to prevent the health hazards of illegal abortion by 
preventing unwanted pregnancies to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Muslim physician, I wish to assert that the United Nations organization 
respects the values and traditions of all countries," said Nafis Sadek, 
executive director of the U.N. Fund for Population Activities and secretary 
general of the upcoming conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Maher Mahran, Egypt's minister of state for population and coordinator for the 
conference in Egypt, said Al Azhar's statement of opposition was based in part 
on a misreading of the document, with a faulty translation that in Arabic made 
it appear that sex education is pornography. "When we mention sex it gives the 
impression that we are going to educate boys and girls in the techniques of 
enjoying sex," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahran said Egypt will continue to insist on principles upon which the Koran 
speaks unequivocally, including any endorsement of homosexuality, which he said 
is "non-negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahran has become the object of scorn in the militant Islamic community in 
Egypt, which believes the Egyptian government is hosting the international 
conference and endorsing its principles as a way of currying favor with the 
West and excusing its own failure to promote successful economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 In their view, the upcoming debate must be framed in political and economic 
terms, not merely scriptural. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Arab world from a regional point of view, you will realize they don't 
have any population problem," said writer Huweidi, noting that the wealthy Arab 
Gulf nations have been struggling to boost their populations to discourage 
reliance on foreign labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt, he said, has seen its economic growth rate decline from 7% to less than 
1.5% in recent years and has tried to blame the resulting problems on 
population growth, whose major increase has been attributable to a decrease in 
deaths from disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see the problem, we realize the main issue is how to help develop 
society before imposing family planning on the society," Huweidi said. "But the 
government has kept blaming the people, saying you are responsible for your 
poverty because you had too many children." 
</P>
<P>
 The persistent view heard in Islamic circles is that the West is seeking to 
curb population growth in the undeveloped world in order to dominate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pretend that their invitation to stop the growth of populations in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America is due to their fear of poverty spreading in those 
areas . . . when they were the ones that stole our wealth and forced economic 
retardation on us," said Adel Hussein, editor of As Shaab. "As they killed us 
in the past with bombs and bullets in order to rule and control us, they now 
want to kill us and our unborn children for the same purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Eryan of the Muslim Brotherhood said Muslims will seek a postponement of any 
decision on population policy until Muslim issues have a chance to be fully 
aired and debated.

U.S. PROPOSES LIMITED TALKS WITH CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a possible breakthrough toward stemming the flood of Cuban refugees, the 
Clinton Administration has proposed limited talks with the Cuban government on 
migration issues and Cuba has "expressed interest" in the move, U.S. officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although senior Administration officials cautioned that negotiations are far 
from certain, they said that the two governments are discussing the prospect 
and could come to a decision in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Such discussions would be far more limited than the broad-scale negotiations 
that Cuban President Fidel Castro has demanded recently as the price for ending 
the exodus. But some analysts believe that Castro may settle for less if the 
United States makes concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cubans should agree to the U.S. offer, the limited talks could offer an 
opportunity for the two sides to end the flight from Cuba and possibly save 
Washington the cost and trouble of holding the refugees in detention camps at 
Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton left Washington on Friday for a vacation on the resort island of 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., apparently without changing his mind on his refusal 
to engage in the kind of broad talks that Castro says are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials disclosed that the Administration had offered its 
invitation for narrower talks. And State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said 
later that the Cubans "have expressed some interest. We'll see."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference in La Paz, Bolivia, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said Friday that his government "wouldn't refuse" a discussion 
with the United States limited to immigration issues, Reuters reported. "We 
would be ready to listen," Robaina said. But he added that the two countries 
need "serious, deep and long-term conversations," especially on the U.S. 
embargo and on the Guantanamo naval base, which the United States has held 
since the beginning of this century.  
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the strong tide of Cuban refugees continued in the 
Florida Straits, despite increasingly heavy seas and squalls. The Coast Guard 
reported that it had picked up 378 Cuban migrants by midafternoon -- below the 
previous pace, but still a substantial number. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said that they expected still more violent weather off 
Florida's shores this weekend, with the prospect of 45-knot squalls and 10-foot 
waves -- more than enough to swamp most rafts and small boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, in line with a policy that Clinton announced last weekend, the 
Treasury Department unveiled new rules prohibiting Cuban-Americans living in 
the United States from sending money to their relatives in Cuba -- a move 
designed to squeeze Cuba's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations also restrict charter flights between Cuba and the United 
States, allowing transport only of legal immigrants from Cuba, government 
officials of both countries, journalists and persons who are involved in 
research projects, humanitarian programs and religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Coast Guard also reported that it caught a Hialeah, Fla., 
resident trying to smuggle nine Cuban refugees into South Florida on a 20-foot 
powerboat. The man was turned over to U.S. Justice Department officials and the 
Cubans were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Pentagon reported that the first of some 8,000 additional U.S. troops 
left Friday for Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, where the Pentagon is 
building detention camps designed to accommodate 60,000 Cuban and Haitian 
refugees, up from about 17,000 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's continuing refusal to accept Castro's overture for broad economic 
and diplomatic talks apparently has spurred some divisions among top 
policy-makers over the wisdom of taking such a hard line. Some leading foreign 
policy advisers favor talking to Castro as he wants.  
</P>
<P>
 The narrower talks, which have been going on intermittently since 1984, last 
occurred in December. Under the accord that governs the talks, it was time for 
the Administration to invite Cuba to renew them. In the current climate, Cuba 
was expected to reject the U.S. offer outright. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of Latin American experts headed by former U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot L. 
Richardson called on both governments Friday to "turn away from confrontation 
and begin negotiating on the issues that divide them." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, part of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based forum for 
discussion of issues affecting Latin America, also called on the United States 
to repeal its restrictions on sending money to Cuba, saying that it only hurts 
ordinary Cubans and isolates them further. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials also disclosed Friday that the torrent of refugees 
now being picked up by Coast Guard vessels has been found to include two groups 
at opposite extremes of Cuban society -- the sons of mid-level Cuban officials 
and convicts who have just been paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate explanation for the appearance of either group. U.S. 
officials said they had seen some evidence that Castro had ordered some 
convicts to be given special leaves so they could make the trip. Cuba sent 
dozens of convicts during the Mariel boat lift of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's departure for Martha's Vineyard in the midst of the Cuban crisis 
drew questions by critics who recalled Clinton's own criticism, in 1992, of 
President George Bush for leaving the White House in the middle of a foreign 
policy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 However, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers asserted that Clinton's 
departure "doesn't mean that he won't be available. . . . He'll have adequate 
communication . . . and if he needs to spend time working on these problems, he 
certainly will." 
</P>
<P>
 The travel and financial restrictions announced by the Treasury Department 
were essentially in line with the policies that Clinton outlined a week ago. 
Before Friday's changes, Cuban-Americans had been permitted to send home up to 
$1,200 a year in cash or checks. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Treasury officials conceded that the impact of the two measures is 
likely to be smaller than they first predicted, depriving Cuba of only $150 
million a year in foreign exchange instead of $500 million, as some officials 
initially had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some Cuban-Americans said that they could easily circumvent the 
limits on charter flights simply by flying to Mexico first and then boarding 
planes bound for Cuba. Mexico has no restrictions on airline service to Havana.

BALSEROS SAIL ON A TIDE OF DESPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the flood tide of Cuban refugees continues to roll toward Florida, an 
emerging portrait of America's newest emigres reveals that the typical Cuban 
rafter is a 28-year-old man with a 10th-grade education who does not speak 
English and has a death-defying certainty that his chances for a happy life 
under the regime of Fidel Castro are zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the risk-takers, willing to sacrifice today . . . to have a better 
tomorrow," said Msgr. Bryan O. Walsh, executive director of Miami's Catholic 
Community Service. "They make the best possible additions to a free enterprise 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with dozens of refugees and social service officials and 
some preliminary government statistics, those who risk the perilous trip across 
the Florida Straits come into focus as a cross-section of a communist society 
bereft of promise and opportunity for laborers and professionals alike. 
</P>
<P>
 From single men to intact families with infants, what the Cuban balseros 
share, according to observers here, is a hopelessness so deep that risking 
sharks and drowning seems better than staying put. "They are not pursuing the 
American dream as much as they are fleeing the Cuban nightmare," said Miami 
sociologist Juan Clark. "This is an exodus of people desperate to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 This desperation distinguishes the rafters from some previous immigrants and 
likely will color their experience in the United States for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the waves of Europeans who came to this country seeking a better life 
in the late 19th Century, many of the Cubans now arriving may not have spent 
years carefully planning for the opportunity ahead. And as products of the 
communist revolution, many of the Cubans also have only the vaguest idea of how 
a free-market society works and how to live in one. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus they may face an extended period of confusion and adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the balseros, or rafters , may have some special advantages. About 85% to 
90% of the refugees in one group processed by the government claimed relatives 
in this country, who in many cases can provide a place to stay, leads on jobs 
and crucial help in getting off to a good start. By contrast, many migrants 
streaming across the southern border of the United States go it alone and 
struggle to get a foothold with subsistence work. 
</P>
<P>
 And as much as any migrants have, the newest Cuban emigres have demonstrated a 
fierce desire to overcome adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people with a high level of initiative, which is considered a 
handicap in Cuba," said Clark, a professor at Miami-Dade Community College. 
Those who choose to make the dangerous journey are those most stifled by the 
totalitarian system there "because using initiative there makes you a criminal. 
It's a crime to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 While more than 12,000 Cubans picked up in the last week are now either held 
in a detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, or headed 
there, this year about 7,500 others beat the Aug. 20 cutoff and were permitted 
to enter the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alberto Gomez, 30, a factory worker who left his wife and daughter in 
Guanabo and climbed aboard a flimsy inner-tube raft for a trip that he said 
"terrified me to tears." But he vowed: "Here I will work hard, and within a 
year reclaim my family." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rosa Zambrana Aleman, 33, who spent eight days at sea with her 12-year-old 
daughter and 26 others from her hometown of Sagua la Grande, 200 miles east of 
Havana. " Mar y cielo, nada mas ," she said -- nothing but sea and sky. Now, 
with no family in the United States, she does not know where she will end up. 
"Whatever God wants," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 * Orlando Pena, 36, a pulp mill worker, who along with his brother, Ovidio, 
and their father, also named Orlando, said goodby to his mother in a Pinar del 
Rio hospital where she was having an ovarian cyst removed. "She begged us not 
to go," he said. "But there was no other way." He, his father and brother have 
the promise of work aboard a shrimp boat in Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 Although from the same country, the balseros seem to have remarkably little in 
common with those in the last mass flight from Cuba, the Mariel boat lift, 
according to those who work with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not criminals, they are not insane or sick -- which is what 
everybody's afraid of," said Roseann Micallef, director of the Church World 
Service refugee program. "This is no Mariel." (Officials have noted, however, 
that some recently paroled convicts are among the latest wave of refugees.) 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the exodus from Cuba boiled up into a crisis three weeks ago, 
South Florida has been haunted by the specter of Mariel, the chaotic 1980 boat 
lift in which more that 125,000 Cubans arrived here in five months. Among those 
arrivals were about 5,000 criminals and mental patients who were forced onto 
American boats that had traveled to Cuba to pick up relatives. Although Castro 
has threatened to open his ports to U.S. vessels, the Clinton Administration's 
firm threat to prosecute American residents who travel to Cuba has so far 
prevented a repeat of a Mariel-style flotilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the balseros , a prime characteristic seems to be their physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really very healthy," said Msgr. Walsh, a veteran of 35 years of 
refugee affairs in Miami. "Most are so skinny we didn't have clothes to fit 
them -- but (they are) healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures from the U.S. Justice Department's Community Relations 
Service, which oversees refugee resettlement, 560 Cubans were processed in the 
week ending Aug. 16. Of those, 80% were male and, of those, 60% were single. In 
the group were 56 children under 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban migration to the United States, and especially to South Florida, has 
been a constant almost from the first days of Castro's rule, which began in 
January, 1959. But until now, there have been two major exoduses: first in 1960 
and 1961, when thousands of Cuba's middle class, fearing Castro's turn to 
communism, fled to Miami by air, and again with Mariel in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariel boat lift brought to South Florida a more representative sampling 
of the Cuban population: younger, less-educated, darker skinned. Unlike earlier 
refugees, most had grown up under communism and many here -- Cubans and 
non-Cubans alike -- feared that the Mariel arrivals lacked a well-defined work 
ethic. That fear has been proven to be largely unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The new arrivals are expected to follow that pattern, moving soon into the 
productive economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cubans are advantaged in two ways: with a large, reasonably prosperous 
enclave to help them get a foothold and, as refugees, they are entitled to 
federal benefits," said Michael Fix, director of immigrant policy for the Urban 
Institute, a Washington think tank. "Together, that may explain why Cubans have 
been so successful here, especially economically." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new arrivals already have connected with the network. Liduvina 
Lugones, for example, received a call one recent afternoon from a refugee 
worker in Key West who told her: "Your nephew Rodney is here. He just rafted 
in. Can you take him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lugones, a U.S. resident for 25 years, had never met Rodney Herrera, her 
brother's son. "Now I am trying to help him find a job, get him settled 
somewhere, let him start a life here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Bryon, a counselor with Catholic Community Service and a Cuban emigre 
himself, said that people such as Herrera often find work at Miami 
International Airport, where men get hired as baggage handlers, and women clean 
planes between flights. The pay is minimum wage, $4.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 To most Cubans, used to making the peso equivalent of $1 or $2 a month, that 
seems like a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them to study English and I give them a list of night school classes 
too," said Bryon. (In Greater Miami, with a population that is about 50% 
Latino, a lack of English is often not a serious handicap, however. Spanish is 
spoken everywhere.) 
</P>
<P>
 Those without family in South Florida are often put up in small, local motels 
in Miami's Little Havana section. For example, at the San Juan Motel on 
Southwest 8th Street, known as Calle Ocho, balseros occupied 15 of the 22 rooms 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long they step out into their new world. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the hallway of a Little Havana resettlement agency, Alberto Gomez 
looked small and bewildered as he struggled to understand what he must do to 
obtain a Social Security card, food stamps and a physical exam. He spent 2 1/2 
days at sea before the Coast Guard picked him and seven others up off the 
Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 He is staying now with a distant cousin, sleeping behind a partition in the 
cousin's upholstery shop. He recalled the raft trip: "I only thought of 
arriving. I didn't think of my family. Only the hope of getting here." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his family in Guanabo, Gomez opened a rolled up handbook on 
Florida's driving laws and pulled out a picture of his 6-year-old daughter at a 
birthday party. Tears welled in his eyes and he turned away.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had talked about my going for a long time," he said finally. "The 
situation there was bad. One year. In one year I will have the money to get 
them here too." The Risk-Takers 
</P>

 The emerging portrait of the Cuban refugees, based on early interview with 
social service workers and the government: 
</P>
<P>
 Profile 
</P>
<P>
 Male: About 80% 
</P>
<P>
 Single: More than half 
</P>
<P>
 Under 18: About 10% 
</P>
<P>
 Typical rafter: A 28-year-old man with a 10th-grade education who does not 
speak English.

LITTLE LEAGUERS ALREADY WON CITY'S HEART; BASEBALL: TODAY'S WORLD TITLE GAME 
WILL BE AIRED LIVE AT 12:30 P.M. 
</P>

<P>
 In Richard Roman's eyes, the Northridge Little League team -- national champs 
and a contender today for the world title -- has already hit one out of the 
ballpark for the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, I'm excited for them," said Roman, 63, general manager of the El Matador 
Mexican restaurant and a Northridge resident, newly arrived from Long Beach. "I 
don't know 'em . . . but still wish them all the luck in the world. What the 
hell, I live here now." 
</P>
<P>
 His enthusiasm is expressed in a three-foot marquee mounted on the roof of his 
car proclaiming: "Go! Northridge Little Leaguers, We're Very Proud of You!" 
</P>
<P>
 That cheer will resonate loudly throughout the Valley today as the squad of 
young athletes takes to a baseball diamond in Williamsport, Pa., ready to go to 
bat for both their team and their earthquake-scarred hometown, which views them 
as symbols of resilience and renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement over the Little League World Series final is at a high pitch in Los 
Angeles -- so much that the local ABC television affiliate will broadcast the 
game live beginning at 12:30 p.m. today, rather than by tape-delay three hours 
later as will other West Coast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes better sense, and it's a better service to the community," KABC 
Program Director Connie Borge said Friday. "These are our babies, and we want 
them to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing against a team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, the Northridge crew -- 
nicknamed "The Earthquake Kids" -- hopes to keep the coveted trophy in Southern 
California, following in the footsteps of the Long Beach team that took the 
series the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' parents, meanwhile, incensed over the way tickets have been 
distributed for the championship game, were weighing options that included 
refusing to let the boys play. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League officials provided Northridge with 190 tickets, but only 60 are 
above the team's first-base dugout, where all of the team's supporters sat at 
games this week. The rest of the tickets are for the right-field area. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 members of Northridge players' families will attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandparents, brothers and sisters who flew 2,500 miles for this can't even 
sit with the rest of us," said Jack Fisher, father of shortstop Matt Fisher. 
"This stinks, and if I have to pull my kid off the field to get it straightened 
out, that's what I will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets were not required for any other series game. Admission, even with 
tickets, is free. Attendance for the final is expected to be about 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told by Little League earlier in the week that tickets would be no 
problem," said Tim Cunningham, father of catcher Matt Cunningham. "It's 
inconceivable that they won't let 100 Northridge supporters sit together." 
</P>
<P>
 In Williamsport on Friday, the boys' fame drew a horde of journalists to their 
practice in the humid afternoon. Two baseball equipment companies showered the 
team with new shoes, bats and batting gloves, but team manager Larry Baca was 
content for his wards to use the same old equipment that helped them win 20 
games in five tournaments so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Peter Tuber outlined the philosophy that he and his teammates hope 
will earn them their 21st -- and most important -- victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to approach the game like every other game we've played," Peter 
said. "That way we won't be too nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, the team has already shot to stardom. They're hot commodities in 
the eyes of local media outlets and companies eager for a piece of the action 
after the team returns to Los Angeles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Paula Mort, secretary of the Northridge Baseball Assn. and a team 
booster in Williamsport, Disneyland has offered to pick the boys up from the 
airport and feature them in its Main Street parade, with VIP seating for 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 KRTH radio will send stretch limousines to the boys' homes at 5:30 a.m. Monday 
to collect them for an on-the-air talk with Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda and 
Mayor Richard Riordan, Mort said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has weighed in with its own celebration: a parade and rally scheduled 
for 4:30 p.m. Monday, sponsored by Councilman Hal Bernson's office and the 
Northridge Chamber of Commerce. Catching Little League fever, City Hall cleared 
the way for the fete on Friday by waiving all fees, costs and requirements. The 
parade will begin at Northridge Park and end a mile away at the team's home 
base: the Little League baseball fields on Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, applications for a parade permit must be submitted 60 days in 
advance, but "we just broke all our own rules today. We haven't done this very 
often," said Greig Smith, Bernson's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all. At 10 a.m. Tuesday, a proclamation will be issued honoring 
the Earthquake Kids.  
</P>
<P>
 Some parents were concerned that their children would be too drained from the 
weekend's events to attend celebrations so soon, but pride won out. "In three 
weeks this all will end, the kids will be back in school and forgotten," said 
Eric Gordon, father of right fielder Spencer Gordon. "If the boys want to do 
these things, I think they ought to do them." The boys earned their berth in 
today's championship game by shutting out a Springfield, Va., team 3-0 Thursday 
before a crowd of 20,000.

ASIA; TRADE LURES CHINESE, VIETNAMESE; BUSINESS IS BOOMING ALONG BORDER. 
REOPENING RAIL LINK COULD FUEL THE TREND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Shi Yanjun moved his business from Guangzhou to this primitive border trading 
post on the rugged southern frontier to make his fortune selling clocks, 
watches and satellite television dishes to Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 His stall, full of sophisticated electronics and television monitors, is 
flanked by other stores selling sacks of garlic, bicycle parts, bootleg 
Vietnamese music cassettes and veterinary hog syringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Chinese merchants on the border, reopened in 1992 after the 
two neighboring Communist countries "normalized" relations, Shi has thrived in 
business here. Since arriving in January, he said, he has sold 100 Chinese-made 
satellite dishes and receivers at an average price of $3,000 a set -- this even 
though private ownership of the dishes is banned in both China and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know anything about the laws in Vietnam," he said with a perfect, 
deadpan expression over tea on a recent rainy afternoon here. "We just sell 
what the customers want to buy. Of course, we don't sell to Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate his products, he installed two eight-foot dishes on the roof of 
his adjacent apartment; one is aimed at the Chinese satellite and the other at 
the Australian satellite that beams the Vietnamese television. 
</P>
<P>
 In just two years, trade between China and Vietnam has grown dramatically, 
doubling from $200 million in 1992 to $400 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chinese border district surrounding the nearby city of Pingxiang, trade 
last year topped $80 million, reviving the moribund local economy; it last 
thrived when the area was an important rail depot for Soviet weapons being 
shipped to North Vietnamese forces fighting American and South Vietnamese 
forces in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad link was cut in 1979 after Chinese forces invaded North Vietnam 
-- the most recent such incursions in centuries of conflicts between the two 
ancient foes of Asia. Passing through the nearby Friendship Pass, invading 
Chinese forces reached as far as Lang Son before withdrawing under heavy fire 
from the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes that the international rail line will be reconnected as relations 
improve between the two countries, Chinese and overseas investors have spent 
millions of dollars in Pingxiang building hotels and office buildings ready to 
cash in on a border trade boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Pingxiang hosted a border trade fair, attended by 
high-ranking Vietnamese Communist officials, aimed at boosting commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, most of the hotels and office buildings remain empty. On a recent 
weekend, only seven rooms in a new 140-room hotel were occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hanoi, still harboring deep suspicions of Chinese intentions, say 
they are uncertain if the rail link will be reconnected anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the prevailing attitude, a senior Vietnamese Communist official in 
Lang Son referred to the railroad in a conversation as the "railroad to 
Russia." Many officials in Vietnam still think of it as a link with their 
former Soviet allies, not with China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The railroad is the key," said Cai Ke, a municipal official in Pingxiang. 
"When it reopens depends on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Naturally, we wish 
they would hurry up." 
</P>
<P>
 If trade between China and Vietnam is ever to take off, the two countries must 
overcome historic differences. Until then, Shi and the other merchants along 
the 690-mile border find themselves subject to the vicissitudes and 
uncertainties that have characterized Sino-Vietnamese relations for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, for example, when Chinese and Vietnamese officials in Beijing and 
Hanoi exchanged heated comments over a territorial dispute in the South China 
Sea -- which is more than 1,000 miles from his shop -- Shi said sales declined 
noticeably as customs officials on both sides of the border clamped down on 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Vietnam has the same tradition of industrialization as China, we can 
anticipate the growth of its market," said Shi, an engineer who until recently 
was manager of a small clock factory in Guangzhou. "We know the market will be 
there if there are no more tensions between the two countries."

MIDEAST; TOURISTS TEST ISRAEL-TURKEY RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli tourists are expected to flood Turkey, the only Muslim country that 
encourages tourism from the Jewish state, in record numbers next month. Will 
Israel's good relations with Turkey survive the stampede? 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey became the most favored destination of Israeli tourists this year when 
Turkish hoteliers and charter airlines dropped their rates between Tel Aviv and 
Istanbul so drastically that it became cheaper for an Israeli family of four to 
fly to Turkey for a long weekend than to fly to the Israeli Red Sea resort of 
Eilat. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 Israelis traveled to Turkey between January and July of this 
year -- a 252% increase over the same period in 1993, according to Turkish 
tourism figures. By the end of the year, more than 250,000 Israelis are 
expected to have visited Turkey.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why are Israelis going to Turkey? It is very simple -- it's cheap," said Yaki 
Ben Menachem, vice president for marketing of Rimon Tours, a wholesale tour 
operator. "It has become a substitute for Eilat or Tiberias or Netanya." 
</P>
<P>
 The deluge of Israelis has caused some problems in Turkey's popular resorts, 
particularly in Antalya, on the southern coast, where Israelis joke that they 
can stay a week and never hear any language but Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli travelers returning earlier this month from Turkish vacations 
bombarded radio talk shows with complaints of overbooked hotels and surly 
service. Newspapers ran columns asking whether Israelis were truly welcome in 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the criticism, Aynur Dogan, information counselor for the Turkish 
Embassy in Israel, called a news conference earlier this month in Tel Aviv to 
reassure the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the Israeli people, and we're very happy to welcome them in our 
country. I wanted to say that I could find no concrete evidence of bad 
treatment," Dogan said in an interview. She pointed out that Turkey has 
canceled its visa requirements for Israelis, although Turks must still obtain 
visas before traveling to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Turks and Israel's badly strained Ben Gurion International Airport 
are now bracing for the peak travel season. It starts Sept. 4, the eve of Rosh 
Hashanah, which marks the start of the High Holy Days that include the fast day 
of Yom Kippur and culminate with the weeklong harvest festival of Succot. 
</P>
<P>
 September has so many holy days that there are only nine full working days 
during the month, and Israelis are eager to take advantage of the time off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot get a flight out of Israel the night Yom Kippur ends," said 
Nachman Klieman, spokesman for El Al, Israel's national air carrier. "Every 
flight out is completely booked." That includes six flights to Turkey, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is higher than usual for flights not only to Turkey but also to Athens, 
Bangkok, London, Nairobi and Beijing, Klieman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis have always been passionate travelers. According to U.N. statistics, 
Israelis travel more per capita each year than the people of any other nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost a rite of passage that young Israelis will spend a year traveling 
abroad after finishing their military service. And now, with the nation 
enjoying a spurt of economic growth, more Israelis have more money to spend on 
their favorite pastime.

OZONE REBOUNDS FROM LOW LEVELS OF 1992-1993; SCIENCE: BUT THE ATMOSPHERIC LAYER 
REMAINS IN DECLINE, RESEARCHERS SAY. MT. PINATUBO ERUPTION CAUSED UNUSUAL 
DEPLETION TWO WINTERS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The protective ozone layer over North America has rebounded from its extremely 
low level of two winters ago, but that doesn't mean it's time to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 High-altitude "ozone over the United States during the winter of 1993-1994 
recovered from the record low values of the previous winter," a team of 
scientists reports in Geophysical Research Letters, which is published by the 
Washington-based American Geophysical Union. Ozone levels that were as much as 
15% below normal in 1992-1993 have risen to slightly above normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The layer of ozone high in the atmosphere helps block dangerous ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun. Too much of this radiation can lead to skin cancer, 
premature aging of the skin and eye damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel J. Oltmans, one of the researchers, stressed that the recovery of the 
ozone layer doesn't mean it's safe to spend time in the sun without protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still the long-term decline (in ozone) that's been going on for the 
past dozen years or so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery really is a recovery to the levels represented by the long-term 
decline, it's not a recovery to levels that we saw in the mid-1970s," he said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the University of Athens, Greece, reported in the same issue of 
the journal that their studies indicate a per-decade decline in ozone levels of 
2.5% in summer and 7% in winter over populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemicals from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines helped cause 
the unusual ozone decline in the winter of 1992-93, but that material has 
largely settled out of the air, scientists report. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study was based on measurements of ozone in the atmosphere above 
Nashville; Fresno; Wallops Island, Va., and Boulder, Colo. Oltmans said 
satellite measurements of ozone had similar findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the ozone is associated with the chemical chlorine in the air. 
Environmentalists have fought in recent years to reduce this by limiting use of 
chlorine-containing gases in cosmetics and other manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ozone damage was sharply increased by the chemicals blasted into the air 
by Pinatubo in 1991, said Oltmans, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder. Also 
taking part in the study were researchers from the University of Colorado and 
the University of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called ozone hole over the Antarctic has attracted the most attention 
in studies of this problem. During winter there, cold air becomes trapped over 
the South Pole, giving chemicals plenty of time to damage the ozone layer, 
which becomes seriously depleted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone levels over the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population 
live, have declined somewhat in recent years, but not to the extent of 
Antarctica, Oltmans noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned something about the ability of . . . (chemicals) to affect the 
ozone layer, to process chlorine into reactive forms, that we were somewhat 
less sure about prior to the eruption" of Pinatubo, said Oltmans. The studies 
are continuing, he added.

ZAPATISTAS CALL RULING PARTY VICTORY A 'LIE' AND URGE PEACEFUL RESISTANCE; 
MEXICO: IN FIRST STATEMENT SINCE VOTE, REBELS ASK FOR MASSIVE RALLIES. RESULT 
OF GOVERNOR'S RACE IN VOLATILE CHIAPAS STATE STILL DISPUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Mayan rebels whose revolt earlier this year plunged Mexico into 
unprecedented crisis on Friday blasted national elections and called for civil 
disobedience to "repudiate the fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first statement since Sunday's vote, the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army said the ruling party's large margin of victory is a "lie" that "only the 
gringos will swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated statement, signed by Subcommander Marcos, came as 
tensions in the southern state of Chiapas threaten to explode over what 
opposition forces claim was a rigged election that cheated their candidate out 
of the state governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tactic (of the government) is to repeat the great lie until it becomes 
truth," Marcos said of the election results that give sweeping wins to the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). "They are going to be mistaken 
once again, and it will all come tumbling down on top of them as it did in 
January." 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, the Zapatista army launched a surprise rebellion that 
stunned Mexico and left 145 people dead in 12 days of fighting with the Mexican 
army until the federal government ordered a cease-fire. The Zapatistas demanded 
democracy and human rights for the hundreds of thousands of poor Indians who 
populate southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's elections were seen here as a test of Mexico's commitment to 
democratic change. But numerous irregularities in the way the voting was 
conducted -- from alleged bribery and intimidation to the spoiling of ballots 
-- have left many in Chiapas angry and awaiting a signal from the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 In two communiques released late Thursday and published Friday, the Zapatista 
army called on Chiapans to "defend their will" and to turn out for massive, 
peaceful demonstrations against the PRI. Rallies are to begin today here, as 
well as in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition's bitter disappointment and frustration over the elections 
threaten to reignite the Chiapas conflict. Although most analysts do not 
believe that the Zapatistas have many military options at their disposal, the 
situation remains unsettled and volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections seem to have left Chiapas as divided and polarized as ever. 
Opposition forces, who share Zapatista demands, claim that the authentic 
election results, which they monitored, give a narrow win to Amado Avendano, 
their gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano, publisher of a tiny local newspaper who survived a suspicious car 
wreck at the height of the campaign, claimed this week that he is the rightful 
governor-elect. In his first news conference since the election, he told 
reporters Thursday night that he will fight the official results "to the 
ultimate consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Chiapas state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, PRI candidate 
Eduardo Robledo made the same claim and began going about the business of 
setting up his new government. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Robledo softened his rhetoric and assured voters he had 
"learned the lessons" of the Zapatista revolt. But for political victory, he 
had to rely on the most conservative of the region's traditional power groups, 
such as ranchers and old-style PRI militants, whom Zapatistas see as the root 
of Chiapas' problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, columnist Luis Hernandez Navarro described the situation in Chiapas 
as two locomotives speeding toward a collision. "Holding elections for governor 
served more as an element of political decomposition than institutional 
stabilization," he said. "The impending wreck of the two trains in Chiapas 
could have been avoided and it wasn't. . . . The war is there, latent. The 
wreck of the two trains will create the conditions for it to germinate." 
</P>
<P>
 The official tally gives Robledo 50.4% of the vote, with 34.9% going to 
Avendano, who ran on the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas said they intercepted radio communications between state 
election officials that proved Avendano won the race by a 2-to-1 margin. No 
proof of the claim was offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos also claimed that ballot boxes were stuffed, Indians were pressured to 
vote for the ruling party -- sometimes by employers -- and votes for Avendano 
were intentionally voided by PRI poll workers. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent watchdog group, the Civic Alliance, denounced more than 300 
irregularities in Chiapas, including vote buying, pressure and intimidation, 
names missing from registration lists and unauthorized people allowed to linger 
at voting booths. The Civic Alliance said its own monitoring of a small sample 
of votes gave a narrow victory to Avendano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I believe there was fraud -- a more refined fraud -- but fraud," 
said Juan Jose Borrego, the Alliance's state coordinator.

OUTSPOKEN OFFICIAL CASUALTY OF DRUG WAR; COLOMBIA: TRUSTED TOP PROSECUTOR 
RETIRES UNDER SIEGE. HE DREW FIRE FROM U.S. FOR SAYING PROHIBITION IS HOPELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Gustavo de Greiff was appointed Colombia's first general prosecutor July 
1, 1991, he was hailed as a man of impeccable credentials and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 And when, three weeks later, he warned President Cesar Gaviria that Medellin 
cocaine boss Pablo Escobar was continuing to traffic in drugs from jail, he 
soared into public opinion as a formidable crusader, the golden hope for the 
nation's notoriously corrupt judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 But De Greiff left office last week under siege, forced out by a Supreme Court 
decision that he must step down at 65, but which De Greiff says was politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Colombian officials who attacked him for advocating the legalization 
of drugs are delighted. Officials furious with De Greiff's policy of plea 
bargaining with Colombia's biggest cocaine dealers, the Cali cartel, are 
breathing a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. quarrel with De Greiff reflects two conflicting visions of the drug 
problem: De Greiff, echoing many Colombians, argues that the drug war is 
hopeless, while U.S. authorities insist on a major crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Alfonso Valdivieso, De Greiff's replacement, preaches a hard 
line: He opposes the legalization of drugs. He takes over as new President 
Ernesto Samper is under international pressure to signal his own resolve to 
fight drug trafficking, after reports his campaign may have received cocaine 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked about studying legalization as a way of putting an end to the 
obscene profits of drug traffickers," De Greiff said in an interview. "They 
(U.S. officials) didn't like that. I talked about opening the door of justice 
to criminals who wanted to surrender in exchange for reduced sentences 
established by law. They didn't like that either." 
</P>
<P>
 Respected by most Colombians as honest and progressive, yet also known for his 
combative and brash style, De Greiff became a permanent irritant for the U.S. 
and Colombian governments when he began to travel abroad, arguing that the 
prohibition of drugs was a 20-year failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The former judge and university rector insisted that drug seizures had not had 
an impact on price or supply, while production and consumption of drugs had 
increased. Profits from the illegal trade, he pointed out, sow the seed of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials were outraged that Colombia's top crime fighter stood for 
legalization and a plea-bargaining policy that could give the heads of the 
massive Cali cocaine empire -- believed to control 80% of the world cocaine 
trade -- prison sentences of less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government suspended a longstanding policy of evidence-sharing with 
the Colombian prosecutor's office. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the 
Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international 
relations, publicly accused De Greiff of threatening to bring about his 
nation's capitulation to the Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Colombians rallied to De Greiff's defense. Editorials in the local press 
accused the United States of trying to force their nation into a bloody war 
against drug traffickers. It is a war, they say, in which thousands of innocent 
Colombians have already been killed because of U.S. drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombians believe in De Greiff because of his independence. The U.S. hates 
him -- or rather, loathes him -- because of it," said Alfredo Molano, a 
Colombian expert on the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll showed De Greiff to be Colombia's most trusted public official. 
De Greiff, who calls the U.S. attitude toward Colombia "imperialism" and the 
U.S. attacks against him "McCarthyism of the worst kind," is grim about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations that Samper's campaign accepted $4 million in drug money -- a 
charge Samper denied -- will limit the new president's options, De Greiff said. 
He added, "U.S. pressure leaves the new government very little field of action, 
because if it tries to apply the plea-bargaining policy, the U.S. will 
immediately say, 'Look, this government has connections with drug traffickers.' 
"

DRUGS A GROWING PROBLEM FOR S. AFRICA; NARCOTICS: COCAINE BUST SURPRISES 
NATION. POST-APARTHEID SYSTEM IS SAID TO HAVE OPENED BORDERS TO TRAFFICKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Front-page newspaper headlines here Friday trumpeted a surprising side to the 
new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police Hunt for Cocaine Dealer," shouted the Star. "Coke Haul in Hotel Raid," 
boasted the Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure of 28.6 pounds of high-quality cocaine from a dingy 10th-floor 
hotel room in central Johannesburg, while minor by American standards, 
nonetheless was called the largest ever in the city. Only 24 pounds was seized 
here in all of 1992, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, officials said the latest cocaine cache, and the arrest of 
five Nigerians, was proof of a growing problem with global implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after the country's first democratic government was elected, 
officials say South Africa is fast becoming a significant transit point for 
cocaine and heroin trafficking to Europe and the United States. At the same 
time, South Africa is becoming an ever-larger market for illegal drugs smuggled 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we are becoming a focal point," Gen. Johan van der Mervwe, 
commissioner of the nation's police service, said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the growing traffic to the opening of borders, greater overseas 
trade and increased air traffic as the long-isolated nation establishes 
international links in the post-apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug syndicates in Nigeria, the Netherlands, Colombia, India, the former 
Soviet republics and other nations have moved quickly to take advantage of the 
relaxed restrictions, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because we are now integrated into the world community, we are no longer 
immune," agreed Craig Coetzee, spokesman for the Ministry of Safety and 
Security. "A groundswell can be expected." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Lee P. Brown, director of the White House Office of National 
Drug Control Policy, spent all week meeting officials here. He told a news 
conference Friday in Pretoria that when U.S. drug enforcement officials took 
stock of international drug trafficking a few months ago, South Africa "did not 
even come up on the radar screen." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the April election, Brown said, officials have tracked cocaine 
moving from Latin America to Europe via South Africa. Heroin has gone the other 
way, moving from South, West and Southeast Asia to the United States through 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug syndicates are taking advantage of the new openness," he said. The 
syndicates, he said, "have seized on this country as a new center of 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the top U.S. drug policy official, said the Clinton Administration 
would respond to requests from Pretoria for technical assistance or training. 
But he said no decision has been made on a proposal to open an office of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA office in Cairo currently covers the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
 South African officials, he said, are committed to passing new legislation to 
qualify as a signatory of the 1988 Vienna Convention against illegal 
trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. He said laws are needed, 
for example, to combat money-laundering and conspiracy.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week President Nelson Mandela promised a crackdown on drug smuggling and 
other crime. He said that the upsurge in drug trafficking and abuse is making 
it more difficult for "the social initiatives and projects we have planned to 
take off and to get the cooperation of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sudden spotlight on cocaine and heroin, officials say the drug 
still abused most is Mandrax, or methaqualone, an illegal depressant in pill 
form. It is produced in India and Pakistan and smuggled into South Africa, 
where it is usually crushed and smoked with locally grown marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who leaves today for Nigeria, said South Africa can become a model for 
drug control because the problem here is still relatively small. "South Africa 
can get ahead of the problem and make a difference," he said. "I think the U.S. 
waited too long. And we're suffering because of that."

SLAMMED BY INFLATION, LITHUANIANS TO VOTE ON BOOSTING BANK BALANCES; 
REFERENDUM: MEASURE WOULD INCREASE SAVINGS 100-FOLD. OPPONENTS SAY IT WOULD 
DESTROY ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How would you like the government to tack a couple of zeros on the end of your 
bank account balance, increasing your savings by a factor of 100? 
</P>
<P>
 This is the seductive offer Lithuanians will vote on today in a nationwide 
referendum, which, if approved, would oblige the government to index bank 
savings to account for the hyper-inflation that ravaged the country in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure admit it is unlikely to pass but say that if it 
does, it will restore economic justice. Opponents -- including the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Lithuania's ruling Democratic 
Labor Party -- say it will bring more inflation and, in the end, Lithuania's 
economic destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Devastating inflation has been a common feature throughout the former Soviet 
Union. Street corners and kitchen tables in Minsk, Moscow and Kiev echo with 
complaints like those of Kostas Pietrovsky, 44, a Vilnius cab driver who has 
had 10,000 rubles in the bank since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have bought a car. Now I couldn't buy a pair of shoes with that 
money," he said, angrily swinging his taxi down the narrow, hilly streets here. 
"What about our babushki , who had set aside savings to pay for their own 
funerals? Now that funeral money would barely cover a bouquet or wreath, much 
less a coffin and a grave plot. Someone has to help those people." 
</P>
<P>
 But if inflation has been the common post-Soviet denominator, a widespread 
conviction that the government ought to pick up the tab for it is almost unique 
to Lithuania, an Ireland-sized Baltic nation home to 3.7 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed of this idea was planted in 1991, when Lithuania -- led by Vytautas 
Landsbergis and the grass-roots Sajudis movement -- had set up its own 
government and was staring down Soviet tanks in a bold bid for independence. To 
punish the rebels, Moscow cut off the flow of Soviet rubles to Lithuanian 
branches of the Soviet Union's lone citizens savings bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Panicky Lithuanians asked what good independence would be if the Soviet Union 
confiscated their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear not, responded Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius -- Landsbergis' 
right-hand man. In the milk-and-honey land of independent Lithuania, Vagnorius 
promised, the government would cover all confiscated Soviet rubles with new 
Lithuanian litas. Citizens were encouraged not to touch their ruble accounts -- 
advice that helped head off a run on Lithuania's banks -- and the government 
registered the amounts in each bank account as of February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother listened to that talk of how an independent Lithuania would protect 
us by exchanging litas for rubles," Pietrovsky said. "She then sold all her 
gold and jewelry at the market and deposited the earnings in the bank. Now look 
at her -- without her gold and without her savings." 
</P>
<P>
 The old Soviet Union never did confiscate the accounts; it collapsed first. 
Inflation, however, accomplished what the Soviets had only threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Vagnorius and Landsbergis -- now leaders of the opposition Conservative Party 
-- say the government ought to compensate people for their losses. Doing so 
would require about 8 billion litas ($2 billion) -- or roughly two Lithuanian 
national budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the staggering economic realities, the notion of compensation remains 
popular among Lithuanians, 70% of whom live from paycheck to paycheck and can 
put nothing aside. Thousands of voters supported Landsbergis' petition drive to 
hold the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 But along the way, the original, simple request -- 100 times as much money, 
thank you very much -- ballooned into a legislative program. Conservatives, 
frustrated by two years in the opposition, have tacked on bills covering 
everything from fighting organized crime to C-SPAN-style coverage of the 
Seimas, or Parliament.  
</P>
<P>
 The poster-sized ballot, crammed front and back with meandering fine print, is 
so large the elections commission fears that the usual ballot boxes won't be 
able to hold all the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The text is so dense that a Lithuanian actress, hired to read the ballot for 
broadcast to sailors at sea who wish to vote, needed 44 minutes to get through 
it. And it is so confusing that Vagnorius, the referendum's architect, is one 
of the few people in Vilnius who can actually explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people do not understand any of the (referendum's) details," Vagnorius 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tells it, the core of the referendum is not the savings compensation at 
all but a review of the privatization process. Conservatives say the ruling 
party has used privatization to steal choice businesses and real estate; the 
referendum would set up a special commission to review certain cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But such talk alarms the IMF, which has said the referendum could discredit 
Lithuanian privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 President Algirdas Brazauskas, 62, says the Conservatives are in favor of 
"nationalizing" newly privatized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the pledge of 100-fold indexing -- which Conservatives continue to 
dangle before panting voters -- it's no longer explicit. Instead, the 
referendum calls for selling one-third of Lithuania's state-owned property -- 
exactly which third remains unclear -- and using the earnings for compensation. 
Vagnorius calculates that scheme would net 10 billion litas, which would mean 
savings could be indexed 100-fold with money to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMF and government officials counter that Vagnorius has drastically 
overestimated the value of Lithuanian property. They also argue that anything 
near 100-fold indexing would kick off a new round of inflation and make a 
mockery of the Lithuanian lita, stable since its introduction in 1993.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; SUMMING UP RWANDA'S MULTIPLYING HORRORS LEADS TO A TOTAL 
OF DESPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age soldier with a scarred carbine and curious eyes asks the departing 
American, "So, what do you think of Rwanda now?" 
</P>
<P>
 What, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 You wish for a coherent answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But all you can do is shrug, because how can you tell this eager young man 
that you think he lives in one of the most beautiful places on Earth and one of 
the most horrible? 
</P>
<P>
 Dare you tell him that you fear that doom has half a century's head start over 
hope in the footrace for Rwanda's future? Would he understand if you said 
Rwanda is as far away from coherent as you've ever been? 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier smiles, as if to say that's OK. He doesn't have a good answer 
either. How could he? 
</P>
<P>
 So all you can think of Rwanda now is what little you have lived of it. 
</P>
<P>
 You think of that empty highway, east of Kigali, where the African acacias 
rise like lightning bolts from the soil and bloom in a shocking bright canopy 
of purple, where the air is cool and full of bird songs and thick with the 
smell of corpses from a shallow mass grave where pigs are rooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe half a million or more Tutsis and their sympathizers lie rotting in the 
soil of Rwanda, chopped down by maniac Hutu machetes that flashed in the 
moonlight all spring long, filling the nights with screams -- but not for 
mercy, because mercy was first to fall in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you conceivably think of a country where nearly one of every 10 
people was butchered in slightly more than three months, at the encouragement 
of the government? Where a man prayed with his wife as he shoveled dirt on her 
and buried her alive at the point of a machete, because her father was Tutsi 
and his was Hutu and this was Rwanda in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 And what can you think of a country where perhaps six out of 10 people then 
took sudden flight in barefoot columns 100 miles long, Hutu refugees bent under 
the weight of all their worldly possessions -- and the even-heavier load of 
their guilt and fear of retribution? 
</P>
<P>
 All of them marched silently to the hellish ant heaps of Zairian camps, where 
the weak would die and the strong would be sustained with poisonous dreams of 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the people whose suffering touched the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But you think to yourself how strangely little it seemed to touch them. 
Somewhere, some time ago, they ran out of tears. Now they roll up their dead in 
mats and lug them curbside like lawn clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 As one refugee lies in the mud in the agony of dysentery, another steps over 
to stir the dinner pot. An old woman shuffles to a trench latrine and is beaten 
to death by young men because she cannot pay the few pennies they are extorting 
at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other refugees whittle away at the bases of big trees for firewood. Then 
thunderstorms blow the trees over. Some people are crushed. Others move forward 
to retrieve more firewood. These people are crammed together but not pulling 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time you plunge into the camps, you know you are looking into faces of 
mass murderers. The young, tough ones move to the front of the crowd, stripped 
of their dignity and their machetes. What do they want? Food, blankets and 
amnesty for their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 You think of the boy of perhaps 8 who could not walk as fast as his parents 
and drifted alone for four days in the moving mob of refugees. And when the mob 
bolted for the bridge across the Rusizi River at the town of Cyangugu, it 
trampled over him like he was another clod of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But only in a place like Rwanda could you rejoice at the boy's fortune. A 
British television crew rescued the bloody youngster and made news of him, and 
viewers far away reached into their pocketbooks to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda is a rich land inhabited by poor people. So you think: Why does getting 
ahead mean so little compared to getting even? Half the time, you cannot even 
distinguish a Tutsi from a Hutu. And could any difference matter this much? 
</P>
<P>
 You think of the block houses, sitting in the shade of hardwoods, overlooking 
banana groves and coffee plantations and misty peaks. Miles and miles of these 
farm villages. All empty today, the crops rotted or looted. Their residents now 
huddle under plastic sheeting on lava beds in Goma, Zaire, covered with lice, 
festered with worms, pelted by torrents of rain, chewed by mosquitoes, dying at 
the rate of one every three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And you think of the rows upon rows of tents that shelter the littlest 
displaced Rwandans -- entire cities of abandoned, lost and orphaned children. 
There isn't enough heart in all the world to make things right for them, though 
a good many are trying, and that knowledge numbs. 
</P>
<P>
 So you leave Rwanda. And what do you think of it now? You think this: The 
shadows of its ghosts darken our days.

BOY KILLED DURING EXTREMIST ATTACK ON EGYPT TOURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first attack on tourists in three months, suspected Muslim extremists 
fired on a tour bus Friday in southern Egypt, killing a Spanish child and 
wounding at least three others. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came a little more than a week before an estimated 20,000 visitors 
converge on Egypt for the U.N. international population conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus was carrying 11 Spanish tourists en route from the ancient temple at 
Dendara to other monuments. The attack occurred about 10:30 a.m. near the town 
of Nag Hammadi, about 288 miles south of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Ministry said in a statement that a 13-year-old Spanish boy, 
identified by the Spanish Embassy in Cairo as Pablo Rochan, was killed in the 
gunfire. Rochan's father, another Spaniard and an Egyptian tour guide were 
wounded, officials said. Police sources said the boy's mother also was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials have increased security in Cairo in advance of the 
conference and hope it will help rebuild Egypt's tourist business, devastated 
by the radicals' bloody 2 1/2-year campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 390 people have been killed during the radicals' campaign of 
violence, including government officials, police, minority Coptic Christians 
and militants.

U.S. PAYS KIN OF FOREIGNERS IN SHOOT-DOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government is making $100,000 payments to each of the families of the 
11 foreign nationals who were killed in the mistaken shoot-down of two Army 
helicopters in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon statement said Defense Secretary William J. Perry decided to make 
the payments to the families of the British, Turkish, French and Kurdish crew 
members "in recognition of the unique circumstances related to the aircraft 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon earlier released a report on the April 14 incident that found the 
pilots of two U.S. F-15s had misidentified the helicopters as Iraqi and that 
crews on an AWACS observation plane had failed to tell the pilots the choppers 
were friendly.

'DISAPPOINTED' JACKSON HINTS AT RUN IN '96; POLITICS: TWO-TIME PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE CALLS CLINTON A 'DREAM-BUSTER.' CAMPAIGN EITHER AS A DEMOCRAT OR 
INDEPENDENT IS POSSIBLE, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sadly disappointed" with President Clinton's performance in office, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson said Friday that he is considering running for President in 1996 
-- either by challenging Clinton for the party's nomination or by running as an 
independent candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The option of running is open," Jackson said in an interview. "And the option 
of running in a general election deserves as much attention as running in the 
primary." 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing either of these courses, Jackson could make Clinton's road back to 
the White House much rougher. If he contests Clinton for the Democratic 
nomination, Jackson's appeal to blacks and other liberal constituencies could 
force Clinton to pay more attention to the left. And this would be at a time 
when the "new Democrat" President would probably want to move to the center to 
answer Republican criticism that his policies are already far too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 A bid by Jackson, who ran for President in 1984 and 1988, would threaten to 
divide the Democratic Party much as Patrick J. Buchanan's challenge to 
President Bush in 1992 disrupted the GOP. And an independent Jackson candidacy 
might well siphon off the black votes that Clinton needs to win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wouldn't be helpful," said Don Sweitzer, political director of 
the Democratic National Committee about a possible Jackson candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that Rev. Jackson, who is a valued adviser, would continue to 
work with the President who has been trying to do a number of things with a 
recalcitrant Congress. We are hopeful that people in the party would not take 
part in anything that would tear the party apart." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson said that he would make no decision about 1996 until after 
November, he took a dim view of the "present direction" of the Clinton 
presidency, which he labeled a "dream buster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who voted for racial equality and workers' rights and economic 
stimulus and education equity as keys to reduce pain and hardship are sadly 
disappointed," he said. He was speaking on behalf of "the vast body of workers, 
blacks, Hispanics and urban America" who helped elect Clinton in 1992, Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson criticized the Democratic Leadership Council for abandoning its 
commitment to social justice. The council, which Clinton headed before he 
sought the White House, served as a crucible for many of the modifications in 
traditional liberal doctrines that Clinton has sought to apply as President. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson derided one product of this approach, the crime bill adopted this week 
by Congress, calling it a combination of "Kool-Aid and cyanide." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime prevention programs are supposed to be the Kool-Aid, he said, while 
the cyanide is the punishment -- specifically the provisions increasing the 
number of federal crimes punishable by death from two to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we got in Kool-Aid is not worth the cyanide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson acknowledged that Clinton has had difficulties with Congress, 
particularly on his economic stimulus program that Republicans in the Senate 
filibustered to death last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While he ponders his decision about 1996, Jackson said, he will be active in 
the 1994 congressional campaigns, working to register voters and then campaign 
for some Democratic officeholders on a "very selective and targeted" basis.

HURRICANE INIKI BLAMED FOR KAUAI POWER OUTAGE

<P>
 The island of Kauai was without electricity for about two hours early Friday, 
apparently a long-delayed blow from Hurricane Iniki. 
</P>
<P>
 Power went out at 4:54 a.m. and was partially restored by 7 a.m., Civil 
Defense officials said. No serious problems were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The power outage was caused by the fall of a static wire, which was believed 
to have been damaged during the hurricane two years ago but did not fail until 
now, officials said.

HEALTH CARE DEBATE MAY BE GIVING WAY TO REVOLUTION: INSURANCE MARKET REFORM; 
LEGISLATION: EVEN A SCALED-BACK EFFORT TO CHANGE INDUSTRY'S RULES CARRIES A BIG 
RISK. WITHOUT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE, IT WOULD DRIVE UP RATES FOR EVERYBODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Out of the ashes of President Clinton's ambitious but ill-fated health reform 
initiative, the outlines of a new revolution are emerging. The term used to 
describe it -- insurance market reforms -- is not likely to stir voters' souls. 
</P>
<P>
 But if enacted by Congress, possibly before its October adjournment, such 
changes would fundamentally alter the rules of the medical insurance industry, 
opening the market to millions of Americans who are unable to buy coverage 
because of an existing illness or simply the high cost of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But insurance market reforms carry a huge risk. 
</P>
<P>
 If not done with precision -- and followed by additional reforms of the type 
envisioned by the President -- such changes could cause instability in the 
system by increasing the number of people without insurance while causing rates 
to rise for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because sweeping insurance reforms -- without a concomitant requirement 
for universal coverage -- would drive up rates for everyone, including the 
newly enfranchised. Their premiums would increase because the young and healthy 
would be likely to drop coverage, secure in the knowledge that they could buy 
coverage if they were to develop a health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, that would leave the insurance pools with an increasingly 
disproportionate share of sick and high-risk people, which would further drive 
up rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pitfalls of such a potential "death spiral," in the words of Sen. 
Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), there is growing pressure on Congress to enact such 
legislation as a minimum first step in health care reform when it returns in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Such action could go a long way toward dispelling the image of a gridlocked 
Congress on an issue that Clinton has made the cornerstone of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who has championed 
comprehensive reform for years, Friday abandoned his quest, suggesting that he 
-- like other White House allies in Congress -- may settle for far more modest 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to such scaled-back efforts, the President said Friday: "I certainly 
don't want to embrace an approach that will do more harm than good and that 
won't achieve our objectives. . . . I'm not prepared to make a final judgment 
on that at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said that insurance 
reforms and other limited steps are "something obviously the President would 
look at." But Panetta, during a lunch with reporters, hastily added: "It isn't 
health reform. No one should be misled." 
</P>
<P>
 The political appeal of enacting insurance market reforms -- at least in the 
short-run -- is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 No single element in the complex health care debate enjoys greater bipartisan 
support. Almost every health reform bill in recent years has proposed 
variations of it. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending discriminatory insurance practices would instantly allay deep-seated 
middle-class fears of losing coverage because of job changes or being priced 
out of the market after major illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reforms will solve many of the problems that the insured, voting 
middle-class is worried about," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser 
Family Foundation, a health care philanthropy based in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics of insurance reforms point to the experience in New York as 
Exhibit No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a law took effect last year that barred insurers from setting premiums 
based on age, sex or health status and required them to guarantee coverage to 
all. In effect, young people were forced to pay as much as older people, even 
though a 25-year-old's medical bills average only one-fourth that of a 
60-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a year, the number of uninsured in New York grew by 500,000 -- 
predominantly the young and healthy -- while rates went up by as much as 170%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are going to choose not to buy coverage are going to be the 
healthy. And if they drop out of the pool, the average risk in the pool becomes 
more expensive," said William Custer, director of research of the independent 
Employee Benefit Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "So either you have to subsidize people to buy coverage or their premiums go 
up," he said. "And if the premiums go up, the more healthy drop out and you 
have a self-defeating system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem with insurance reform without universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Moon, an economist for the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, 
said that insurance reform is "a real tough call because you would improve life 
for some folks. There's no doubt about it. But you would also disadvantage a 
lot of other people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there are ways to guard against unintended consequences, although 
not any one bill now pending in Congress would quite do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 One requirement to avoid, they say, is a so-called full community rating, in 
which customers are charged the same premiums regardless of age, risk or 
geographic location. That is what happened in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have full community rating, you're going to see lots of young folks 
say, 'Adios,' " said Gail Wilensky, former head of the Health Care Financing 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she and others said, federal legislation must take into account 
demographic differences. The bill proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), for instance, would initially allow insurers to charge older people 
no more than four times what it charges the young and healthy. Over time, this 
ratio would be reduced to 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurance experts say that a 2 to 1 "age band" ratio may be more 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Another safeguard would be to impose penalties against those who allow their 
insurance to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to have meaningful penalties against those who drop out or 
don't enter the system until they need it," Marianne Miller, director of 
research at the Health Insurance Assn. of America, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a penalty might work this way: An insurer could not deny coverage to 
someone who has allowed his insurance to lapse but it could write the person a 
policy that excluded coverage for a pre-existing condition for six or 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Another device to ensure greater insurance participation would be to limit the 
enrollment period to perhaps 30 days a year instead of allowing enrollment at 
any time, Miller said. "Again, this would encourage people to buy ahead of 
time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such safeguards, insurance reforms "do not answer some very serious 
problems," said Wilensky. "So don't fool yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's Altman elaborated: "It won't control costs or insure the uninsured -- 
the two biggest challenges we face." Added Edward F. Howard, executive vice 
president of the Alliance for Health Reform, a nonpartisan educational group: 
"You buy some time, but costs will continue to escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilensky, an adviser in President George Bush's 1992 reelection campaign, 
said: "I would do insurance reforms even if that were the only thing -- 
although recognize that you will let some people in who have been shut out and 
you will probably encourage some who have been in to drop out if their premiums 
go up very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she said, "That's a giant step from where we are now."

SECRETARY WINS SUIT AGAINST LAW FIRM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former secretary for the world's largest law firm was sexually harassed by a 
former partner, a jury decided Friday. Rena Weeks, 40, was awarded $50,000 in 
damages in her lawsuit against Martin Greenstein and the 1,600-attorney firm of 
Baker & McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks had sought $600,000 from Greenstein for emotional distress stemming from 
the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-man, six-woman Superior Court jury also found Baker & McKenzie failed 
to take sufficient action to prevent the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which began deliberating Wednesday, must return to court Monday to 
address punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, who worked at the firm for about three months in 1991, alleged that 
Greenstein dumped candies in a breast pocket of her blouse, groped her breast, 
pressed against her from behind and pulled her arms back to "see which one 
(breast) is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Baker & McKenzie argued that Weeks' claims were "the product of 
an overactive imagination" and motivated by reading an office handbook on 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides refused comment Friday.

FIRE THREAT FORCES 2ND EVACUATION AT LAKE IN SIERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Erratic winds Friday afternoon forced the evacuation of campers and cabin 
dwellers at Huntington Lake for a second time as crews battled to stop a raging 
Sierra Nevada forest fire. 
</P>
<P>
 An undetermined number of people staying around the recreational lake were 
ordered to leave at midafternoon as a precaution because of fears the fire 
might reach the lake, said Sierra National Forest spokeswoman Robyn Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 400 residents of Big Creek west of the lake were evacuated Thursday as 
the fire, driven by changing winds, spread first in one direction, then 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no buildings had been burned either at the lake or in Big Creek, 
Smith said. The fire was ignited Wednesday when a squirrel caused an electrical 
short at a Southern California Edison powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was moving toward the southwest end of the lake near the base of the 
dam about 50 miles east of Fresno, Smith said. California 168 was closed Friday 
afternoon at Tamarack Ridge, according to the state Department of 
Transportation.

BULLDOZER'S DRIVER KILLED BY FOREST FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A volunteer bulldozer driver killed as he fled a sudden flare-up in a 
5,000-acre forest fire had chosen a different escape route than other drivers, 
fire officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Bruce Maplesden Jr., 25, died Thursday night fighting the fire about 
two miles from Sams Valley, where more than 100 homes had been evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildly swirling winds kicked up in the early evening, breathing new life into 
the blaze and sending it racing through the rugged canyons where the 
firefighters were trying to dig lines to contain the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fire surged -- covering a quarter of a mile in less than three minutes 
-- the firefighters, and several bulldozers, fled. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervisor had ordered a group of bulldozer drivers out, but Maplesden split 
off from the pack and headed in a different direction, said fire commander Mike 
Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
 Maplesden, 25, apparently tried to run. His burned body was found on the 
ground near the back of the bulldozer, said Deputy Medical Examiner Spencer 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that the fire was set, and if so, the arsonist could face 
felony murder charges for Maplesden's death, Jackson County Sheriff C.W. Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In five western states, more than 22,176 firefighters were battling 28 major 
fires Friday that have already burned 365,780 acres, according to the National 
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a 2,600-acre forest fire danced back and forth in erratic winds 
near the Sierra Nevada town of Big Creek, about 50 miles east of Fresno. The 
shifting winds moved it closer, then veered off to push it toward a wilderness 
area that firefighters will have trouble reaching by foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities predicted total containment by Sunday night. About 400 residents 
and nearby campers had been evacuated.

 Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, the Navy's vice chief of naval operations, will retire 
Feb. 1, the Pentagon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's No. 2 admiral became the center of controversy earlier this year. 
His nomination to head the Pacific command was withdrawn by senior Navy 
officials when some senators criticized his handling of a sexual harassment 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-star admiral has served more than 37 years on active duty, the 
Pentagon said. No nominee for his position was announced.

2 POLICE OFFICERS, DOG SHOT DEAD; MAN ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rookie police officer was shot and killed Friday after approaching a man 
sleeping in a car, and an off-duty officer and his police dog were killed while 
searching for the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who had what appeared to be a dog bite was arrested later. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of police officers searched for much of the afternoon for a possible 
associate of the man in custody. Several blocks were cordoned off as officers 
searched woods and alleys with dogs and helicopters equipped with heat-seeking 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ron Ryan Jr., 26, the son of a veteran police lieutenant, was shot 
five times after he approached a car in a church parking lot on the city's East 
Side. He had been on the force a little more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He engaged in a scuffle with the suspect, who drew a firearm, shot Officer 
Ryan, stood over him and shot him again, and removed the officer's handgun," 
Police Chief William Finney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors reported the shooting, and Ryan was taken to St. Paul-Ramsey Medical 
Center, where he died during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sealed off the neighborhood and began a search that eventually involved 
more than 100 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the search, Officer Timothy Jones, 37, and his dog, Laser, were killed 
in a wooded area of the neighborhood. Friday was his day off, but he had rushed 
to help after hearing of Ryan's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bang, bang, bang. Then there were about 15 or 30 more shots," said 
Paula Leikam of Burnsville, Minn., who was visiting relatives in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, police captured a man who had what appeared to be a dog 
bite on his torso. He was treated at the St. Paul hospital and taken to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old man from Mason City, Iowa, had not yet been charged. Ramsey 
County Atty. Tom Foley said he expects criminal charges to be filed next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason City police said the man in custody was wanted for a probation violation 
there. Investigator Frank Stearns said the man had been convicted of possession 
of firearms and narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason City Police Chief Duane L. Jewell said the man was believed to have been 
with another man wanted for attempted murder in Iowa.

TEACHER WHO DISOBEYED SILENCE LAW LOSES COURT FIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge declined Friday to order the reinstatement of a social studies teacher 
who refused to obey a moment-of-silence law at the start of his class. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Frank Hull rejected Brian Bown's request for a preliminary 
injunction against the Gwinnett County school district.The district said Bown 
was merely suspended with pay from South Gwinnett High School pending a Sept. 6 
hearing before the county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown, 41, who says he was fired, had said earlier he would abide by whatever 
the judge decided. He has also filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law, 
which went into effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown, who contends that the law is an unconstitutional attempt to return 
prayer to the classroom, had continued a lecture during the "quiet reflection" 
period Monday, the first day of school. He left Tuesday after telling 
administrators he would not comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Hartley, an attorney for the district, said Bown's disruptive behavior 
prompted the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district contends that the new law, which requires that all schools 
observe a daily "moment of quiet reflection on the anticipated activities," 
does not violate Bown's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, school officials say, Bown could have simply left the classroom after 
the principal announced the beginning of the 40-second interval over the 
intercom. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not mandated to do anything. A teacher is not required to enforce, 
implement or enact this law," Hartley told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He chose to disrupt his class, talking with students about his own beliefs 
and his philosophy. He did this for his own personal agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley also said the incident occurred after the high school principal had 
told Bown: "You are not to disrupt the moment; you are not to disrupt the 
classroom."

 Peggy Fears, 91, one of the legendary Ziegfeld Follies showgirls. After a 
successful career as a chorus girl on Broadway, she moved west to try 
Hollywood.She made her screen debut in 1935 in "Lottery Lover," a light 
romantic film in which a shy sailor wins a lottery to get a date with a 
"Follies girl." The breakup of her marriage to New York theater impresario A.C. 
Blumenthal was stormy. Miss Fears said he sent her roses but never paid her 
$20,000 annual alimony, hired a detective to follow her and tapped her 
telephone, playing her recorded conversations for his friends. The frustrated 
starlet took a singing engagement in a Hollywood nightclub in 1938, saying she 
was "down to my last string of pearls." After her career faded, she was one of 
the early residents of Fire Island in New York, where she opened the Pines 
Yacht Club. On Wednesday in Montrose, Calif.

WILSON OFFERS CONCESSIONS TO PRESERVE CUTS IN WELFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday sought to preserve recent cuts in welfare benefits 
by offering to exempt disabled recipients and certain categories of children in 
order to satisfy court objections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a formal request to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, 
Wilson asked the Clinton Administration to endorse the cuts and the exemptions 
as soon as possible "to allow us to continue our comprehensive welfare 
reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's plan would create a two-tiered benefit system for welfare families in 
California and for the first time permit certain classes of recipients to 
receive more money than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, most families with three eligible welfare recipients 
would be entitled to a maximum monthly grant of $594. But families of three 
that include a disabled adult would be given a higher amount -- $633 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a single child on welfare who is entitled to an exemption would be 
able to collect a maximum monthly benefit of $311. Those not eligible for the 
exemption -- such as the child of illegal immigrants -- would get $293. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala has said that she is likely to give the state authorization for the 
cuts, but she has also indicated that she may ask for revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Social Services officials estimated that the new 
exemptions would affect about 80,000 families, or 8.4% of the state's Aid for 
Families With Dependent Children caseload. They asked that they be allowed to 
make the changes effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the exemptions would increase welfare costs for the state and 
federal government by about $30 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has made a restructuring of the welfare system a theme of his 
reelection campaign, urged the Clinton Administration to act quickly on 
California's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Clinton Administration) has a choice to encourage states in their bold 
and innovative reforms, or to further tighten the screws that trap millions in 
a lifetime of welfare dependency," he wrote Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's appeal for the federal approval of a new benefit system came three 
days after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his request that it 
reconsider a decision that invalidated across-the-board welfare reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a three-member panel of the court ruled that a 1.3% welfare cut that 
the state put into effect in 1992 should not have been approved by the federal 
government. It said the George Bush Administration had violated federal law 
when it endorsed the cut because it had failed to consider the effect the 
reductions would have on poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said although California had argued that the cuts would serve as an 
incentive for recipients to go to work, the appellate panel failed to see how 
it could be any incentive for those who were disabled or for children. 
</P>
<P>
 In requesting new authorization from the Clinton Administration, Wilson sought 
to remove the court's objections by exempting the disabled and certain 
categories of children from the 1992 cut and two more cuts in 1993 and 1994. 
Wilson did not offer to make refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Claire Pastore, an attorney for the Western Center on Law & Poverty, said 
the state had so narrowly defined those who would be exempt that she did not 
believe it had resolved the court's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal defines as disabled only those families in which an adult has 
been designated to receive Social Security benefits because of an inability to 
work. The other exemptions apply to child-only cases -- those in which only the 
children in a family are eligible for aid. However, Wilson does not propose to 
exempt the so-called citizen children, those whose parents are illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the state) would like to pretend the 9th Circuit only has a problem 
with disabled and child-only cases, but the 9th Circuit had a much broader 
problem," Pastore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court was very concerned about whether the (Bush Administration), keeping 
in mind the purpose of AFDC is to feed and house low-income children, had 
adequately considered the effect of the cuts on children and on everybody who 
could not get work." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastore said the state had exempted large numbers of families from its 
mandatory job training program because it found them unable to work. She said 
those families also should be exempted from the cuts.

SACRAMENTO FILE: SENATE OKS BAN ON WITNESSES' SALE OF INTERVIEWS TO NEWS MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sparked by the O.J. Simpson case, legislation prohibiting witnesses from 
selling their stories to the news media before or during a trial has been 
approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A 28-2 vote sent the bill (AB501) by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) back to the lower house for concurrence in Senate amendments, which 
would move it to Gov. Pete Wilson's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was sparked by the rise of tabloid television news shows such as 
"Hard Copy" and "Inside Edition" that pay witnesses for interviews. Supermarket 
tabloid newspapers such as the National Enquirer also pay for such stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Payment for testimony jeopardizes the very integrity of the judicial system 
by compromising the testimony of material witnesses," Brown said. "This bill 
protects the quality of our judicial system while respecting freedom of 
speech."

ALLAN HOUSER; PATRIARCH OF NATIVE AMERICAN SCULPTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apache sculptor Allan Houser, a National Medal of Arts winner who was 
considered the patriarch of Native American sculptors, has died at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Houser died of colon cancer Monday night at his Santa Fe home. 
</P>
<P>
 President George Bush presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 1992, 
honoring his work, which often portrays mother and child, warriors on 
horseback, or Apache dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Houser's sculptures have been shown in museums and galleries worldwide. His 
style ranged from dramatic realism to abstract geometric forms.  
</P>
<P>
 Experimentation was crucial to his work, Houser said in a 1991 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what keeps you alive. I'd get bored if I did the same thing all the 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Landis, curator of art at the Albuquerque Museum, called Houser's death 
a universal loss: "He was the leading Indian sculptor, but the loss goes far 
beyond ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Houser's work is in the British Royal Collection, the Smithsonian Institution 
in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Linden 
Museum in Stuttgart, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist presented a peace sculpture to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in 
April. It was a monumental bronze of an Indian holding aloft a sacred pipe as 
an offering to the Great Spirit, titled "May We Have Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Houser called it a gift from Native Americans to all people. 
</P>
<P>
 Born near Apache, Okla., Houser was the son of Sam Haozous, who was a grandson 
of Apache chief Mangas Coloradas. 
</P>
<P>
 Houser once said he changed the spelling of his surname, which means "pulling 
roots," to make it easier to pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Santa Fe Indian School in the 1930s and received commissions from 
the federal Works Progress Administration and the Interior Department. In the 
1940s he received two Guggenheim fellowships. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 20 years of teaching, Houser quit in 1975 to devote all his 
time to his art, working in stone, wood and bronze.

BEN YELLEN; IMPERIAL VALLEY ACTIVIST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Yellen, 86, Imperial Valley curmudgeon who lost his medical license for 
gross negligence and incompetence. Yellen's 40-year practice in Brawley ended 
over his injection of drugs he concocted into a 16-month-old child who died.But 
Yellen, a one-term Brawley city councilman and frequent political candidate, 
was probably better known for his endless efforts to thwart government with 
letters from his mimeograph machine. "Never write one letter, always write 400" 
was his credo. In the 1970s he won national attention, including an appearance 
on "60 Minutes," over his battle to convert the Imperial Valley to small farms. 
He said the Reclamation Act of 1902 precluded federal water distribution to any 
farm larger than 160 acres. But the U.S. Supreme Court defeated him by 
exempting large landowners in the Imperial Valley from the federal law. On July 
1 in Brawley.

GAMING CONTROL BILL CLEARS MAJOR HURDLE; LEGISLATURE: PANEL AGREES TO 
COMPROMISE MEASURE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE COMMISSION TO REGULATE THE CARD 
CLUB INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation to establish a powerful gaming control commission to regulate 
California's booming $7.5-billion-a-year card club industry cleared a major 
hurdle Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping proposal was approved by a joint Assembly-Senate conference 
committee and sent to the floors of both houses for consideration by Wednesday, 
the final day of the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily lobbied compromise bill is the result of two weeks of intense 
behind-the-scenes negotiations featuring an unlikely set of players, including 
Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very strong regulatory reform proposal," said Hayden, who is 
co-authoring the measure with Democratic Assemblymen Curtis Tucker Jr. of 
Inglewood and Phillip Isenberg of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the state's 265 clubs are loosely regulated by local governments and a 
three-person unit in Lungren's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would set up a larger gaming control division in Lungren's office to 
investigate card club applicants, enforce the state's gambling laws, and 
establish a five-member commission to approve card club licenses and discipline 
club operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under strict conflict-of-interest provisions, the commissioners would be 
prohibited from employment in the gaming industry for 10 years before 
appointment and for three years after serving on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reform provision is intended to limit the influence of campaign 
contributions from gaming sources by restricting the donations made by card 
rooms to candidates for attorney general and local card club initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Legislature's rules, the proposal had to be approved by the 
committee by Friday. For much of the day, the proposal's fate was up in the air 
as lawmakers wrestled with who would appoint the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, they broke the deadlock by agreeing to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to 
name three members and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and the 
Senate Rules Committee to name one apiece.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would prevent an undue concentration of clubs by restricting 
new clubs from starting within five miles of existing card rooms in Los Angeles 
County. The bill's backers said this would not restrict development of a 
contemplated casino in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As an accommodation to Hayden, several disputed provisions were stripped from 
the bill. They would have placed a cap on the number of new card tables in Los 
Angeles County and for the first time would have allowed publicly traded 
companies to own card clubs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hollywood Park is expected to push another bill that would allow 
public firms to own card clubs in California. A card club recently opened at 
the Inglewood racetrack, but because Hollywood Park is a public corporation, it 
must lease the facility to a concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the committee who agreed to the compromise were Hayden, Tucker, 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno).

BATTLE OF BRITAIN'S 'NIMBIES': CELEBRITIES FIGHT PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new word has been introduced this summer into the lexicon of England's 
"chattering class" -- those who consider themselves opinion makers in media and 
literary circles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "Nimby," whose practitioners are Nimbies and live in a broad area across 
southern England called Nimbyshire. As in the United States, Nimby is an 
acronym for "Not in My Back Yard." 
</P>
<P>
 It generally refers to celebrity campaigners for liberal causes who have moved 
to the country and howl in anguish when other people want to share in the rural 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 And it pits them, under the guise of protecting the environment, against those 
who would build new roads to relieve the horrendous traffic jams in rustic 
villages.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nimbies' detractors gleefully charge them with hypocrisy -- in Britain, 
about the worst sin of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue caught the public eye this summer when protesters objected to a 
four-lane bypass around Bath that would, they said, destroy scenic countryside. 
A leading demonstrator was Bel Mooney, a well-known writer, journalist and 
television personality who is married to Jonathan Dimbleby, a leading anchorman 
for TV documentaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Mooney camped out in a yurt, began fasting, made friends with some transients 
and reaped acres of space in the newspapers. She climbed a tree and promised 
not to come down -- for a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as she posed for photographers, critics carped that she and her 
husband are actually based in London and make frequent use of the M-4, the 
freeway that links the capital with the Bath and Bristol area. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, they asked, had she been when that superhighway necessarily cut through 
swaths of Berkshire, Wiltshire and Avon to speed city dwellers to the 
countryside on weekends? 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney tired of camping out and repaired to her comfortable country estate in 
Upper Swainswick, near Bath. Some transients, who were evicted from their 
campsite, asked if they could pitch tents in a corner of her spacious fields. 
She said no, explaining later that the land was unsuitable for campers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Jilly Cooper, a well-known author of glitzy novels, organized a protest 
against a new 83-home development in her beloved Gloucestershire in the 
Cotswolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please, please consider other measures," she pleaded with local 
council members. "I do love it passionately and feel it should not be ruined by 
developers in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The bubbly Cooper is supported by other residents, who have protested by 
erecting an Indian-style totem pole. Cooper said she would get other 
celebrities to join her in a "dance 'round the totem pole" to prevent 
construction from going ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan, in the village of Turville in Buckinghamshire, to turn an empty 
school into a holiday location for London inner-city children has been opposed 
by Alistair Horne, an esteemed historian and biographer, and Lord Quinton, 
former head of Trinity College at Oxford University. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Spectator magazine, Jeremy Paxton, the abrasive anchorman for the 
"Newsnight" TV program, sharply criticized those objecting to the proposed use 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inner-city children are the very thing the new residents of the villages of 
southern England are trying to escape," he wrote. "For them, the countryside is 
some sort of Shangri-La, the inner cities some awful Hieronymus Bosch 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton complained that houses in the village "increasingly are occupied by the 
well-heeled, weekenders and the elderly. First, the school closes, then the 
village shop. The pub remains, but it is serving ersatz Thai chicken to 
permanently tanned people in immaculate 'off-road' vehicles which have never 
been off the road."  
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Wheatcroft, a well-known writer, countered in the Daily Telegraph: 
"It is not so much easy as inevitable to make fun of the massed ranks of 
Nimbyshire. Whether it is strictly fair to do so, I am not so sure. 
Nimby-baiting is itself now a licensed field sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "But aren't we all Nimbies at heart? Surely we are -- and can only be -- 
humbugs and hypocrites when it comes to the 'environment.' None of us wants to 
live next to a power station or an airport or a sewage farm. Yet we all use 
electricity, we all travel by air and we all go to the lavatory. We are all 
Nimbies now -- and quite right, too."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; LYN NOFZIGER JOINS REAGAN ALUMNI ON 
HUFFINGTON TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Mike Huffington's Senate campaign headquarters began to look even 
more like a Ronald Reagan Administration alumni meeting this week with the 
addition of ex-White House communications director Lyn Nofziger. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's campaign was getting advice from 
another presidential-level voice in Paul Begala, the political adviser in the 
Clinton White House. Begala said he would not be on the senator's campaign 
payroll, but he was providing advice as "part of my work for the party." 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers join staffs for both candidates that are already stacked with 
nationally known veterans. The high-level interest reflects the stakes involved 
in California's Senate race, where national leaders from both political parties 
say the outcome could be an indicator of President Clinton's chances for 
reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign said Nofziger, President Reagan's former press 
secretary, will help advise the campaign on media strategy. He will continue to 
work out of his office in Washington, commuting periodically to the campaign's 
headquarters in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Nofziger was brought into the campaign by Edward J. Rollins, who managed 
Reagan's 1984 reelection and served in the White House as a political adviser. 
Rollins joined the Huffington campaign last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Senate campaign also includes Richard Wirthlin, who served as 
the pollster for the Reagan White House, and Ken Khachigian, a former Reagan 
speech writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign also announced a number of other staff changes that were 
portrayed as a reorganization to prepare for the fall campaign. They include a 
new campaign manager, James Moore, who moved to California recently from a job 
in Alexandria, Va., with Rollins' consulting company. Former campaign manager 
Bob Schuman moved back to his home in San Diego, but remains on the payroll as 
a senior adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Also joining Nofziger on the campaign's communications staff is Brian Lungren, 
a Sacramento-based consultant and brother of state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren.

PAKISTANI BEHEADED FOR RAPING YOUNG BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pakistani was beheaded Friday in Mecca for kidnaping and raping a young boy, 
the Interior Ministry announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement said the Pakistani seized the boy from a public street and 
took him to an isolated area. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was tried and convicted by a Sharia, or Islamic law, court. 
</P>
<P>
 Beheadings are carried out in public squares opposite mosques, usually Friday 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 people have been beheaded this year, including Asians, Africans 
and Saudi nationals, mostly for smuggling and peddling drugs.

BISHOPS' PANEL ON GAY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a gay man, I found the article "Episcopal Bishops Panel Completes Study on 
Gay Issues" (Aug. 6) interesting, encouraging and a little amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I have to give the bishops credit for "wrestling with" the issue, the 
baby was thrown out with the bathwater long ago.I, along with many of my gay 
brothers and sisters, have stopped worrying about what the churches think of 
us. Most of us have gone beyond the narrow doctrines of religion and have found 
self-acceptance and strength within our own communities. It is as one clergyman 
who unsuccessfully fought the intolerance in his own church once said to me: 
"Why would you want to be a part of a church which hated you?" I don't.

THE SOUND OF SILENCE; NORMALLY TALKATIVE CLINTON IS NOW MOSTLY MUM . . . BUT 
FOR JUST HOW LONG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation first became aware of Bill Clinton's fondness for talking -- and 
talking, and talking -- the night he gave a seemingly interminable nominating 
speech for Michael S. Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic Convention. Clinton's 
biggest applause line came when he said " . . . and in conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity with Clinton's readiness to share his thoughts on just about 
anything has of course grown enormously during his presidency. Along with 
virtually every other politician, Clinton relishes exposure, whether at 
formally called news conferences, during brief photo sessions with visiting 
dignitaries, while jogging, while shopping, while strolling around or on MTV. 
His operating idea has pretty clearly been that while he's being seen there's 
no reason he shouldn't be heard as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists welcome this chattiness; it often makes for catchy sound bites, if 
not necessarily for hard news. But the President's political advisers, 
recognizing that loquacity is not synonymous with communication and that 
over-exposure can invite boredom, have been worrying increasingly about 
Clinton's talking too much about too many different things too many times 
during a day. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leon E. Panetta became White House chief of staff he made it an early 
item of business to raise this issue. His advice to his boss seems to have been 
based on that classic Ring Lardner line: " 'Shut up,' he explained." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, say people who monitor these things, has in fact curbed his 
volubility, resisting manifold opportunities and, no doubt, temptations to 
think aloud and talk off the top of his head. How long this restraint will last 
has become a subject of much speculation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even under maximum self-restraint it's impossible that Clinton will 
ever be confused with his legendarily close-lipped predecessor, Calvin 
Coolidge, who used words as if each one cost him money. Once at a dinner party, 
so the story goes, a woman seated next to Coolidge said, "Mr. President, I bet 
my husband that I could get you to say three consecutive words." 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose," said Silent Cal.

A CLOSER EYE ON LOAN FRAUD; SBA MODIFIES ITS PROCEDURES AS SIX ARE ACCUSED OF 
FALSIFYING APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week's federal grand jury indictments of six people on charges of 
falsifying applications for Small Business Administration loans were welcome 
evidence that the SBA has recognized problems and is moving to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of court action against those charged, the SBA already 
has revamped some procedures. All six defendants are or were residents of 
Southern California, three of them from Orange County, and investigators said 
fraudulent filings in this region are more widespread than elsewhere. So tax 
statements filed by Southern California loan applicants are now cross-checked 
with the statements they file with the Internal Revenue Service. The agency is 
considering making that practice nationwide, because the problem is spreading. 
That would be smart. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under investigation are loan packagers, who gather the various forms 
needed to apply to the SBA and help applicants fill them out. A particularly 
disturbing aspect of the indictments was that all the defendants are originally 
from Southeast Asia. SBA officials said that some packagers specialize in 
customers from immigrant communities, who may have problems with English and be 
unfamiliar with lending practices in this country. That could make them easy 
prey for the unscrupulous, though SBA officials said most packagers are 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said the six people indicted used false information to obtain 
nearly $1 million worth of government-backed loans, all of which went into 
default. The recession and the savings and loan crisis have made it more 
difficult to get normal bank loans in recent years, making the SBA guarantees 
especially important to small borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 When an SBA-backed loan goes into default, it is of course the taxpayers who 
ultimately pay. The SBA thus must be vigilant, while also taking care not to 
overburden those seeking help, especially in emergencies like the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan packagers are not regulated now; if there turns out to be widespread 
abuse in their ranks, that will have to change.

ELECTION WATCH; BORDER BROUHAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With less than 10 weeks to go before Election Day, Gov. Pete Wilson is back on 
the Mexican border replaying a favorite campaign theme: illegal immigration. He 
even published an open letter to President Clinton complaining that Clinton had 
moved quickly to keep Cuban refugees out of Florida while continuing to turn 
his "back on California's illegal immigration crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban analogy simply does not wash. Cuba presents essentially a diplomatic 
problem involving a longtime enemy of the United States. By contrast, Mexico is 
a friendly neighbor long depended on for plentiful labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving aside the bogus Cuban comparison, we agree with some things the 
governor says. Yes, we should stop illegal immigration at the border. Illegal 
immigrants should not be entitled to government social benefits intended for 
citizens. Yes, some border-area hospitals are unduly burdened by foreign 
patients who abuse the public health system. And the federal government should 
help with the considerable expense placed on the state by immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow Wilson never discusses the underlying magnet that draws the 
migrants here: jobs. Nowhere does he acknowledge that Californians use illegal 
immigrants for cheap labor. It is notable that his open letter omits any call 
for stronger enforcement of penalties, including fines and prison terms, on the 
employers of illegal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 We see two problems here: illegal migration on the southern border and 
half-truths from the governor's office.

CONGRESSIONAL VOTES ON GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Terrible Weapons, Terrible Votes," Commentary, Aug. 19: 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal Bishop Edmond Lee Browning's comments on the representatives' votes 
on gun control show a naivete that I often see in your editorials. A man who 
intends to commit a robbery, rape, or murder does not worry too much about 
following gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The do-gooders always want to disarm the law-abiding citizen. Thousands of 
Rwandans would still be alive if they had guns in their homes. The answer has 
been and always will be to severely punish people who use guns to commit 
crimes.

 After reading Browning's column, I thought I need not write my own letter as 
he has said it all. I do, however, wish to make a suggestion. We should follow 
the example of those people who, enraged by the senseless slaughter on the 
highways by drivers who drink, have formed the organization called Mother 
Against Drunk Driving. Their success should be duplicated by the rest of us, 
Mothers Against Weapons, and used to control that other irresponsible group, 
the National Rifle Assn.

 In response to congressional resistance against an "assault" (read "militia") 
weapons ban, Browning asks, "Why would we want private citizens to carry such 
weapons? Of what possible use are they to civilized society?" May I suggest 
that he study the words of people like Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, 
Henry, Lee, Paine, Mason and a score of others on this subject? 
</P>
<P>
 He's absolutely right in terming this "a deeply moral issue." There can be no 
higher calling for a free people than resisting tyranny.

possibly be opposed to a ban on assault weapons?" Precisely because Congress is 
not composed solely of good and decent people.

 The battle in Congress over the passage of the Clinton Administration's crime 
bill ("The Assault on Common Sense," editorial, Aug. 23) was not about crime 
control, gun control or the cost of big-ticket social programs. It was simply 
American politics as usual; ugly and not very effective. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Co. would have signed a pact with 
the devil to be able to claim legislative victory and a defeat of the National 
Rifle Assn. Even The Times reported that the final hours of arm-twisting and 
deal-making revolved not around the issues, but around party loyalty and the 
need for the Democrats to claim a big win in preparation for the November 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as the (useless) assault weapons ban and any semblance of his social 
proposals remained, President Clinton would have found a way to support the 
compromised bill. The purpose of politics, after all, is to win.

 Neither "hug a thug" nor "drop a cop" rhetoric passed the crime bill in the 
House. The compromise guys did. By putting problem-solving dialogue ahead of 
partisan potshots, they broke the gridlock. May their kind increase! 
</P>
<P>
 When more legislators engage in problem-solving debate rather than partisan 
labels, government will cost less, accomplish more, neuter special interests, 
serve the people better and restore trust in government.

DOMENIGONI RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Green's Aug. 15 commentary on the Metropolitan Water District's 
reservoir project in southwestern Riverside County contends that Southern 
California doesn't need it. We must respectfully disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland faces water shortages in both the near and long term due to 
rising demands and reductions in the reliability of imported supplies resulting 
from regulatory decisions and increased public awareness of environmental 
values. Metropolitan and its member agencies have embarked on an integrated 
resource planning process that has involved local retail and ground-water 
agencies, consumers, agricultural users, the environmental community, business 
groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The process findings, in which Green participated, echo her call for 
additional investments in developing additional local water resources by 
aggressively pursuing conservation, waste-water reclamation, ground-water 
recovery and desalination efforts. The findings also reiterate the importance 
of maintaining and securing imported supplies from the State Water Project and 
the Colorado River.  
</P>
<P>
 However, a common thread throughout the planning process was the need for 
additional ground-water and surface-water storage, which must work together. 
Even with the expected tripling of conservation and water recycling efforts by 
the year 2010, the Southland will fall short of meeting water demands without 
adequate storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan's reservoir project will help right that imbalance; and contrary 
to Green's assertion, we anticipate the monthly cost to ratepayers to be very 
modest for the benefits received. The reservoir provides the critical storage 
capacity needed to take advantage of the opportunities when there is surplus 
water runoff from snow and rain in Northern California or along the Colorado 
River. Had the reservoir been completed in 1993, it could have been half-filled 
by the year's storms, providing enough water for about a million families for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir also meets our critical needs for additional emergency reserves. 
Without action, Southern California could be isolated from a major portion of 
its water in the event of an emergency, such as an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With the memories of the state's recent six-year drought lingering, Green is 
to be commended for reminding your readers of the importance of Southern 
California's water resources. However, those memories and the promise of future 
droughts also confirm the need for Metropolitan's Domenigoni Valley reservoir 
project as well as ground-water storage.

 Green's article was in the right church, but it was in the wrong pew. The 
Domenigoni Reservoir project is symptomatic of a larger disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem is that of unaccountable and unresponsive political 
leadership in the water community and on the MWD board specifically. The MWD 
Board of Directors must be held accountable for this billion-dollar blunder. 
The 52 men and women on this board voted for Domenigoni, knowing that water to 
fill it would be "unreliable" under the best of circumstances. Compounding this 
travesty is the fact that the MWD board refused to consider any of the 
innovative and cost-effective approaches to water storage and supply 
augmentation that Green articulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is running out; we have a serious water problem. Our population continues 
to grow while we are experiencing a net decrease in our imported water 
supplies. It is time for us to stop examining the symptoms and start curing the 
disease.

adult educational and placement program. Although he is retarded, he has a 
strong social awareness.

<P>
 No one was aware that Michael was going out on the streets and talking to the 
homeless. He didn't understand why these people were in the position they were 
in, and unlike the majority of us, asked them. He was very moved by their 
problems and is trying to help. Hence, the letter.

 The homeless live in cardboard boxes, missions and parks. They push shopping 
carts full of clothes, food and cans. They get money from cans and bottles and 
dig in dumpsters for clothes, food, cans, bottles and newspapers. They also 
panhandle for money at the malls, Vons and street corners. They also wash car 
windows for money. They wear torn clothes from the dumpsters. Often people 
throw clothes away so the homeless can get them out of the dumpsters. Some 
people sit down next to the homeless at the bus stop, while others won't sit 
near them. Some people say hello to the homeless to be nice, while others 
ignore them. Some homeless don't take showers so they stink but they need to be 
clean to look for a job.

 Mrs. Thomas used to live with her parents. She was from Ohio and raised by a 
good Catholic family. She is 54 years old and her parents are probably dead or 
too old to keep her. She doesn't have a place to stay and take a shower so she 
can be clean for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some homeless that don't want a job or a place to stay. There are 
some homeless who don't want to talk to you and they talk to themselves and say 
bad things. They even want to hit you and they are violent to each other. 
Homeless people sometimes spend their money on beer and drugs. I feel like the 
homeless are out on the street trying to stay alive without getting shot or 
raped. I would like to see them get off the streets and find a place to stay 
and look for a job. I think the homeless should find a job and get help.

YANCEY, 56, DIES; WON 7 ON TOUR; GOLF: LONG-TIME MANIC-DEPRESSIVE SUFFERS A 
HEART ATTACK WHILE PRACTICING FOR SENIOR TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bert Yancey, who battled demons far worse than the ones that denied him a 
major championship of golf over a 30-year career, collapsed and died of a heart 
attack while practicing Friday for a Senior PGA Tour event at Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey, preparing for the first round of the $500,000 Senior PGA Franklin 
Quest Championship at the Park Meadow Golf Course, twice left the practice 
range complaining of chest and arm pains. 
</P>
<P>
 After a check of his blood pressure, Yancey said he felt better and returned 
to the driving range. He hit five or six more balls, complained of more pain, 
returned to a first-aid tent and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken by ambulance to the Park City Family Health and Emergency Center. 
Paramedics performed CPR en route, but Yancey was pronounced dead at 10:55 
a.m., a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey, a seven-time PGA event winner from 1966 to 1972, joined the senior 
tour in 1988 in what turned out to be the final comeback in the career of a man 
long tormented by manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition at last controlled with medication and psychotherapy, Yancey 
used the senior tour as a vehicle to speak out about the disease that had made 
much of his life a living hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are getting diagnosed for it because more of them are asking for 
help," Yancey said in a recent interview. "The stigma has to be eliminated. 
It's OK to go for help; it's OK to go to a hospital; it's OK to take medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey, a Chipley, Fla., native, who grew up in Tallahassee, was found to be 
manic-depressive in 1975 and lithium was prescribed for him after 14 
frightening years on a mental roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered his first episode as a third-year cadet at West Point in 1961, 
spending nine months in a Valley Forge, Pa., mental hospital after suffering a 
nervous breakdown. Mental illness was not diagnosed at the time and Yancey was 
released after undergoing a series of electro-shock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of wide emotional swings and considerable intellect, Yancey joined the 
PGA full time in 1964. He won the Azalea, Memphis and Portland opens in 1966, 
the Greater Dallas Open in 1967, the Atlantic Classic in 1969, the Bing Crosby 
National Pro Am in 1970 and the 1972 American Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned $690,337 on the PGA Tour and another $404,625 on the senior circuit 
but never won a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit obsessed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, he finished third at the Masters and the U.S. Open; he once tied for 
third at the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey led the 1968 U.S. Open by six shots but shot a 76 on the final day and 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Weiskopf once told the Washington Post that he had watched Yancey fall 
apart on that fateful day at the Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the most discouraged look I've ever seen on anyone," Weiskopf recalled 
of Yancey's collapse. "Defeated. Even before he was finished. Right after that, 
as I look back, the personality change began." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton, one of the leaders Friday in the Franklin Quest, told the 
Associated Press that Yancey had such an obsession with winning the Masters 
that he used to construct detailed papier-mache models of the greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible that he played out here as long and as good as he did," 
Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey hit bottom in 1974, when he arrived in Japan for a series of golf 
exhibitions and proclaimed himself "a messiah" who was going to rid the 
Japanese of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey then tried to jump out of a window, failing only, as he recalled, 
"because I couldn't get the latch open." 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next three months in a Philadelphia mental hospital. Months 
later, and only two weeks before his illness was diagnosed, Yancey climbed up a 
painter's ladder at a New York airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually felt Howard Hughes was getting in touch with me to dispense money 
for cancer," Yancey said in a 1981 interview. "I climbed a ladder at LaGuardia 
and started shouting that cancer was going to be cured." 
</P>
<P>
 After his problem was diagnosed, Yancey was put on lithium. But, in 1977, he 
experienced another of what he called his "manic highs," and was arrested in 
South Carolina for indecent exposure and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Yancey was taken away in a straitjacket and spent 30 days in a 
state mental hospital. He was chained to his bed for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent three of the most unbelievable weeks of my life in that ward," Yancey 
said in a 1978 Washington Post interview. "I had human feces all over the wall 
of the cell. And it was a cell, it wasn't a room. Bugs, roaches, flies, just 
crawling all over and I was tied down." 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey retired from the tour in 1976 after missing the cut in all 26 
tournaments he entered. In ensuing years, there would be more dark periods and 
aborted golf comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey said he at last got his mental health under control in 1984 when he 
started taking the drug Tegretol. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 interview, Yancey conceded that his battle would always continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control is not a cure," he said. "I don't expect to ever exist without 
medication, without psychotherapy, without friends who will tell me, 'You're 
getting off the wall.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey is survived by his wife, Cheryl, three sons, two daughters and two 
grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were incomplete, a PGA spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real tragedy," golfer Tommy Aaron said. "He'd had a tough time all his 
life dealing with his mental illness. He had a great career on the regular 
tour, but he never played out here (on the senior tour) to that level."

STRIKE HITTING HARD, FROM HEARTBROKEN FAN TO BORED ANNOUNCER

 Dear Angels and Brewers, 
</P>
<P>
 My name is Jeff and I am 8 1/2 years old. I was looking forward to the Angels 
and Brewers game on the 24th. Now that you went on strike I can't. I don't want 
you to go on strike and lots of other people don't either. 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. It was going to be my first major league game to see in my whole life.

<P>
 Mrs. Porter: "Coffee, Ross?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ross: "Speaking of coffee, in 1940 Bill Cozzo of Brooklyn, N.Y., had 52 cups 
of coffee at breakfast, 23 cups with cream and 29 cups black. Sugar in 22 cups. 
He was a southpaw. He used a standard eight-ounce cup, white with a blue 
border. It's still the record and. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds: Woman screaming, front door slamming and car racing away. 
</P>

 Ross (running out front): "She's still in her yellow bathrobe that she bought 
in Chicago in 1993 and that she has worn only 27 times. Oh, hi neighbors, I 
didn't see you. Speaking of neighbors, that reminds me. . . ."

 Southern California baseball fans are providing the answer to the baseball 
strike and overblown player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 I have visited minor league baseball stadiums in Adelanto, Rancho Cucamonga 
and Lake Elsinore. The prices for my family of six were unbelievably 
affordable. The crowds were large, enthusiastic and family oriented. No one 
seemed to care who was hitting the home runs, beating the throw to second or 
jawing with the umpire. The beautiful stadiums, the pageantry and colorful 
surroundings are what the fans really enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Build a stadium, they will come.

 I would be very surprised if there was not at least one ballplayer out of some 
700 who is thinking: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Fehr, I never said that you had the right to take my hard-earned money 
away from me and my family. I never agreed that by striking we would 
necessarily be helping future players (a la Curt Flood, etc.) I never said that 
a reasonable 'cap' would not be in my best interests. What I do say is that I 
plan to show up for work at our ballpark, and since I am available for work, I 
expect to be paid my normal salary."

 With the strike entering its second week and no solutions in sight, I propose 
that the rosters be cut from the current 24 players to 19. Each team would have 
five starting pitchers, two relievers and 12 position players.  
</P>
<P>
 First, and most importantly, this would save the owners as much as $6 million 
per year in salaries if each player is earning the league average of $1.2 
million. Hence, the salary-cap proposal could be withdrawn by management. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting the rosters would also lessen the watering-down effect that the last 
25 years of expansion has created.  
</P>
<P>
 The players' union might find this unacceptable, but the owners already 
lowered the roster from 25 to 24, and with layoffs in all industries 
nationwide, it is about time baseball had its turn at bat.

 Now is the best chance the Angels have had in 25 years to improve their 
ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi needs to promote the Vancouver minor league team 
to replace the cellar-dweller Angels. Maybe Anaheim Stadium will once again see 
50,000 fans cheering on the Angels.

 Gene Autry deserves better.

 I have been a loyal Dodger fan for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s brought free agency, salaries went up, and so did the value of 
ballclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the players make so much money from April to August they can sit back and 
enjoy the dog days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have so much money, they can sit back and plan to destroy the 
players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 All I want to say, as a former fan, is, "A pox on both your houses."

 If baseball is so important to the well-being of the nation as to be granted 
an exemption from antitrust laws, then the government should use its powers to 
stop the strike -- for the well-being of the nation's baseball fans.

 Let's focus responsibility for the strike where it belongs: with the owners. 
The reason for the strike is the owners' threat to unilaterally impose their 
system on the players at the end of this season. The owners could end the 
walkout simply by pledging not to do that. Then they could actually try working 
with the players as a partnership instead of merely giving lip service to that 
concept.

 Although I enjoy Mike Downey's writing, and I appreciate his point when he 
says "pro baseball or no baseball," it sounds as if he has fallen under a spell 
that many of us have. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, it doesn't matter whether the strike goes on for a week or a decade. 
The game will go on in streets and parks just like it has for 125 years. People 
who complain that the strike has taken the fun out of the game ought to grab a 
bat and head for a nice open field. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as they feel what a solid hit feels like, it'll be, "What strike?"

NEWSWIRE: NEVADA REGENTS ORDER PROBE OF MASSIMINO DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outraged over a secret contract that gave Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach 
Rollie Massimino an extra $375,000 a year, Nevada regents on Friday ordered an 
investigation into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regents hinted they might try to rescind Massimino's contract to coach 
the Rebels altogether, saying they were duped when they hired him two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like the opportunity to reverse my vote," regent Jill Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member board voted unanimously to hire outside legal counsel to help 
unravel the circumstances and legality of a secret contract that guaranteed 
Massimino $375,000 a year above the $511,000-a-year, five-year contract 
approved by regents in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was taken after interim UNLV President Kenny Guinn said he needed 
help to unravel the case.Guinn, who took over when Robert Maxson resigned in 
May to take the top job at Long Beach State, told Massimino last week that 
terms of the secret contract would not be paid. Auto Racing

 Irvan, who suffered life-threatening injuries to his brain and lungs in a

RV MANIA; BUYERS ARE BACK -- AND NOT IN THE MOOD FOR CHANDELIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After catering to cash-rich customers in the 1980s, the makers of Winnebagos, 
Airstreams and other recreational vehicles must now deal with budget-minded 
shoppers like Mario Bernabe. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old bus mechanic from Orange has spent two summers shopping for a 
roomy and, more important, low-priced RV for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to be comfortable," Bernabe said as he inspected the powder-blue 
interior of a 22-foot-long motor home earlier this month. "The only problem is 
they cost too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a new breed of younger and price-conscious customers like Bernabe, 
the nation's recreational vehicle industry has retooled itself. Among other 
things, RV makers and sellers are cutting manufacturing costs, introducing 
simpler and cheaper models and trying to boost the RV's lowbrow image. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of these efforts and a resurgent national economy have been 
impressive. Total factory shipments last year rose 9.8% to 420,200 on top of a 
30.3% jump in 1992, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Assn. The 
largest gains have been among low-frills, low-priced pop-up trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, it was like a contest to see how many gadgets you could get 
into a vehicle," association president David Humphreys said of the built-in 
bathroom scales and chandeliers that were squeezed into motor homes. "Now all 
the companies are competing on producing low-cost vehicles and still turning a 
profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans' fondness for the open road and the great outdoors has bred a giant 
recreational vehicle industry, which saw more than $9.5 billion in sales last 
year. The "RV lifestyle," as industry officials refer to it, attracts wealthy 
retirees who roam the highways in $200,000 motor homes equipped with 
dishwashers, as well as young families who camp out in $3,000 trailers with 
pop-up tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime the world starts to bug you, you just fill it up and you're gone," 
said David Hill, gazing at the used Winnebago he purchased this month for 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The current RV boom comes after a deep slump in the late 1980s and early '90s 
when the recession and tight credit forced countless dealers to shut down and 
manufacturers to fold. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry began a dramatic turnaround in 1992 as the recession eased in 
many parts of the nation. However, RV makers, like most other American 
businesses, faced a much more sober consumer this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more conscious of price and payments than they ever have been 
before," said George Kirk, vice president and general manager of Freeway RV in 
Irvine. "They never buy the motor home they want" and instead settle for a 
lower-priced model. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing numbers of baby boomers have also begun visiting dealer lots as their 
generation moves into the prime RV-buying years (35 to 55). In preparation for 
the boomers' arrival, the industry began promoting RVs as an affordable 
vacation alternative that complements activities ranging from bird watching to 
antique collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the industry-sponsored cable TV show "Going Our Way" shows RV 
trips to destinations ranging from Nashville to Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boomers have proved a tougher sell than previous RV buyers, some 
dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't as much shopping around or as much comparisons," Bob Crawley, 
general manager of Giant Inland Empire RV in Colton, said of past customers. 
"We are hitting some of the baby boomers, who are a little bit more 
better-educated. They shop a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 Many RV makers were caught off guard by the shift in customer attitudes. The 
popularity of the low-cost trailers produced by Dutchmen Manufacturing -- 
acquired by Jackson Center, Ohio-based Thor Industries -- forced the nation's 
100 or so RV makers to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers "looked around and stripped down their models," said Guy 
Nielsen, who follows the industry as an analyst for SBS Financial Group, an 
investment research firm based in Westport, Conn. "They have worked hard to 
engineer the costs out of these products." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises -- the nation's 
largest RV maker -- introduced the Mallard, a pop-up trailer that sleeps up to 
eight people and includes a stove, refrigerator and sink. The base model, which 
sells for between $10,500 and $13,500, has become one of the company's most 
successful new products, marketing director Bill Toy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a rebounding economy, lower-priced RVs will continue to be popular, he 
said. "I don't see them going away." The Comeback Road 
</P>
<P>
 After a slump in the late 1980s and early 1990s, factory shipments of 
recreational vehicles have bounced back as the industry introduced lower-priced 
trailers and motor homes.

TOYOTA TO INCREASE PRICES MARKEDLY ON '95 MODELS; AUTOS: IMPORTS WILL COST AN 
AVERAGE OF 6.1% MORE. COMPANY IS STRUGGLING TO STAY PROFITABLE AS YEN'S VALUE 
RISES. 
</P>

<P>
 In a fierce struggle to maintain profitability in the face of a rising yen, 
Toyota Motor Co. on Friday announced a significant boost in the prices of its 
1995 model cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese auto giant said the 1995 model import will cost an average of 
$23,035, up $1,333 -- or 6.1% -- from the initial price of 1994 models and $820 
above current prices. The average U.S.-made Toyota will cost $16,641, up $464, 
or 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Japanese auto makers, including Honda, have also hinted at price 
increases, though they have declined to offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese auto maker's U.S. dealers say they are unconcerned by the price 
increases, insisting their buyers are loyal. But the new wave of price hikes 
could significantly cut into Japan's share of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Japanese car is already $2,000 more than its domestic 
counterpart," said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office 
for the Study of Automotive Transportation. "People are recognizing they now 
have a choice of better domestic cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers raised sticker prices twice over the course of the 1994 
model year, for a total average increase of about 4.8%. But when price 
increases resulted in reduced market share, the car makers in effect discounted 
prices by leasing more cars at below-market interest rates of 3% to 4% and 
depending more heavily on cut-rate volume sales to fleet buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strategies have been effective in boosting Japan's share of the U.S. 
market in recent months as unusually large numbers of American auto plants 
closed to retool for new models. With the new U.S. models entering showrooms, 
Cole said, the Japanese companies will face a tougher challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 They are in a weak position to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that every 1-yen rise in the yen's value against the dollar 
costs Toyota about $100 million in lost earnings. The No. 1 Japanese car 
maker's latest price increase will only partially offset foreign exchange 
losses resulting from the yen's 12% rise against the dollar over the past year. 
Indeed, some analysts speculate that the auto maker will be forced to boost 
prices again in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Toyota announced that its earnings for the year ended June 30 
were $1.26 billion, down 29% from the year before and down 75% from their 1990 
high. Sales fell 8.3% from the year before to $94 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Toyota has successfully cut costs in recent years, it is already a 
lean company and has little fat left to cut. Any decline in sales resulting 
from price increases could actually raise costs by creating excess capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic business dilemma," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for Toyota is that price increases for its U.S.-made autos were 
more modest than for its imports because of the success of the firm's campaign 
to use more American parts at its U.S. plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intense efforts to localize our supply sources for the U.S.- built Camry 
have enabled us to hold the average price increase on the entire Camry line to 
a mere $34 over final prices of comparably equipped '94 models," said Dave 
Illingworth, vice president at Toyota's U.S. headquarters in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers hope to reduce their vulnerability to exchange rate 
fluctuations by building more cars in America. Both Honda and Toyota have plans 
to sharply increase production here. By 1999, Honda said, it will sharply 
increase exports from its U.S. plants to 150,000, more than triple their level 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 An improved home market could also help the embattled Japanese auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn., an industry trade group, said Friday 
that domestic sales rose 2.9% in July from the year before and will rise more 
sharply in August, signaling an end to the Japanese industry's long slump.

MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH CALMS FEARS; INDICATORS: 3.8% RATE IN SECOND QUARTER 
IS BELOW FORECASTS. BUILDUP IN INVENTORIES IS CITED AS A MAJOR FACTOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The government said Friday that the economy grew at a moderate 3.8% annual 
rate in the second quarter, easing analysts' concerns that inflation is poised 
for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Commerce Department's revised estimate of quarterly growth in the 
gross domestic product was up slightly from its original 3.7% estimate made 
last month, it was below economists' forecasts.  
</P>
<P>
 The department also said that most of the growth came from a sharp buildup in 
inventories of unsold goods. That's a sign that consumers are reining in their 
spending and that the economy is expanding at a more sustainable rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors greeted the news by sending stock prices sharply higher. The Dow 
Jones industrial average zoomed 51.16 points to close at 3,881.05 -- up nearly 
126 points for the week and its highest level in five months -- on heavy volume 
of 305.02 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds rallied too. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond, which 
declines when bond prices rise, fell to 7.48% from 7.53% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also got a boost from a second Commerce Department report that said 
after-tax profits of U.S. corporations rose a strong 7.4% in the second 
quarter. Rising corporate profits typically push stock prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's GDP report said the 3.8% growth rate in the output of goods 
and services was largely attributable to a strong increase in the amount of 
unsold goods that are piling up in warehouses and on store shelves across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the inventory jump -- the largest in 6 1/2 years -- and 
moderating consumer spending are likely to force producers to cut output to 
clear their shelves of unwanted items. That should keep the economy from 
overheating and keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the buildup in inventories was probably unanticipated. Business may 
have failed to anticipate the extent to which consumer demand would slacken 
off," said Gordon Richards of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. "What this 
means is that the economy is poised on the verge of a slowdown in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 GDP expanded at a 3.3% in the first quarter, making for growth in the first 
six months of just over 3.5%. The revised growth level was well below the 4.1% 
annual rate forecast by economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists noted that nearly two-thirds of the growth in GDP last quarter came 
from the jump in business inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockpiles of unsold goods rose $56.3 billion -- or $2.3 billion more than 
previously estimated -- after a rise of $25.4 billion in the first three months 
of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The net change between quarters -- equal to $30.9 billion -- was the largest 
since a $54.5-billion change in the fourth quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory jump was accompanied by weakening in consumer spending, which 
rose just 1.4% after spurting 4.7% in the first quarter. It was the smallest 
gain since a 0.5% drop in the fourth quarter of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is still pretty strong, but fortunately it is losing momentum. I 
say 'fortunately' because that takes a little bit of pressure off the inflation 
front," said Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy also said Friday's good inflation report should ease pressure on the 
Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates again as part of its ongoing 
battle against inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, consumer optimism about the economy grew this month compared to 
July, but not as fast as originally expected, according to a widely watched 
University of Michigan survey.

TELEPHONE FIRMS DON'T NEED LOCAL FRANCHISES FOR VIDEO; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE 
RULING, WHICH SPARES THE COMPANIES HIGH FEES, IS ANOTHER SETBACK FOR THE CABLE 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>

 In a setback for revenue-hungry local governments, a federal appeals court 
ruled Friday that telephone companies seeking to offer video programming over 
their phone networks don't need to obtain costly franchises from local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which upholds regulations approved by the Federal Communications 
Commission in 1991, was also a setback for the beleaguered cable industry, 
which now pays millions of dollars annually in franchise fees to local 
governments for the right to offer cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 If phone companies could deliver programming without the costs of franchise 
fees, they could have a competitive advantage over rival cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Washington could speed the emergence of alternative video suppliers and new 
telephone technology. A restrictive regulatory environment had left many phone 
companies reluctant to spend the huge sums necessary to modernize their 
networks for video delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased," said Chris Collins, a spokesman for the United States 
Telephone Assn., a Washington trade group. "It could have crippled video dial 
tone had the decision gone the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Video dial tone is one of the most promising methods by which phone companies 
hope to deliver programming through their phone networks. It differs from cable 
in that the phone companies, as common carriers, are required to carry all 
programs available. So if a cable viewer cannot get Cable News Network through 
his or her cable system, the channel can be ordered through video dial tone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the technology's promise, fewer than two dozen applications to offer 
video dial tone services are pending at the FCC. Many telephone companies had 
been focusing on ways to directly enter the cable business, which they viewed 
as more profitable than video dial tone because they could take a financial 
interest in the programs they supplied to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, many local officials had sought regulatory control over video 
dial tone as well as the lucrative franchise fees the technology might 
generate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have franchise agreements with all the other utilities such as water and 
sewer and cable companies because we believe we need to protect the right of 
citizens who, after all, own these right of ways" used by wires traveling along 
city streets, said Christine Treat, city attorney in Lee's Summit, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable and local government officials said they had not yet decided whether to 
appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 However, phone companies are pushing ahead with video dial tone service. Bell 
Atlantic Corp., for example, was given FCC approval to offer video dial tone to 
38,000 residents of Dover Township, N.J., the FCC's first non-trial approval of 
the service.

<P>
 Pinball, it seems, is still profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when "Super Streetfighter 2" and sophisticated virtual reality games 
are all the rage at the video arcade, Sega Enterprises Ltd. said Friday that it 
plans to acquire Chicago-based Data East Pinball, the world's second-largest 
pinball maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. but Sega, the $4-billion Japanese video 
game giant that has built a reputation as a cutting-edge interactive 
entertainment firm, said in a news release that pinball machines "continue to 
be a dominant element in the amusement arcade industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hayao Nakayama, Sega's president and chief executive: "We believe the 
acquisition will give us a full line of amusement machines and allow us to 
consolidate our position of strength in that market." AMY HARMON

 Euro Disney Stock Plunges: Trading of shares in the troubled leisure park were 
suspended for a quarter of an hour on the Paris bourse after they fell more 
than 10% on new doubts about the viability of the park outside Paris. The stock 
exchange halted trading in the early afternoon after the share hit $1.75, down 
from a closing price of $1.95 on Thursday.The Paris stock market stops trading 
in a share for 15 minutes if a price fluctuates 10%. A further suspension is 
carried out if the price moves another 5%. Euro Disney shares closed down 7.77% 
at $1.79 on heavy volume of 6.8 million shares. Brokers said the plunge was due 
to a report that Paribas Capital Markets leisure analyst Nigel Reed had valued 
the share at just 30 cents after a visit to the company.

 Foreign Car Dealers May Sue Over New Labeling Law: The American International 
Automobile Dealers Assn. said it might file a legal challenge of the 
requirement that all new cars bear window stickers detailing where they were 
assembled. The trade group took a step toward suing earlier this week when it 
filed a petition challenging the regulation with the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, the U.S. government's auto safety agency.The petition 
doesn't prevent the regulation from taking effect. There is no time limit for 
the NHTSA's response. The requirement is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. 
Foreign car producers say the labels will mislead the public and discriminate 
in favor of U.S. auto makers. Supporters say they will answer the increasingly 
muddled question about how "American" a car really is.

 Former Journal Editor May Go to Time Warner: Norman Pearlstine, a former 
executive editor of the Wall Street Journal, is reportedly a leading candidate 
to succeed Jason McManus as editor in chief at Time Warner Inc., the world's 
largest magazine publisher. Pearlstine would be the first outsider to hold the 
job if he were selected for the coveted post, which oversees such magazines as 
Time, Sports Illustrated, People, Money and Fortune.The decision is up to the 
Time Warner board. McManus, 60, has held the job for nearly eight years, 
occupying a post previously held by Henry Luce, Hedley Donovan and Henry 
Grunwald. He is expected to retire soon and reportedly has been taking an 
active role in recommending a successor.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SURGES 51; YIELDS DECLINE AS DOLLAR RISES

 The stock market shot higher for the second time in three days after a 
government report showed second-quarter economic growth was weaker than 
expected, easing concern about inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A market-wide rally began at the opening bell after the Commerce Department 
said the second-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised upward less 
than expected, to 3.8% from 3.7% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sent bond yields tumbling and brought a wave of new buyers into the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 70.90 points Wednesday, rose 
51.16 points to close at 3,881.05 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the highest level for the Dow since it reached 3,895.65 on March 18, 
just before the market went into its spring free fall on worries about rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the week, the Dow gained 125.94 points, or 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue chip index was up as much as 65 points at one point Friday, prompting 
the New York Stock Exchange to impose standard "circuit breaker" restrictions 
on computerized program trades shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the breadth of Friday's advance was far better than 
Wednesday's, when most key indexes significantly lagged the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 15 to 7 on the NYSE on Friday in 
active trading of 305.6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 1.2%, almost as much as the Dow's 
1.3% rise. And the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, which began 
to rally early in August while the Dow languished, jumped 1.1% on Friday and 
was up 2.8% for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield dropped 
to 7.48% from 7.53% on Thursday, ending the week unchanged from last week, 
despite wild interim swings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters say increasing confidence that the economy has slowed 
enough to forestall further interest rate increases could bring many sidelined 
investors into stocks in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, foreign money could be lured to U.S. shares if the dollar 
continues to strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the dollar made one of its biggest single-day gains of the year 
against the German mark, bolstered by expectations that the U.S. economy can 
continue to grow moderately and with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar surged to 1.575 marks, up more than 2% from 1.543 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also rose to 100.46 Japanese yen, up from 99.71 on Thursday and the 
highest level since Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks rocketed anew as investors bet on a more sustainable 
economic expansion. Alcoa rose 1 3/8 to 81 1/8, GE gained 1 1/8 to 50 3/4, 
Caterpillar surged 3 5/8 to 115 5/8, FMC added 1 1/8 to 58, Asarco leaped 1 7/8 
to 29 7/8 and GM leaped 1 3/8 to 51 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology and telecom issues also surged again. Cisco Systems rocketed 
1 5/8 to 25 5/8, Sun Microsystems soared 2 7/8 to 28, Nextel jumped 2 1/8 to 30 
1/2, IBM added 5/8 to 70 and Hewlett-Packard was up 1 3/8 to 89 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among consumer issues, Procter & Gamble jumped 1 7/8 to 59 3/4, Philip 
Morris rose 1 3/4 to 58 5/8 and Sears gained 1 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index closed sharply higher, adding 30.90 points 
to 3,265.1. In Frankfurt, the DAX index rose 9.33 points to 2,161.54, and 
Paris' CAC index soared 36.22 points to 2,062.74. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended steady in Tokyo, with the 225-share Nikkei average rising 28.20 
points to 20,471.49. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 4.04 points to 2,772.17.

 Digital Equipment Cutting PC Prices: The Maynard, Mass., company said it will 
cut prices by 2% to 26% on about 60 systems in its two families of personal 
computers.The moves are in response to recent price cuts by industry leader 
Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., a spokesman 
for Digital Equipment Corp. said. The reductions, which take effect Tuesday, 
affect most of the personal computers in the Value and Premium families, the 
company said. Models using Intel Corp.'s i486 microprocessor will cost between 
$1,049 and $2,699, down from $1,099 to $2,924. Several more-powerful models, 
which use Intel's Pentium chip, will cost between $2,924 and $3,274, down from 
$3,474 to $3,924.

 Natural Gas Prices Likely to Stay Soft: Spot natural gas prices reached their 
lowest levels in more than two years this week and are likely to stay low until 
winter because of growing supplies, analysts say. "I don't even think weather 
would help at this point unless a big hurricane hit," said Michael Barbis, an 
analyst at NatWest Securities in New York.Drilling rigs and pipelines in the 
Gulf of Mexico, a major gas-producing area, can be shut down or suffer damage 
from storms in the fall hurricane season. Spot market prices for natural gas 
along the Gulf Coast slumped this week to less than $1.50 per million British 
thermal units, the lowest level since April, 1992, and down 25 cents from 
earlier this month. A year ago, natural gas prices were at $2.25 per BTU.

GM TRIES TO GEAR UP AFTER CRIPPLING STRIKE; AUTOS: THE WALKOUT BY 3,500 WORKERS 
AT AN INDIANA PARTS FACILITY LED TO THE IDLING OF 15 ASSEMBLY PLANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. worked Friday to revive car and truck assembly lines 
idled when they ran out of lights and bumpers built by a single strike-closed 
factory in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout at GM's Inland Fisher Guide plant in Anderson ended Thursday, but 
the effects continued to be felt at the nation's leading auto maker, 
demonstrating its vulnerability to supply disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday Friday, 15 GM assembly plants from Quebec to Kentucky had laid off 
more than 46,000 workers and stopped building vehicles ranging from 
best-selling pickups to Corvettes and Camaros. 
</P>
<P>
 Three truck plants were reopening later Friday, thanks to the quick shipment 
of nine loads of Anderson parts built before the strike. But GM spokesman John 
Shea said more assembly plant closings were "very possible" and that no others 
were likely to start back up before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day strike by 3,500 people -- about 1% of GM's North American work 
force -- was able to hobble half the company's vehicle plants because of a 
"just-in-time" supply system that has become standard for modern manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 By building, shipping and using parts as they are needed, businesses cut 
inventory and storage costs and can be more flexible, changing or improving 
components as they go. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to be efficient, lean and responsive to customers, a 
just-in-time system is what you need," Shea said. "But if you should have 
something like a strike, or you need to work out problems with your suppliers . 
. . there's less room for error." 
</P>
<P>
 In GM's case, there seems to have been no room. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants that closed apparently did not have suppliers other than the 
Anderson facility for the exterior lights, bumpers and lighting controls needed 
to build the cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 GM would not confirm that, but Shea said, "Clearly, you can conclude they're a 
significant supplier." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the strike at Anderson was caused by GM's desire to use an outside 
source for some parts. GM wasn't looking to add another supplier but to produce 
bumpers more cheaply than it can at Anderson with workers whose pay and 
benefits are estimated at $42 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably there are independent suppliers who have labor costs one-third of 
that," said analyst David Healy of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 GM would not say how the strike was resolved. But a letter released by the 
United Auto Workers said the company will add 19 products and keep the plant's 
current product line through 1997, suggesting that the company capitulated to 
the UAW local's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was another reminder of the UAW's ability to hamstring some of the 
auto maker's efforts to cut its costs by buying parts from outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally accepted estimates are that GM builds about 70% of the parts it 
uses. Chrysler Corp., the domestic industry's leader in efficiency and 
profitability, buys about 70% from outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade journal Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that GM will forfeit 
production of 20,000 vehicles because of the plant closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Ron Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco said the 
company could recover from that fairly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some sales are permanently lost" when a car or truck isn't immediately 
available to a buyer, Glantz said. "But when you're talking about losing 20,000 
units, in most cases dealers have enough inventory so it doesn't make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Healy said, is GM's predicament in trying to balance cost 
cutting with the union's success at guaranteeing job security for its members 
with strikes like that at Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real damage took place last fall when GM failed to get any 
concessions on the wage packages for their components employees," Healy said, 
referring to GM's national contract with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
 GM stock rose $1.375 to $51.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 The stock market shot higher for the second time in three days after a 
government report showed second-quarter economic growth was weaker than 
expected, easing concern about inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A market-wide rally began at the opening bell after the Commerce Department 
reported that the second-quarter gross domestic product figure was revised 
upward less than expected, to 3.8% from 3.7% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared more than 70 points Wednesday, 
rose another 51.16 points to 3,881.05 on Friday, reaching levels not seen since 
March 18, when the blue chip barometer closed at 3,895.65. The Dow gained an 
impressive 125.94 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow was up as much as 65 points at one point in Friday's session. The 
strength of the rally prompted the New York Stock Exchange to impose "circuit 
breaker" restrictions on program trades shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners in the broader market by about 13 to 6 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where 305.6 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wednesday's rally, which was dominated by blue chip issues, Friday's 
advances came across the board. The NYSE's composite index rose 2.64 points to 
260.82. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller companies advanced 8.14 points to 
762.94, and Standard & Poor's 500 list added 5.72 points to 473.80. 
</P>
<P>
 The GDP report also pushed bond rates lower and the dollar higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield dropped to 7.48% from 7.53% on Thursday, 
while its price, which rises when yields fall, gained 5/8 point, or $6.25 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar made one of its biggest single-day gains of the year 
against the German mark on the strength of the solid rallies in stock and bond 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the greenback was quoted at 1.575 marks, up more than 2% from 
1.543 on Thursday. The dollar also rose to 100.46 Japanese yen, up from 99.71 
on Thursday and the highest level since Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 30 components of the Dow average, nine were up a point or more. They 
were led by Caterpillar, which rose 3 5/8 to 115 5/8, followed by Procter & 
Gamble, up 1 7/8 to 59 3/4, and Philip Morris, up 1 3/4 to 58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues led small-company stocks higher. Cisco Systems was up 1 
5/8 to 25 5/8, Sun Microsystems gained 2 7/8 to 28 and Microsoft tacked on 
11/16 to 56 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors was up 1 3/8 at 51 3/4 after the car maker settled a strike 
at a parts plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among cyclical stocks, Aluminum Co. of America rose 1 3/8 to 81 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among financial stocks, JP Morgan ended up 5/8 to 64 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mining company Asarco rose 1 7/8 to 29 7/8. Prudential Securities upgraded 
the stock to "buy" from "hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London shares gained strength throughout the day, with the Financial 
Times 100-share average closing 30.9 points higher at 3,265.1. The average 
gained 73.7 over the week and is 14.8% above its 1994 low of 2,844.7 hit June 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended 9.33 points higher at 2,161.54, 
up 11.97 from last Friday. Stocks also ended steady in Tokyo, with the 
225-share Nikkei average rising 28.20 points to close at 20,471.49. That was 
down 41.21 from last week, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index dropped 4.04 points to 2,772.17.

TACO BELL TO ISSUE VIDEOTAPE COUPONS; MARKETING: FAST-FOOD CUSTOMERS WILL

 Taco Bell customers will receive coupons for free Blockbuster video rentals 
under a joint promotion that the companies announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer who buys any Taco Bell food item and a medium drink will get a 
coupon good for a second Blockbuster Video movie free with a video rental at 
the regular price. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion comes as fast-food companies are increasingly becoming involved 
in the video business. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's, for instance, has become one of the nation's leading video sales 
outlets by offering hit movies on videocassette at discounted costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's promotional deal, which starts Monday, is scheduled to run to 
Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion "is in response to nationwide Taco Bell market research that 
told us customers want both great-tasting, value-priced food and video 
entertainment," said Len Moskovits, a Taco Bell vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion is the largest of its kind for Blockbuster, which with 3,750 
stores is the nation's top video rental chain. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 million coupons, redeemable through Oct. 16, are expected to be 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupons will be promoted by a $12-million Taco Bell advertising campaign, 
including a TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell, a unit of soft-drink giant Pepsico Inc., is the 
nation's leading Mexican-style fast-food chain.

TO CATCH A GOOD MOVIE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years I have been frustrated to read reviews of "so-called" 
limited-release movies in Calendar when I know I cannot see them unless I drive 
to a theater in Los Angeles.There are some wonderful movies that many people in 
Orange County do not get a chance to see. I think the (majority of) theater 
owners believe we are too unsophisticated in Orange County to appreciate a good 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 At last Edwards Cinemas has dedicated two screens at their Rancho Niguel 8 in 
Laguna Niguel to limited-release movies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shame on you, Harry Connick Jr. and your promoters of the Hollywood Bowl 
concert on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't come to be assaulted with a rock concert or watch an aerobics 
performer play the piano.  
</P>
<P>
 If this is the "new" Harry Connick Jr., count us out. We thought that, with 
all the running around and high fives, we were at a Dodger game. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, Harry, take your tux out of the locker and give your fans the music 
and songs we came to hear and that made you famous.

PARAMOUNT'S GATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The photograph in the upper right-hand corner of the first page of Aug. 24's 
Calendar section is, indeed, the historic Paramount gate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is not the "Melrose Avenue Entrance" as stated in the accompanying 
text. The entrance on Melrose was constructed by the studio in 1982. The 
original (and historic) gate shown in your photograph was on Marathon Street on 
property now enclosed by the Paramount lot.

HOLLYWOOD'S AGE BIAS WON'T DIE BY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Bowen's statement (Letters, Aug. 20) that the efforts put forth by the 
Writers Guild Age Awareness Committee have little chance of working was off the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen writes, "Producers just need to realize that the mature person will do 
it better." No problem . . . right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong! It's the producers who are avoiding gray hair in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 For the professionals who entered the industry in the '60s and '70s when the 
best producers, directors, writers and crew heads all had gray hair, there was 
an expectation that if you learned your craft really well, your career would 
get better with time and you would prosper. That, unfortunately, is no longer 
the case. The social contract has been broken, and the expectation has been 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers and directors are being told by their agents that "I can't go on 
representing you; I have to concentrate on younger clients." Unless they have 
powerful names, older writers cannot get meetings with powerful 
decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 We're dealing with Wunderkinder here, so an "over the hill" writer or director 
can be a baby boomer, and there are more than a few with kids still expecting 
to go to college. I have personal knowledge of several who made six-figure 
incomes until a few years ago and are now facing bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers Guild Age Awareness Committee, in concert with representatives 
from the Directors Guild, SAG and AFTRA, is taking positive steps to create 
opportunities for commercially viable material created by people over 40, the 
age level for discrimination as specified by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen was correct in his statement that the producers need to understand the 
skills a mature artist or craftsman can bring to a project; he just didn't 
understand the depth and severity of the problem faced by some of the most 
experienced production professionals in Hollywood today. The problem is not 
self-expression; it is survival.

BARBRA AND WHITNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Chris Willman's review of Whitney Houston's concert ("Houston Finds 
Voice by Getting Personal," Aug. 23): 
</P>
<P>
 I did not see Whitney Houston's concert, but I was one of the fortunate few at 
the Pond of Anaheim July 20 for the Barbra Streisand concert, where there were 
people in the audience ranging in age from 4 to 80-plus years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Willman states, "even Streisand would have a hard time meeting her potential 
if she were 31 and forced to conform to the expectations of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1973, when Barbra was 31, she made the television special "Barbra 
. . . and Other Musical Instruments." Here she sang songs like "I Got Rhythm" 
with an assortment of African instruments (at least 10 years before Paul 
Simon's hit album "Graceland"). Rather than "conforming" to the musical trends 
of that period, she did not sell out to rock 'n' roll just to be "hip." It just 
wasn't her style. She still managed to "meet her potential" and win over 
millions of fans and admirers worldwide, by being different, and she continues 
to do so to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The only "expectations" Barbra has ever conformed to are her own expectations 
of excellence, class and the pursuit of artistic expression. She has built a 
career around not conforming to anybody's "expectations"! 
</P>
<P>
 There are very few women in show business who do not owe a debt of gratitude 
to Streisand (including Houston) for blazing a trail and making it a little 
easier to follow their artistic hearts, regardless of the "expectations" put 
upon them or the obstacles put before them.

QUALITY FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "One Studio's Trash Is Another's Treasure," Aug. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 The real point is that the majority of producers are looking for a guarantee 
in a script, and there never is a guarantee. If they turn their attention to 
finding something of quality, they may find that you can do something 
worthwhile and get paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as you see in most American films, greed leads the way. And it shows with 
high-concept, superficial films. Too many people are looking for a "payday" 
rather than a film that they can be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 The old saying is still true: "There is not a shortage of Cary Grant/Irene 
Dunne movies, just a shortage of people who can recognize them."

'MI VIDA LOCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was reading about the movie "Mi Vida Loca" prior to Kevin Thomas' movie 
review ("The Road to 'Mi Vida Loca' Paved With Good Intentions," July 22).And I 
was poised to write. I wanted to express that the blight of society that this 
film depicts does not represent any large proportion of Latin society. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas says it sincerely in his closing paragraph. "More than anything 
else, 'Mi Vida Loca' makes the case for how important it is that ethnic and 
minority filmmakers get the opportunity to tell the stories of their own 
people."

GARDENING; SEED AND YE SHALL FIND SATISFACTION; TO GET WHAT YOU WANT AND SAVE 
MONEY, START SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's nearly impossible to keep plants from going to seed in August. Gardeners 
often exhibit the same tendency. 
</P>
<P>
 Days just too hot for planting can be perfect for lounging in a hammock with a 
favorite iced drink and plotting fall gardening schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seed-loving gardeners are a growing tribe, according to Ron Vanderhoff, 
Nurseryland district manager for Orange County/Los Angeles. "Seed sales have 
expanded dramatically," he says. "They've tripled in the last three or four 
years, and we think that trend will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is economy. "Seed sales traditionally go up during recessions," he 
says. "Seed is always the cheapest way to garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Barton of Brea, a gardener with 40 years of experience in growing from 
seed, vouches for that. "You can get 30 tomato plants for a $1 packet of seed," 
he says. "You can't buy a single plant in a nursery for that price. In fact you 
can barely buy one tomato in a supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
 Increased horticultural sophistication is another reason for the popularity of 
seeds. Growers tend to raise plants that will look good in pony packs when they 
arrive at the nursery, especially in the case of annuals, Vanderhoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are less compact plants that look just as good or better in the garden 
but that look rangy and unappealing in pony packs," he says. "People who want 
them usually have no choice other than starting from seed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Allen of the Newport Beach landscape design firm Fleur Jardin falls into 
this category. Whether it's calendulas, snapdragons, marigolds or zinnias, he 
inevitably prefers taller annuals to the varieties he finds on the market. 
"They're more graceful, more cottagey, and better for cutting." Because he 
can't find what he wants in the nurseries, Allen grows annuals for customers 
and for his own garden from seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from seed has other advantages, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get what you want when you want it. Growers usually don't release plants 
until they're in bloom, but I like to get my plants in the ground earlier. I'm 
convinced the younger plants are when you transfer them to the garden, the 
stronger they'll be." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen sows his fall annuals in flats in late August and early September and 
transfers them to the garden as soon as they've developed four leaves, 
approximately six weeks later. (A lazier way to start annuals is to wait until 
the first rain storm is expected, scratch up a bare patch of dirt beforehand, 
scatter seeds, wait for rain, and watch what happens.) 
</P>
<P>
 Color control is better starting from seed, too, Allen says. "Many plants only 
come mixed in the nurseries -- foxgloves, for example -- when all I want is one 
color. That's another reason I start from seed." 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasure people find in growing their own produce -- if only a few 
culinary herbs in a window box -- has also contributed to the current interest 
in seeds. Shepherd's Garden Seeds, one of the companies that has been 
instrumental in creating the current crop of home food growers, has experienced 
sales growth of 25% a year since 1986, according to Beth Benjamin, 
horticultural adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd's current best sellers are heirloom tomatoes, habanero and other 
chili peppers, French filet beans, scented basils and all the specialty greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderhoff at Nurseryland reports similar trends. Lettuce and specialty green 
sales have been particularly strong, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Home gardener Bea Grow of San Clemente, for one, isn't surprised. She sows at 
least 10 different types of lettuce seed in her border each year. "I just 
broadcast seeds wherever I have an empty space among my perennials," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bronze-leafed lettuces, which are her favorites, look very pretty mixed in 
with other plant foliage, she says. They taste as good as they look, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Franzen in Tustin likes greens, too. She's planted Shepherd's 'Paros' 
chard several years in a row now. "Chard is so expensive in the supermarket and 
so easy to grow. And it keeps going for most of a year before you have to 
replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chervil is fun and easy, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners also have more choices now. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago three major seed companies -- Burpee, Ferry-Morse and Northrup 
King -- accounted for 95% of Nurseryland's seed sales, according to Vanderhoff. 
But lots of new players, such as Seeds of Change, a company specializing in 
organically grown seed, are making inroads into the market. And older companies 
such as the English firm Thompson & Morgan have caught on again. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes gone-to-seed gardeners always searching for the unusual happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're always looking for something new, seed is the way to go," Grow 
advises. "There are so many options." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's normally green, and some seed company has a purple one, then that's 
always the one I want," Barton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've been reading about a certain plant in a garden book and coveting it 
like crazy and I find it somewhere in seed, then I'm a goner," Franzen says. 
"I've got to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a final reason starting from seed has caught on: The experience is 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "To watch a big, vigorous plant develop from this delicate little seedling is 
a pretty miraculous thing," Vanderhoff says. "Even after 16 years in this 
business, I still find it amazing." Going to Seed? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some plants to start from seed in August or September: 
</P>
<P>
 Cool-season annuals: Calendula, Iceland & Shirley poppies, larkspur, 
snapdragon, stocks, sweet peas, pansies. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring-flowering perennials: Delphinium, digitalis, hollyhocks, Shasta 
daisies, coreopsis, columbine, penstemon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool-season vegetables: Broccoli, cauliflower, chard, radicchio, mustard, 
lettuce, spinach, arugula, peas, fava beans.

FIRE ESCAPES; BEFORE A BACK-YARD BLAZE GETS COOKING BE SURE IT'S COOL WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crackling warmth and light of a campfire seem to possess some special 
power: It brings out the storyteller and singer in almost everyone. It makes 
hot dogs -- dangled precariously from the end of a wire hanger -- taste better. 
It inspires decadence -- chocolate bars, graham crackers and melted 
marshmallows combined into gooey sandwiches -- that would not be tolerated 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you could enjoy all those things without piling into the car and 
driving to a campsite in the woods or finding a fire ring at the beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the regulations where you live, it is possible you could gather 
around a camp-style fire in your own back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gaffney of Costa Mesa recently built a fire pit in his back yard. It was 
not a difficult job, he said, and it has been a great addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our landlord came and cut down our trees, and we needed to find a way to take 
up the space that was left," said Gaffney, a locally based country singer. "We 
planted a small flower garden and still had plenty of room left. So we decided 
it would be nice to have a fire pit like the ones at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 With permission of the landlord, Gaffney set out digging a hole just off the 
patio. He dug the pit, about three feet in diameter, in about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used the soil I took out to make steep angled walls and kept wetting it 
down. The soil is mostly clay and stays real hard after it's dried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to a local building supply yard provided lava rock to edge the pit, and 
a donation from Gaffney's mother-in-law of her old wooden fence supplied the 
first batch of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total cost came to $25," he said. "We have a lot of people over, and 
everybody likes hanging around it, especially our friends' kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Policies on building outdoor fires vary from community to community; all 
require that appropriate safety precautions be taken.  
</P>
<P>
 Before proceeding, contact your local fire department to learn what 
restrictions apply in your area and to get a permit if required. Some 
communities don't allow permanent fire rings but do issue permits for one-time 
barbecue pits. Some issue same-day permits; some require notice. The county has 
very strict policies covering unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, it's legal to build your own fire pit as long as some common 
sense requirements are met, according to Fire Marshal Tom Mcduff.  
</P>
<P>
 "We allow recreational fires as long as they are 25 feet away from structures 
or other combustibles and in a fire pit." 
</P>
<P>
 There should always be a bucket of water or a hose at the ready in case there 
are any problems, and the fire should be constantly attended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should only burn wood or charcoal. No trash -- that would no longer be a 
recreational fire and you could be letting loose all sorts of toxins into the 
air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in one of the unincorporated areas of the county, fire pits are 
taboo unless they are fueled by natural gas and have been built with the proper 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't allow open fires anywhere except in state recreation areas," said 
Darren Johnson, hazard reduction inspector with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The single exception is for a one-time barbecue pit. "Some special permits are 
required, and there are guidelines and restrictions," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance only wood can be used for fuel, and it cannot be stacked higher 
than two feet. The diameter is limited to four feet. It must also be covered 
with a screen spark arrester of at least 1/2-inch mesh. A 2 1/2 gallon bucket 
of water must be nearby, and trash is never allowed to be burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are also weather conditions involved. If it's a red flag day of heat 
and high winds then no permits will be issued," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, regulations governing back yard fires are based on the Uniform 
Fire Code, with communities making variations to take into account particulars 
of their area, such as high fire danger or high population density. 
</P>
<P>
 When the local fire station knows you're planning a barbecue pit, it avoids 
engines being called by neighbors to a fire that is in reality a roasting pig. 
</P>
<P>
 While a permit for a back-yard fire pit is not a common request, neither is it 
uncommon. Several fire departments said most requests are for one-time fires, 
often to roast a pig or lamb as part of a holiday or cultural celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, each back-yard fire requires a no-fee permit, according to fire 
prevention officer Jim Livingston. And, he said, "lots (of people) do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, back-yard fires also require a permit, for which there is a 
$35 fee. The person applying for the permit must submit plans that will be 
evaluated to make sure the fire won't endanger people or property. The length 
of time for which the permit is good varies, but most people want it for a 
particular weekend rather than long-term, according to fire prevention officer 
Ron Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, permits are issued for outside cooking fires when the applicant 
demonstrates that there is no danger. The $5 permit is usually for one-time use 
but can include additional specific times and dates, according to Fire Marshal 
John Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of all the regulations -- whether relaxed or strict -- is to keep 
fire danger low and the fire department in the know about what's cooking out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the back yard at the Gaffneys', the fire pit has become a 
regular focal point of social gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was a guest that built the first fire, even before Gaffney thought 
he was finished building the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris planned on lining it, but we had friends visiting, including some 
people from Switzerland, and they wanted a fire," said Julie Gaffney, Chris' 
wife. "The heat from that first fire seemed to make the pit walls even harder, 
and a lining no longer seemed necessary."  
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing in the glow of that first fire, the Gaffneys' guests shared with 
their hosts a variation on making "s'mores," the campfire dessert sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just melting a marshmallow and then putting it on the graham cracker 
and chocolate," Julie said. But one of her guests demonstrated how to make a 
small grill out of a wire hanger so the entire s'more could be toasted.  
</P>
<P>
 The technique, good for traditional campfires as well as back yard versions: 
Take a straightened wire hanger, fold it in half and then bend the U-shaped end 
again to form an envelope to hold the assembled sandwich. Toast and eat.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; GETTING TO BOTTOM OF DRAIN MAY CLEAR ICE FROM 
FROST-FREE FRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Q. My frost-free refrigerator has worked fine for the last nine years and 
continues to do so, except for the ice that forms in the back corner. What is 
causing this? 
</P>
<P>
 K.E., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. It could be that the defrost system is working, but you're having a 
drainage problem, says Tom Houlihan of Orange County Appliance Parts in Garden 
Grove. The defrost system operates by collecting the frost on a coil, then 
heating it so that it melts. This water then drops into the drain pan at the 
bottom of the unit and evaporates. However, if the line that runs down to the 
pan is plugged, water will collect and it can freeze. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Q. My husband says I should rinse every dish clean before putting it in the 
dishwasher. I think the dishwasher can handle food particles and the dishes 
don't have to be perfectly clean. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
 S.W., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A. Although it has a pump to dispose of small food particles, a dishwasher 
shouldn't be treated like a disposal, says Ted Blanke of Central Plumbing & 
Heating Supply in La Habra. From the dishwasher to the final sink discharge at 
the disposal, the drain typically passes an air gap. Over time, food particles 
can accumulate and clog. You have to be aware of non-dissolving food particles. 
You don't have to wash the dish completely, just rinse off the loose food so 
that you're not leaving a lot to clog the system. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. We'd like to wallpaper our living room. However, I want to do it in a 
striped wallpaper pattern, which is a problem since the walls aren't straight 
and it's bound to look funny in the corners where the stripes will run out. How 
do the pros do it? 
</P>
<P>
 T.Y., Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A. This is a pretty common problem since most walls aren't perfectly square, 
says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. Generally, if 
you look really close at a couple of walls that have been papered, you'll find 
the corners don't line up real well. You'll end up with a slightly fatter or 
thinner stripe by using the corner to make up for the wall's bad angle. 
Re-plumb the piece as it comes out of the corner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We recently bought a house that has a swimming pool. We'd like to make it 
safer without fencing it in. Are those strong pool covers able to provide 
security against someone falling in? 
</P>
<P>
 M.M., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A. They can, but you'll need to do some research, says Brad Gaston of Orange 
Pool Supply in Orange. Some covers are better than others and you may need to 
look into which one will suit you. There are the motorized covers designed for 
rectangular pools as well as the net-type covers to keep children and animals 
out. However, remember that state law requires all new pools to be built with a 
fence, and that's probably the most effective safety device as long as the gate 
is closed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I have some old aluminum patio furniture that I'd like to repaint. The last 
time I did it I used spray cans and while I finished with a good paint job, it 
was quite messy. I ended up with paint in areas where I didn't want it, 
especially on my hands. How can I make it a cleaner job? 
</P>
<P>
 P.Y.,Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A. There's a common mistake people make when they use spray paints, says 
painter Doug Howard of Anaheim: They don't use rubber gloves. You're always 
bound to get paint flying up around your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Because you don't have great control, you'll also have to be sure that you've 
got the object you're painting adequately masked off. This will prevent paint 
from dripping around onto the floor or areas where you don't want paint. Also 
be sure you're just applying light coats, letting them dry and then applying 
your extra coats. When you spray too thick, you'll have drips and blotches that 
can get everywhere.

 What palatial estate would be complete without a life-size reproduction of a 
15th-Century royal European suit of armor? Made in Toledo, Spain, by 
descendants of artisans who put together the originals long ago, the detailing 
on the suits is completely authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a market in Orange County for suits of armor? "Let me just say people 
there are very familiar with our products," said Bob Khoury of the Noble 
Collection, which sells the suits and swords and other pieces of period 
weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lionheart suit ($4,900) is a limited edition piece that is made by only 
one artisan, who crafts it strictly from memory. All of the work on the 
breastplate, helmet, knees and elbows is done by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits, which stand over six feet, are fully functional and arrive at your 
home holding a sword.  
</P>
<P>
 For information or to order through the Noble Collection catalogue, which is 
based in Merrifield, Va., call (800) 806-6253. Hold Everything 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Company's apothecary canisters have the look of antiques, but they are 
quite contemporary in function. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Simon Scott actually had the bathroom in mind when he came up with 
the idea, although the canisters hold nearly anything and everything. He wanted 
something to put his cotton balls and swabs in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was actually a secondary thought to a whole line of housewares I wanted to 
create," said Scott, 30, of Los Angeles, who is also a jewelry designer. "Doing 
the jars was actually the easiest and simplest part of the line to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-purpose jars ($35 and up), available in several sizes, have 
interchangeable tops that are hand-crafted out of alder wood that's been 
hand-turned, oiled and stained, then rubbed with beeswax and carnuba wax to 
protect the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The metal parts on the tops, inspired by old church steeples and Middle 
Eastern architecture, are brass and zinc coated with a nontoxic varnish. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who began his canister line about four months ago, will be adding more 
sizes, including some to be used with herbal candles and to hold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Company's canisters are available in Orange County at Areo in Laguna 
Beach, Newport Hills Drug and Le Garage in Newport Beach, and Elements in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (310) 659-3882. Window Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designer Bonnie Sachs' studio shades are meant to add a distinctive 
look to windows in a variety of room styles. Sachs' collection of valances and 
portieres are her original designs, which she individually hand-paints on heavy 
canvas or Ultrasuede. 
</P>
<P>
 Sachs, who started her collection in spring 1993, has about 40 standard 
designs, from Southwestern to floral to dinosaur, that she uses as a starting 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I customize and personalize them for the client," said Sachs, who also 
uses tassels and beadwork. "They are very durable; you just wipe them off, so 
they work well in kitchens, baths and kids' rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Sachs, who lives in Marina del Rey, uses a nontoxic, acrylic-based paint and 
an acrylic matte varnish. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, a 36-inch-wide valance ranges from $250 to $400. Hardware is 
additional.

PLANTING SEEDS FOR DIABETES CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Can ancestral Native American diets provide the clue to controlling 
adult-onset diabetes? 
</P>
<P>
 Native Seeds-SEARCH of Tucson, one of the country's most respected 
seed-preservation groups, is so sure of it that the current catalogue offers 
what are described as "a number of diabetes-control foods" that can be grown or 
purchased in the Southwest, where Native Americans have one of the nation's 
highest rates of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Seeds, a nonprofit organization, began examining four years ago a 
possible linkage between diabetes and what tribal members eat. Now the group is 
recommending they concentrate on foods that the body digests slowly and absorbs 
in ways that reduce blood-sugar levels, the so-called slow-release foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many traditional foods, proven to be effective in regulating blood sugar, can 
be incorporated into a diet low in fat and high in soluble fibers," says Native 
Seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Using diet to try and control adult-onset diabetes is standard medical 
technique in this country. The American Diabetes Assn. says the disease often 
can be controlled by limiting food intake and doing exercises such as walking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desert foods may be your best medicine," says a brochure distributed to 
Southwest tribes by Native Seeds (the SEARCH portion of the name is an acronym 
for Southwestern Endangered Arid-land Resource Clearing House). 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of years, desert dwellers in the Southwest and Mexico ate cactus 
fruit, cholla buds and prickly pear pads known as nopalitos. They still are 
frequently sold in Mexican food sections of grocery stores and can be 
wild-harvested. However, the traditional diet in recent years has been 
supplanted for many with the same "junk foods" common in the nation's culture. 
</P>
<P>
 All the traditional foods are listed in the current catalogue, including many 
beans, such as tepary, amaranth, mesquite pods and chia and psyllium seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalogue is available for $1 from: Native Seeds, 2509 N. Campbell Ave., 
Suite 325, Tucson, AZ 85719.

DIG INTO CATALOGUES FOR SCOOP

 Although nurseries are beginning to carry an astonishing array of seed 
packets, some gardeners still prefer to do at least some of their seed shopping 
by catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Raeber of Laguna Beach is one of those gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old-fashioned seed catalogues were opinionated and full of information -- 
recipes, gardening advice, folklore, philosophy, even poetry -- and some of the 
newer catalogues are returning to that. And those are the ones I like." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Raeber's favorite catalogues is Shepherd's Garden Seeds. "The 
descriptions are so wonderful (company founder Rene Shepherd still writes all 
of them), you want everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Another is Seeds of Change. "They've got unusual plants, but they've also got 
all of these intriguing articles by scientists about subjects like 
biodiversity. Their catalogue is almost like a textbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetable grower Ralph Barton of Brea likes Nichols Garden Nursery. "There's 
nothing fancy about their catalogue, but year after year it's got the things I 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes J.L. Hudson Seedsman for its heirloom varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb fancier Chris Franzen of Tustin also likes Nichols, but two other company 
catalogues tempt her now, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just received my first Richters Herb Catalog, and it's wonderful -- great 
color photos and lots of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companion Plants is another neat one. Very simple. No photos, just 
descriptions. But very appealing somehow."

150 WAVES FOR CHANNEL SURFERS TO RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's first satellite broadcasting system is expected to debut this year, 
beaming 150 TV channels of shows, movies and sporting events to homes across 
the country that are equipped with pizza-sized satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-powered, direct-to-home satellite broadcasting will originate in the 
$100 million Castle Rock Broadcast Center in Castle Rock, Colo., 30 miles south 
of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch these satellite network broadcasts, viewers will first have to buy 
reception gear called the Digital Satellite System; RCA-brand DSS equipment 
will start at $699. 
</P>
<P>
 With a properly aimed 18-inch diameter satellite dish, viewers will be able to 
receive programming from a pair of communications satellites orbiting close to 
one another. One went into orbit last December with the other scheduled to 
launch this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTv, a unit of General Motors' subsidiary, GM Hughes Electronics, will use 
more than 80% of the satellites' capacity. Another programming provider, United 
States Satellite Broadcasting in St. Paul, Minn., will use the rest to offer a 
different lineup of channels to DSS owners. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the 150 channels that DirecTv plans to offer will be 
devoted to pay-per-view movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But though 50 channels might be set aside for pay-per-view, this does not mean 
that subscribers will have a choice of 50 different movies at any given time. 
An especially popular movie might play on eight different channels, with 
starting times staggered. 
</P>
<P>
 For each tape that goes out on the air, Castle Rock will be rolling a backup 
tape in unison. If something goes wrong with the main copy, a technician or 
machine can switch over to the backup feed. Airing times would be dictated by a 
schedule generated in DirecTv's corporate headquarters in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTv expects that about 40 channels in its lineup will be familiar cable 
services such as CNN, USA, the Nashville Network, TNT and the Discovery 
Channel, which are themselves distributed nationally via different satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTv also plans to offer about 40 channels of sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our emphasis in Year One -- in 1994 -- is quality, quality, quality," DirecTv 
president Eddy Hartenstein said. "We have one chance to get it right, and 
that's the first chance."

TOOLS; GETTING A HANDLE ON MEASURING DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Projects built "by guess and by gosh" usually look that way and result in a 
nightmare of fitting and adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some basic measuring tools and some hints for using them expertly: 
</P>
<P>
 Retractable measuring tape. Made of spring steel that rolls into a metal case, 
it is the most important all-around measuring tool. A useful length is 25 feet. 
A hook on the end of the tape catches the work piece, making long measurements 
a one-person job. When reading a measuring tape, twist it slightly so the 
markings touch the project. View the tape at a right angle to obtain an 
accurate reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Folding carpenter's rule. Used where a rigid measuring tool is needed. Folding 
rules are made of wood and usually have brass hinges. Sections are 12 inches 
long; when unfolded, standard rules measure six or eight feet in length. The 
most useful style has a sliding extension for making inside measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel rule. Neither of the above tools afford a reliable straightedge for 
drawing lines. For that, you can use a rigid steel rule. These come in lengths 
ranging from 12 to 48 inches, or you can use one of the tools favored instead 
by most builders and cabinetmakers -- either a combination square or a 
carpenter's square. A carpenter's level also works as a straightedge.  
</P>
<P>
 Combination square. Consists of a metal ruler, or blade, usually 12 inches 
long and a shorter, sliding handle that attaches to it precisely at a right 
angle. Most models also have an edge that forms a 45-degree angle with the 
blade (useful for dividing right angles in half when fitting molding), a small 
built-in level, and a removable scribing tool for marking. Besides functioning 
as a straightedge, a combination square can be used for measuring, checking the 
squareness of corners, leveling horizontal surfaces, and as a depth gauge for 
cutouts like those needed for inlaying door and cabinet hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's square. A large right-angled strip of metal designed for marking 
lumber used in house construction. Standard models have a wide 24-inch blade 
and a narrower six-inch blade, called the tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's level. The most useful are two to four feet long and have three or 
more bubble vials to enable checking vertical as well as horizontal surfaces. 
As with a measuring tape, when using a level, be sure to view it at a right 
angle to obtain an accurate reading. Even a slight error can be significant on 
long surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk line. For marking straight lines longer than is practical with a 
straightedge, use a chalk line. This is a small metal case containing chalk and 
50 to 100 feet of string on a reel. Pull the string from the case, hold it taut 
between two points on a surface, and snap it to leave a chalk mark as a guide. 
The tool also functions as a plumb bob to establish a vertical line. Hang the 
string so the case is just above the ground; when the case stops swinging, the 
line is vertical. 
</P>
<P>
 Sliding T-bevel. Used for setting, checking and transferring angles. This 
adjustable gauge consists of a straight-sided wood or metal handle with a 
slotted metal blade connected to it at one end. The blade pivots to form any 
angle with the handle and locks in place. Set the angle from an existing one or 
match it to markings on a protractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Profile gauge. Records the shape of an irregular design -- for instance, the 
contours of molding -- for tracing onto a template or piece of stock. The tool 
has a row of movable metal or plastic pins that assume the profile of whatever 
object they are pressed against.

GARDENING; THREE POTTED-PLANT WINNERS: COLOR THEM PROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A multicolor lantana, a red geranium and a pink impatiens are 1994 FloraStar 
winners for new potted-plant introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our testing shows they should perform well in climates across the country," 
says Mike Novovesky, FloraStar's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those participating in the selection process were the University of 
Georgia, University of Florida, Michigan State, Penn State and Washington 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 The lantana -- Patriot Rainbow -- is from American Daylily and Perennials, 
Grain Valley, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the judges: "The hallmark of this new lantana is its very compact and 
moderately slow growth habit. The internode spaces are very short, and 
self-branching is spontaneous; no pinching is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The color is described as ranging from chiffon yellow to orange to fuchsia 
pink, providing intense hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Foliage is typical lantana shape and scent, but leaves are smaller and more 
closely arranged. It forms a globe-shaped mound of 12 to 16 inches in a single 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The geranium -- Star Burst Red -- is from Ball FloraPlant of West Chicago, 
Ill. It resulted from a cross of a single-flowered salmon with white red strips 
and a pure white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The novelty of this plant is its variable color . . . a real head-turner," 
said the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Foliage is medium-green. 
</P>
<P>
 The impatiens -- Pink Ice -- is from D.S. Cole Growers of Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the judges: "This plant offers a new color to the variegated foliage, 
Summer-Ice series of impatiens. The variegated foliage is not only very 
attractive but has a growing habit that is much more compact than the greenleaf 
type of double impatiens." 
</P>
<P>
 A mature plant will be about 10 to 12 inches high and 12 to 14 inches wide 
"and makes an excellent hanging basket." Flowers are described as a strong 
pink. 
</P>
<P>
 FloraStar, a subsidiary of the Professional Plant Growers Assn., began 
announcing selections five years ago for potted plants. Its members include 
such major seed suppliers as Park Seed, Paul Ecke Poinsettias, Bodger Seed and 
Ball Seed and commercial growers such as Ellison's Greenhouse, Konjolan's 
Greenhouse, Park Floral, Lovell Farms, Molback's Greenhouse, Malmborg's, W.J. 
Miller, C. Baker & Sons, White's Nursery and Nurseryman's Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Novovesky is a former president of All-America Rose Selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be declared a winner, the new plant must offer improved performance and 
value to the commercial grower and consumer," he says. 
</P>

DECORATING; DORM ROOM IS A STUDY IN SMART USE OF SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serious thoughts of a college freshman's first home away from home often get 
lost in the rush to shop for campus clothes and to crowd in one last summer 
with childhood pals. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, because you'll have to squeeze a lot of living -- and studying -- 
into a dorm room that is at best probably a minuscule single or barely big 
enough to share with another newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dorm rooms are initially Spartan, furnished with bed, bureau, desk and 
chair and, maybe, a desk lamp. Occupants supply comforts and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to an effective make-over is to take advantage of every inch," says 
Patricia Shaw, style director for the JCPenney home furnishings catalogues in 
Plano, Tex. "Start with colorful bed linens and matching curtains. They don't 
take up any room but add a good deal of color and pattern to what is almost 
always a neutral space." 
</P>
<P>
 A wall-mounted bulletin board is useful for class schedules and assignment 
deadlines. Some schools say no to nails in the walls. If so, prop the bulletin 
board against a wall above a dresser or desk. Or, if it's light enough, try 
attaching it with double-faced tape. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's space and money, buy a few storage cubes to stack as a bedside 
table. A floor lamp that can be moved as needed nearer the bed or next to the 
desk will provide extra lighting. A wicker trunk can double as a storage unit 
and extra seating. 
</P>
<P>
 As a luxury, consider an area rug next to the bed. Washable bath mats are 
practical and come in a range of sizes and patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any college students who will wash a rug," Shaw says, "but 
they will bring it home to Mom's washing machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Bring family photos and mementos. They go a long way toward counteracting that 
institutional feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make room for a wall of photos and poster art, no matter how tiny and crowded 
the room. The closet door can be another display place," says Ro Logrippo of 
Burlingame, Calif., an author of books on design. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight foam-core board, available in art supply stores, makes a better 
surface than a wall. It can be mounted with double-faced tape. Lightly coat 
backs of photos and posters with a spray adhesive before sticking them on the 
foam-core. 
</P>
<P>
 Logrippo suggests using the desktop as an auxiliary bulletin board. Have a 
piece of clear acrylic cut to size and tuck schedules and other reference 
materials underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 In shared rooms, privacy is hard to come by. A folding screen can provide some 
visual privacy and serve as a tackboard surface.

FURNISHINGS; HERTER BROTHERS CRAFTED PIECES FOR A GILDED AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY L. ROSS, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From immigrant cabinetmakers to White House decorators went the careers of 
Christian and Gustave Herter. The German-born brothers became custom furniture 
makers and society decorators during the Gilded Age. They furnished the 
residences of American millionaires such as J. Pierpont Morgan, Mark Hopkins, 
William H. Vanderbilt and Jay Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustave Herter (1830-1898) had a penchant for heavily ornamented baroque and 
Louis XIV-style furniture. Christian Herter (1839-1883) achieved a marriage of 
European styles, including French-style Greek Revival and Anglo-Japanese.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1875, when the wife of President Ulysses S. Grant wanted to embellish the 
Red Room, she ordered $3,765 worth of furniture from Herter Brothers, said 
assistant White House curator William Allman. A bill of sale lists gilt 
reception chairs covered in black and gold Japanese velvet with carved lion 
heads, ladies' chairs, a rosewood inlaid table with lion heads, a tapestry 
screen and gold Japanese satin draperies trimmed with damask velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 The table was found by Jacqueline Kennedy and placed in the Treaty Room, where 
it remained through the Reagan era. The table and a gilt chair are now in 
storage. The rest of the collection has been lost or sold. 
</P>
<P>
 (In a generation-skipping connection to the White House, a century after 
Christian Herter created furniture for President Grant, his grandson and 
namesake executed foreign policy for President Eisenhower as secretary of 
state.) 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Herter's ultimate commission -- he died in 1883, a year after its 
completion -- was the $2 million Vanderbilt mansion in New York, in which each 
room was designed with a different theme: Pompeiian vestibule, Japanese parlor, 
Renaissance dining room, Moorish smoking room and Anglo-Japanese bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 pieces of the Herters' work are the subject of a retrospective at the 
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The exhibit will travel to Atlanta's High 
Museum on Dec. 13 and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on March 
14. A catalogue and a companion book, "Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors 
for a Gilded Age," has been published by Harry N. Abrams (256 pages, $60).

CONSTRUCTION; LAY THE FOUNDATION WITH FAMILY, NEIGHBORS FOR A MODEL REMODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've lined up the money and signed off on the plan. But an army of 
tradespeople laying siege to your home can start kids squawking, dogs barking 
and neighbors talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions for ways to keep your sanity and prevent aggravation 
during a remodel: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare the family. Explain to kids what's about to take place and why. 
Construction sites are always dangerous, so make sure the kids know to stay 
clear. Put in temporary doors or gates to keep toddlers and pets out of 
unfinished areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inform the neighbors. Noise, debris and curbside traffic jams are all part 
of a remodeling. If you have neighbors nearby, it can't hurt to warn them. Ask 
if they have any concerns. They may have a baby who needs a quiet nap or a pet 
that needs to be kept inside during your work. To keep things friendly, you 
might offer to let your neighbors use your construction dumpster or pick over 
your scrap pile. Throw a party when you're done. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be nice to the crews. Have coffee and doughnuts to offer them in the 
morning. Then leave them alone. If you have questions or changes, talk to the 
person you signed the contract with, not the subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set guidelines. After several weeks, even the nicest tradespeople in your 
house can become aggravating. For peace of mind, and to avoid confrontations 
later, talk to your builder about starting and quitting times, loud music, 
bathroom access and daily cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss material storage. On jobs that take more than a few days, the 
storage of construction materials in your home, garage or driveway can be a 
nuisance. Explore alternatives with your builder beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store breakables. Chances are the first crew in on a remodeling will be 
there for demolition or rough framing. Don't tempt fate and expect them to 
tiptoe around a lot of expensive cut crystal. Move antiques, furniture and 
anything breakable before work begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase security. The vast majority of contractors are trustworthy. On rare 
occasions they may hire a helper who is less so. At a minimum, keep valuables 
locked up. If you can't be at home while the work is being done, find ways to 
limit access with your builder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be nice to yourself. Budget some extra money for rest and relaxation. Take a 
few day trips to get away. Go to the movies or visit friends in the evenings. 
And, at least once a day, think about how great everything will look when it's 
done.

REDECORATING; AS MAKE-OVER, WAINSCOTING ISN'T HALF BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to make over the appearance of a room without spending a lot of 
time and money, consider wainscoting. 
</P>
<P>
 By covering the bottom half of the walls with wood or paneling, you can 
disguise serious damage or wall defects and have a treatment that complements 
many decorating schemes because it takes on a natural finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Wainscoting applies to many different wall treatments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Flat-panel wainscoting, which consists of a series of flat panels surrounded 
with rails and stiles much like cabinet doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raised-panel wainscoting, considered a more elegant version of the 
treatment, and 
</P>
<P>
 * Double V-joint and bead wainscoting, most prevalent in older houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is still available in open stock at many lumber yards, usually in 
pine or fir and in different grades. If you plan to paint wainscoting, you can 
save money by using a less expensive grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Installation starts by deciding the height of the chair rail -- 36 inches is 
fairly standard. The chair rail is the decorative top trim to the wainscoting, 
and the baseboard finishes the bottom at floor level. 
</P>
<P>
 You will need horizontal nailing for the boards at least every 24 inches. This 
is required when narrow boards are applied vertically to bridge the gaps 
between the vertical studs behind the present wall surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 These studs are usually on 16-inch centers, and the horizontal furring strips 
should be nailed through these studs or inlet into the wall to bear on them 
directly. They form the solid and straight supports for the wainscoting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wall is ready, the next step is to cut all the wainscoting boards to 
length. Start installing your wainscoting alongside a door casing or in the 
corner of the room. Use a level to plumb the first board.  
</P>
<P>
 Because each wainscoting board has a tongue on one side and a groove on the 
other, all the following boards can be nailed to the furring strips through the 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Tap each board firmly into the groove of the one already up before nailing it. 
This way the nails will be covered by the next board and won't show. Work 
carefully to avoid splitting the tongue, and angle the nails about 45 degrees 
so they won't block the groove of the next board. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-handed people find it easiest to work from left to right.  
</P>
<P>
 When you come to an electrical outlet, turn off the power, remove the cover 
plate and pull the receptacle out of the box, taking care not to damage the 
insulation. Don't remove the wires. Cut the board or boards to match the edge 
of the box and screw the receptacle into the opening when the boards are nailed 
up.

BRING A BIT OF SUMMER INSIDE WITH NEW PLANTS GROWN FROM CUTTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems only fair there should be a way to capture the color of the summer 
flower garden and save it for winter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is a way, and it costs little and is infinitely rewarding, 
especially for the new gardener. It is the practice of taking cuttings from 
certain plants, rooting them and planting them in pots and hanging baskets. 
With a little nurturing, they will grow into glorious clones of their summer 
selves, sustaining warm color and brightness through the cooler months. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an aspect of gardening that seems to dwell simultaneously in two worlds. 
It is highly practical -- you're getting the equivalent of a hanging basket for 
free -- but also quite magical: The business of turning a section of stem into 
a fully equipped plant is mysterious to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 A cutting is simply a short, four- to eight-inch stem piece snipped off the 
plant -- it might or might not include existing flowers and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 With some plants, the cutting must be done with the skill of a surgeon. With 
most garden annuals, however, even the newest gardeners can produce results 
with any stem from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a growing medium -- water is fine for these willing recruits -- the bottom 
of the stem soon will produce small white roots. Old hands avoid the urge 
simply to dig up the whole original plant and bring it in -- with time, rooted 
cuttings are sturdier and healthier indoor companions. 
</P>
<P>
 To make indoor plants out of outdoor annuals, you need to begin now. First 
assemble supplies: containers and hanging baskets of various sizes, bagged 
potting soil, compost, perlite, houseplant fertilizer or an all-purpose organic 
fertilizer such as fish emulsion and optional rooting compound or powder. All 
are available at garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hundreds of plant varieties lend themselves to cloning through 
cuttings and rooting, there are a handful of sure-fire hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Varieties that have soft or succulent stems will root most easily, while those 
with stiff or slightly woody stems tend to be the most reluctant. Three that 
root readily are geraniums, basil and impatiens. Coincidentally, these three 
also make good potted plants, so they are ideal for this project. 
</P>
<P>
 First, take your cuttings. With good scissors, cut the stem cleanly for a 
four- to eight-inch piece. Take prunings from several parts of the plant and 
from more than one variety since they come in a range of colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Put cuttings in a container that will not crowd them -- a wide-mouth jar, a 
small bucket -- so they are submerged about halfway up in water, like a bouquet 
of flowers. This is the easiest way, and it works very well to get stems to 
begin rooting. Another method is to dunk stem ends in water, followed by a dip 
in rooting powder, a hormone that stimulates root growth. These then are not 
put in water, but pushed into a container of moistened perlite, a white, pearly 
and sterile growing medium used to add porosity to potting soils and to root 
cuttings. The second method will deliver more certain results, but it takes 
more space and requires a little more expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 If cuttings are in water, you will be able to see when stems begin showing 
roots. Some stems will blacken and wither, but most will develop roots within 
two weeks. When the roots get about three inches long, the new plant cuttings 
are ready to go into a planting medium. This stage is the trickiest and, 
because of the transition, has the highest rate of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 A carefully prepared growing medium will increase the chances of success. To 
get containers ready for the young plants, mix two parts potting soil, two 
parts compost, one part perlite. Blend and moisten so it is wet but not soaked. 
Then fill the containers. 
</P>
<P>
 You can put several cuttings in one pot, but bury them deeply -- between two 
and four, or even six inches -- and plant gently to avoid damage to the young 
roots. Carefully firm the planting medium around each plant. You will know in a 
few days whether the cutting has taken -- a successful one will look healthy 
and sturdy. A wilting plant probably won't make it. Once the cuttings are 
launched, fertilize them and prune their tops back to encourage branching 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 You can continue to grow these plants inside, providing you give them enough 
light, but most gardeners prefer to set them outside for the first few weeks of 
growth. Don't put them in direct sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are outside, you will have to acclimate them to their eventual indoor 
habitat. When the weather gets cooler, bring them inside in the evening and set 
them out during the day. After a week, reduce their outdoor time to half a day. 
A week or so later, the transition should be complete.

FIGURE IN DENNY CASE ARRESTED IN ALLEGED ASSAULT; POLICE: ANTOINE MILLER IS 
ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SHOOT A MOTORIST. HE PLEADED GUILTY TO COMMITTING A FELONY 
ATTACK DURING 1992 RIOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Antoine Eugene Miller, who became a symbol of the Los Angeles riots for his 
role in the attack on truck driver Reginald O. Denny, was arrested Friday on 
suspicion of trying to shoot a motorist just three blocks from a flash point of 
the riots at Florence and Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 22, is accused of trying to fire a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol 
at a driver from point-blank range after an argument, said Deputy Chief Mark 
Kroeker of the Los Angeles Police Department. The gun jammed and did not go 
off, Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got in an argument with two African American males, who were seated in a 
car," LAPD spokeswoman Sandra Castello said of the incident, which occurred 
last Sunday. "He ran into a house and came back out with a . . . chrome-plated 
pistol. He walked up and pointed the gun point-blank and pulled the trigger, 
but it was unable to fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Miller fired the gun before he got to the driver's side of the car 
near 71st Street and Normandie Avenue, police said. The target of the attempted 
shooting picked up an unknown number of bullet casings at the scene and took 
them to the 77th Street Division police station, Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD detectives arrested Miller at 7:10 a.m. Friday after raiding a home where 
he was staying, Castello said. He was booked on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon and held without bail at the 77th Street station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, one of four primary defendants in the Denny trial, had been charged 
with premeditated attempted murder in that case but pleaded guilty in November, 
1993, to lesser charges of felonious assault and two related misdemeanor 
counts. In exchange for his plea, he was given no prison time and placed on 27 
months of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Supervising Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills repeatedly 
stressed to Miller that he would not hesitate to send him to prison for 
violation of probation if Miller became "significantly involved" in any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will be carrying the key to the penitentiary around in your pocket, young 
man," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's probation had been scheduled to end in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Seville Colston, who with her husband Greg raised Miller for much of his 
childhood, expressed surprise at the arrest, describing Miller as "a troubled 
little kid with problems, but he wasn't real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 A talented artist who recently had shown some of his drawings to the Walt 
Disney studios, Miller tended to be shy and to hide his feelings, Colston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always made light of things," she said. "That's why it's shocking to me 
that he even had a 9-millimeter whatever it was. I've never known him to play 
with guns. I've never known that side of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Colston, who runs an auto repair shop at 69th Street and Vermont Avenue, 
said Miller had been spending much of his time there, visiting. Greg Colston 
said he learned of the arrest late Friday and theorized that Miller may have 
been the target of others who wanted to do him harm in some way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it -- I can't believe it," Greg Colston said. "He comes by my 
shop all the time. I've been trying to keep him in the right direction. I don't 
believe this (stuff) that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's attorney in the Denny case, James R. Gillen, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In videotapes of the Denny beating in 1992, Miller was seen opening the door 
of Denny's truck before Denny was pulled from it and severely beaten. However, 
lawyers from both sides agreed that Miller committed no acts of violence 
against Denny. The videotapes also showed Miller going through Denny's pockets 
later, as he lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never in my life beat on nobody," Miller said after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 He ultimately pleaded guilty to felony assault with a deadly weapon for 
throwing a metal-encased telephone book at the car in which Marisa Bejar was 
riding at Florence and Normandie, opening a gash in her head and showering her 
7-month-old baby with glass. The two misdemeanor charges involved receiving a 
stolen purse and taking papers from Denny's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller's arrest Friday, one activist -- a block-club captain in a 
Neighborhood Watch program near Florence and Normandie -- polled others in her 
group on the alleged incident. No one seemed surprised by it, the activist 
said, declining to be named for fear of repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to do something to get these types of people off the street -- 
(the ones) that are going to be running for their guns and wiping out people," 
the block club captain said. "It makes life so cheap."

FEELING HEMMED IN BY NO-PANTS DRESS CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given that women run everything from the Justice Department to Hollywood 
studios, and seeing as this is California, where -- according to mythology -- 
every way of life is embraced and no style of anything is forbidden, it may 
seem quaint to realize that some women still cannot wear pants to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's just an unspoken code, other times it's a blatant rule. Either 
way, the state Legislature narrowly avoided tackling the issue this week. A 
bill to prohibit employers from refusing to let women wear pants to work was 
killed on the Senate floor Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stately Biltmore Hotel Downtown is one place where the no-pants policy is 
strict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not recommended," public relations director Maureen Stokes said about 
wearing pants. "It's part of the hotel policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes herself was swathed in a long sweep of below-the-knee lilac skirt with 
stockings and pumps. "I love skirts," said Stokes, who would not wear pants 
even if the hotel allowed her to. It is a matter of her religion, she said. 
"Pentecostals don't wear pants." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other women at the hotel who long to wear pants and who watched 
the demise of the state bill with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to write to all the ladies in Sacramento," said one executive 
assistant who said she would wear pants to work if she could. Even the hotel 
maids cannot wear them. "I don't see what's wrong with a maid wearing them -- 
to vacuum, getting under beds, scrubbing floors." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither she nor the gray-dress-clad maids would be wearing pants this 
week. "It's just not a tradition in the hotel industry," she said. "And the 
hotel industry is very conservative. You don't go around changing things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At other places the policy is less a written rule and more what the business 
world will accept.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really up to the local manager for the division," said Kathy Marshel, 
regional manager for personal financial services at the Los Angeles office of 
Chase Manhattan Bank. Marshel has no problems with women at the bank wearing 
pants but rarely chooses them herself. "In our division, we deal with a lot of 
high net worth individuals. When you're dealing with that kind of clientele, 
you project that kind of image." 
</P>
<P>
 Others chafed at a vague but powerful sense of restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it sucks," said Elizabeth Klune, 32, who sells financial services for 
Chase Manhattan. "I think it's ridiculous. I have to wear a suit and nylons, 
and I carry around 70 pounds of equipment," she said of the laptop computer, 
files, briefcase and garment bag that accompany her when she calls on clients. 
"I think it's discriminatory to ask someone with a smaller frame to carry that 
around while they're in high heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she was standing in the Chase's carpeted reception area wearing 
jeans, a knit top and a print jacket. Chase is just one of many Downtown 
companies that have made Fridays into a festival of dressing down. But just on 
Fridays. And not to visit clients. 
</P>
<P>
 So she lives up to the suited dress codes she believes her clients expect. She 
even makes concessions with her pierced earrings. She only wears two. "I have 
three holes in my right ear," she said chuckling as she fingered her Friday 
casual dangling earring, "and two in my left ear. My last boss at Chemical Bank 
lectured me. . . . He said, 'I would not have all those earrings."' 
</P>
<P>
 At City National Bank, there are no restrictions on women wearing pants. "That 
went out," said Vickie Piatt, a vice president at the Pershing Square branch 
who was clad in jeans for dress-down Friday. "The last bank I worked at had a 
rule that women couldn't wear pants. That bank closed," she said, laughing. "I 
don't think that was the reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatt said she believes she has more flexibility than men in what she wears. 
"I think in the financial industry, the dress code is more restrictive for men. 
They are expected to wear suits and coats. I can wear nice pants and a dressy 
blouse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But her colleague, Beverly Ellis, a vice president and commercial loan 
officer, said her personal dress code makes her stay away from pants. She did 
make an exception Friday, wearing a fashionable pantsuit in keeping with the 
office's casual mode. However, she feels more comfortable in skirts when she is 
working with clients from multimillion-dollar companies who come looking for 
financing. "I'm a feminist, I kept my maiden name," Ellis said. "But for me, 
it's just not something I wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the bill bristle at the notion that they are sexist. "I see 
nothing wrong in letting women wear pants," said state Sen. K. Maurice 
Johannessen (who lets women in his office wear pants), "but I just see 
something wrong in dictating to businesses what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to save the legislation, the bill's author, Assemblywoman Diane 
Martinez (D-Monterey Park), has merged it with another bill on employment 
discrimination that will hit the Assembly floor next week.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the last decade of this century, it's entirely appropriate that women's 
business attire include pants," Martinez said. "We do not take away an 
employer's right to demand professional dress."

CITYSCAPES / MARC LACEY: PAWNSHOP STANDS ALONE IN OFFERING 24-HOUR SERVICE; 'I 
THINK I'M DOING A GREAT SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. A PAWNSHOP IS REALLY JUST AN 
ATM FOR THE POOR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Convenience stores, taco stands, doughnut shops, automated teller machines and 
adult bookstores are open 24 hours a day all across this sprawling city. So why 
not an around-the-clock pawnshop, figured entrepreneur David Zimberg. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Zimberg installed a night window at his Pico Boulevard shop, 
allowing customers to trade in their wares from the sidewalk. On a good night, 
the shop makes 45 loans, taking in everything from jewelry to appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Las Vegas has plenty of pawnshops that never close, Zimberg's store 
is the city's first and, industry officials say, may be the only one in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimberg, 36, a Russian immigrant who owns 16 pawnshops throughout the area, 
contends that he is serving the mother who needs diapers for her baby at 1 a.m. 
or the family man low on cash but trying to bring home some milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm doing a great service to the community," he says. "A pawnshop is 
really just an ATM for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents of the area have a decidedly different view, and they have 
prompted city officials to push for greater regulation of the city's 120 
pawnshops. The residents say such stores attract drug users desperate for their 
next fix and burglars trying to quickly unload their loot.  
</P>
<P>
 "If this were Las Vegas, I could see a pawnshop open 24 hours a day," said 
Albert Boker, who lives near Zimberg's store. "(But) there are no casinos here. 
They are open for criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ron Mayberry, president of the Baldwin Neighborhood Homeowners Assn.: "I 
consider a pawnshop worse than a liquor store. Some youngster might take his 
mother's possessions and try to get $10 for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the city retires for the night, business continues sporadically at the 
window of Union Pawn Brokers. The picture is bleaker than that at any ATM. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much you want?" the employee behind the window says. It is 8 p.m. on a 
Wednesday. He wears a gun on his hip and sits behind security glass, watching 
TV between deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-five bucks," Gabriel Mayorga responds as he hands over an electric 
tile cutter, one that he uses on his contracting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pawnshop employee, who won't give his name, offers the 19-year-old Mayorga 
$10 and will not bargain a bit. Mayorga, who says he needs the money to go 
drinking with a friend, accepts. He will buy back the tile cutter for $17 the 
next day, which is payday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's easier to just borrow money here than to borrow it from 
friends," Mayorga says. "Not everybody has ATM cards. That's the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:15 p.m., a man pawns a ring for a pile of singles. He plans to pick the 
ring up within the month but says he needs some gas money and something to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Lewis steps up to the window at 10:35 p.m. and tries to get $10 for a 
broken pager. The employee inspects it, calls his boss at home and then says no 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I come at 1 or 2 in the morning," Lewis says. "My girl will come in 
late and say we need this or that." 
</P>
<P>
 It is now minutes before 11 p.m. and a man named Percival is trying 
unsuccessfully to extend the loan on an electric drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I'm out of money," he explains. "I'm unemployed. I'm living in a 
motel. I don't like coming here, but it's a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 11 p.m., an older couple step up to the night window, underneath 
the flashing "OPEN 24 HOURS" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 She leans forward and he gently unlatches the chain from around her neck. She 
slips off a ring and pulls some other jewelry out of her purse. She wants at 
least $30, but the employee will only offer $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Her earrings are next. She slips them off her ears and drops them into the 
tray. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tense delay, the employee gives a thumbs up sign. It's a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The desperation does not just touch on the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a secured parking lot in Reseda, where Zimberg has 200 pawned cars, there 
is a Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 And a former Los Angeles Laker has pawned two World Championship rings at 
Zimberg's store. The Laker did not pay back his loan in time so Zimberg -- 
whose motto is "Need the Dough? Let Us Know" -- owns them now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Councilman Nate Holden toured Zimberg's pawnshop this week, it was for 
both personal and professional reasons. Holden's Mid-City district is home to 
20 pawnshops, including Zimberg's, and the councilman persuaded the City 
Council this week to take the first step toward regulating the hours and 
locations of such establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping by Zimberg's store Thursday afternoon for a firsthand look, Holden 
scoured the display cases for some of his own possessions. Holden's home was 
burglarized earlier in the year and the police have yet to crack the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimberg gave Holden the VIP tour, leading him past the guard dog and through 
the crowded shelves of merchandise in the back room. Holden did not find a 
thing of his own and Zimberg says the belief that pawnshops traffic in stolen 
goods is by and large a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires pawnbrokers to take a fingerprint from customers and be 
shown a valid California driver's license, according to the Collateral Loan and 
Secondhand Dealers Assn. In addition, the serial numbers of all items must be 
reported to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimberg has gone even further, tying his computer directly into the computer 
used by the Los Angeles Police Department's pawnshop detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs in his shop, Zimberg has a small table of goods that the police have 
determined to be stolen. Waiting to be picked up by the rightful owners are a 
rifle, two pistols and an assortment of wooden carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city does not act, there may be other 24-hour pawnshops soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Herald Hirsch, owner of 5-Minute Pawn Shop, is mulling over the idea of 
expanding his hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person thinks that 85% to 100% of those who use pawnshops are 
thieves and drug dealers," Hirsch said. "That's wrong. There's a million 
different reasons why people need money."

SPOTLIGHT OVERLOOKS GIRLS' VICTORIES; SPORTS: NEWBURY PARK SOFTBALL TEAMS WON 
CHAMPIONSHIPS -- BUT BOYS GOT ALL THE GLORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Newbury Park girls' softball teams won national championships this month. 
But hardly anyone noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in its 22-year history, both divisions in Newbury Park's 
Bobby Sox girls' softball league brought home national titles. It was the third 
straight year that the older 12- to 15-year-old girls had captured the national 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 But while local newspapers featured the success of Thousand Oaks' boys Junior 
League national title last week, the girls' accomplishments received relatively 
little coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls are feeling bad about all the press that the boys' Little League 
has gotten," said Sheila Gourley, mother of 15-year-old left fielder Tara 
Gourley. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the fuss over the boys brought out the competitive spirit in these 
hard-as-nails fast-pitch girls.  
</P>
<P>
 "We should challenge them to a game," declared Amanda Marino, the 15-year-old 
catcher on one winning Newbury Park all-star team. "We'll beat them because 
we're tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity in media coverage reflects the public's long-held view that 
girls' organized sports are less compelling than boys' sports, said Joseph 
Joyce, president of the Newbury Park Bobby Sox league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a social issue, really," Joyce said. "Softball is just starting to come 
to the forefront now. . . . But it still does not have the public awareness 
that baseball does." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball also does not have high-paying professional leagues as a career 
option. So while the 13-year-old stars of the boys' Little League team talked 
about one day joining the major leagues, their female counterparts could only 
speak Friday of plans to play softball in high school and college. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Stokx, who pitched the last four innings for the 9- to 11-year-old Bobby 
Sox title at the national tournament in Sparks, Nev., said she plans to 
continue playing softball as a way to win a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But after college, her athletic plans will likely come to an end, Katie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably become a teacher or a nurse," said the 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Newbury Park teams were chosen for the national tournament based on 
their performance in a district tournament in July at Borchard Park. They then 
each beat out 24 other teams to take home the national titles in a tournament 
that ended on a blazing hot softball diamond in Sparks on Aug. 16.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite temperatures that reached 100, both teams managed to keep their cool 
when it came to the fundamentals of softball, Marissa Keohohou, manager of one 
of younger Bobby Sox team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our girls had the basics down," Keohohou said. "They caught the ball with two 
hands, they turned their back foot and hip forward while batting and they 
played good defense." 
</P>
<P>
 As the national titleholders, they are the top players out of 40,000 girls in 
the Bobby Sox league nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The softball league has teams in six western states, said George Rodriguez, 
chief executive of Bobby Sox National, headquartered in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Sox players can start out as 6-year-olds in the Mini League, then 
progress to the Bobby Sox Division for girls 9 to 11. The American Girl 
division consists of 12- to 15-year-olds; then, some girls progress to the 
league's AAA Prep Division, Rodriguez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many girls on the AAA girls are on high school teams as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Newbury Park teams did a great job this year," Rodriguez said. "They 
deserve all the recognition they can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about girls' softball has always been paltry compared to the 
attention given to boys' organized baseball, said Mark Yamauchi, coach of 
Newbury Park's older team. The day after the girls clinched their titles, a 
local newspaper carried a sports-page feature about the boys Little League 
all-star team above two brief stories written about the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because people hold a misconception about the level of play in Bobby 
Sox leagues, Yamauchi said. His star pitcher, Stacie Beshore, used five 
different pitches to defeat Koolau, Hawaii 19-12 at the national tournament, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fast ball reaches the mid-50 m.p.h. range, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls don't play a wimpy game," Yamauchi said. "Their level of play is 
very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Player Heather Buchanan said boys are impressed when they come to watch the 
girls play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes guys think of girls' sports as kind of lame," said Heather, who 
plays third base. "Then they see Stacie pitching and they go, 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Bobby Sox team clinched the national title after beating Tustin 
3-2 and 8-3. It is the first time that Newbury Park's younger team has brought 
home the national crown, Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a gathering Friday, the younger girls were nonchalant about their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of time practicing," said Jennifer Dilley, 10, the youngest 
player on the team. "We worked well as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 But the older girls were more assertive about what they had achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys deserve the coverage, but we do too," Heather said. "We worked just 
as hard."

U.S. OFFICIAL STRENGTHENS TIES TO FIELD WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Maria Echaveste's parents told her she was making a big mistake 22 years ago 
when she accepted a scholarship to Stanford University instead of looking for a 
blue-collar job in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her farm worker father, who had no formal education and was taught by his wife 
to sign his name, even tried to discourage her from entering Channel Islands 
High School in 1968, urging her to labor in the fields for the sake of her poor 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a girl, and girls don't need education, that's what he thought," said 
Echaveste, who became a lawyer. "I think that was a very traditional Mexican 
reaction. But I was the eldest daughter, and I was challenging that." 
</P>
<P>
 Echaveste now holds a powerful job in Washington as the head of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and her folks have long since 
acknowledged that she did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is still distressed by childhood memories of picking tomatoes and 
strawberries under a scorching sun, and is haunted by recollections of the 
wretched concrete shacks that she lived in with her parents, four sisters and 
two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agriculture is a big part of Ventura County, so farm workers are also," 
Echaveste said. "But it seems like people want to keep the farm workers out of 
sight, so they don't have to see how they have to live. It's a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Oxnard's Colonia neighborhood for her sister's wedding, Echaveste 
visited one of Ventura County's worst slums -- the Oxnard Mobilehome Lodge -- 
Friday with representatives from California Rural Legal Assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 What she saw there upset her but came as no surprise: Living conditions for 
farm workers have barely improved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There continue to be a lot of the problems that were present when I was in 
the fields," Echaveste said. "I lived in concrete shacks with no bathrooms that 
were better than what people have today." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,100 people -- mostly farm workers -- live in about 140 tattered 
metal trailers at the park, which has no sewers or bathrooms. An inspection in 
1991 found 1,197 health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders have discussed closing the park since 1985, when a fire that 
charred three of the tiny trailers left 25 people homeless. So far, little has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has vowed since 1992 to relocate the park residents, and recently 
purchased land for a low-cost housing project. But residents say they are being 
betrayed by the city, because they will not be able to afford the homes that 
are being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking around the shabby streets of the trailer park, Echaveste talked to 
residents about their problems in rusty Spanish, keeping notes to take back to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 While a boy played Frisbee in the street with a paint lid, Echaveste talked to 
Alberto Madrigal, who lives in a decrepit trailer with his wife and four 
children -- one of whom has to sleep under a table. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to live in these conditions," Echaveste said later. "(Madrigal) 
said that it's just not right to have no privacy when your daughters are 
growing up. He has a bed in his kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Echaveste conceded that from her position, which puts her in charge of 
enforcing minimum wage and child labor standards, there is little she can do to 
help the trailer residents, other than notify the federal department of Housing 
and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do much about this," she said. "But I think there is a lot of value 
in having government workers see for themselves what the conditions are," she 
said. "It's one thing to sit behind a desk in Washington. It's another to see 
things for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 When she left Oxnard for Stanford, Echaveste saw for herself just how little 
people knew about farm workers -- and how much better others lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a total dramatic culture shock," she said of her college experience. 
"It was such a rich school. Kids had college prep classes, and were way ahead 
of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her disadvantages, Echaveste graduated from Stanford with high marks, 
went on to law school at Berkeley and quickly established herself in her field. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Hillary Clinton while serving on the board of the New World 
Foundation, a nonprofit agency that serves grants to social service 
organizations, and later became involved with Bill Clinton's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Echaveste served as Latino coordinator during the campaign, helping Clinton 
court the Latino vote. She later worked on Clinton's transition team before 
being appointed to her current job by the Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite feeling helpless in situations like her tour of the mobile home park, 
her idealism, and enthusiasm for government, have not waned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it would be faster, but bureaucracy and government is really 
difficult," she said. "It really matters who you have in the positions, though. 
You need people who care."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; BIDDERS SHUN BARGAINS TO SUPPORT 4-H 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 The Voorheeses of Camarillo nearly always make it to the fairgrounds on the 
last Friday of every county fair.  
</P>
<P>
 That's when they go shopping for pork.  
</P>
<P>
 Bacon, sausage, pork chops, ham hocks, even pepperoni -- within a month after 
the Ventura County Fair ends, their freezer is stocked full of all the edible 
products their butcher can muster from a 4-H pig.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did 4-H 35 years ago, and the buyers came by and supported us then," Alan 
Voorhees explained. "So it's fun to come by and support these kids now." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the hundreds of others who showed up at the fair's large livestock barn 
Friday to purchase animals, Alan and Jane Voorhees knew they would pay more 
than twice the market price for the hog they bought.  
</P>
<P>
 But as buyers point out repeatedly during the daylong event, the auction is 
not about bargains. It's about supporting the children who participate in 4-H 
-- which stands for Head, Heart, Hands and Health -- and Future Farmers of 
America, and supporting the farming traditions of the groups themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of steers, calves, swine, lambs and goats that went on the 
auction block Friday are the products of months of labor and care by youngsters 
across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the child learns how to take responsibility for another creature, 
the adult group organizers say.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the animal itself -- well, pampered beasts make for marvelous food, 
buyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, most stuff sold as lamb is more mature and older and not fed 
as well," said Sol Chooljian, a management consultant from Camarillo who came 
to the auction to buy the sheep raised by children from his neighborhood. "This 
meat is lighter tasting and not as gamy." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all the animals land in the slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that I could do anything with it but put it in my back yard and 
raise it," said Jeanne Anderson of Ventura, who planned to bid for her niece's 
calf at the auction. "I look 'em in the eyes and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim DeBiasio planned to keep the calf he purchased from Toby Fullington of 
Small Valley 4-H, adding it to the herd at his ranch in Caliente, Calif. 
DeBiasio drove down to Ventura especially for the auction at the urging of a 
friend who was looking for buyers to support 4-H. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid $3.50 a pound for Toby's 200-pound calf -- $2.84 more a pound than if 
he had bought a calf commercially. "It's more expensive, but it's for 4-H and 
all that happy stuff," he said. "It's a breeder. It'll live until it stops 
producing."  
</P>
<P>
 The children did not shed tears over their animals as the auctioneers parceled 
them off to bidders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is more of a happy day because your pig got bid on and you are glad 
with how much he bought," said 12-year-old Lacey Walker of Las Posas 4-H, whose 
234-pound pig, Roastanne, sold for $3.50 a pound on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of the sale "doesn't sink in until Sunday" when the animals are 
shipped off to a processing plant and the children have to say goodby, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey rejoiced over the price she got for her pig -- Vons supermarkets 
purchased it -- but some calf and steer owners left the auction in tears 
because prices for their animals were unusually low this year. Auction 
organizers blamed a poor economy and the fact that the large animals sold first 
this year, before bidders got into the spirit of the auction and before enough 
free alcohol was consumed at the auction's bar.  
</P>
<P>
 Eva Reeder, a 14-year-old Future Farmer from Santa Paula, sold her 372-pound 
calf for only $1 a pound -- about a third of what she had hoped to get for the 
animal. The money will barely recoup what she spent boarding and feeding the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the calf and steer owners, however, barely broke stride to consider 
how much cash they could have made had the bidding gone higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing but it's not that bad," said Heather Hundley, 16, whose 
grand champion steer sold for $4 a pound -- $5 less per pound than last year's 
grand champion. " 'Cause it's fun. This is not for the money. I like raising 
animals and I like taking care of them. It's like having a big dog."

CONVICTED CHILD MOLESTER KILLS HIMSELF IN CAR WRECK; CRIME: WHILE AWAITING 
SENTENCING, THE CAMARILLO MAN SLAMS HIS VEHICLE INTO MUGU ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Camarillo man awaiting sentencing on child molestation charges killed 
himself by slamming his car into Mugu Rock, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Marz's death came one day after a Ventura County judge rejected a 
prosecutor's plea to lock him up because he was suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Marz, 65, was killed when his car crashed head-on into the landmark rock at 
9:40 p.m. Thursday, just off Pacific Coast Highway south of Oxnard, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said there were no skid marks leading to the rock 
which the car struck before bursting into flame. Four or five "very brave" 
people pulled Marz out of the car, Wingate said. He was pronounced dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona asked Superior Court Judge Charles 
Campbell to place Marz in custody for his own safety. Corona informed the judge 
that Marz had told several people that he was going to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty upsetting," the distraught prosecutor said Friday afternoon. "I 
tried to save him but I wasn't able to." 
</P>
<P>
 Countering Corona's motion, public defender Neil Quinn, who was representing 
Marz, objected to his client being placed in custody without being given a 
"notice hearing." This would give Quinn two days to review the case, Corona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell rejected Corona's request. Neither Quinn nor Campbell could be 
reached late Friday to respond to Corona's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Marz, who pleaded guilty July 22 to child molestation, was to be assigned a 
new psychologist for evaluation -- the reason for the hearing on Wednesday -- 
and was scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 21, Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the maximum penalty for the charge is 16 years in prison, but her 
office had yet to decide what sentence it would recommend to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 According to allegations made to authorities, the child molestation incidents 
date back more than a decade -- from November, 1982, to December, 1990, Corona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Leslie Warren, citing a California Highway Patrol report, said 
Marz's sedan had been traveling north on Pacific Coast Highway when it struck 
the landmark rock, which climbers often use to sharpen their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese, whose office autopsied the body on Friday, said 
the cause of death was traumatic head injuries. Investigator Wingate, who was 
called to the crash scene, said several people quickly pulled Marz from the car 
before it erupted in fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some very brave people got him out of the car, so his body was not burned," 
Wingate said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FILM OFFICE SHAKE-UP SOUNDS ALARM; MOVIES: ENTERTAINMENT 
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ALIKE WORRY THAT A RECENTLY IMPROVED 
RELATIONSHIP MAY SUFFER. THE INCIDENT REVEALS SOME STICKY ISSUES IN THE 
BIG-MONEY BUSINESS OF SHOOTING ON L.A. STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The abrupt firing last week of Stephanie Liner, the popular director of the 
county film office, has jolted the entertainment business and sounded an alarm 
among local government officials, who fear that her departure could stall the 
growing rapprochement with an industry that adds billions to Southern 
California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many industry executives hope that Liner's departure will not reverse recent 
strides made in improving relations and in stemming what had become an alarming 
exodus of filmmakers from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In a profession that is powered by personal relationships and deals sealed 
with a handshake, most agree that Liner had been able to establish a high level 
of rapport with entertainment executives while building community support for 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, officials with the Economic Development Corp., which runs the film 
office under contract with the county, have declined to comment on the reasons 
for Liner's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firing has provided a rare glimpse of the sticky interplay between a 
government beholden to constituents who don't like the disruption of film crews 
rumbling through their neighborhoods and an industry that -- for better or 
worse -- has come to symbolize Southern California's quirky personality. 
</P>
<P>
 If Southern California depends on the entertainment industry for its image, 
the industry depends on local officials to ease its job by eliminating the 
miles of bureaucratic red tape that can slow filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Film companies must have a permit to film on any property not zoned as a movie 
studio, including public buildings, parks, beaches, highways and street 
corners. But there are 72 different communities in the region, creating a maze 
of jurisdictions with often-conflicting rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the county film office and at the city of Los Angeles film 
office, both of which issue permits for location shooting, say that after 
several years of decline, the numbers of permits issued locally have begun to 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the turnaround is the result of a renewed recognition among local 
elected officials that television and movie production represent a valuable 
commodity in Southern California's tattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make it easier for filming to be done in the Los Angeles area . . 
. and we have to keep other areas that are trying to woo our film production 
away from being successful," said City Councilman Hal Bernson, who has pushed 
to consolidate local film operations into one unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But relations have not always been so rosy, say industry executives, who 
remember the bad old days when officials were more likely to hamper than help 
their efforts to mount productions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Partly it was a problem of familiarity breeds contempt," said Gini Barrett, a 
senior vice president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers. "The city and the industry grew up together and there was a 
tendency, frankly on both parts, to take each other for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 When 30 top industry officials attended a recent meeting of the County Board 
of Supervisors to protest Liner's dismissal, it may have been an unprecedented 
showing, culminating in a growing recognition by executives that there must be 
more involvement on their part if they are to win concessions that ease 
restrictions on filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen that many (industry) people turn out on something like this," 
said Cody Cluff, Mayor Richard Riordan's assistant deputy mayor for 
entertainment industry affairs. "I think there is an awareness among all 
elements of the industry that . . . if we don't get involved in government and 
how it is treating us, we're going to have to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several years, that is what many in the industry have done. 
Movie industry officials estimate that so-called runaway productions have cost 
the region as much as $2 billion annually. When added to the estimated $5 
billion that location production contributes to the economy of Los Angeles 
County each year, the stakes become truly staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobered by the recession and fierce competition from other states and 
countries for production dollars, county and city officials have launched an 
all-out drive to make the industry feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are in the works to merge the city and county film offices to smooth the 
issuance of film permits. Next month, the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments will unveil an ambitious plan to create a nonprofit corporation 
that would consolidate film permit procedures throughout a six-county region, 
while working to expand film production and other economic development 
associated with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because of the economic climate, this is now the fair-haired 
industry," said Patti Archuletta, director of the California Film Commission. 
"For the first time, I have cities coming to me that in that past have said 
filmmaking is an intrusion, but now are saying, 'How can we get some of it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many film executives believe their stock rose locally only when other areas 
began to aggressively seek their favors. According to industry and government 
officials, there are more than 250 film commissions outside of Los Angeles that 
each year spend more than $2 million on advertising and promotional displays to 
lure production dollars. Major studio facilities have been developed in New 
York, New Jersey, Texas, North Carolina, Hawaii, Chicago and Florida, and in 
Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers say areas outside of Los Angeles and California have far fewer 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other areas there is not the entrenchment (of regulations) that you find 
here, but that may be attributable in part because they don't get the volume of 
productions that L.A. does," said Lisa Rawlins, a vice president at Warner 
Bros. "We're a very mobile industry and in the past when we've been frustrated 
with filming in L.A., it was just as easy for us to move somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Roth, who is in charge of the regional government group's film project, 
said one major goal over the next two years will be to recapture 10% of runaway 
production dollars, which could boost employment in the area by about 8,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A key first step to implementing a regional film commission is consolidation 
of the city of Los Angeles and county film offices, Roth said. The Board of 
Supervisors has already approved the merger and it has Riordan's support. 
Bernson said he expects the City Council to approve the move within the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the new cooperative effort between government and the industry 
will yield more successes on the order of "Speed." Local and state officials 
pulled out so many stops to get the movie made that they were as nervous as the 
filmmakers waiting for the initial box office returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took great chances," said Archuletta, who helped to coordinate the filming 
with dozens of city, county and state agencies, including Caltrans and the 
California Highway Patrol. "There is no question that the film would have left 
L.A. and may even have left California had not everyone stepped in to make it 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McCabe a veteran location manager, who worked on the film "Interview With 
the Vampire," said: "We needed dark streets and were able close down Vista del 
Mar west of the airport, and the city and county were able to shut off street 
and parking lights for the evening." 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of cooperation is vital, and making sure it happens is an ongoing 
process," he said. Lights, Camera, Profits 
</P>
<P>
 The competition for film production dollars ha become so heated in recent 
years that scores of cities and states outside of California have formed their 
own film commissions to lure television and film crews. Here's a look at how 
film activity in some cities compare: City of Los Angeles Film Agency Formed: 
1973 Budget: $600,000 Economic Impact: $8.3 billion a year Shot there: "Speed," 
starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves * County of Los Angeles Film Agency 
Formed: 1981 Budget: $520,000 Economic Impact: $15 billion Shot there: 
"Flintstones," starring John Goodman and Rick Moranis * Chicago Film Office 
Formed: 1980 Budget: $260,000 Economic Impact: $115 million Shot there: "The 
Fugitive," starring Harrison Ford * New York Mayor's Office of Film, Theater 
and Broadcasting Formed: 1966 Budget: $680,000 Economic Impact: $3.2 billion 
Shot there: "Home Alone," starring Macaulay Culkin Big Spenders

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEPUTY 
FATALLY WOUNDS MAN DURING STRUGGLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man shot by a sheriff's deputy near a park in Boyle Heights on Friday 
afternoon died later at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy was unhurt in the confrontation about 3:25 p.m. in the 600 block of 
Echandia Street, said sheriff's spokesman Ron Spear.  
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the deputy had been flagged down by people who told him of a 
beating in nearby Prospect Park. Before the deputy could get out of his patrol 
car "the suspect began attacking the deputy. During the struggle, one round 
discharged from the deputy's weapon," hitting the man, Spear said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 No additional ground subsidence has been found along Hollywood Boulevard, but 
water continues to leak into one of two subway tunnels under construction, 
Metro Rail officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to us now is to fully assess the condition and stability of 
the soils," said Ed McSpedon, president of Rail Construction Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews finished installing steel bracing in a 200-foot stretch of the north 
tunnel between Hudson and Whitley avenues this week. Engineers monitoring 
conditions in the tunnel reported that no further ground motion has been 
detected, and the south tunnel has shown no signs of water leaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Crews have been pumping concrete grout into 20 holes drilled in the road to 
strengthen the soil above the north tunnel. Additional grouting holes will be 
drilled as far west as Cherokee Avenue by early next week.

 Repairs to the Walk of Fame in front of the Pacific Theater are under way.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; SETTLEMENT 
GIVES $10 MILLION TO DRIVER STRUCK BY TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A driver who was struck by a truck and requires 24-hour care has been granted 
a $10-million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement for James F. Argo was approved Friday by Torrance Superior 
Court Judge William Hollingsworth, who authorized the victim's sister, Dorothy, 
to act as conservator, the court said.Argo, 47, of El Segundo was hit by a 
truck July 8, 1991, in the Port of Long Beach and sustained massive brain and 
internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Argo spent 45 days in a coma and requires 24-hour nursing care for the rest of 
his life. He is not able to walk on his own, has little use of his arms and 
legs and has limited speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obviously pleased that we didn't have to go through a lengthy trial," 
said Argo's attorney, Keith Nelson. "It's a chapter that's been closed for Jim. 
Now (his family) can go on with taking care of him and not have to worry about 
his future." 
</P>
<P>
 Argo was hit as he stood next to his loaded gravel truck at Long Beach Harbor. 
Jose Miguel Prieto, who was driving on a restricted license, was on his way to 
pick up a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigating officers said Prieto was driving at excessive speeds and with 
defective brakes. Experts calculated Prieto's driving speed to be 40 m.p.h., 15 
m.p.h. faster than the posted speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the defendants -- CMX Trucking of Jacksonville, Fla., now CSX 
Intermodal, Gonzalez Trucking of Inglewood and Prieto of Los Angeles -- agreed 
Aug. 4 to the award in Long Beach Superior Court. The defendants did not have 
to admit liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was a fair settlement," said Lane Quigley, lead attorney for the 
defendants.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OAK VIEW; UZI-ARMED GUNMAN SOUGHT IN ROBBERIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmen were searching Friday for an Uzi-armed gunman who robbed two Oak View 
businesses, locking some of his victims in walk-in refrigerators.  
</P>
<P>
 In the latest robbery, about 4:45 p.m. Thursday, the man entered Scotty's 
Liquor at 910 N. Ventura Ave. and showed an Uzi automatic weapon to two clerks 
while demanding money, said Detective Susan Creede of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman locked the two in the store's walk-in refrigerator before fleeing, 
but they soon were able to get out, Creede said. The loss was estimated at 
about $400. 
</P>
<P>
 In a robbery thought to involve the same man, a gunman took $256 from Little 
Caesar's Pizza, 11420 N. Ventura Ave., on Monday. In that incident, the gunman 
handcuffed one teen-age cook to a pipe and locked a second in the freezer, 
Creede said. 
</P>
<P>
 The handcuffs were "like a toy," however, and the cook soon broke away and 
freed his colleague, the detective said. Both are 17-year-old Ojai boys. GREG

 A 13-month-old boy who fell into a swimming pool at his Oxnard apartment 
complex has died, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Connor Bazillion, who fell into the pool Wednesday afternoon at Oxnard Shores 
at 5090 Nautilus St., was pronounced dead at 9:44 p.m. Thursday in the 
pediatric intensive care unit at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, representative 
Carla Brunstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Curt Bensen, whose unit responded to the 911 call, said a man at 
the unit had dived into the pool after seeing the baby in the water. 
Dispatchers helped people at the scene in attempts to revive the child with 
CPR, Bensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witness accounts, the child had wandered out of his apartment 
while his mother had slept. His father was identified as Paul Bazillion. GREG

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA; NEEL FAMILY REBUTS CHARGES ON LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of an old farming family have offered a stinging rebuke to an 
environmental consultant's charge of pervasive contamination on their Ventura 
Avenue property, which the family hopes to transform into a residential 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can categorically state that the property has not been surrounded by 
industrial waste sites and is not contaminated," Thomas Neel wrote in a 
statement dated Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report submitted Thursday to the Neels by the environmental 
engineering firm of Fugro West, soil on the property showed no evidence of 
contamination by heavy industrial wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 But consultants hired by opponents of the 120-home project allege otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 In a package mailed to Ventura's mayor and other city officials last week, 
consultant Robert Cashier asserted that there is a "100% probability" that the 
project site, between Stanley Avenue and Seneca Street, is contaminated with 
oil-field and industrial wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neel scoffed in his statement at Cashier's allegations, which were based on 
historical, aerial photographs and historical data. Neel asserted that the 
consultant misidentified a gravel mining operation and a water reservoir as oil 
waste dumps, and a walnut tree as an herbicide reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neels will ask the council Monday for permission to build a residential 
development, bike paths and a small park on their 26 acres west of Ventura 
Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's Service Corp., the national copy service giant, owns 22 adjoining 
acres to the south, and company officials have warned that they may move their 
headquarters out of Ventura if the city does not permit residential development 
on the Neel property. Kinko's officials, who may expand their operations, 
believe the Neel project would upgrade the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the small-business owners whose storefronts line the Neel and Kinko's 
properties have vociferously opposed the development because they say it would 
be out of place in the industrial neighborhood. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OJAI; FEASIBILITY STUDY OKD FOR SKATEBOARD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai officials this week backed in concept the construction of a skateboard 
park for area youngsters, forming a task force to investigate where to build 
the facility and how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 40 skateboarders packing the council chambers Tuesday, the City 
Council unanimously agreed to form a committee made up of merchants, 
skateboarders and city and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Parks and Recreation Commission started investigating the idea in 
December when the commission's youth representative reported that area 
youngsters were starving for a place to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateboarders at Tuesday's meeting complained that they are forced to ride 
through streets and parking lots, and noted that many other California cities 
provide safe and widely used facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids need some place to skate to keep them, like, off the streets and 
stuff," said 16-year-old Dylan Buli. He said skateboarding on streets and in 
parking lots has left him and his friends "rolling around the concrete and 
getting all bloody." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the city's parks and recreation commission surveyed two local 
schools. At Matilija Junior High School, 46% of those surveyed said they would 
regularly use a skateboard facility; at Nordhoff High School, that number was 
58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Craig Walker said his review of skateboard parks in other cities 
found that liability was not a problem. He added that state law protects owners 
of recreational property in injury lawsuits provided that safety signs are 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Dan Singer has said that merchants from Ojai's Arcade 
shopping area are displeased with skateboarders near their stores. JASON GRANT

 Dizzy land: One apparently unforgivable sin for a Southern California 
newspaper columnist is to misstate the year Disneyland opened. After all, 
wasn't that also the birth date of Southern California (at least in the minds 
of many Easterners)?

 Anyway, when we made the ghastly error of giving the year as 1954 -- instead 
of 1955 -- some 20 readers assailed us by phone, fax and letter.

 "You sure know how to make one feel older -- I always tell people I'm three 
weeks younger than Disneyland," complained David Hyman of Sepulveda, who 
appealed to us to tell the world that he and the amusement park are really just 
39. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter that really jolted us came from Lonnie Burr of North Hollywood, 
one of the original cast members of the TV show, "The Mickey Mouse Club." He's 
the reason we rushed this correction into print and put it in a prominent 
place.

SOFTBALL LEAGUES THROWN A CURVE BY GENDER CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle of the sexes has flared up on softball diamonds in Santa Clarita, 
raising hardball questions about fairness on the athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began when the manager of a mixed-gender team managed to get it 
transferred from the co-ed league to an all-men's league. In response, men 
began showing up on teams in the previously all-women's league, provoking 
protests from the female players that it was unfair and dangerous to make them 
play against men. 
</P>
<P>
 The gender conflict, brewing for weeks, has spawned accusations of 
discrimination and threats of lawsuits from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 These are hotly debated issues in a city where softball is taken very 
seriously. Ball fields are constantly used here, with game results printed 
weekly in both a local newspaper and a separate publication for softball 
enthusiasts. About 260 teams, including nearly 4,000 residents, now play in the 
league that is administered year-round by the Santa Clarita Parks, Recreation 
and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the Northridge earthquake, while many neighborhoods still lacked 
water or power, several softball players appeared at the emergency tent outside 
City Hall and asked to register for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began in the winter of 1992 when Richard Jewett, manager of 
Softball Express -- which has both men and women players -- asked park 
officials to register the team in a men's division. The squad, Jewett said, so 
dominated other co-ed teams that its players were bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just not competitive," said Jewett. "It wasn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials hesitated, but were advised by City Atty. Carl Newton 
that it could be illegal to block a team from playing in the league it desired, 
based solely on the players' sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one had really asked about this sort of thing," said Chris Daste, city 
recreation supervisor. "It was a real dilemma for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Express was admitted to play the 1992 winter season in the lowest 
category of the men's division, the lower C league. The team did so well that 
it advanced to the upper C league, where it has been competing since July. 
</P>
<P>
 Male players were surprised by the presence of women players on the Softball 
Express team, but had few protests, Jewett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest reaction to it wasn't, 'They shouldn't be here.' It was, 'More 
power to them,' " Jewett said. "There have been a few egos that have been 
frayed, (but) it hasn't been a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulties began, all agree, when the exception granted for Softball Express 
set a precedent that was used the other way around by other teams. A handful of 
men, sometimes the team manager or a player's spouse, began appearing on 
rosters in the women's league. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women players complained vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's cheating," said Anne Marie Schoenmann, manager of the women's 
Pirettes team, which plays in the most competitive women's class, the A league. 
</P>
<P>
 Her squad has left the field rather than play against a team that fielded male 
players. Thursday evening, they walked off the diamond in the fifth inning when 
their opponents produced a male catcher, and forfeited the game -- their third 
for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wanted to play co-ed, we would play co-ed," said Schoenmann. "I played 
co-ed and it's a whole different game." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenmann said her players are concerned about possible injury, especially if 
there is a collision between a runner and the catcher at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 City recreation officials say they will allow mixed teams to compete in 
single-sex leagues for the remainder of this season, but will send them back to 
the co-ed leagues in October, when the next season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Santa Clarita provides "substantially equivalent" programs for men 
and women, it can keep men and women in separate leagues, City Atty. Newton now 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all you can do in this kind of situation is make a decision that will 
try to please the majority of the people," Daste said. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Express will register for the men's league once again, Jewett said, 
and fight to stay in the male league. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials say the team will forfeit any games in which it uses 
illegal players. Since team rosters do not have to be submitted to park 
officials until weeks after the season begins, a showdown is likely at the 
opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we show up for the first game, we are going to put the girls on the 
field," Jewett said.

MAN IN THE NEWS; SEN. ROGERS IS USED TO BEING 'CAPTAIN OF MY SHIP'; 
LEGISLATURE: DESPITE CRITICS' OUTRAGE, HE REFUSES TO CANCEL SCHEDULED ADDRESS 
BEFORE ALLEGED WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AND WILL ONLY SPEAK 
ABOUT STATES RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The heat is on, but state Sen. Don Rogers is cool and unbending -- even amid 
complaints about his plan to address a group of suspected white supremacists 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 His scheduled appearance before an organization that allegedly embraces racist 
beliefs has evoked such strong comments as "reprehensible" and "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just from the state Senate, where Rogers represents one of 
California's most conservative districts, encompassing the Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys and beyond into oil and farming country. 
</P>
<P>
 Watchdog groups that track extremist organizations blasted Rogers' planned 
dinner-hour talk at the fourth annual Jubilation Celebration and Conference in 
Bakersfield, with the Anti-Defamation League calling it "outrageous and 
shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 And the phone in Rogers' Capitol office Friday brought at least two queries 
during a lunch break from fellow Republican officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Rogers told the congressman and assemblyman. All he plans to 
talk about, he said, is his Senate resolution reiterating states rights and 
putting Washington, D.C., on notice that California wants no more costly 
federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Coalition for Human Dignity, a watchdog group in Oregon, the 
conference is sponsored by a California-based newspaper called the Jubilee. The 
paper is a national publication for the Christian Identity movement, whose 
followers believe that people of Northern European descent are superior to 
those of other races and ethnicities. People of color are derided as "mud 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of criticism, Colorado state Rep. Charles Duke backed out of his 
scheduled speech tonight before Jubilee followers. But Rogers has not. He has 
given his word that he does not hold racist beliefs, and he believes that that 
should be enough to satisfy critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Such willfulness is typical of a man who entered politics 20 years ago because 
he was appalled at the size of his tax bill. Back then, in the pre-Proposition 
13 era, the bill had jumped 45% in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a businessman who got into politics for all the right reasons -- to 
reduce the role of government," said Rogers, 66, an oil geologist and partner 
in a drilling firm called Success Petroleum. "I did it to try to keep 
government from destroying us, from overregulating and excessively intruding 
into our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Rogers at times catches himself when his message grows 
strident. "Unlawful" federal mandates -- upon quick reflection -- become 
mandates that are "probably not constitutionally authorized." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Senate floor, however, Rogers often will allow himself to be baited by 
liberal Democrats into heated arguments against gun control, environmental 
protection and any perceived challenge to the protections of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our most staunch constitutionalist," said fellow conservative state Sen. 
Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of the environment, Rogers also is adamant: Global warming is a 
hoax. A thinning ozone layer is a lie. Oil spills have a minimal effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like clean air, clean water and clean food as much as anybody," Rogers said 
in an interview. "But I think we've allowed the pendulum to swing too far, and 
we need some common sense brought back into the mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rogers has a serious devotion to the tenets of the conservative wing of 
the Republican Party, he is not without a sense of humor. He once greeted state 
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) with a demand for an environmental impact 
report on the bright green jacket Dills was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no wisecracks circulating on the Senate floor Friday as Rogers' 
colleagues contemplated how tonight's appearance could affect the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's irresponsible -- and not even clever -- to say you're going 
before a group like this to only talk about states rights and ignore the 
associations with the Aryan Nation types," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). "This is a group whose message is anti-Semite, anti-black, 
anti-minority." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) noted that Rogers has been chairman of 
the Senate's Veteran Affairs Committee since the start of the current two-year 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just really upset," Watson said. "Veterans come in all colors. They 
aren't only Northern Europeans." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was no formal move to censure Rogers, and the senator repeated 
that he was "the captain of my ship" and that he would not be swayed into 
supporting the views of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just months before Rogers tangled with the Internal Revenue Service 
that he first spoke before Jubilee followers, many of whom share his belief 
that the federal government must be kept at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, federal authorities seized Rogers' private plane to cover back 
taxes that he owed on investments. Rogers fought back by filing for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy protection to keep ownership of the plane through a trust he set up 
while he determined a way to pay the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said his biggest accomplishment in government came 12 years ago when he 
sponsored a successful citizen-backed initiative to abolish the state's 
inheritance tax.  
</P>
<P>
 He points to his states rights resolution (SJR 44) as a high point of the 
legislative session that is now winding down. Four other states have passed 
measures similar to Rogers', which "informs the President and Congress that 
California is claiming sovereignty under the 10th Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure -- and its demands that the federal government immediately end 
imposing any mandates that are beyond its constitutional powers -- has a 
certain appeal to the participants in today's Jubilee conference, at which 
states rights is a major theme.

AL MARTINEZ: PIECES OF A FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have pinned on the wall next to me a lined piece of notebook paper on which 
is printed, "I love you mom." 
</P>
<P>
 It is written in black crayon in the careful hand of a child who might be 7 or 
8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 On the back, in the same black crayon, is a picture of a house in rough 
outline with doors and windows. It stands almost bleakly alone, without life, 
without warmth, without surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece of paper is special to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I found it one day at the northern end of the Long Beach Freeway, in a lot 
once occupied by a group of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 It was lying amidst the debris of what had been their encampment. Only pieces 
of their existence remained: a barbecue grill, a paper cup, a few cans, a 
ragged shirt . . . and that note. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who works at Modern Maturity magazine told me about them. She wasn't 
sure how long they had been there and didn't know if they were actually a 
family, or simply people thrown together by necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 She just knew she saw them all the time living among some trees where the 
freeway ends at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra. I went searching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure what compelled me to look. L.A.'s Shelter Partnership estimates 
there are up to 80,000 homeless people in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else, I've gotten used to seeing them around. As long as they 
aren't intruding on your life, you tend to ignore them. They're like passing 
traffic, or leaves carried on a stray wind. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got to the place where the freeway family had been, no one was there. I 
searched both sides and then concentrated on the open area off Highbury Avenue, 
where the encampment had existed. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the neighbors remembered seeing homeless people around the 
concrete-sided L.A. River, but couldn't tell me anything about them. Students 
from Cal State L.A. living at the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity house let me scan 
the area from their back yard, but I found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was hot and smoggy, and I wasn't about to spend a lot of time chasing 
shadows. But then, as I was walking toward the car, a homeless man emerged from 
a group of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 I swear I'd searched the area and hadn't seen anyone, but there he was, a guy 
in his late 40s, dirty, bearded and wearing clothes as old as rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 He was probably mentally retarded and was vague about almost everything, but 
he did point out the exact spot where the family had been. He'd been there a 
couple of nights too, until they'd all been told to move on, he didn't know by 
whom. They were always being told to move. Who told them wasn't important. 
</P>
<P>
 The last I saw him, he was walking south along the 710, going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-printed note -- "I love you mom" -- was in plain sight near the 
barbecue grill. I'm pretty sure of the person's age who wrote it, and who drew 
the picture of a house on the back. I have grandchildren who are 7 and 8, and 
it looks like something one of them might have done. 
</P>
<P>
 I stood there for a long time just looking at the note, drawn slowly into it, 
increasingly unaware of the heat and smog. The din of freeway traffic muted to 
a distant hum, like flies at a picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
 I could picture a little girl sitting in the terrible loneliness of the vacant 
lot, carefully printing the words, and just as meticulously drawing the picture 
of a home that may have existed in a corner of her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Was there actually a mother she was writing the note to, or was the mother 
just the phantom figure of a child's longing? Had there once been a home, or 
had all of her young life been spent wandering and dreaming? 
</P>
<P>
 The house she drew was a house without her in it, a place beyond the horizons 
of her reach, cold and distant and empty. It was like one of the homes that 
surrounded the vacant lot, viewed through despair. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a good time for the homeless. A growing hostility toward their 
existence is forcing them out of sight. It's because, I think, we see the 
homelessness in ourselves, the utter, devastating failure of spirit to soar 
with the rest, and we can't bear the introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 I live now with the vision of the child who wrote the note. I always will. 
There are 5,600 homeless families in L.A. County. Eleven thousand of those 
family members are children. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them may be a little girl whose warmth and loneliness claw at the 
heart. If so, I hope she's loved as she loves, because sometimes -- in the 
emptiness of a world filled with sadness -- love is all we have left.

FORUM TO FOCUS ON SPOUSE ABUSE AMONG ASIANS; CONFERENCE: LITTLE TOKYO EVENT 
TODAY WILL EXAMINE CULTURAL BARRIERS FACED BY BATTERED WIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Domestic violence, a subject long suppressed in traditional Asian cultures, 
will be in the spotlight at a public forum in Los Angeles today as community 
leaders try to capitalize on the publicity generated by the O.J. Simpson case 
to draw attention to special problems facing Asian victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents of domestic violence are as prevalent among Asian Americans as among 
other groups in this country, but Asian victims -- especially immigrants -- 
face added obstacles because of ignorance and language and cultural barriers, 
say organizers of Southern California's first Asian-Pacific domestic violence 
conference in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some come from cultures where it is an accepted practice for men to batter 
their wives to train them," said Kaoru Ichikawa, a psychiatric social worker at 
the Asian Pacific Counseling & Treatment Center. In such cases, victims as well 
as their abusers have to be told that in the United States it is illegal to 
beat spouses, she said. "We need to help the men change their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when victims know they have a right to be free from abuse, they put up 
with it because they don't want to bring shame to the family," said Im Jung 
Kwuon, who will be among the speakers at today's all-day session. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwuon said a lot of abuse in Asian families has to do with the age-old Eastern 
notion that men are superior to women. Women endure because they believe they 
have no social standing without their husbands and children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian women also fear losing their children if they leave their husbands, 
she said. In some Asian cultures, children belong exclusively to the father. 
Although this is not the case here, many still believe that, said Kwuon, a 
counselor at the Korean Family Counseling and Legal Advice Center in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reasons for victims' silence include lack of money, isolation and fear, 
said Estelle Chun, a family law specialist at the Asian Pacific American Legal 
Center of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "As tragic as spousal abuse is for white women, born here . . . with friends 
and relatives, you just can't compare that to (the plight of) immigrant women," 
she said. "They have no money, they don't speak English -- they don't even know 
how to take the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Chun, who has counseled hundreds during her nine years at the center, said 
denial is the biggest problem among Asians -- victims and abusers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 She said women come to her not as a result of contacting police but because 
their neighbors alerted authorities or they ended up in a hospital emergency 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for the Pacific Asian Family operates the only shelter for battered 
Asian women in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chun noted that although cases of domestic violence reported to mainstream 
agencies have shot up since the Simpson case, there has been no noticeable 
increase at her center. Separate statistics for Asian American victims citywide 
are unavailable. Chun's center handles about 500 family law cases a year, and 
more than half of those involve spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come to our office full of scars," she said. "There is a lot of abuse 
during pregnancy when husbands kick their wives in the stomach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the saddest cases Chun has handled involved Asian women married to 
American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Living on military bases, isolated from other Asians physically and socially 
-- because of the stigma attached to Asian women married to U.S. servicemen -- 
many live in fear, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are afraid that if they turn in their husbands, they will be deported, 
she said. Under immigration laws, foreign nationals married to U.S. citizens 
have to be sponsored by their American spouses to seek permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's conference, sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Legal Center and 
Network Against Asian Pacific Domestic Violence, will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. at the Centenary United Methodist Church, 300 S. Central Ave.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: UNION ENDORSES 3 FOR COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The union representing instructors at Ventura County's three community 
colleges has announced its endorsements for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers is recommending that 
its members support two challengers and an unopposed incumbent for the 
governing board of the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 In Area 1, where appointed incumbent Karen M. Boone is facing challengers John 
Tallman and Jim Hibbs, the union supports Tallman, a former teacher and 
administrator at Ventura College. The seat represents the Ventura area on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went with John because we know that he knows a lot about the district," 
said chapter President Barbara Hoffman. "He was a faculty member at Ventura 
College at one time. He's committed to the college and is interested in some of 
the same things we are." 
</P>
<P>
 In Area 2, where incumbent Gregory Cole has chosen not to seek reelection, the 
union has endorsed psychologist Donald W. Kingdon, who is facing Annette 
Broersman, Norman J. Nagel, Joseph Richey and Donald E. Stevens on the Nov. 8 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really feel Don's the best of a couple of good people," Hoffman said. 
"He's real bright and he has a real sense of the district being part of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The union also endorsed incumbent Pete Tafoya, who is running unopposed in 
Area 5, representing South Oxnard and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said a committee of union members made recommendations to the 
executive board after interviewing each candidate. The executive board then 
adopted the committee's recommendations. JEFF McDONALD

FUNDS IN WILL TO HELP BUILD PET CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Humane Society of Ventura County will build a separate building for its 
spay and neuter clinic with more than $170,000 recently donated by a local 
animal lover. 
</P>
<P>
 President Joyce George said the society's board of directors decided this week 
to use funds left in the will of Alice Wittenberg to construct the building on 
its Ojai grounds. The society currently spays and neuters about 6,000 dogs and 
cats in its Ojai headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new clinic, "hopefully we'll be able to spay and neuter more animals 
for Ventura County pet owners," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there are about 20,000 dogs and cats each year in Ventura 
County that have to be destroyed because there are no homes for them," she 
said. "If we can spay and neuter more animals, there will be fewer homeless 
animals born." 
</P>
<P>
 George said the society will increase publicity to reach pet owners in 
conjunction with the opening of the new building. But she said it is too early 
to know when the building will be constructed and that additional funds must be 
raised for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The society charges up to $75 to spay or neuter dogs and up to $25 for cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolene Hoffman, director of the society's animal shelter, said the donation 
from Wittenberg of Moorpark -- who died in October at age 93 -- includes 
$165,818 plus about $10,000 worth of jewelry. It was left to the society, in 
part, Hoffman said, because Wittenberg no longer had any living relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly deFremery, executrix of Wittenberg's will, said Wittenberg inherited 
money from her parents. She said Wittenberg owned several horses, loved dogs 
and cats, and often photographed people's pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very particular about her own animals," deFremery said. "She wouldn't 
let anybody handle them. They had the best food and everything else." JASON 
GRANT

WOMAN, MAN KNIFED IN DOMESTIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura woman who was stabbed during an apparent domestic dispute Friday 
morning met police officers at her front door with a butcher knife impaled in 
her neck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend was found lying nearby with cuts on his neck, wrists and chest 
in what appeared to be a botched murder-suicide attempt by him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, identified as Wendy Beaulieu, 25, and Anthony McDougald, 29, were 
admitted to the intensive care unit at Ventura County Medical Center. Beaulieu 
was in fair condition late Friday and McDougald was listed in critical 
condition, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her wounds, Beaulieu was able to talk to officers, who said they 
believed the 9:30 a.m. incident was the result of a recent breakup, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During an argument at a house in the 200 block of West Harrison Avenue in 
Ventura, police said Beaulieu told them that McDougald struggled with her over 
the knife before grabbing it from her. Police believe he inflicted his own 
wounds, then stabbed Beaulieu before falling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests were made and an investigation was continuing. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; EX-STUDENT'S INJURY CLAIM REJECTED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District board has rejected a claim by a 
former Westlake High School student who was injured during an off-campus brawl 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative claim filed by Curtis Simmons, 17, sought compensation for 
medical and general expenses resulting from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members rejected the claim at their meeting Thursday. President 
Dolores Didio said it is standard procedure for the board to reject all 
administrative claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires plaintiffs to file claims before a lawsuit can be filed in 
Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' attorney, Judith Fogel, said she expected the board to reject the 
claim and added that her client will pursue a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who school officials said will not return to Westlake High this year, 
was beaten with a wooden board Feb. 3 during a fight at North Ranch Park that 
left two other students hospitalized. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 4 ARE HELD OVER BEATING, ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four suspected members of a Conejo Valley gang remained in custody Friday 
after being arrested on suspicion of beating and robbing two teen-agers who had 
been sitting on a Thousand Oaks curb, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, both 18, were in the 200 block of Valarde Drive about 11:55 
p.m. Wednesday when the four approached them and demanded cigarettes, said Sgt. 
Kitty Hoberg of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two Thousand Oaks men refused, they were beaten and one was robbed of 
his backpack and its contents, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the two required immediate medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after leaving in a white Hyundai driven by a 16-year-old Thousand Oaks 
girl, the suspects were apprehended by deputies at a nearby fast-food 
restaurant, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Booked on suspicion of robbery were 18-year-old Mark Ancheta, 20-year-old 
Kevin Corey and 18-year-old Ryan Shepherd, Sgt. Will Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Richard Thomas said all were being held Friday at Ventura County Jail. 
Bail for each was $20,000 and their arraignment was scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth suspect, a 16-year-old Thousand Oaks boy, was taken to Ventura 
County Juvenile Hall, where he also remained in custody Friday, Detective Ernie 
Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said investigation into the 16-year-old girl's possible involvement was 
continuing. GREG RIPPEE

AHMANSON TO SEEK MORE TIME TO COMPLETE DEAL FOR PUBLIC PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co., required to donate 10,000 acres for public parkland 
before starting construction on a mini-city in the Simi Hills, will ask the 
county for three more years to complete the open-space acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 When county supervisors approved the massive Ahmanson Ranch project nearly two 
years ago, they said the developer could begin building the golf-course 
community only after deeding four mountain properties to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And they set a deadline of December, 1995, for Ahmanson to convert the 
privately owned parcels into public open space. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, two of the properties -- Jordan Ranch and Liberty Canyon -- have 
entered the public domain, their rugged trails and magnificent vistas open to 
visitors. But Ahmanson has not yet purchased two other parcels: Runkle Ranch 
and Corral Canyon, which sweep across 4,700 acres in the Santa Susana Mountains 
and Malibu bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than negotiating for Runkle and Corral -- both owned by entertainer Bob 
Hope -- Ahmanson executives have spent the last two years in court, responding 
to nine lawsuits filed against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 One phase of the litigation was resolved this spring, when a Superior Court 
judge ruled that the county acted properly in approving the $1-billion project. 
But opponents have appealed, arguing that plopping 8,600 residents on a former 
sheep ranch would snarl traffic, foul the air, trample wildlife habitat and 
strain public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Calabasas officials announced Friday that they will appeal a 
separate ruling in favor of Ahmanson. The city is trying to block the developer 
from widening Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 Until the lawsuits are resolved, Ahmanson officials cannot be sure they will 
end up with a green light to build their upscale city. So they are reluctant to 
spend millions of dollars to purchase Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon for open 
space, spokeswoman Mary Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take this one step at a time," Trigg said. "We've been 
concentrating all of our efforts on resolving the litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 With the court battles expected to continue for at least a year, Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk said she considered the Ahmanson request reasonable. Granting 
the extension, she said, "is the fair and equitable thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the Ahmanson Ranch project argued that the supervisors should 
stick to the original deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people knew full well they were going to be sued by everyone in sight," 
said Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney fighting the development. "If they didn't 
write into their contract (a clause granting them) an extension in the case of 
litigation, then they have no business building cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlock also objected to the timing of Ahmanson's request. Even without an 
extension, the company has 16 months to complete the land transactions. Rather 
than petition for relief now, she said, Ahmanson officials should work to wrap 
up the litigation and get on with the property acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 But by requesting a hearing this fall, Ahmanson executives ensure that the 
current Board of Supervisors will vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two supervisors who support the project, VanderKolk and Vicky Howard, will 
retire from the board after November's election. And one contender for 
VanderKolk's seat, attorney Trudi Loh, said she would oppose an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take a hard-headed look at this: We cut a contract . . . and now 
they're asking for the ground rules to be changed," Loh said. "This doesn't 
seem anything close to reasonable."  
</P>
<P>
 Loh's opponent in the supervisorial race, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank 
Schillo, said he would be inclined to grant an extension because the developer 
cannot control courtroom delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was their fault, a problem they had created, I would give a different 
answer," he said. "But if they're held up by lawsuits, it's only fair to give 
them an opportunity to extend the deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 The two contenders for Howard's seat, Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery, both said they would support the 
extension request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Commission is expected to vote on the Ahmanson 
request Sept. 15, and the Board of Supervisors will take up the debate in 
mid-October.

L.A. RABBIS REACH OUT TO SINGLES AT HIGH HOLIDAYS; JUDAISM: THE UNATTACHED MAY 
FEEL LEFT OUT AT FAMILY-CENTERED SEASON. SERVICES CATERING TO THEIR NEEDS RANGE 
FROM INNOVATIVE TO TRADITIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE BENESCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Connie Benesch is a free-lance 
journalist, who plans to synagogue-hop with some single friends over the Jewish 
High Holy Days. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The High Holy Days for members of the Jewish faith are fast approaching, and 
for many single Jews this time of atonement can be fraught with turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be rough being single over the High Holidays because everything is so 
family-oriented," said Renee Mandel, a Santa Monica screenwriter whose family 
lives in Florida. "What makes it bearable are my friends, who are my family 
away from home." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially for singles like Mandel, with families in far-off places, the 
10-day period that culminates Sept. 15 in Yom Kippur, the Jewish New Year, can 
evoke feelings of alienation, depression and loneliness. Although people are 
encouraged to atone alone and engage in introspection during Rosh Hashanah and 
Yom Kippur, these holidays promote family togetherness. Attending services 
alone can reinforce alone-in-a-crowd feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 So every year at this time, many single Jews face a dilemma: Where can they go 
where they can feel a part of -- rather than apart from -- the religious 
experience?  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, unlike many other cities, offers a bounty of places for singles 
to worship over the High Holy Days, with some groups catering almost 
exclusively to the unattached. 
</P>
<P>
 The offerings run the gamut from innovative, participatory services conducted 
by lay people to more traditional services led by rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singles in L.A. are isolated. They're rootless here," says Rabbi Irwin 
Katsof, executive vice president of Aish HaTorah, an Orthodox group that will 
hold special services that cater to singles. "When you have so many Jews who 
come here from other places, it's very easy for them to assimilate away. What 
we have done at Aish is develop a community for singles to feel a part of." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Aish HaTorah offers two teaching services, one for the 
twentysomething crowd and another for the thirtysomething-and-up contingent. 
The services will incorporate lots of explanations of the meaning and relevance 
of traditional prayers, many of which will be conducted in English. 
</P>
<P>
 If requested, Aish rabbis even will find singles a family with which they can 
share a Yom Kippur or Rosh Hashanah meal. "Beat alienation as a single in 
L.A.," Katsof urges. "Have a meal with a rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first organizations to recognize the need for singles-oriented 
services was Emet Young Professionals, which started holding them in 1976 in 
the San Fernando Valley. When the group folded in 1985, Jewish Singles Meeting 
Place took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish Singles Meeting Place services are unique in that they are officiated 
by lay people, albeit people proficient in Hebrew. "We tell people this is your 
service," said attorney Michael Klein, who helps plan and lead the services, to 
be held this year at Kadima Hebrew Academy in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very different feel to our services. People are invited to bring 
things and share them -- poems, readings. Or they can just speak about their 
feelings. My observation is that when people get a chance to express themselves 
as part of a service, it not only adds to their experience, but it brings 
others closer as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem transformed when they feel that they are creating the service 
themselves instead of sitting and experiencing it as receivers only," Klein 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most spirited programs for singles is led by Rabbi Shlomo Schwartz, 
an unorthodox Orthodox rabbi who offers free High Holy Days services and other 
social functions for Jews who are without significant others. 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded rabbi, whom many simply call "Schwartzee," is a former Chabad 
leader who founded the nonprofit CHAI Center so he could present programs that 
more traditional rabbis would classify as off-the-wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi, who runs the center out of his Mar Vista home, says he seeks to 
reach the unreligious, with prayers explained and services conducted mostly in 
English. He also aims to inject humor into services by relating inspiring 
Hasidic stories and anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to lure "Reform Jews, non-affiliated Jews -- and any Jew that 
moves."  
</P>
<P>
 To drum up interest in his High Holy Days services, Schwartz distributes 
flyers containing such enticing statements as "No tickets! No appeals! FREE." 
</P>
<P>
 Fully aware that religious services do not draw people the way parties do, 
Schwartz has planned a Jewish New Year's celebration after Rosh Hashanah 
services on Sept. 5 at 8 p.m. at the Pacific Hollywood Theatre. The rabbi says 
he doesn't mind if people come to the party without going to services 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever works is where I'm at, because once they go to services, they love 
it," said Schwartz, whose unusual brand of outreach included going to Woodstock 
'94 to pass out apples to Jewish people and arrange for someone to blow the 
shofar from the main stage -- activities to help usher in the Jewish New Year. 
"It tickles their Jewish soul, and they often tap sources of Jewish energy that 
they never knew they had. It hits the J spot," he added, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz has no qualms about his reasons for holding these services. 
Afterward, people socialize -- which is what Schwartz most desires.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be up front with you," Schwartz said. "My motives are to get Jewish 
people together in large numbers and maybe even smuggle in some meaning too.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will only marry within the faith by accident. The goal of my work 
is orchestrating the accident. I want to perpetuate an endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
 Matchmaking also is on the minds of Orthodox rabbinic leaders at Aish HaTorah, 
who say that about 70 weddings have come about as a result of people meeting 
through programs at its Pico-Robertson site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi David Baron, who founded Temple Shalom for the Arts two years ago, 
advises against attending singles-oriented services with the intent of finding 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 "To go to a service with a singles mindset instead of with a prayerful mindset 
is the wrong approach," said Baron, a single father whose 750-member 
congregation is about 40% singles. "I think you should go to temple and 
disregard your status -- as single, divorced, happily married, unhappily 
married, whatever it may be -- and go for a religious or soul-searching 
experience. Along that path you'll encounter other people and maybe have a 
wonderful connection with someone who is seeking the same thing. That's how it 
should operate." 
</P>
<P>
 The gay community also has a place that especially welcomes them. Billing 
itself as "Southern California's progressive temple," the West Hollywood-based 
Congregation Kol Ami was founded in 1992 by a group of 50 gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of single folks fall through the cracks," said Rabbi Denise Eger. 
"We're trying to offer them a place where they can feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
 To experience a feeling of inclusion instead of isolation, some singles band 
together and meet at synagogues around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's services at Temple Shalom were so moving and spiritually 
rewarding that I put a group together to go this year," said Jane Lieberman, an 
entertainment publicist at Rogers & Cowan in Beverly Hills. "It's always much 
more meaningful to share the worship experience."

 The television situation comedy "Frasier," Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 
movie "Schindler's List" and "Chant," the surprising best-selling recording by 
monks at a Spanish monastery, will be honored by Catholics in Media Associates 
at its annual Communion and award brunch in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards by Catholics in Media, founded by the writer-director team of Patt 
and Jack Shea of Studio City, are designed to recognize entertainment industry 
projects and people whose work "made clearer the Word of God and affirmed the 
highest ethical standards of the Judeo-Christian tradition," a representative 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Amblin Entertainment's "Schindler's List," about the saving of Jewish 
lives during the Holocaust, appeared to be an obvious choice for film honors by 
the Catholic group's board of directors, the NBC comedy show starring Kelsey 
Grammer as "Frasier" was not. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the series from Paramount Network Television was cited not only for 
its laughs, "but for treating age and physical limitation with dignity, for 
celebrating family loyalty in an age when 'self-sacrifice' is a dirty word," 
and for conscientious characters who struggle with temptation yet wind up 
gaining the respect of the audience for their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frasier" also is one of five contenders for best comedy series in the 46th 
annual Prime Time Emmy Awards Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chant," a double platinum album distributed by Angel Records, has led a 
revival of interest in Gregorian chanting and other monastery music. "The 
success of 'Chant' reminds us that music has a healing power," noted a 
Catholics in Media spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholics in Media event is Oct. 9 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly 
Hills. Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will celebrate Mass at 10 a.m. that 
day and the brunch will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Catholics in Media gave awards to the MGM feature film "Benny and 
Joon," Disney Channel's remake of the classic "Heidi" and the CBS television 
series "Picket Fences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Communion and awards brunch is the archdiocesan-backed successor to an 
annual Communion breakfast for Catholics in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the October event are $45. For information, call (818) 907-2734. 
</P>
<P>
 PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Film director David Zucker ("Naked Gun," "Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of 
Fear") will be awarded the Micah Center for Ethical Monotheism's first Award 
for Goodness in a ceremony Thursday night at the Academy Plaza Theatre, 5237 
Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Zucker is being honored for donating his 
time to direct and help write "For Goodness Sake," the first film produced by 
the Los Angeles-based center founded by writer-radio talk show host Dennis 
Prager. The film, shown on KCET on June 25, features actors Florence Henderson, 
Jason Alexander and TV host Bob Saget of "America's Funniest Home Videos" 
portraying situations with moral choices. A vignette acted by O.J. Simpson, 
soon to go on trial on double murder charges, was omitted when KCET aired the 
film and will also be missing Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rabbi Stephen M. Passamaneck, professor of rabbinics at Hebrew Union College 
in Los Angeles, was recently honored by the International Conference of Police 
Chaplains for his work with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
Passamaneck joined the chaplaincy corps of the Sheriff's Department in 1976 and 
has served as supervising chaplain there since 1986. The professor-chaplain 
said that his involvement has led him to research what traditional Jewish law 
has said concerning civil and criminal law enforcement, which he said had been 
a neglected area of Jewish studies. 
</P>
<P>
 BOOKS 
</P>
<P>
 * In honor of the publication of a novel, "The Gospel of Joseph" (Crossroad) 
by Gabriel Meyer, a reception will be held for the author at 7:30 p.m. today at 
St. Andrew Russian Greek-Catholic Church, 538 Concord St., El Segundo. The 
fictional work by Meyer, who is associate editor of the Encino-based National 
Catholic Register, centers on the discovery of letters and other writings 
attributed to the father of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Ellenson, who holds an endowed chair in Jewish religious thought at 
Hebrew Union College, has written "Between Tradition and Culture: The 
Dialectics of Modern Jewish Religion and Identity" (Scholars Press). The book 
focuses on how Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and Reconstructionist leaders in 
Judaism have responded to modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 * The annual international convocation of Self-Realization Fellowship will 
close today at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. More than 
3,000 participants from 42 countries were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 India-born Swami Paramahansa Yogananda (1893-1952) founded the yoga-centered 
religious movement, establishing it in 1925 on Mt. Washington. Its Lake Shrine 
and Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial in Pacific Palisades are a familiar 
site to Los Angeles residents, as are the organization's temple and India Hall 
in Hollywood. The religious body has nearly 400 affiliated ashrams and centers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 LITURGY 
</P>
<P>
 * A Divine Liturgy will be offered at 11 a.m. Sunday in Los Angeles for 
Cardinal Anthony Peter Koraiche, the retired Maronite Catholic Patriarch of 
Antioch and All the East who died on Aug. 19 in Lebanon. Bishop John Chedid, 
who will lead the service at Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral, 333 S. San 
Vicente Blvd., said the patriarch "shepherded his people during the most 
difficult of times in Lebanon." Koraiche was elected Maronite Patriarch in 1975 
and was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1983. Due to failing 
health, Koraiche resigned in 1986 and was succeeded by Patriarch Nasrallah 
Peter Sfeir. 
</P>
<P>
 EVENTS 
</P>

 * The all-Danish Kefas Choir of Copenhagen, a group of 55 singers and 
musicians, will present a concert of gospel music at 4 p.m. Sunday at the 
predominantly black Trinity Baptist Church in South-Central Los Angeles. 
"Although we are of many races and creeds, gospel music is the universal 
proclamation of the 'good news' of Jesus Christ," said Andre David Brooks, 
director of Trinity Baptist's Young Adult Praise Choir, which will present its 
own concert Sept. 11 at the church, 2040 W. Jefferson Blvd. For information,

QUAKE DAMAGE SHUTS SIMI VALLEY HIGH GYM; EDUCATION: CONTRACTORS ARE TRYING TO 
DETERMINE IF IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO TEAR DOWN BUILDING OR FIX IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the start of school just two weeks away, Simi Valley High School's 
earthquake-damaged gymnasium and multipurpose room are still condemned and will 
remain closed for the school year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The white stucco buildings were badly damaged during the Jan. 17 temblor and 
are expected to cost about $1.7 million to repair. Contractors are still trying 
to determine if it would be cheaper to tear down the structurally damaged 
gymnasium than try to fix the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a major project whether we rebuild it or restore it," said Lowell 
Schultze, spokesman for the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Grady, the district's director of facilities, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we start tomorrow, the job is nine to 12 months," Grady said. "And we 
are not starting tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 When school starts on Sept. 8, Simi Valley High will hold physical education 
classes outside because the district has not received federal or state funding 
to construct a temporary gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Grady said the district has submitted two proposals for a temporary facility 
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but has received no response. 
District officials are now preparing a third proposal that they hope to have 
completed by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of structure now being considered is a canvas, tent-like dome, 
similar to the "bubble" dome recently erected at Alemany High School in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just in the process of putting the costs together to present to FEMA," 
Schultze said. "If we get the OK, we will start the order process." 
</P>
<P>
 But that process will take a minimum of 65 days, Grady said. That means Simi 
Valley High students will have to do without a gym for at least the first few 
months of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be a detriment to education," Grady said. "I look at it as 
similar to any other classroom. It isn't practical to hold (classes) outdoors 
100% (of the time)." 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the school district has received $10,000 from FEMA and the 
Governor's Office of Emergency Services to conduct architectural and 
engineering studies on earthquake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But studies on the gym and multipurpose room have not been completed, and the 
district will not receive further federal funding for their repair until the 
studies are done, FEMA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it is all in Simi Valley's hands," said Ross Mayfield, a disaster 
field officer for the OES. "We are writing as fast as they give us the 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has submitted 330 damage survey reports, seeking $3.9 
million for earthquake-related repairs at damaged schools, federal disaster 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials expect the district to file at least another 30 reports 
bringing the damage total to about $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Simi Valley Unified has received about $3.3 million in federal 
emergency money for its repairs, which include wall cracks and replacement of 
overhead lighting fixtures in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District, which suffered minimal 
damage during the quake, has submitted 148 damage survey reports and is 
expected to submit another 152, FEMA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified has received $1.2 million in aid, but the district 
anticipates damage at its 31 campuses will cost about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wait for federal funding continues, school officials are working to 
come up with ways to make up for the lack of a gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High Principal Kathryn Scroggin said some sports teams will be 
able to use the Simi Valley Parks and Recreation Department's new gymnasium, 
which opened this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are also negotiating with rival Royal High School to use some 
of its facilities for games and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been real cooperative," she said. "But it will be nice when we 
get our own gym back." 
</P>
<P>
 Students are anxious for things to get back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bummer," sophomore Sean Costello said this week while waiting in line 
to buy his textbooks. "We don't get to see the basketball games, we've got to 
go to other schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Nichole Ransom said if the school does not get a temporary gym by 
winter, the rainy season could be miserable for Simi Valley High students. 
</P>
<P>
 "On rainy days, we will be stuck," she said. "But there's nothing we can do 
about it."

EPISCOPAL STATEMENT ON SEXUALITY MODIFIED BY CONSERVATIVE BISHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of conservative bishops has succeeded in modifying an Episcopal Church 
document on sexuality in church teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it affirmed traditional marriage," church spokeswoman Sarah 
Bartenstein said of the altered document. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Bishops voted narrowly to approve changes in the pastoral 
document Wednesday and attached an affirmation bolstering the church's 
traditional emphasis on lifelong, heterosexual marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pastoral letter as it had been proposed to the House of Bishops, 
spiritual leaders of the 2.5-million-member denomination recommended that 
future ordinations follow church teachings, suggesting a moratorium on the 
ordination of gays. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexuality statement also urged church members to welcome gay men and 
lesbians. It declared that the love, caring, commitment and spirituality found 
in heterosexual relationships can be found in gay relationships as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes make the letter "more realistic in terms of where the whole church 
is," said Bishop John MacNaughton of West Texas, one of 101 bishops who signed 
the conservative affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every major religious group is grappling with the contentious issue of 
sexuality. The United Church of Christ is the only major Protestant 
denomination to allow the ordination of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Episcopal Church's legislative body has declared that homosexuals are 
children of God with full and equal claims upon the church, and that physical 
sexual expression is appropriate only within the lifelong, monogamous union of 
husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The church says it is not appropriate to ordain non-celibate homosexuals, but 
in recent years several bishops have ordained them. 
</P>
<P>
 The document considered was called "Continuing the Dialogue: A Pastoral 
Teaching of the House of Bishops to the Church as It Considers Issues of Human 
Sexuality."

ROUSING CHEER FOR AN IMPERFECT BILL; CRIME MEASURE'S STRENGTHS EXCEED ITS FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fight was ugly but the White House finally prevailed. A crime bill passed 
this week after marathon meetings, poker-faced deal-making and some pretty 
nasty name-calling. Though trimmed -- to a still-hefty $30.2 billion -- the 
compromised legislation still promises more police and more prevention programs 
to Americans weary of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, at best, offers $13.4 billion to local governments to hire as many 
as 100,000 additional cops. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican who 
lobbied Washington on behalf of the measure, can expect plenty of new federal 
help. Los Angeles could get 1,600 new officers. Orange County expects 200 
additional officers. More Border Patrol agents, which California can certainly 
use, are also included in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 California also expects to get a large share of $9.9 billion marked to build 
new prisons, establish "boot camps" for young offenders and reimburse states 
that imprison illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. That too is welcome 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been said about the so-called pork in the bill. But prevention is at 
least as important as locking up criminals. The $5.5 billion authorized for 
local grants to fund recreation, education and anti-gang efforts will pay for 
programs like new shelters for battered women, facilities that few cities or 
counties could otherwise afford. After-school programs, the much-maligned 
midnight basketball leagues and Los Angeles' ambitious Hope in Youth 
gang-prevention effort also deserve consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drug front, $1 invested in treatment returns greater dividends than $1 
invested in law enforcement. The $1.4 billion authorized for anti-drug efforts 
will finance special courts, advocated by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, to deal with 
nonviolent first offenders. These special courts worked in Miami and should 
work in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill was almost killed for the sixth year in a row by bitter 
partisan politicking. The National Rifle Assn. attacked the strong federal 
assault weapons ban, championed tirelessly by California's own Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein. She won. So did America. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill survived because a compromise was crafted by shrewd Democrats 
who sacrificed a few chunks of pork and moderate Republicans who broke ranks. 
In the House, three California Republicans -- Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley, 
Steve Horn of Long Beach and Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara -- deserve credit 
for supporting this bill. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton will gladly sign this truly bipartisan measure into law. It 
is imperfect, to be sure. But in the fight against crime, any help from 
Washington is both warmly welcomed and desperately needed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; GOLF TOURNAMENT TEE TIMES AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tee times are still available for a golf tournament that will benefit South 
County's only walk-in center for abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 The first annual Laura's House Golf Tournament will take place on Monday at 
the Pacific Golf Club, 200 Avenida la Pata, in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised will go toward purchasing a shelter for women who are victims of 
domestic violence. The shelter will house abused women and offer educational 
programs on domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura's House officials are asking for a donation of $150, which will cover 
entry fees for the tournament and an awards luau dinner afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have collected more than $40,000 for the shelter fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the doors opened for South County's first walk-in center for domestic 
violence victims at 97 Calle Industrias in the Ralph's shopping center off 
Avenida Pico . 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three months, the center has helped several women. Volunteers 
drove one mother with children to court to obtain a restraining order while 
room in a temporary shelter was found for another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Several support groups operate out of the center. Included are support groups 
for teens, women and the mothers of abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the tournament or any of the center's programs, call 
(714) 361-3775.FRANK MESSINA

2 LINKED TO UCI STUDENT'S SLAYING FACE EXTRADITION; CRIME: THE PAIR, 
APPREHENDED IN BOSTON WHILE RIDING IN VAN AUTHORITIES SAY WAS USED IN AUG. 17 
SHOOTING, ARE HELD ON FUGITIVE WARRANTS. THEY'LL RETURN TO COUNTY NEXT WEEK.

 Two men wanted for questioning in the recent murder of a UCI student, and 
arrested by Boston police while riding in a van used in the killing, waived 
extradition Friday and will be returned to Orange County early next week, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Monteiro, spokeswoman for the Suffolk County, Mass. district attorney's 
office, said Vinh Quoc Ta, 18, of Santa Ana, and a 17-year-old resident of 
Orange were arraigned Friday in Dorchester District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both waived extradition and will be returning to California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monteiro said the youths were being held without bail on fugitive warrants 
from California for violating probation. Ta was sentenced to three years' 
probation June 8, after agreeing to plead guilty to charges of burglarizing a 
restaurant in Santa Ana on Feb. 1. He and three other young men were caught 
only moments after they left the restaurant with the establishment's cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile was also on probation, but Suffolk County authorities did not 
have any details about his conviction in Orange County, Monteiro said, and 
local authorities refused to discuss his case because he is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Police Sgt. George Jaramillo said the two were only wanted for 
questioning in the Aug. 17 shooting death of Robert Sapinoso, 19, of 
Westminster. Jaramillo said the van they were riding in when arrested in Boston 
had California plates and was used by the killers in the shooting of Sapinoso. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not yet determined conclusively whether these (two) individuals were 
involved in Sapinoso's murder, but we're leaning that way," Jaramillo said. 
"They have not been identified by any witnesses, but they were in the suspect 
vehicle and that's why we want to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths were arrested Thursday by Boston police, who had been asked by 
Garden Grove police to be on the lookout for a silver Toyota van with 
California registration that homicide investigators are convinced was used by 
Sapinoso's killers. A third male who was in the van when it was stopped by 
Boston police was not arrested, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso, an engineering student at UCI, was visiting a friend in Garden Grove 
on the day of the shooting. He and his friend had seen the Toyota driving up 
and down the street and the occupants inside acting suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaramillo said Sapinoso and the friend believed the van "had been used in a 
vehicle vandalism or burglary in the same neighborhood several days earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 The two got inside Sapinoso's car and followed the van. After writing down all 
but one digit of the van's license number, they momentarily lost sight of it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sapinoso and his friend were stopped at a traffic light, a young man who 
had been a passenger in the van suddenly appeared, walked up to the driver's 
side of Sapinoso's Honda, and fired four shots at the student. His passenger, 
who was unhurt, got Sapinoso into the passenger seat and drove him to a nearby 
hospital, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaramillo refused to say how Garden Grove police learned that the vehicle 
might be in Boston, except to say that "we had some information it may have 
been driven to the Boston area." He said the two suspects will be returned to 
Orange County by four Garden Grove officers early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Department of Motor Vehicle records, the van was reported stolen 
"by a police agency" on Aug. 18 -- the day after Sapinoso's murder. Efforts to 
reach the owner of the van were unsuccessful, and Jaramillo declined to say 
whether Garden Grove police reported the van stolen or to comment "on anything 
relating to the van." 
</P>
<P>
 Ta, who had been in the Orange County Jail for more than four months while he 
awaited trial on commercial burglary charges earlier this year, was arrested 
for that crime along with three other youths, all of whom were sentenced to 
probation for the nighttime burglary of a Santa Ana restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Charles Spagnola, who represented one of the other defendants 
in the case, said the four broke into the closed restaurant in full view of a 
Santa Ana police officer, who was parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them had a prior record. They were clean until this happened and this 
helped them earn probation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta and the others attempted to escape with the restaurant's cash register but 
were apprehended after a brief chase. Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Victoria 
Chen, who prosecuted the case, said the prosecution accepted a guilty plea from 
each defendant in exchange for probation, because there were five people in the 
car used by the suspects to make their getaway, and the officer could not 
identify the people who broke into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of them claimed he was the fifth guy sitting in the car while the other 
four committed the burglary," said Chen. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth suspect was a juvenile who was tried in juvenile court, but Chen and 
Spagnola did not have any information about his conviction and sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman, who sentenced Ta and the others to 
three years' supervised probation each, said he had vague recollection of the 
case. However, given the backgrounds of Ta and the others at the time, it was 
not unusual to sentence them to time already served in the county jail and 
three years' probation in exchange for their guilty pleas, Jackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all admitted they were culpable. They were caught red-handed. It was not 
unusual with a clean record and relative youth to sentence somebody like this 
to probation," said Jackman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta's family expressed surprise that he had been arrested and was being held in 
Boston. Family members said that Ta moved out of the family home in Santa Ana 
about a month ago and that they did not know where he was living. 
</P>
<P>
 Lily Ta, the 15-year-old sister of the suspect, said that her brother got into 
trouble with the law because he hung around "bad people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ta's stint in jail troubled his parents, Lily Ta said. "They told him not to 
be bad," the sister said. "He promised my parents he wouldn't be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her brother was a high-school dropout who did not own a car and as 
far as she knew did not hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Ta often spoke about focusing on his future. After he was released 
from jail, he left the state for two weeks in an effort to get away from his 
troublesome friends, Lily Ta said. Family members did not know where he went. 
But Ta returned home in July and soon left the Ta family home for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the house was so boring and that he wanted to get out," she said. "He 
wanted to meet friends and see about his future." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good brother. He cares about the family, but he (felt he couldn't) 
help the family. . . . He had no money," she said. "In his heart, he got angry 
about himself and why he didn't (complete) school." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving out, Ta lived in a quiet Santa Ana neighborhood with his parents 
and four sisters. An older brother lives in Vietnam, Lily Ta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ta family moved to the United States in 1988 and have lived in its Santa 
Ana home for about a year, Lily Ta said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother works as a part-time housecleaner. His father has worked on-and-off 
in restaurants.

QUICK LEARNERS MAKE MOST OF RWANDA TREK

 They had brought only a few boxes of food and bandages, but three South County 
residents who traveled to war-torn Rwanda found themselves turned into medics 
and international relief agency couriers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ron Neely and Gary and Carol Kusunoki, members of Calvary Chapel in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, left two weeks ago, they knew the supplies they carried 
weren't much. Still, they hoped even the little they could give would help 
orphans in Rwanda's devastated villages. 
</P>
<P>
 But when several international relief agencies in Kigali heard about their 
mission, they inundated them with supplies that had sat unused in the capital 
because there were not enough relief workers willing to make the tough trek 
into Rwanda's rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The threesome ended up transporting water purifiers, diapers, fresh produce 
and 100 blankets, along with their few boxes of supplies, to an orphanage 36 
miles from Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now know first-hand that we can do something. Every person can get 
involved," said Neely, 36, a Lake Forest resident and the director of Safe 
Harbor International, a relief organization run by Calvary Chapel. "But for 
each orphan we were able to help, there are 100 more we could not reach." 
</P>
<P>
 After briefly lifting the spirits of the 120 undernourished children of the 
Kayonza orphanage with songs and hugs, the Safe Harbor members now hope to help 
the orphanage on a permanent basis. They plan to build additional rooms at the 
orphanage, send a medical team to treat the children and bring in bunk beds, 
clothing and more food, they said Friday after returning from their five-day 
trip.

 Gary Kusunoki, 35, a Laguna Hills resident who is the Calvary Chapel pastor, 
said it is hard to forget the sight of corpses beside the road and dozens of 
flies buzzing about the children's faces as they sat inert, too exhausted to 
swat them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't get help soon, they will die," he said of the infants, toddlers 
and adolescents who broke into smiles and laughs when the Americans fed and 
held them. "It's a cold, hard fact that when we return, some of them won't be 
there anymore."

 Carol Kusunoki, 34, said the filth of the restrooms and water supplies shocked 
her and made her realize that Safe Harbor could not end its relief mission with 
just a five-day trip.  
</P>
<P>
 Safe Harbor plans to send a team of volunteer doctors and nurses to Kayonza in 
October. Although the three travelers were only prepared to treat minor wounds, 
they ended up setting broken bones themselves by following telephone 
instructions from doctors in a distant city. 
</P>
<P>
 The three said they are happy to be home, where they can eat food other than 
cold Army rations, take hot showers, and hug their own children, who stayed 
home for this trip but say they want to go next time to meet the Rwandan 
orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trip has given us a greater appreciation for the blessings we have here," 
Gary Kusunoki said. "The most encouraging thing was being able to do so much 
for the kids. But the frustrating thing was leaving so much more undone."

TRIAL ORDERED IN TWO SLAYINGS; CRIME: WOMAN IS ACCUSED OF MURDERING HER 
HUSBAND'S LOVER AND AN INFANT IN MISSION VIEJO. MATE IS WEALTHY TAIWAN 
BUSINESSMAN.

<P>
 The wife of a wealthy Taiwan businessman was ordered to stand trial Friday for 
the murder of her husband's lover and the slain woman's 5-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge also ruled that the prosecution's key evidence against Li-Yun (Lisa) 
Peng -- DNA evidence that links Peng's saliva to a bite mark found on the dead 
woman's arm -- would be admissible in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's defense attorney has decried the high-tech testing as "voodoo," but 
South Municipal Court Judge Arthur Koelle said he found the evidence reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of evidence used by the Orange County crime lab in this case is 
generally accepted in the scientific community, as it was testified to by the 
experts in this hearing," Koelle said at the close of Peng's preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng, 44, who has homes in Rancho Santa Margarita and her native Taiwan, has 
pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that she stabbed Ranbing (Jennifer) Ji 18 times on Aug. 
18, 1993, in Ji's Mission Viejo apartment. Ji's son, Kevin, was found 
suffocated in a crib in an adjoining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that Peng killed Ji, 25, out of jealousy after learning of 
her husband's extramarital affair. The husband testified that he was the baby's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng was arrested in January after authorities said they had a DNA link to a 
bite on Ji's left arm.  
</P>
<P>
 Peng's preliminary hearing had spanned three months, with the judge spending 
much of that time reviewing the volumes of DNA research submitted by 
prosecution and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's attorneys fought vigorously to keep out the DNA evidence, contending 
that the testing is unreliable and submitting more than 1,000 pages of material 
on the subject to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Marshall M. Schulman, Peng's lead defense attorney, assailed the 
judge's ruling, contending that there is a "raging scientific controversy" over 
the reliability of DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be just voodoo science as far as I'm concerned," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he plans to raise the matter again in Orange County Superior 
Court, where Peng is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Schulman argued that there was not enough evidence to hold his 
client to stand trial. He said that a statement recorded by police -- where 
Peng allegedly said that Ji had attacked her with a knife the day of the murder 
-- might help clear his client. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows "that she was attacked by Jennifer Ji with a knife," Schulman told 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney contended there is no evidence linking Peng to the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko welcomed the judge's findings 
that allowed DNA evidence and held Peng for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the first time DNA has been admitted in any case," Molko said. 
"We've been doing this for three to four years, and people are not just aware 
of it -- the public is not. This will help focus on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Molko said that DNA evidence shows that saliva from a bite mark on Ji's arm 
matches genetic markers of samples taken from Peng. He said that such a match 
can only be found in one person out of 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's husband, Tseng (Jim) Peng, a Taiwanese businessman, discovered the 
bodies of Ji and her infant son when he went to visit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng Peng, 51, is chief executive officer of San Diego-based Ranger 
Communications, one of the world's largest manufacturers of citizens' band 
radios with factories in Taiwan, Malaysia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, he testified that he is the father of Ji's son, Kevin, and had met Ji 
in 1990 while on a business trip to China. Ji later moved to Mission Viejo near 
the Pengs' Rancho Santa Margarita home. 
</P>
<P>
 Molko said the district attorney's office has has yet to decide whether to 
seek the death penalty against Peng.

MOTHERS SHARE GRIEF; KIN ON OPPOSITE SIDES IN WOODS CASE EMBRACE, SHED TEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 United in a common tragedy, three mothers whose lives intersected with the 
death of Steve Woods last year had touched hands, then briefly embraced during 
a chance meeting recently in a courthouse hallway, an encounter that left all 
three in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the trial they were attending ended Thursday with second-degree 
murder convictions against Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, and Hector Penuelas, 17, in 
the death of Woods, 17, the mothers seemed still to share a bond, an 
understanding that his slaying last year had made victims of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bonilla's mother said Friday it was out of respect for Steve Woods' 
mother that she and other relatives of the defendants had made no public 
comment immediately after the verdict. Kathy Woods, in turn, said she felt only 
sadness for the families of the young men found guilty in the bizarre 
confrontation last October that left her son dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the two women Friday voiced sharply contrasting views of the 
verdict reached by Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey. Woods 
expressed relief and a measure of vindication that the first two defendants in 
the case had been convicted of murder and nine other felony counts; Maria Perez 
Bonilla spoke of her faith in her own son's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Penuelas' relatives, and those of four other defendants in the case, could not 
be reached for comment Friday. Three of the youths, including Penuelas' brother 
Saul, 18, have yet to be tried. A fourth, Arturo Villalobos, 19, has pleaded 
guilty to voluntary manslaughter and will be sentenced in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods died last November, almost a month after he was speared through the head 
by a paint-roller rod that was thrown at the car in which he was riding at 
Calafia Beach County Park. The gang attack, along with the horrifying nature of 
Woods' injury, shocked the quiet community of San Clemente, stirring protests 
and uncovering racial divisions in a town where violence is still a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 That the slaying also left deep emotional scars on the families of both the 
victim and the defendants was clear in conversations Friday with Kathy Woods 
and Maria Perez Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated near a window in a quiet booth at the Denny's restaurant where her son 
had worked, Kathy Woods said the two-week trial left her emotionally drained. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of the trial was especially difficult, she said, with opening 
arguments that included descriptions of her son's wound and the events 
surrounding his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in a nightmare, and I will always live in that nightmare," Woods said 
quietly. "But hearing the word 'murder' makes it a reality all over again. This 
was such a heinous thing to have happen to anyone. It's like it hits me all 
over again: My son was murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, she said, others who were present during the 
confrontation have not been charged. "I still think of all those others," she 
said. "It will never be over for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But the verdicts, which carry possible sentences of 15 years to life in 
prison, did bring her a measure of relief, she said. She had feared that the 
youths, who were juveniles at the time of the attack but were tried as adults, 
would be convicted of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her sympathy for their families, Woods also said she hopes the two 
young men will be given prison terms of at least 20 years when they are 
sentenced on Jan. 13. Throughout the trial, she said, she could find no remorse 
in their expressions, nothing that made her think they felt much guilt over her 
son's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just saw stony expressions," she said. "That doesn't mean they don't have 
remorse, but they didn't show it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Woods, now working as a real estate broker, has become 
increasingly visible, making occasional appearances at victims' rights meetings 
and recently traveling to Sacramento to try to lobby the Legislature on several 
crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she did not end up addressing the lawmakers that time, she said she 
plans to continue working with crime victims and their relatives to try to 
toughen existing laws on crime. Her top priorities include lengthening the 
prison sentences for violent offenders and lowering the age at which juveniles 
can stand trial as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a crusader," she said, her low voice intense. "But if I can go with a 
group and we can speak with one voice to the Legislature, maybe we can do some 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I see my direction now, which I really didn't do before." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the verdicts affirmed the faith of Woods' mother in the criminal 
justice system, at least to some extent, they served only to shatter that of 
Bonilla's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Perez Bonilla said that with her son's convictions on charges of 
second-degree murder, assault, conspiracy to commit assault and a gang 
enhancement, her family's faith in the judge -- and by extension, the justice 
system -- has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the best for my son. But now, what? We sat in the courtroom and we had 
our faith that the judge would find out that this was an accident . . . but he 
didn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing (Julio) did bad was be there at that beach that night," Perez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's investigators, Bonilla was the heavy-set Latino who had 
punched the driver of one of the vehicles involved. Although the blow did not 
injure the driver, it was viewed as helping precipitate the violence that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla bragged about punching the driver later that night at another San 
Clemente park. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said that before the verdict was read Thursday, she had talked to her 
son on the telephone from the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that he had a lot of faith in God too," Perez said. "And, I told 
him we supported him, that we loved him. He told me to take care of myself 
because I suffer from high blood pressure, and with this whole thing, my 
husband has been ill too. You have to understand that with Julio, he feels bad 
too, for what happened and for what it's doing to his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the verdict, the family had huddled in a courtroom corridor and prayed 
together in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 During the drive to the Santa Ana courthouse, Bonilla's nephews and nieces 
kept hounding her with questions about their uncle, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Hey, what's with my uncle Julio?' his niece kept asking. I have six 
grandchildren, and on the drive in the car to the court they kept asking, 'How 
come we can't see our uncle Julio? Is he sick? What's wrong?' It's difficult 
because they're too young to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Mauro, do not know what they can do now to help their 
son. They have heard that an appeal is possible. But she said they are resigned 
to putting the past behind them, and going ahead with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "With God, that's the only way we can endure this and get it behind us," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she continued to protest that her son, who was never a problem at home, is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "All during the trial," she said, "they kept saying my son was responsible for 
this brutal slaying. But you know what? We know nothing of this. Yes, my son 
was there with his friends that night, but I'm sure he didn't do this. I'm sure 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that God will help us in this," she added, "and that he won't leave 
us or abandon us."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS NEW TB TESTS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District now requires all first-grade students as 
well as all other students in any grade who are new to the county to be tested 
for tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education adopted the policy this week to meet new county 
requirements designed to reduce the risk of infections at schools, district 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the increase in cases of active tuberculosis that have been found 
in the county, this is clearly a positive step for us to be making," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that implementing the policy will not be easy because of the 
large number of students it will affect. Also, tuberculosis tests require 
nurses to see each youngster twice within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The new requirements are effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should call their child's school to find out when and where testing 
will be done.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BLIND KIDS HIT DUNES TO CAMP, SWIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Dunes Resort welcomed 26 blind youths for a three-day camp out 
this week that gave them a chance to hone their independent living skills, get 
some exercise and socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, many of whom got their first chance at water sports such as 
sailing and windsurfing, also learned something about self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we do has a learning goal," said Brian Nelson, assistant youth 
coordinator for the Braille Institute's Orange County office. "The kids are 
putting up their own tents and doing all their own cooking, which all helps out 
with their independent living skills." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, ages 12 to 19, don't usually get as much exercise as sighted young 
people because their blindness limits the kinds of activities they can do, 
especially alone, Nelson said. The trip to the Dunes, which ends today, gives 
them a chance to learn and transfer their skills to new activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Torres, who does a lot of swimming at his Garden Grove apartment 
complex, bristled at having to wear a life vest at the water park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said I have to wear this because I'm 12," he said. "I wouldn't have to 
if I was 13. I go to the beach a lot too, and this (the park) is almost like a 
beach and almost like a pool." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is a yellow belt in judo, which taught him balance. He needed all 
he could get to go out on his first windsurfing adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just never tried it before and it's like surfing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first hour of his lesson, he spent a lot of time in the water. No 
matter how many times he fell off the sail board, he got right back on. 
Somewhere into the second hour, he was gliding triumphantly across the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 His teacher, 16-year-old Dan Lobdell of Costa Mesa, marveled at Ruben's 
determination and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I close my eyes and think about windsurfing," he said. "I don't know how they 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Young, a 16-year-old from Glendale, said he prefers events with dances, 
ice cream socials and other mixers where he and the other teens can mix and, 
with luck, date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like the beach sometimes," he said. "You get all messy and I 
don't really like getting messy." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Lepe, 12, said he wanted to try almost everything -- sailing, pedal boats 
and electric floating lounges called Sun Kats. But he didn't want to talk too 
much about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shy," he giggled, turning his face away. "I hope the TV (news) doesn't 
come." Shayla Gustafson, 14, said she enjoyed the Sun Kats most but attended 
the event because "my parents make me go." 
</P>
<P>
 "She really doesn't go on very many camping trips," chimed in her more 
assertive tent mate, Amber Larsen, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went kayaking. The resort provided the kayaks for us," Larsen said. "We 
went into the marsh and stuff. We picked up sea lettuce and it felt like 
plastic. I said, 'Eeww, trash!' But it wasn't."HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY STAFF EXPLORING FARMERS MARKET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has instructed the staff to explore the possibility of 
allowing an open air "farmers market" to operate on city property. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said he has been approached by several private 
groups who would like to install such a market in the parking lot next to City 
Hall on weekends or mid-week evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council meeting this week, several residents spoke in favor of allowing 
a fresh produce market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a farmers market would be a real asset," Marilyn Johnson said. "I 
just think it would bring a little uplift to our city that has been going 
through a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chamber of Commerce president Becky Carey said a recent chamber survey 
showed that having such a market in town was a priority for many residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a real benefit," Carey said. "It's something a lot of 
people have wanted to do in our downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 But resident Wayne Baglin questioned the wisdom of using a parking space for 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need parking more than anything else in town," he said. "Please don't 
bring more congestion and people we don't need when we prefer to have a little 
bit of peace and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 While the city hall parking lot is used heavily during summer festival months, 
it is apt to be available at other times, Frank reported in a memo to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have allowed open air markets to operate on public property in 
exchange for a percentage of the gross receipts and/or a flat fee, the memo 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to have city staff explore various sites in town 
where such a market could operate.LESLIE EARNEST

 The City Council has given final approval to a law requiring pet owners to 
tote a container for animal waste whenever they walk their dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 While pet owners are already required by law to pick up after their pets, city 
officials say that particular law is often ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. has maintained that requiring residents to 
carry disposal containers with them will encourage them to clean up after their 
pet. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the ordinance this week. The new law, which 
says residents must carry "a suitable wrapper, bag or container," when walking 
dogs, will become effective Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine for first, second and third offenses are $25, $50 and $100, 
respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 Purcell has said animal control officers will issue warnings before giving 
citations for the first few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The law does not apply to blind people with dogs.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; TEACHERS LEARNING SKILLS FOR THE

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 250 teachers and administrators from the Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District hit the classrooms this week for a symposium about technology 
and how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's program, held at Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate School, 
offered hands-on training in use of the Internet -- which links computers 
throughout the nation into an information network accessible to many -- as well 
as desktop publishing, multimedia production and several other high-tech tools. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION URGED 
</P>

<P>
 The city has adopted a new plan that offers developers incentives to build 
affordable housing, part of an attempt to make 20% of new homes accessible to 
low- and moderate-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Affordable Housing Plan adopted by the City Council last week "promotes 
and encourages" housing for people of modest means, rather than requiring 
builders to provide it.The plan's only compulsory clause requires developers of 
projects containing more than 10 units to discuss affordable housing options 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, a family of four earning less than $40,000 is considered low 
income and should spend no more than $10,000 annually, or $850 per month, on 
housing. A family of four earning less than $29,000 per year is considered very 
low income in Orange County, according to the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members supported the plan but said they wanted the city to monitor 
income levels of occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I strongly favor this plan," said Councilman Mark A. Murphy, who 
sat on the steering committee for the program. "This is a private sector plan 
for a public sector need." LESLEY WRIGHT

 The annual Pacific Coast Builders Conference this summer awarded Huntington 
Beach's downtown Oceanview Promenade its grand award in best office/business 
building under the 100,000-square-foot category.

 The judges felt that the building borrowed from the forms of the municipal 
pier and related strongly to adjacent buildings.

<P>
 The building was the project of Abdelmuti Development Co. It is the fifth city

<P>
 The Food Distribution Center's annual Corporate Challenge Food Drive collected 
nearly 70,000 pounds of food, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 companies and 42,800 employees contributed dry and canned foods 
to the drive, which ended last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The food was inspected and sorted by center officials and will be distributed 
to more than 260 charities in Orange County, including the Salvation Army, 
Mental Health Assn., homeless services groups and homes for unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 180,000 people a month receive food from the distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees from McDonnell-Douglas in Huntington Beach donated the most food of 
any company -- 18,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials said the drive was held in the summer because that is when 
the need is greatest, especially among children, who do not receive free school 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in donating non-perishable foods to the center, 426-A W. 
Almond St., can call (714) 771-1343. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; RECOVERING WORKER RECEIVES GIFT OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Candice Walker underwent intestinal surgery recently, the 29-year-old 
city employee was showered with get-well wishes, cards and flowers from her 
City Hall co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, Walker also got something very unusual from her colleagues -- 
their vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 To help defray $4,000 in medical costs, more than 60 city employees donated 
about 350 hours of vacation time directly to Walker. The donations, which are 
still coming in, will amount to an estimated $3,500 for Walker, who is 
recuperating in her Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really feels great," said Walker, who works in the city's print shop 
assembling agendas and brochures. "I didn't have enough money to cover (the 
operation). It shows that a lot of employees care about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker is one of a handful of city employees who have benefited under the 
voluntary city program. Last year, employees rallied to donate $11,000 worth of 
vacation time to a part-time recreation worker who lost a limb. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which has about 2,000 workers, approved the voluntary program about 
three years ago to aid seriously ill or injured city employees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About five city employees have received similar vacation time contributions, 
including one worker with a serious lung disease who got $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much better than passing the hat," said Sharon Ericson, president of 
the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn. "You just donate your hourly wage. That's 
why I always try to get management to donate because their rate is so high." 
</P>
<P>
 For Walker, the donations are a case of "what goes around, comes around." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who has been with the city for seven years, has given away some 80 
hours of her vacation time to four other city employees in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought this was a good program," Walker said. "It shows people 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said she will probably return to her office duties after Labor Day. Her 
return is welcome news to her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Candy keeps the city moving," said Marilyn Hauk, also with the Anaheim 
Municipal Employees Assn. MARTIN MILLER

 Police Chief Daryl Wicker is recuperating at home from a recent minor heart 
attack and will be back at work soon, City Manager Darrell Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the City Council Monday night, Essex said Wicker is "doing 
quite well" after heart-related chest pains he suffered while visiting in 
Riverside County Aug. 12.Wicker, 48, initially was hospitalized in Sun City and 
then was transferred to St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager told the council that Wicker did not have to undergo heart 
surgery and is now resting at home for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were pleased at the good news about the chief's 
quick recovery. They also noted that there has been an outpouring of concern 
and sympathy for Wicker from many residents in Cypress and in surrounding 
communities. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; CITY OKS 9.8% HIKE IN TRASH PICKUP FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will pay $1.10 more a month for trash pickup to help offset extra 
costs to the city's trash-hauling company due to the Santiago Canyon landfill 
closure in Irvine this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the rate increase at Tuesday's council 
meeting, boosting the monthly rate to $12.95 from $11.85 -- a 9.8% increase 
that will take effect Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 CR&R Inc, the trash-collection company based in Stanton, had asked the City 
Council in June to approve the increase to help compensate for the extra miles 
haulers must drive to Brea, where some of the city's garbage is now dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city's new cleanup program -- where residents are allowed to 
place unlimited amounts of large items for curbside pickup four times a year -- 
is extra work for the company and another reason behind the hike in fares. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first rate increase approved by the City Council since the company 
and the city signed a three-year solid waste collection contract in 1991. TOM 
RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL CONSIDERS NEWS RACK CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long rows of news racks lining public streets may become a thing of the past 
if the City Council approves a new ordinance this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study session Monday, council members discussed a draft of the law in an 
attempt to regulate the aesthetics, if not the content, of newspaper racks 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had passed a "blinder" ordinance earlier this summer to force 
sexually suggestive journals to cover themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the second ordinance pass, all publications would have to pay a $10 
permit fee and abide by a number of specific provisions or risk impoundment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's here is about as restrictive as you can get, in my opinion," said 
Mayor Donald L. Bone. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance says that racks may be attached to each other but each group 
must be separated by 10 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Racks would also be banned from curbs painted green, white or yellow because 
they would block access to people getting into or out of cars there. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have to be no more than 40 inches tall and 30 inches wide, the 
ordinance says. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, news rack owners are required only to register with the city. Once 
the law passes, they will have 90 days to comply, according to Traffic Engineer 
Herbert E. Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 All the regulations are related to public safety and welfare and comply with 
the most recent interpretations of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 
explained Deputy City Atty. D. Craig Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was written in line with other cities' laws that have been 
upheld in court, he said. He and Public Works Director Donald K. Jensen added 
that they believe the law could be fully defended if someone challenges it in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," said Councilman Arthur C. Brown of the ordinance, noting that he 
fielded one or two complaints a month when he was mayor last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the issue is tentatively set for early October. LESLEY

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING LEAVES 2 WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy were wounded early Friday morning in 
what police believe was a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, who were identified only as Buena Park residents, were each shot 
once as they stood on the 5800 block of Kingman Avenue at about 1:15 a.m. They 
were taken to West Anaheim Medical Center.Their wounds did not appear to be 
serious, said Police Lt. Patrick Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived at the scene after receiving several 911 calls from residents 
who heard the gunfire. Police found the victims lying on the ground, Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators suspect that the incident was a drive-by shooting, but so 
far the victims have refused to give police a full accounting of what happened, 
Black said.

BOOKKEEPER, TWO OTHERS FACE FRAUD CHARGES; LAW: A FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS 
DONALD LEE PETERSON AND TWO ALLEGED ACCOMPLICES, ACCUSED OF TAKING MORE THAN 
$700,000 FROM AREA BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Lee Peterson, the itinerant bookkeeper accused of making off with more 
than $700,000 from Southern California businesses, was indicted by a federal 
grand jury Friday along with two others for bank fraud, mail fraud and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scheme that has impressed prosecutors for its sophistication, Peterson 
was hired as bookkeeper at investment companies in Newport Beach, Santa Ana, 
Westminster, Santa Monica, Long Beach and San Diego over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, he used an alias and a phony resume, staying just a few months. The 
indictment alleges that by the time he left, he had transferred large sums out 
of the companies. None of the money has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 56, had two accomplices, authorities said, both of whom were named 
in Friday's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory J. Gwynn, 41, of Los Angeles, is already in jail, charged with 
recently shooting his girlfriend. Patrick W. Finnigan, 55, whose last known 
address was in Orange County, was also charged in the alleged scheme and is a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities say Gwynn and Finnigan served as phony references for 
Peterson's prospective employers and opened bank accounts to which the funds 
were diverted. Once they got the money, they allegedly bought gold coins and 
American Eagle bullion coins. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the mild-mannered Peterson, authorities say, who was able to fool 
employers for so long and figure out exactly when it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Donald G. Rubright, is leaving the case now that it is making 
its way into federal court because Peterson doesn't have any more money for 
legal fees. Rubright said Peterson "has got a lot of problems, giving how 
compelling the (government's) case is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the money been taken from one or two companies, Rubright said, it could be 
argued that Peterson engaged in an isolated crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was purposeful fraudulent activity," Rubright said. "It was repeated 
again and again with the same modus operandi and so you could see how clear and 
purposeful it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies wanted to hire Peterson because he asked for a fairly modest salary 
and didn't require health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these companies just ate it up," Rubright said. "Certainly, any company 
that had gone to the trouble of confirming his educational background would 
have found out what the real story was. People need to be more leery when they 
are allowing access to their checking accounts and books."

 More than $700,000 was stolen, nearly half of it from Lido Pacific Asset 
Management Co. in Newport Beach, where Peterson worked under the name David 
Shelton from July, 1992, to February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Peterson also worked for Newport Equities Group in Santa 
Ana, InterPacific Asset Management in Westminster and Nathan J. International 
Inc., in Huntington Beach, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in April, following a story in the Wall Street Journal about 
the fraud investigation. The owner of a Westminster property management company 
called police to report he had recently hired a bookkeeper fitting Peterson's 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Huntington Beach police and the Orange County district attorney's 
office were pursuing the case, they turned it over to federal authorities 
because Peterson is subjected to greater prison time and a longer 
statute-of-limitations period for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson faces 500 years in prison and a $15-million fine. Finnigan faces 495 
years in prison and a $14.75-million fine and Gwynn faces 30 years in prison 
and a $1-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, his attorney said, "could have made quite a good living" through 
legitimate means. "He's pleasant and soft-spoken. You get no flavor of a crafty 
criminal."

4 TEENS HURT IN CRASH NEAR HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four El Toro High School students were injured, one critically, when their 
Honda sedan collided with another car just after they pulled out of the 
school's parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four boys were not identified because they are juveniles.The school was 
not in session, but the students had just left a cross-country training session 
as they pulled onto Ridge Route, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini.  
</P>
<P>
 The Honda and a Chevrolet collided on Toledo Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the most seriously injured teens were airlifted to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where one was reported in critical condition with head 
injuries and a second in guarded condition with broken bones. The other two 
teens were taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where they were both reported in stable condition with broken bones, cuts and 
bruises.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chevrolet's driver was treated at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in 
Laguna Hills and released. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests or citations, Martini said, but the Sheriff's Department 
is investigating.

PAROLEE HELD IN FATAL 4-VEHICLE LA HABRA CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed and a second was arrested for vehicular manslaughter 
Friday, after a high-speed chase through La Habra that ended in a four-car 
crash on the steps of the city's Fire Department, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Chandler Emile Graham, 31, of Buena Park, was identified by 
police as a convicted kidnaper on parole who has 10 aliases. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 1 p.m., La Habra police received a call from Brea police about a 
car being driven recklessly from Brea into La Habra on Lambert Boulevard. A La 
Habra motorcycle officer spotted the sedan, which had turned onto Cypress 
Street, and ordered the driver to pull over. But when the officer approached 
the stopped car, it took off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol unit and then another motorcycle officer picked up the chase as it 
wound onto La Habra Boulevard, past the Police Department at speeds of 60-70 
m.p.h., Lt. John W. Buchholz said. The officers lost sight of the car until 
they arrived at the scene of the crash near the intersection of La Habra and 
Monte Vista Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchholz said that one car traveling in the opposite direction on La Habra, 
started to make a left turn onto Monte Vista when the fleeing driver swerved 
across the center divider, setting off the chain-reaction crash that also 
involved another car and two trucks. The sedan came to rest on the steps of the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody at the scene thought it was a plane crash, it was so loud," Buchholz 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tore O. Johanson, 66, of Lakewood, who was driving the other car, 
died at the scene. His wife, Shirley, 68, had to be cut out of the car and was 
flown to UCI Medical Center, where she was reported in fair but guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, who was injured, was being held at the jail ward at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Pruter, 71, of Whittier, was injured slightly when his pickup truck was 
hit. He was and taken to a Friendly Hills Regional Hospital in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchholz said an opened quart-size bottle of beer was found in Graham's car.

SEASONAL LIFEGUARDS GET COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Surf City Lifeguards Employee Assn., an organization representing about 80 
seasonal lifeguards, will be recognized by the city, officials announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion they meet all the guidelines to allow us to recognize them," 
William H. Osness, city personnel director, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard J. Silber, a Huntington Beach attorney representing the part-time, 
seasonal lifeguards, called the city's recognition a landmark decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge, it's the first employee organization to represent seasonal 
lifeguards in . . . the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited, thrilled and happy," Silber added. "It means that for the 
first time the seasonal lifeguards, under state collective bargaining law and 
under city labor relations resolutions, have created an employee association to 
represent them concerning their wages, hours and conditions of employment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, the city must negotiate with the association concerning those 
matters and no longer unilaterally set wages and conditions of employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Graham, a driving force behind the formation of the association, also 
hailed the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased that the city acted professionally and promptly in this 
matter," said Graham, 40, who has 14 years' experience as a seasonal lifeguard. 
"Before, we weren't recognized by the state of California labor laws, and the 
city of Huntington Beach didn't recognize us either. We were in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we can now push public safety as a bargaining unit," he said. 
"We just want to protect the public and our positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said that with the city recognition he now expects additional seasonal 
lifeguards to join the organization. Currently, 80 of about 100 seasonal 
lifeguards are members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silber said the next step is for the state to hold an election -- at the 
request of the association and city -- to determine if the association will be 
the exclusive employee representative for the seasonal lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the association is certified as the exclusive bargaining unit, contract 
negotiations between the city and the association can start. 
</P>
<P>
 An election is planned for next week before many of the seasonal lifeguards -- 
who are college students, teachers and other professionals -- leave their 
summer jobs at the city's beach after the Labor Day weekend. The majority of 
them work during the summer months and holiday times. 
</P>
<P>
 Silber said that the seasonal lifeguards have not been treated like city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that will come to end," he said, adding that now they can "negotiate 
their own rights and benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The seasonal lifeguards currently have no benefits, work for lower pay than 
their full-time, year-round counterparts and are not paid at a higher rate for 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Silber said the seasonal lifeguards plan to start negotiations with the city 
"as soon as possible to present to the city a short list of items that the 
association wants immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is, we are prepared to negotiate and resolve them through 
collective bargaining," he said.

MUSIC REVIEW; JARVI CONDUCTS AN ORFF NIGHT AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, too many years ago, an innocent college sophomore in 
Providence, R.I., was given a recording of Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana." 
</P>
<P>
 Wow. The earth moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact in the dorm was terrific. Here, thought the wise fool and his 
friends, was a masterpiece for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone was modern yet ancient. The source was sort-of-sacred yet profane. 
The score, created in the shadows of 1935, zonked the listener point blank as 
it veered from the mystical to the spiritual to the bawdy and back again. 
</P>
<P>
 And again. 
</P>
<P>
 Orff, a canny survivor of the Nazi aesthetic, had given the world a gutsy 
memento of antique lust. In his cantata, he adorned 13th-Century poems from the 
archive of a Bavarian monastery with expressive accents that emerged grand and 
elegant one moment, folky and even jazzy the next. The chugging rhythmic 
structures taxed no ears that had ever heard Stravinsky, and the lyrical 
indulgences worried only those with a low tolerance for sonic saccharine. 
</P>
<P>
 This, we thought, was what modern music should be. Bold. Sexy. Immediate. 
Sexy. Tuneful. Arty. Sexy. It was all so easy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all too easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The charm, for at least one convert, didn't last long. With repeated hearings 
-- and there were many -- the intellectual primitivism began to seem a bit 
feebleminded. The starkness turned to emptiness. The beat-beat-beat of the 
percussion conjured goose-steps. The sentiment suggested comic-book kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, "Carmina Burana" struck the struggling music major as modern music 
for people who really don't like modern music. But the stomp-along cantata 
wouldn't go away. In fact, it prevailed to join the short list of Great Hits of 
the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sophomore became a junior, he had had enough. He decided to avoid the 
grunt-pound-and-bob orgy wherever possible. He turned Orff off. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, along came Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich and the movement of 
the Xeroxed arpeggio. Along came the stultifying trials of fashionable 
minimalism. Along came hammering repetition of the same simplistic ideas ad 
nauseam if not infinitum, always in the name of artistic resuscitation. Orff, 
by comparison, began to sound sophisticated, even complex. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was Thursday night at Hollywood Bowl, where Neeme Jarvi and his 
Detroit Symphony joined three vocal soloists and local choral forces for a big 
and bold, fast but hardly furious performance of Orff's beloved, indomitable 
gut-thumper. In the cool light of 1994, the tiresome platitudes didn't seem 
quite so tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, of course, is relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi stressed the obvious, devoting little time to any quest for delicacy. It 
seemed a reasonable approach, under the alfresco circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 His orchestra, grossly amplified, sounded often rough and usually ready. The 
Los Angeles Master Chorale, which had mustered "Carmina Burana" on its own a 
couple of months ago under Paul Salamunovich, sang with its customary fusion of 
fervor and finesse. The Los Angeles Children's Chorus, trained by Rebecca 
Thompson, did what it had to do with pert security. 
</P>
<P>
 The solo trio, haunted by microphone echoes, was led by Canadian baritone 
Kevin McMillan, who delivered his wide-ranging odes to life, love and booze 
with point, passing pitch-problems notwithstanding. Lisa Saffer's virginal 
soprano coped ecstatically with the high-flying fioriture of defloration 
("Dulcissime"). Tenor Craig Estep dared to roar like a lion in the plaints of 
the roasted cygnet, even though Orff was happy to settle for a weird falsetto 
in the stratospheric ascents. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi chose a far different, certainly less meretricious perspective of 
Germanic Medievalism for the first portion of the program, exulting in the 
bourgeois romanticism of Wagner's "Meistersinger." The Estonian maestro brought 
ample pomp if limited circumstance to 25 minutes of orchestral excerpts, 
including the prelude and Dance of the Apprentices. His players responded with 
eager generalities rather than elegant details. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The skies, harboring only three mezzo-forte airplanes, were unusually 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 * The audience, officially tabulated at 11,370, included one unhappy, 
exceptionally healthy-voiced baby in the lower boxes -- no doubt an incipient 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 50-cent program magazine offered inadequate annotations from Detroit, 
and neither texts nor translations. 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to the ovation that Orff built into the final cadence, Jarvi 
piled anticlimax upon climax and repeated a midsection chorus, "Were diu werlt 
alle min," as an unorthodox encore.

 TV Blues: The House of Blues announced plans Friday to produce and distribute 
22 episodes of a weekly concert series, "Live From the House of Blues," for 
cable TV this fall. Negotiations are under way with several cable networks. In 
addition to the routinely sold-out House of Blues club on the Sunset Strip, 
there are venues in New Orleans, Massachusetts and, soon, New York. The House 
of Blues will internally produce the program and is planning to air each show 
simultaneously on radio stations nationwide.

 Dueling Roseannes: The network race is on to turn Roseanne and her rocky 
romance with Tom Arnold into a made-for-TV movie. NBC has ordered "Roseanne and 
Tom: A Hollywood Marriage," starring Patrika Darbo ("Corrina, Corrina") and 
Stephen Lee ("Little White Lies"). Fox already is readying a TV movie starring 
Denny Dillon (the secretary from HBO's "Dream On"). It's scheduled to begin 
shooting Wednesday for an early fall broadcast. The NBC project, directed by 
Richard Colla ("Deadly Medicine"), will begin production next month to air in 
November.

 Rising Star: Can you imagine the likes of Fox's beefy "Beverly Hills, 90210" 
or melodramatic "Melrose Place" on CBS, television's oldest-skewing network? 
You might not have to. Darren Star, the hot, young creator and executive 
producer of those shows, will move from Fox, where he began his TV career, to 
CBS in a new deal struck with his production company. Star received a rare 
13-episode commitment from CBS to create and produce a new one-hour ensemble 
drama about young people in New York, tentatively titled "Central Park West." 
The series is slated for a fall 1995 premiere.

 Ballet Bestowal: African American classical ballet pioneer Joseph Rickard, who 
died last Wednesday after a long bout with pneumonia, left a legacy to the 
Huntington Library in San Marino. Rickard, founder of the First Negro Classic 
Ballet in 1947, donated a personal collection of 270 items ranging from 
scrapbooks to music scores to set designs. Among the successful ballets Rickard 
choreographed was the first black production of "Cinderella," with original

 Their Life: The Piano Man and the Uptown Girl have called it quits. Billy Joel 
and Christie Brinkley announced in April that they were separating, and now 
their divorce is final. The nine-year marriage of the musician, 45, and the 
model, 40, was dissolved Thursday by Supreme Court Justice Phyllis 
Gangel-Jacob, according to reports. The final agreement was filed earlier this 
week under the caption "Anonymous vs. Anonymous." The divorce documents are 
under court seal and no information was available about the couple's division 
of property or custody arrangements for their 8-year-old daughter, Alexa Ray.

 Changes in Latitude: The "Son of a Son of a Sailor" may need some flying tips. 
Jimmy Buffett swam to safety Thursday when the seaplane he was piloting crashed 
into a wave on takeoff from Nantucket, Mass. The "Margaritaville" singer was 
alone in the nine-seat, twin-engine plane when it flipped. Buffett, 47, of Key 
West, Fla., escaped and was picked up by a passing boat that carried him to 
shore. Authorities said Buffett had no visible injuries but complained of pain. 
Buffet and Herman Wouk are expected to begin work in November on a Broadway 
musical based on Wouk's 1965 novel "Don't Stop the Carnival." It's about a 
Broadway press agent who quits his job and buys an island hotel hoping to find 
paradise. He doesn't. QUICK TAKES

ART REVIEW; THREE DOSES OF REALITY, MAGIC AND ODDITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Rip van Winkle woke up to the three exhibitions of contemporary art at Cal 
State Long Beach he'd probably be a little flummoxed. Back before he dozed off 
20 years ago, art was something interesting to look at. What's here is still 
interesting but for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rip slept, art changed. A progressively troubled world caused a revival 
of Expressionism. It got mixed up with a tendency to replace empirical 
observation with disembodied thought. This conceptual trend is subject to bouts 
of hysteria. That's what happens when you lock your mind up in a room full of 
electronic communications gear and never look at reality. Hysterical epochs 
tend to think everything is going wrong. Naturally that reflects in the art 
they produce. 
</P>
<P>
 New York artist Susan Crile, for example, presents an installation of about 12 
big paintings. Called "The Fires of War," the show has been organized by 
curator Jeremy Strick at the St. Louis Art Museum. Pictures show pyrotechnic 
explosions in an already devastated landscape. There are no people. Sparse 
signs of former human habitation include the skeleton of a burnt-out shack and 
a stretch of asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
 As paintings, they're pretty raw. One composition titled "Conflagration: Oil 
and Fire" is visually compelling in the way the hellish scene is mirrored in a 
lake, but the aesthetic effect seems incidental. The artist clearly has 
something else on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it has to do with the deja vu familiarity of the images. We've seen that 
peculiar gaseous, chemically artificial sort of fireball before, on television. 
During the Gulf War, millions sat up half the night watching in horrified 
fascination as Saddam Hussein laid waste to the Kuwaiti oil fields like some 
mad Sardanapalus incinerating his lands, piqued at his own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Such associations are certainly one's own since nothing here calls up either 
the history of art or moral outrage. Even though Crile actually visited the oil 
fields, these pictures are emotionally dead. So what we are left with is a 
familiar coupling of emotional anomie and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 That rap has long since curdled into cliche. The work does, however, ignite a 
more universally pertinent question that has as much to do with viewers as with 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is humankind so fascinated with devastation? It excites people like an 
aphrodisiac. We flock to disaster like zombies clucking our concern, but really 
we just want to see the show. We don't want to think about this kind of primal 
fascination because we're always fighting off the truth of our animality. 
</P>
<P>
 If Crile at least leaves us with something interesting to think about, 
photographer Arthur Tress presents a traveling piece that is as rewarding to 
listen to as to look at. Titled "Arthur Tress, Requiem for a Paperweight," it 
is a case of information overload if nothing else. It consists of some 96 
square-framed panels arranged in nine thematic groups. Each panel is further 
fragmented into collages made up of everything from campy vintage pulp 
illustrations to Japanese prints and electronic imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a minor miracle of graphic stage management that Tress makes his theme 
clear. The piece follows the stages of life of a Universal Salaryman in this 
Darwinian, chaotic, technocratic epoch. It begins with the fashionable 
evocation of middle-class boyhood trauma. A Boy Scout is surprised with his 
cache of forbidden books. 
</P>
<P>
 The show marches on through the usual questions. What shall I be? How can I 
fit in? Suddenly our hero is a suit assailed by responsibility, terror of 
failure and impotence. Finally he entertains visions of escape into the realm 
of aesthetics or techno-metaphysical transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is an absolute encyclopedia of mawkish homilies about ordinary life. 
But then so was "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band." Tress' work resembles 
it in its attempt to wring universal truth from commonplace event. Sometimes 
it's witty, touching and smart. It gets a lot of help from a score by R. Weis. 
Its loopy sound and snippets of poetry make a binding auditory texture. Tress 
is so close to multimedia, one can't help wondering if it all might work better 
as a computer show. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "magic realism" used to designate a kind of tight, hyper-realist 
painting style. The exhibition "Magic Realism, Violating Expectations" changes 
that definition. A group show drawn from the University Art Museum's permanent 
collection, it consists of about 25 small works that create often-compelling 
images using offbeat techniques or themes.  
</P>
<P>
 Calum Colvin's "Male Nude," for example, makes a sensuous picture of its 
subject by using photography to combine a still-life of a female mannequin, 
ceramics and paint. It works in a fashion similar to that of the Italian Old 
Master trickster Arcimboldo who combined images of fruit into the illusion of a 
man's head. Boyd Webb does a similar trick in an image of a human brain made up 
of intertwined zebras. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all work is that illusionistic. Performance artist Eugenia Vargas is 
pretty straightforward in photographs of her own mud-covered head. The surprise 
is that it looks so much like romantic sculpture. Other examples by people like 
David Hockney, Richard Bosman and Susan Rothenberg are in more conventional 
media but manage to create the same odd effect. Perhaps the hidden point here 
is that, in the end, magic is always the goal of art, not tricks, not politics.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TIME STANDS STILL AT GREEK FOR STEVIE NICKS AND FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can you believe it's been nearly 20 years since Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood 
Mac and helped turn that fading blues-rock band into a pop powerhouse? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently plenty of people can't -- or won't -- accept that passage of 
time.At the Greek Theatre on Thursday -- the first of two Nicks shows there -- 
a full house of fans clung to every word and note she sang as if hers was the 
voice of an oracular priestess. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one seemed in deeper denial than the star herself, who continues to 
play a role that was charming (if fey) when she was a lithe young woman in her 
20s, but is rather embarrassing for someone approaching middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still dramatically running off stage to change shawls every other song 
or so (six different outfits on Thursday). She's still twirling (albeit more 
slowly these days) to accent the unicorns-and-rainbows-ish imagery she often 
favors. And still relying on songs from the first two albums she made with the 
Mac as the foundation of her show (because, let's face it, her more recent 
material doesn't measure up). 
</P>
<P>
 And when she did the old songs -- "Dreams," "Rhiannon" and "Gold Dust Woman," 
accounting for a quarter of Thursday's set list -- she and her band made them 
virtual carbon copies of the mid-tempo Mac originals, save for Nicks' 
now-limited vocal range. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the highlight of the show was, in fact, a blast from the past, but 
a borrowed one: an encore of Tom Petty's "I Need to Know," done with an 
energetic, no-frills approach that finally blew her out of her time warp. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'BACKSTROKES': AN AWKWARD STAB AT HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one point in "Backstrokes," a frustrated therapist loses his unflappable 
composure and tries to strangle a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 In psychoanalysis jargon, this episode is an example of 
"countertransference."But in Joseph A. Volpi's clunky comedy about romance in 
the '90s, it's just another awkward stab at humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Circle Theatre's "Backstrokes," like David Mamet's quintessential '70s 
sex comedy "Sexual Perversity in Chicago," follows the love lives of two 
couples, in this case married yuppies Arthur (Mike Esposito) and June (Susan 
Gayle Watts) and confirmed singles Joey (Cress Williams) and Lita (Jennifer 
Taylor Scott). 
</P>
<P>
 One need not be a relationship counselor to guess how it will all turn out. 
Despite an air of trendiness, this long one-act traffics in cliches that are at 
least as old as the 20-something cast. While the real world has moved on to 
Prozac and monogamy, these characters are stuck joking about Valium and casual 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors do their best, but no one can really play exchanges like this one: 
"Commitment and responsibility are what hold society together." "I thought 
that's what Elmer's glue was for!" 
</P>
<P>
 Volpi also directed, sans Elmer's. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Backstrokes," Actors Circle Theatre, 7313 Santa Monica Blvd., West 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 3. $10. (213) 882-8043. Running 
time: 2 hours.

ART REVIEW; 'DIATOM' ART NOVEL IS SCANTILY CLAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, European aristocrats amused themselves after dinner by 
dressing up as figures in famous paintings and staging detailed tableaux 
vivants . 
</P>
<P>
 The makers of "Diatom: A PhotoGraphic Novel" update this impulse to imitate 
images by dressing models in comic-book costumes, posing them on elaborate 
sci-fi sets and photographing them in comic-strip sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the 19th-Century aristocrats, commercial photographer Dan Couto and 
costume designer/art director Glen Hanson do not participate in such theatrical 
undertakings for their own entertainment. Their goal is to sell a series of 
designer comic books in which glossy, retouched photographs replace 
mass-produced prints. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pheromone Salon d'Art, 32 enlarged prototypes are presented singularly as 
fine art photographs that follow the frame-by-frame sequence of comics. The 
story they tell is as cliched as the generic narratives that structure 
conventional pornography: Its only role is to provide a sketchy framework for 
the display of scantily clad bodies in provocative poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Couto's and Hanson's soft-core dramatization looks like the ill-conceived 
offspring of Joel-Peter Witkin's photographs and a B-movie rip-off of "Star 
Wars." In their corny black-and-white pictures, corporate wholesomeness 
seamlessly merges with sadomasochistic exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diatom's" upscale photographic comic strips represent an avaricious attempt 
to cash in on camp. They trade the perversely sophisticated appeal of extreme 
artifice and ostentation for the uninspired ploys of a middle-of-the-road 
marketing campaign. 
</P>

RAMS READY TO DEAL FOR MADDOX; FOOTBALL: SALARY CAP FORCING BRONCOS TO TRADE OR 
RELEASE BACKUP TO JOHN ELWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams talked extensively with the Denver Broncos on Friday and appear on 
the verge of completing a trade today for former UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Broncos approached us," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, 
"It's definitely something worth considering." 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials met last night at Rams Park and agreed to make a formal bid for 
Maddox, a No. 1 pick two years ago, who turns 23 in six days. 
</P>
<P>
 A club official said there was no deal as of Friday night, but it could be 
completed as early as noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos asked the Rams for a third-round draft pick next year, the Rams 
countered with an offer of a fifth and the teams then discussed the Rams' 
fourth-round pick, which was obtained in a trade with Dallas during this year's 
NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like Maddox (6-4, 195) because of his age, athletic ability and the 
anticipated value of quarterbacks next season with expansion franchises in 
Charlotte and Jacksonville filling their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake, Tommy Maddox would love to play for the Rams," said Leigh 
Steinberg, Maddox's agent. "The Giants, Cardinals, Bengals and 49ers have also 
expressed interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wouldn't want Tommy Maddox? If he had stayed in school he would have been 
one of the top five players in this year's draft." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos decided to unload Maddox when he refused to take a reported 
$650,000 pay cut to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox guided UCLA to a 9-3 record and a victory in the John Hancock Bowl as a 
sophomore and then made himself eligible for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams consummate the deal, he is expected to assume Jamie Martin's role 
as the team's No. 3 quarterback. The Rams might also have to re-evaluate their 
final cuts, and in some cases, keep a younger and cheaper player instead of a 
veteran to maintain operating room under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos announced recently, that because of Maddox's $850,000 salary and 
salary-cap considerations, they would release him before Sunday's final cut to 
53 if unable to deal him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a trade falls through, we'd have to let Tommy go in the final cut," Bronco 
Coach Wade Phillips said. "One way or the other, Tommy will either be traded or 
that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals, based on last season's results, would have the first opportunity 
to claim Maddox if the Broncos place him on waivers. The Rams stand fifth on 
the list to claim Maddox, which forces them to trade if they are interested in 
acquiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was for a No. 1 draft pick, then that would be something else," Zygmunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox got limited playing time in four of Denver's five exhibition games this 
season, completing 29 of 42 passes for 386 yards with three touchdowns and no 
interceptions. He didn't play Thursday night in the Broncos' 30-21 victory over 
the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 His best game was against Atlanta Aug. 6, when he replaced John Elway late in 
the first quarter and completed 18 of 28 passes for 291 yards and two 
touchdowns.

IT COMES DOWN TO 1 GAME; LITTLE LEAGUE: GENTILE TO START FOR NORTHRIDGE AGAINST 
VENEZUELA FOR WORLD SERIES TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Distractions were at a peak for Northridge Little Leaguers as the U.S. 
champion team began practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A horde of television cameras and reporters greeted the players, who responded 
nonchalantly and began stretching and playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the workout, Manager Larry Baca gathered the players at the 
pitcher's mound and reminded them that this practice was indeed special. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us it would be our last workout together, and to enjoy it fully," 
said Spencer Gordon, the team's right fielder. "Then he thanked us for putting 
in so much work." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will face Maracaibo, Venezuela, today at 12:40 p.m. PDT for the 
World Series championship. The game will be televised live on Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking time to thank the players was typical of Baca and his assistant, George 
Saul. The men have been close friends for years, meeting in the National Guard 
in the 1960s. They have coached Little League and American Legion teams 
together for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They are appreciated by the players and parents for their low-key approach. 
The spotlight has consistently been on the players, which is precisely how Baca 
and Saul want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have done all the work," Baca said. "Not a single player missed a 
single practice this entire all-star season. That's pretty amazing. I'd tell 
them to get to practice early to stretch, and you know what, they were all 
there before I was every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication paid off. Northridge (20-1) defeated Springfield, Va., on 
one-hit shutouts Wednesday and Thursday to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela, however, will offer Northridge its most severe test. The team is 
4-0 in Series play and defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 10-1, Thursday for the 
international championship, hitting four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hidalgo, a right-hander who throws harder than any pitcher Northridge 
has faced, most likely will start. In a 4-1 victory over Chinese Taipei on 
Tuesday, Hidalgo struck out the first 12 batters and finished with 15 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him pitch, I said there's no way he's 12 years old," said Matt 
Cassel, the Northridge first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same could be said of Northridge pitchers Nathaniel Dunlap and Peter 
Tuber, tall boys with live arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of them will start today, however. Although Baca said Tuber would 
start, he changed his mind Friday and selected right-hander Justin Gentile, who 
defeated Virginia on a one-hitter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge parents and players have speculated all week about whether the 
Venezuelan players are of legal age. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League has cracked down on violations since the Philippine team was 
stripped of its World Series championship in 1992 after it was revealed that 
players were over-age and lived outside league boundaries. Verification is 
still left to local districts, but Little League Headquarters has provided 
stronger enforcement, disqualifying several teams from the Far East as well as 
the team from the Dominican Republic last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, short of creating an investigative team, Little League cannot be sure 
all of its rules are followed.

WEEKDAY PIGSKIN DATE IS REASON FOR WEAK RESPONSE, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Fresno State and Ohio State meet at the Disneyland Pigskin Classic Monday 
night, a crowd of 30,000 is expected, said Orange County Sports Assn. Executive 
Director Don Andersen, whose group promotes the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed that our attendance will be on the low side," Andersen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Angels were scheduled to play a three-game series against the 
Cleveland Indians this weekend at Anaheim Stadium, the Pigskin Classic had to 
scheduled on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we had the game on the weekend, we probably could have sold 20,000 more 
tickets," Andersen said. "So, yeah it's frustrating; to the tune of about 
$600,000." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fresno State agreed to play in the Pigskin Classic, Andersen said Coach 
Jim Sweeney thought the Bulldogs could bring more than 30,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fresno brought 26,000 fans down when they beat USC in the 1992 Freedom Bowl," 
Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fresno State ticket office, which has sold 7,500 tickets for Monday's 
game, estimated that 10,000 Bulldog fans will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest stumbling block is that the game is on a Monday," said Dave 
Haglund, Fresno State's associate sports information director. "Most people 
can't afford to take the two days off of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The four Pigskin Classic games have averaged 39,093 spectators. The game has 
featured high-profile programs including Florida State and Colorado, which won 
a national championship the season it played in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, a USC-North Carolina match-up drew the Pigskin Classic's largest 
crowd, 49,309. Anaheim Stadium's capacity is 69,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "In four years, all eight teams we've had in the game have gone on to bowl 
games," Andersen said. "The quality of the teams has never been a question." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's five-year contract to sponsor the game expires after Monday's 
game. Andersen said an announcement will be made after the game regarding the 
status of the contract. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

 "The Earthquake Kids" makes a clever slogan for T- shirts. Wouldn't it make a 
snappy title for a movie as well? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Evans/de la Torre Productions is asking, and the folks being asked 
are the parents of Northridge players. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gordon, father of right fielder Spencer Gordon, received a proposal for 
either a feature or television movie from Evans/de la Torre, which produced 
"Sandlot," a feature film about youth baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, an attorney, did not want to divulge details about the offer until he 
had discussed it with the other parents, but he said it was for "six figures." 
</P>
<P>
 "They think that with the earthquake aspect, this can make a good movie," 
Gordon said. 
</P>

 Worthless: Northridge players arrived at practice Friday to find a rack of new 
bats waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bats are a full 10 ounces lighter than their length in inches. They are 
made by Worth and a marketing representative of the company was present at 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Once their novelty wore off, however, the players wanted no part of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make a weird sound and they have no pop," catcher Matt Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Saul was pleased to see his players ignore the bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be changing bats at this point. We have to stick with what got us 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hand in glove: Other sporting goods companies apparently have been allowed by 
Little League to give equipment to players. Mizuno doled out shoes and batting 
gloves, and some players collected more than their share. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cassel, the Northridge first baseman, had a large stack of batting gloves 
in his equipment bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had enough for players on all the teams, but some of the teams have 
left, so we got theirs too," Cassel said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Tough at the top: Don Iadevaia became president of Northridge Little League 
two years ago because he is a tireless worker, spending every spring evening at 
the field and running weekly board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 His dedication is about to be tested even more severely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be crunch time when I get back to Northridge," said Iadevaia, 
an electrical contractor. "I really don't know what to expect, but I know this 
league will be getting a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "And our fall league registration begins next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Iadevaia is quickly learning to delegate. He has assigned other league 
officials to handle requests for interviews and appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The team turned down an offer by Disneyland to pick up the players from Los 
Angeles International Airport upon their arrival Sunday for a parade down Main 
Street at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The team accepted an offer to be picked up by limousine Monday at 5:30 a.m. at 
the Northridge field and taken to a radio station, where they will be on the 
air with Mayor Richard Riordan. STEVE HENSON

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: KENNEDY HIGH'S RECORD-SETTING 1,600-METER RELAY TEAM; 
GOLDEN COUGAR QUARTET LINKED FOREVER BY THEIR HISTORIC RUN; TRACK AND FIELD: 
MARK SET 13 YEARS AGO HAS WEATHERED TEST OF TIME. IT STILL RANKS SECOND ON THE 
ALL-TIME NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Denean Hill -- nee Howard -- can laugh about it now, but 13 years ago, she was 
deeply embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy High girls' 1,600-meter relay team had just set a national high 
school record of 3 minutes 37.71 seconds to win the 1981 State championship. 
But while teammates Ann Johnson, Kelley Cook Bell -- known then as Kelley Cook 
-- and Denean's sister, Tina, were basking in the adulation of the 
standing-room-only crowd of 14,250 at Cerritos College, Hill was apologizing 
for the advice she gave them minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept saying, 'Oh you guys, I am so sorry,' " Hill said this week from her 
Newhall home. "I felt like such an idiot. I remember telling them before the 
race, 'Look. Let's go out there and do our best, and try to win, but let's 
don't even think about the record. There's no way we can get it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most track experts would have agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy lowered the national high school record in the 1,600 relay twice in 
1980, but the Golden Cougars' fastest runner, Sherri Howard, had graduated in 
June before winning the 400 in the U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Without her, Kennedy appeared to lack the horsepower to break its national 
record of 3:37.98. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a chance at defending our state title," Hill said. "But I 
couldn't see how we were going to be able to compensate for the loss of someone 
with Sherri's talents." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy did so because Hill, Cook Bell and Tina Howard all improved their 
times from the previous year, and Johnson proved to be a solid addition to the 
group after being hampered by injuries early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong Manual Arts team also figured in the record equation. The Toilers led 
after the second and third legs before succumbing to Hill's blistering anchor 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy entered the meet with the fastest high school time in the nation at 
3:40.76. But Manual Arts was close behind at 3:41.07. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Howard ran a 54.2-second leg to give Kennedy a 10-meter lead at the first 
exchange, but Cook Bell's 57.4 carry left the Golden Cougars three to four 
meters in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's 55.3 leg left Kennedy seven to eight meters out of the lead, and 
Denean followed with a scorching 50.8 anchor. She caught Manual Arts' Carla 
Johnson coming out of the first turn and pulled away to victory. The Toilers 
finished second in 3:39.07. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denean went after her like a Tiger going after its prey," said Eugene Howard, 
who coached his daughters throughout their careers. "I remember when (Denean) 
got the baton, I didn't think we had a chance at getting the record because 
she'd have to run a (sub-51 second) leg. But that's what she did." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory helped defending champion Kennedy finish second behind Berkeley in 
the team standings and soothed the disappointment of a botched pass in the 400 
relay at the start of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 During a memorable two-day meet in which five national high school records 
were set, Tina finished second in the 400 in a then-personal best of 54.38 and 
Denean placed second in the 100 (11.83) and won the 200 (23.73) before they 
teamed with Cook Bell and Johnson in the 1,600 relay, the final girls' event of 
the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls really dug down deep that night," Eugene Howard said. "They shocked 
me with that time. When I saw how fast they had run, it really got me going. I 
was just so proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been 13 years since that record-breaking performance, the mark 
by that Kennedy foursome has weathered the test of time well. It still ranks 
second on the all-time national high school list behind Pasadena Muir's 3:37.69 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, there have been plenty of alterations in the lives of the 
athletes who produced the record. 
</P>
<P>
 One never ran after high school, another had her collegiate career cut short 
by injury and a third hung up her spikes after graduating from college. And 
then there's Denean, who has been a member of four U.S. Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, they have been married, given birth, moved out of state and 
entered business. But they'll always be linked by their record run nearly half 
a lifetime ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Howard, who ran the first leg on the record relay, always seemed 
overshadowed by members of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Tina finished third in the 400 in the City Section championships, but 
a few weeks later Sherri and Denean placed first and third in the Olympic 
trials in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina improved to second in the state as a senior in 1981, but that was the 
year that Denean won the first of three consecutive 400 titles in The Athletics 
Congress championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The large shadows cast by her sisters didn't bother Tina as she continued to 
compete with them at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She lowered her personal best to 54.34 in college, but she left track behind 
after graduating with a degree in business administration in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, running through college was enough," Tina said. "I never intended to 
run after that. By the time I graduated, I was ready to get my career started." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina, who is engaged, has worked as an assistant at the Center of Health 
Resources in Los Angeles for the past two years, and would eventually like to 
open her own business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another goal that I've set for myself," she said. "We were always 
setting goals for ourselves in high school and working toward them and I'm 
still doing that now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kelley Cook Bell enrolled at Kennedy High as a promising 800-meter runner in 
the fall of 1979, but when the 1980 track season began, she had earned a spot 
on the Golden Cougars' 1,600 relay team that included Sherri, Tina and Denean 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 That trio had combined with older sister Artra to set a national high school 
record of 3:44.1 in the mile relay in the 1979 State championships for San 
Gorgonio High in San Bernardino. And the media attention on "California's First 
Family of Track" heated up after the Howards moved to Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kennedy set a then-national record of 3:39.62 in the 1,600 relay in the 
1980 City championships, broadcaster Jim Hill, working then for KNX-TV, was on 
the scene to interview the record-setters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the slowest runner on the team, Cook Bell could have developed an 
inferiority complex, but the Howards made her feel like part of the family from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew that it didn't matter how fast I ran, as long as I gave 150% 
every time I stepped on the track," she said. "That's all they asked of me and 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her ease around the Howards, Cook Bell realized she was fortunate to 
be running with such a talented trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times I think that I was just happy to be there," she said. "Running with 
the Howards was a once-in-a-lifetime thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cook Bell no longer lives in the state, the closeness that developed 
among the four runners in high school has lasted through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 They still keep in touch and whenever Cook Bell visits her parents in Granada 
Hills, they get together. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook Bell, who ran 2:15 in the 800 in high school, placed fifth or better in 
three consecutive City finals before lowering her best to 2:13 at Valley 
College in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 She transferred to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the fall of that year, but 
never ran a "serious" 800 again. Then-Mustang Coach Lance Harter used her 
primarily in the 400 and in the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 She lowered her personal best to 54.6 in the one-lap event before suffering 
torn ligaments in her left knee in 1987 while playing soccer for the school's 
club team. 
</P>
<P>
 That year had its positives, however. She met Dan Bell, a member of the 
school's rodeo team, and the two were married four years later and eventually 
moved to Dan's hometown in Paradise Valley, Nev., population 150. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to live in a town where you didn't have to lock your doors at 
night," she said. "It's a different type of lifestyle from where I grew up, but 
the quality of life is great for raising a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook Bell, who has an 18-month-old son named Shane, has been the boys' track 
coach at Lowry High in Winnemucca since 1992, and was recently hired as a 
coordinator at a fitness center in that town. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Dan also run a hay-baling business and own 50% of the Paradise Saloon 
and Mercantile Co. 
</P>
<P>
 r Cook Bell has kept a low profile about her athletic accomplishments since 
moving to Paradise Valley, but they became public knowledge earlier this week 
when a photographer from the local newspaper shot photos of her for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really making a big deal out of it," she said with an embarrassed 
laugh. "It's not like I go around talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Johnson is the mystery woman of Kennedy's record-setters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hill and Howard have stayed in touch with Cook Bell over the years, 
none knows the whereabouts of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Kennedy in 1982, Johnson was expected to run for Valley 
College during the 1983 season, but she never came out for the Monarch team. 
</P>
<P>
 James Harvey, an assistant coach at Antelope Valley College and a long-time 
coach at Valley, said Johnson was a "very good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember talking to her about running for Valley, but she never made it out 
there," Harvey said. "I'm not sure what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Howard, who said he saw Johnson and her parents at a meet five or six 
years ago at Cerritos College, said that Johnson originally planned to run 
track in college, but instead decided to work full-time to help out her family. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where Johnson might be, Hill has not forgotten her contribution to 
that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ann ran the race of her life," Hill said. "We couldn't have set the record 
without her. . . . But when she held her own on that leg, I knew we had a 
chance at winning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Denean Hill has had to live up to some grand expectations since placing third 
in the 1980 Olympic trials at the age of 15, but she has managed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 She won five state high school titles for Kennedy. And though slowed by 
injuries at Cal State L.A., she has ranked among the top 10 sprinters in the 
400 in the country nine times during her career, and qualified for four Olympic 
and two World Championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Olympic dreams turned sour in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter ordered the 
U.S. team to boycott the Games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion 
of Afghanistan. But she earned a gold medal as a member of the American 
1,600-relay team in the 1984 Games that were marred by the Soviet-led Eastern 
European boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who is married to WBA light-heavyweight champion Virgil Hill, had the 
best year of her career in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished sixth in the 400 in the Olympics -- after running a personal best 
of 49.87 in a semifinal -- and ran the first leg on the team that finished 
second with a national record of 3:15.51. 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting out 1989 to give birth to Virgil Jr., Hill missed the 1990 and 
'91 seasons because of a knee injury. She placed fifth in the 400 in the 1992 
Olympic trials and earned another silver medal in the 1,600 relay in the Games 
of Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill gave birth to her daughter Alaysia last November and has been gradually 
working herself back into shape this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she plans to race again next year and take a shot at qualifying for 
her fifth Olympic team in 1996, the 1981 State championships always will hold a 
special spot for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (national record in the 1,600 relay) is still the most-surprising 
performance of my career," Hill said. "I've run some better times in some 
bigger meets since, but I've never been more pleasantly surprised."

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; KLOEK SAW FIT TO FIX HIS ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Never underestimate the benefits of a little arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kloek pitched for El Paso in the double-A Texas League with a fragile 
arm last season, and he finally gave in to the pain late in the year, ending 
his season with a 4.11 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Cal State Northridge pitcher underwent arthroscopic surgery on his 
right shoulder in September and returned to his El Paso teammates in July with 
a new arm. In his first seven starts, he was 4-0 with a 3.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much difference as far as the style of pitching," said Rob 
Dirksen, El Paso's pitching coach the past two seasons, "but I feel he is 
pitching with more confidence knowing that he has a healthy arm. He's not 
trying to overcompensate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year he was trying to hide from a sore arm, trying to conceal it, but 
now he feels healthy and you can see it in his face. He's not grimacing when he 
throws the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Kloek, 24, was a fourth-round pick of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1992 and he 
breezed through his first summer at Class-A Beloit, Wis., with a 10-1 record 
and 2.11 ERA. But when he began to struggle last season at El Paso, something 
seemed wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It slowly built up and got worse," Kloek said. "I had felt the same thing 
before in college, but working out and lifting made it just go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kloek had an impingement in his shoulder, meaning muscles and other soft 
tissue in the shoulder were pinched together. It is one of the most common 
injuries to pitchers and it usually is a result of overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After the surgery in September, Kloek went home to Santa Barbara for 
rehabilitation.  
</P>
<P>
 He was ready to pitch again by June, when he reported to the Brewers' 
rookie-league team in Chandler, Ariz. After a few starts, he was promoted to El 
Paso, where he has been throwing about 100 pitches per start. Dirksen has been 
pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin is a very good, mature pitcher," Dirksen said. "He knows what he's 
doing on the mound. He knows what he has to do to win with his abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swing-less in San Jose: Jacob Cruz (Channel Islands) has had a 
much-too-leisurely summer in the California League. After 21 games, he learned 
he had a stress fracture in his left elbow and has spent the last month 
helplessly watching San Jose Giant games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being with the team," Cruz said, "but now it is really bothering me 
that I'm not in the lineup, not playing, not doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz started swinging a bat this week. He had been traveling with the team, 
although he couldn't take batting practice or take infield or play pepper or 
even play catch, much less play in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 A supplemental first-round pick of the San Francisco Giants in June, Cruz 
signed in early July and was hitting .253 at Class-A San Jose when he finally 
went to the team trainer about the mysterious pain in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what it was," he said. "I just thought it was a normal 
soreness." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz said he hopes to be able to play this week or in time for the playoffs, 
which begin the week of Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving up: At first, Keith Smith was overmatched in professional baseball. But 
that didn't last long. Smith (Newbury Park) improved his hitting so much during 
the past month that he was promoted from rookie-level Bristol, Va., to Class-A 
Fayetteville, N.C.. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good arm. He can run. We are very impressed with him," said David 
Miller, Detroit Tiger director of minor-league operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the leading high school passer in California history, was raw as a 
baseball player when the Tigers drafted him in the fifth round in June. And it 
showed when he struggled to reach .200 in his first month at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith adjusted and raised his average to .263 through Monday. He was 
promoted Tuesday and was two for five in his debut in the South Atlantic 
League. Smith will play the final two weeks of the season at Fayetteville, then 
report to the Tigers' fall Instructional League camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's improved," Miller said. "When they are improving like that, you 
like to keep them going from one step to the next." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving down: In spring training, the Seattle Mariners were so high on relief 
pitcher Craig Clayton that they figured he would be in the major leagues soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's in Class A. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton (Cal State Northridge), a converted third baseman, started the season 
at double-A Jacksonville, Fla., but he was injured, then pitched badly and was 
shipped down to Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been inconsistent," said Jim Beattie, Seattle's farm director. "Things 
came so naturally last year and now that he's been struggling, things have 
gotten away from him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners haven't given up on Clayton, who is 1-1, with a 6.48 ERA in 25 
innings at Riverside. They will send him to the Instructional League this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Brian Harrison (Ventura College) asked for and was granted his 
release by the independent San Bernardino Spirit on Aug. 17. Harrison, who was 
5-1 with a 3.86 ERA, would have been unable to pitch again this season anyway 
because he needed surgery to remove bone spurs in his elbow. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Ray Young (Moorpark College) was released twice this season. The 
Florida Marlins released him from triple-A Edmonton in late July, after the 
Oakland A's released him from triple-A Tacoma. He finished 1-3 with a 6.68 ERA.

 Dave Landaker (Royal) will not be making his third consecutive appearance in 
the Houston Astros' Instructional League. The Astros canceled their 
Instructional League, reportedly to save money lost because of the players' 
strike. Other teams to scrap their fall leagues because of the strike are 
Boston, Kansas City, Minnesota, Texas, Houston, Pittsburgh, San Diego and 
Cincinnati.

ANGELS; FLORA AGREES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ARIZONA FALL LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Second baseman Kevin Flora, in an attempt to revitalize his career, has agreed 
to play in the Arizona Fall League and will report Sept. 30 to the Tempe 
Rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin's really excited about coming," said Bill Moore, Flora's agent. "His 
attitude is totally different now." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, projected to be the Angels' everyday second baseman this season, 
rejected the club's invitation to play in the fall league last winter while 
continuing to mourn his wife, who died April 22, 1993. Flora began this season 
with triple-A Vancouver, but took a two-month leave of absence in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora returned to the Angel organization in July, but has been hampered by 
tendinitis in his left knee. He has played only 12 games at Class A Lake 
Elsinore, and is batting .227 with three RBIs. He probably will complete the 
season at Lake Elsinore without returning to Vancouver, according to Ken 
Forsch, Angel farm director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're trying to make sure he's back in playing shape again," Forsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, according to a league official, also have decided to send at least 
four other players to the Arizona Fall League: Double-A Midland shortstop Tim 
Harkrider (.268, no homers, 48 RBIs) and triple-A pitchers Mark Holzemer (4-10, 
6.79 earned-run average), Ken Edenfield (9-4, 3.61 ERA) and Jeff Schmidt (1-5, 
4.25 ERA). Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are continuing contract negotiations with designated hitter Chili 
Davis during the strike, but an agreement is not expected before October. Davis 
is seeking a three-year contract, according to sources, while the Angels' 
preliminary proposal was for one year and an option for the 1996 season. . . . 
There have been more home runs hit at Anaheim Stadium this season (167) than 
any other stadium in the major leagues, according to Stats Inc. The 93 homers 
yielded by the Angel staff at Anaheim Stadium also is the most by any team at 
their home stadium. . . . The Angels will have at least three, and perhaps four 
farm teams in the playoffs in September. . . . The Angels rank eighth in the 
major leagues in games played by first-round draft picks since 1980, trailing 
only the Chicago White Sox (2,928), Milwaukee Brewers (2,800) and Seattle 
Mariners (2,294) in the American League.

<P>
 As expected, officials from the City of Palmdale on Friday signed a letter of 
intent with the Golden State League of Professional Baseball, opening the door 
for detailed negotiations that could ultimately land the region a minor-league 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement, the city will provide 25 acres of land and 
utilities in exchange for a $5-million stadium, to be constructed at league 
expense.The independent league, which has no major league affiliation, hopes to 
begin play in six California cities by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the city will now begin drawing up contractual 
documents outlining specifics of the land-exchange deal. 
</P>
<P>
 League President Bob Weinstein, a 51-year-old Chatsworth investment banker, 
has 90 days to demonstrate the league has $50 million its coffers. Most of the 
league bankroll is earmarked for new stadiums, to be constructed in each of its 
host cities. STEVE ELLING

YOEST STILL SHOOTING FOR NBA CAREER; BASKETBALL: FORMER CRESPI AND LOYOLA 
MARYMOUNT STANDOUT HAS BOUNCED BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE CBA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mike Yoest graduated from Loyola Marymount in 1988 his goal was to play 
pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter where, he just wanted to play. Working on the court beat any 
9-to-5 job he could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 He had solid if not spectacular credentials. As a senior, he started 32 games 
for Loyola, which had a 25-game winning streak and finished the season ranked 
15th in the nation. He averaged 17.6 points and 7.9 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Yoest, the Loyola coaching staff had connections in Sweden. So 
when he was offered the opportunity to play there, the former Crespi High 
standout didn't hesitate. He spent only one season in Sweden, but his pro 
career had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I learned in Sweden is that I don't like cold weather," he 
said. "But I needed to see what I could make of the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Yoest, a 6-foot-7 forward, has spent five seasons bouncing between 
Europe and the Continental Basketball Assn. with hopes of eventually cracking 
the NBA. Yoest, who earned a degree in marketing, lives with his parents in 
Chatsworth during the off-season and has supported himself on low CBA wages and 
occasional acting work in commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played for CBA teams in San Jose and Bakersfield, and his European 
stops include Sweden and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season was his best in Europe. He averaged 25 points and 3.5 steals a 
game for Zitoira de Setubal in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 But an NBA job remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just once I'd like to get there and have a taste of it," Yoest said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has come close to satisfying his appetite. The Golden State Warriors and 
Sacramento Kings invited him to camp as a free agent in 1988. He tried out for 
both teams, but was cut. Yoest also was cut by Sacramento in 1990. Still, he 
considers the experience invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play well enough to impress anyone, but it was still a great thing 
for my career in Europe. I learned what it took to stay on my game and what 
they look for in the pros," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Westhead, who coached Yoest at Loyola, said his former player is just a 
bounce pass away from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Yoest has missed being an NBA player by maybe 5%," said Westhead, a 
former coach of the Lakers who now coaches at George Mason University. "He's a 
guy who can run, jump, shoot and do everything. It's a shame he hasn't made it 
yet. He's the kind of guy any coach would love to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest's career nearly ended before he left the 11th grade at Crespi. In a 
tournament game, he suffered a fractured tibia and sat out the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am in my junior season and I get hurt. That left only one year for me 
to earn a scholarship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, Yoest lead the Celts into the second round of the Southern 
Section playoffs, averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loyola, Yoest teamed with Bo Kimble, Hank Gathers and Corey Gaines in the 
1987-88 season to give the school perhaps its best team. The Lions advanced to 
the second round of the NCAA tournament before losing to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest played one of his best college games during the tournament. In the first 
round against Wyoming at Salt Lake City, he scored 25 points, converting 15 of 
17 foul shots during a 119-115 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest's first CBA experience was short. He was drafted by the Rockford 
Lightning in 1988, but his rights were traded to Albany before the season 
started. George Karl, current Seattle SuperSonics coach, cut Yoest at Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a guy hoping to get a pro career I wasn't doing too well," Yoest said. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed with the CBA's San Jose Jammers in 1990-1991. Like most players in 
the CBA, he earned around $3,500 a month for a six-month season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the pay, the CBA is like the NBA. You play four games a week and 
go on 10-day road trips," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest recorded the first triple-double in Jammers' franchise history. But the 
team history is a short one. The franchise relocated to Bakersfield in 1991. 
Soon after, it folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to retreat home, Yoest decided to audition for commercials. His brother 
Steve already had been to a few tryouts. Yoest went to casting calls for LA 
Gear and Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both companies called and made me offers. I was kind of floored by it," Yoest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After careful consideration he decided to go with Reebok. The company was 
making its "Dan and Dave" commercials, which focused on decathletes Dan O'Brien 
and Dave Johnson and figured to be prominent during the 1992 Olympics. But the 
commercials were scrapped when O'Brien failed to qualify for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy not making the Olympics cost me a lot of money," Yoest said. "But 
probably not as much money as it did Reebok." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest landed a position in Portugal at midseason and has played there the past 
three years. He is uncertain about returning to Portugal for a another season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in Europe creates problems," Yoest said. "There is a new language to 
learn, the culture is different and you get homesick. You're always out of 
touch with back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest was in Portugal in 1990 when he received a phone call at 4 a.m. His 
college roommate, Gathers, had collapsed and died from heart failure in a 
basketball game at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got that call I didn't believe it at first," Yoest said. "Then you 
realize there's nothing you can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank and I were good friends but I couldn't make it back for the funeral 
because of the season," Yoest said. "When things like that happen, you feel 
helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoest is entertaining ideas of trying out for a new CBA team in Hartford. Paul 
Mokeski, a former NBA player with the Milwaukee Bucks and a Crespi graduate, is 
slated to be the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't given up on any more NBA tryouts but I'm also being realistic," 
Yoest said. "I'm not upset about how my career has gone. After all, how many 
people out there wouldn't want to switch places with me? 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself lucky. And besides, why give up the dream?"

CANO DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES AT UCI; COLLEGES: NEW ANTEATER SOCCER DIRECTOR 
DOESN'T MIND GETTING A LITTLE DIRTY TO BOOST HIS PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marine Cano knew he would be wearing a lot of hats when he took the job as 
director of soccer/head women's coach at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, maybe he didn't think a painter's cap would be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano has been running six hours of two-a-day practices with the women's team, 
staying atop progress on the men's team, putting on clinics for youth groups, 
speaking to every Rotary Club that will listen, recruiting, scheduling, 
planning strategy and lugging paint around. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano and a friend are spray painting a royal Anteater blue over the green 
outfield fence at the former baseball stadium that UCI soccer calls home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to look great after we finish and put a big Anteater and some of 
our sponsors' logos up there," he said, stepping back to survey the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never consider this kind of thing beneath me. It's all part of what 
we're trying to do here. Everything is for the program, for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the busiest time of my life, but it's also been very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano coached men's and women's soccer at Cal State Dominguez Hills for nine 
years before accepting the Anteater job last December. And he arrived in Irvine 
with the attitude that he would give all he had and hope for a few drops of 
support in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job here is not to take, but to give," he said. "Hopefully, all the 
speaking engagements and clinics help make friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get a lot of people out here to the games. I want this place to be 
a festival of soccer for the community, from newcomers to the game to soccer 
purists who want to come here to see a good game and a bona fide program." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano seems to have the personality to make it at Irvine, where sports programs 
survive on a coach's wit and wile as much as won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raiser? He's a tireless, self-appointed ambassador of soccer good will. 
Enthusiastic? His license plate: MR SOCCR. Self-starter? Well, nobody told him 
to paint the fence. Motivator? Does decibel level count? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real yeller," said Tracy Ann Manz, a freshman forward who was the 
Pacific Coast League most valuable player at Estancia, "which is good because I 
need to be yelled at sometimes. I need to be pushed a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, who also has coached at El Camino College, UCLA and Cal and is director 
of a nationwide program -- Marine Cano's Mr. Soccer Schools -- seems to have a 
pretty good handle on how to handle different players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motivational styles (of Cano and former Coach Ray Smith) are very 
different," said Shawna Berke, Irvine's all-time scoring leader. "I think Cano 
will do a lot for my confidence level. He's more of an individual motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggle with my confidence every year. There's always a point where I get 
down on myself and I think he's really going to be able to help me. He's a 
really good communicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, a former goalkeeper on the U.S. national team, is clearly confident in 
his favored style of play -- an aggressive, counter-attacking approach -- and 
he has the players believing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 He has moved Berke, a senior, from an outside midfielder, a position she has 
played for more than seven years, to an inside midfielder spot and let her know 
that she's expected to be more vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's challenged me and put more pressure on me," Berke said. "I'm going to be 
involved in almost every play." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cano stresses offense, any idea that high-scoring high jinx would take 
the place of defensive fundamentals has already been quashed. So far, the 
Anteaters have been working extensively on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Muzzinigro, a senior mid-fielder who is a co-captain with Berke, is 
impressed with Cano's style, his strategy and his ability to implement that 
strategy. "The adjustments have been pretty smooth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muzzinigro, a soft-spoken girl next door off the field and a fierce competitor 
with a collection of yellow cards to prove it on the field, is Cano's idea of a 
role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was playing as a youngster, I remember a coach telling me that soccer 
is a man's game," Cano said. "Well, in this case, it's a woman's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go after teams. We're not going to sit back and wait. We won't 
play dirty but we will be very, very tough. We'll tackle. We'll win balls in 
the air. We'll be diving head-first to score goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his worker-bee schedule, Cano still suffers pangs of soccer withdrawal 
after the high of the World Cup. Two-a-day practices have been soothing, but 
he'll be completely cured when the season begins next weekend. Coach Derek 
Lawther's men's team debuts at 4 next Saturday against Gonzaga in the new-blue 
Anteater Stadium. Cano's women's team plays host to Cal State Hayward at 1 p.m. 
Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup gave a lot of people an injection of soccer adrenaline," Cano 
said, "and hopefully we can keep it going. Southern California is the hotbed of 
women's soccer. Five players on the national team are from here. Everybody 
recruits here. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal as a coach for our players is to beat someone very good this year. A 
good record is one thing, but proving that you can beat someone in the top five 
or six is getting there. We'll probably have at least three chances to do that 
this season, with Portland, Washington and Cal (Sept. 9 in Berkeley)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine women were 12-8 last year, only the second time in their 10-year 
history they have managed a winning record. But they lost only one starter from 
last season's team and Cano, the quintessential optimist, is brimming with 
positives these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking this job was the best decision I ever made," he said. "I love 
challenges. I guess that goes back to my playing days. I always played best 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I really enjoy it here. It's an atmosphere I've longed for as head coach. 
The place is beautiful and the players are very keen on doing something, for 
themselves as individuals -- and that's OK -- and for themselves as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to get them ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that and painting the fence.

UTAH STATE RECRUIT FROM KENNEDY RULED INELIGIBLE BY NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wesley Morris, a standout wide receiver and defensive back at Kennedy High who 
was signed by Utah State, may have become one of the first persons affected by 
the newly formed NCAA Clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' scholarship was revoked after it was discovered by the Clearinghouse 
that he was ineligible, even though he was told by school officials in March 
that he had met NCAA requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clearinghouse was formed to provide a standardized review of eligibility 
for NCAA athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Morris' third performance on the ACT, a test in which his high 
school coach said Morris scored a 16.5, which rounds up to the NCAA minimum of 
17. According to former Utah State assistant coach Dewayne Walker, and under 
the assurance of academic adviser Don Ross, Walker told Morris he had met the 
eligibility requirements and was offered a full scholarship, which Morris 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris reported to the Logan campus Aug. 9 and took part in practices until he 
was asked to leave the field by school administrators after being notified of 
his ineligibility. Morris left the campus on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each week, we're given a review by the Clearinghouse," Utah State sports 
information director John Lewandowski said. "When we received a notification 
there was a problem with the test scores, we withheld him from practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be the average of those scores, not the best of the test scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' average of the three scores was 16.25, which does not round up to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way it was explained to us," said Kennedy football Coach Mitch 
Olson, who monitored the recruiting process. "Either way, employees of that 
school made the student miss three opportunities to pass that test. They 
guaranteed us that he had passed. . . . The bottom line is they messed up; 
they're covering their (tracks) any way they can." 
</P>
<P>
 After Walker told him he had met NCAA requirements, Morris canceled other 
scheduled tests in which he could have increased his score and instead 
concentrated on his core classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker has since become the defensive backs coach at Brigham Young; Ross is 
now at Dayton. Walker, who offered the scholarship, was not aware of Morris' 
situation until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left (Utah State in March) with the understanding that his test scores were 
fine, and now I'm hearing this," Walker said. "It's ridiculous. Obviously (Utah 
State) wouldn't have brought him up there if everything wasn't legit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, somebody did a miscalculation; you let the kid practice for a week 
and all of a sudden you find out the kid is short and you had all the way from 
March until now (to figure it out)? It's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lewandowski explained the differences between the old system, in which 
universities were responsible for determining an athlete's eligibility, and 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Ross and Dewayne Walker aren't the final say in this thing, unlike in the 
past, when maybe the school registrar made the decision," Lewandowski said. 
"Now it's in the NCAA Clearinghouse and it's cut and dry -- either you're 
eligible or you're not. In the past, maybe there was a little leeway. . . but 
that's not the case now."

 Morris, an all-Garden Grove League player, has enrolled at Golden West 
College. Because he hasn't met the SAT or ACT requirements, if he earns a 
scholarship to a four-year school, he can't leave Golden West after his third 
semester for spring practices.

BROWN QUITS AS WOODBRIDGE BASEBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vince Brown said he has resigned as Woodbridge baseball coach after failing to 
secure a full-time teaching job in the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 34, quit Tuesday after two seasons at Woodbridge, where he was a 
walk-on coach.A full-time middle school teacher in the Tustin Unified School 
District, Brown could not land a position in Irvine. His job in Tustin prevents 
him from devoting enough time to coaching baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made every attempt to get into the Irvine Unified School District," Brown 
said. "Though some people like the athletic director (Dave Cowen) acted 
surprised when I said earlier this summer I needed a full-time job, they knew. 
It's come to the point I've got to make a commitment to Tustin (school 
district). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad for the kids at Woodbridge. They worked hard over the summer and made 
a lot of strides . . . I don't like putting them in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowen was vacationing and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge was 11-16 last season under Brown and in a five-way tie for second 
place in the Sea View League. However, the Warriors failed to earn a Southern 
Section playoff berth. Two seasons ago, Brown led Woodbridge to a 20-4 mark and 
a share of the Sea View title with Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has a 173-67 mark overall, coached seven seasons at Tustin High, 
where he guided the Tillers to four consecutive Sea View titles and a Southern 
Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also is an assistant football coach at Chapman University. FORREST LEE

GOLF ROUNDUP; ROBERTS MAKES TRIPLE-BOGEY ON 18, LOSES LEAD IN AKRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's too early to say Loren Roberts blew it. And the field of tournament 
winners from the past year, including Nick Price and Greg Norman, is way too 
good for Roberts to suggest he ever felt in control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberts' triple-bogey on the 18th hole Friday dropped him from first to 
seventh place and tightened up the field in the World Series of Golf, setting 
the stage for a free-for-all on Firestone Country Club's North course this 
weekend in Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's looking like it's going to be a really good finish on Sunday," 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who shared the first-round lead with Craig Stadler at 5-under 65, had 
gone as far as nine shots under par until he put his second shot on No. 16 in 
the lake on the way to a bogey 6. 
</P>
<P>
 With that hole still weighing heavily on his mind, the par-4 18th turned into 
a nightmare. His drive carried over the lake but into the rough, forcing him to 
chip back onto the fairway. His 7-iron approach shot sailed over the green, and 
after chipping within 10 feet, he three-putted for a 7. 
</P>
<P>
 That left him at 5-under 135 after two rounds, giving the lead to the 
threesome of Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, Mark McCumber and Steve 
Lowery, all at 7-under 133. One shot back at 134 were Price, Norman and Ernie 
Els, while Roberts fell into another three-way tie at 135 with Hale Irwin and 
Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts was still in the lead when the national television coverage concluded 
for the day. He then walked away from the 18th green and spent some time on the 
putting green and driving range before settling down enough to speak with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to do anything I'd regret," he said. "I'm going to look at 
it like I had my bad round. I threw away four shots on the last three holes. 
But there's no way I would say I let a bunch of guys in the field, because it's 
only halfway through. Obviously Norman and Price are right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Price kept himself in contention with a 4-under 66, showing no ill effects 
from in-office surgery to remove three cancerous moles from his back Aug. 15, 
the day after he won the PGA Championship. Price, who also won this year's 
British Open, had the 12 stitches taken out Thursday morning, shortly before he 
shot a 68 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Dave Stockton, Tom Weiskopf and Jack Kiefer were tied for 
the first-round lead at the Franklin Quest Championship, a senior tournament 
which got under way in Park City, Utah, despite Bert Yancey's fatal heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who set a scoring record of 199 in last year's tournament, Weiskopf 
and Kiefer shot four-under-par 68s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Murphy, Jay Siegel, and Charles Coody were at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy King, who is one victory away from qualifying for the LPGA Hall of Fame, 
shot a three-under-par 69 for a share of the second-round lead at the du 
Maurier Classic in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 King is tied at eight-under 136 with Kelly Robbins (70) and Martha Nause (71). 
</P>
<P>
 Liselotte Neumann, who won the British and Swedish women's opens the last two 
weeks, shot a 67 to share the day's low round with Annika Sorenstam, Jane 
Geddes and Robin Walton.

PIANIST WALTER NORRIS IS TUNED TO BEST OF 2 WORLDS; JAZZ: THE RESPECTED 
KEYBOARDIST, WHO WILL PERFORM IN SEAL BEACH, INCLUDES CLASSICALLY INSPIRED 
SOUNDS IN HIS MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can tell a lot about Walter Norris, the man, from his piano playing. The 
respected keyboardist, who works with bassist Putter Smith on Sunday and 
Tuesday at Spaghettini in Seal Beach, takes an expansive approach at his 
instrument that's intelligent, warm and serious while it blends jazz and 
classical traditions into a seamless whole. 
</P>
<P>
 As he performs, detailed, technically difficult passages give way to bits of 
clear and simple beauty. Delicate phrases are buttressed with substantial 
chordal support. Blue moments give way to resounding joy. And a sense of humor 
is revealed when he drops a bit of an old standard into a lengthy 
improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Norris is equally expansive. He recalls his first musical 
experiences observing the church organist in his native Little Rock, Ark., with 
the same ease as he does giving a recent concert in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 He's willing to speculate on why his old friend saxophonist Ornette Coleman 
(Norris pronounces the name " Ar -nette") never again used a piano in his band 
after including Norris on his groundbreaking 1958 recording "Something Else!." 
He gives honest answers to questions that might put more self-centered artists 
off. And he's not above having a good laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Take for example, what he says about playing the sometimes less-than-perfect 
instruments he finds on obscure and the not-so-obscure engagements when 
visiting this country (Norris has lived in Berlin, Germany, since 1977). 
</P>
<P>
 "One can be very depressed and irritated and violently angry (playing an 
untuned piano), but I don't see it that way. . . . If it's a lovely 
(instrument) with a beautiful sound that responds well, I can express myself in 
a better way. If it's a bad, beat-up instrument with weak hammers and dirty 
strings and a half-dead sound, then I have to use much more pressure to get 
what I want from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often there'll be an out-of-tune note that twangs horribly, a note that would 
cause other pianists to screw up their faces in irritation when they play. But 
it's much better to play that twangy note as if it were a beautiful note. The 
audience may hear that it is sour, but they will be taken by the effect, 
visually and audibly. It will come out beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everything Norris has played -- including work with Coleman, 
saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Stan Getz, trombonist Kai Winding and a long 
stint with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra as well as a handful of fine 
albums under his own name -- has come out beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris was born in Little Rock in 1931. When it came time to choose which 
music capital in which to try to establish his playing career, he chose Los 
Angeles over New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two reasons. The first was because Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker 
were working here. The second is because I thought it had a healthier climate 
at that time (1954) than New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets very personal. In New York in the late '40s and early '50s you 
nearly had to be addicted (to heroin) to get into playing the jazz clubs. This 
is a hard, cold fact. But I wasn't (a drug user). . . . I had too much respect 
for the talent I had and wasn't going to abuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 He found favor among the Los Angeles jazz community and eventually became the 
house pianist at Haig and Tiffany's clubs, where he worked with the likes of 
saxophonists Zoot Sims, Teddy Edwards, Sonny Criss and trumpeter Jack Sheldon. 
He spent time touring with the Shorty Rogers-Bill Holman Quintet. And it was 
here that he made one of his best-remembered associations; a friendship with 
eclectic saxophonist Ornette Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first heard him at a jam session at the Haig just after I got into town, 
and later I was working a session gig and he came in and played. He was 
serious. We had a nice rapport. So he called me in 1958 for his recording 
session that became 'Something Else!.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Norris has often joked about the fact that Coleman never again used a 
keyboardist in his bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I ruined it for all the other piano players, I don't know," he said, 
laughing. "I don't think he ever thought in terms of a well-tempered tuning, 
not that he was out of tune. But the fact is that the piano is tuned to exact 
notes. You can't make notes sound flat like you can on a violin or saxophone. 
And that's the way Ar -nette hears that music. My playing on the piano forced 
him, in a certain way, into harmonies that he would normally not play." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Coleman, Norris eventually left Los Angeles for New York in the '60s, 
where he worked the club scene and became the musical director for the local 
Playboy Club. 
</P>
<P>
 When pianist Roland Hanna left the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra in 1974, 
Norris took over, frequently touring Europe with the much-touted ensemble and 
playing its legendary Monday night slot at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich 
Village. He also served a short time in the late Charles Mingus' band. 
</P>
<P>
 An offer from the S.F.B. Radio Orchestra in then-West Berlin prompted his 
move, in 1977, to Germany. He began recording in Munich for the Enja label and 
later, for the Inner City label. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those dates, a 1978 session with Hungarian bassist Aladar Pege, released in 
this country as "Synchronicity," stands out both for its involved interplay and 
the Norris-composed vehicles for improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans have been raised to have more respect for music. It's their 
history and culture. You have to remember that it was just a short time ago, 
only a few hundred years, that Bach was playing there, Mozart was playing 
there. . . . So there's a very deep love and hunger for music in the German 
people. And I think that makes it a little better for jazz as well." 
</P>
<P>
 A classically influenced jazz pianist who received training both as a child 
and later, in New York, at the Manhattan School of Music, Norris says that 
inclusion of classically inspired sounds is a natural part of his 
improvisational process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've practiced classical music since the day I could see it. Working with 
music from a composer who's on the genius level, getting your fingers and mind 
involved with the language of a genius, that's a good education. I don't 
consciously take from classical music and insert fragments into my jazz 
playing. It's not that kind of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because I've been exposed to classical music, and it has an influence in 
whatever comes out in the improvisation, bubbling up from the subconscious," he 
said. "But I don't plan for it to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Norris doesn't like to think in terms of jazz and classical 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only use them when I'm trying to explain something. I think Debussy was a 
great genius and that his music evolutionized piano music, but had he lived 
today, he probably would have been an improviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had any of the classical composers been living in the States today with this 
melting pot environment of all the races, with a dominating element of 
black-African influence, I think they all would have been into jazz. I think 
Art Tatum was one of the greatest piano players ever, no category involved. I'm 
sure if Chopin had heard (Tatum's) Decca recordings he would have been very 
impressed. Liszt, too." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, the masters would have been impressed with Norris' recordings as 
well. Signed to the Concord label, he's released a series of solid albums 
including 1991's "Sunburst" with saxophonist Joe Henderson, a solo concert 
"Live at Maybeck Recital Hall, Volume Four" and the most recent, "Love Every 
Moment," with drummer Larance Marable and bassist Smith, who'll be on hand at 
Spaghettini. 
</P>
<P>
 On a whirlwind tour of West Coast dates that concludes Sept. 24 in Portland, 
Ore., Norris is encouraged by what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become much better (for jazz) in the States than it was 40 years ago. It 
used to be that people would want to run you out of town when you played jazz. 
Now people are hungry to hear it, especially in California." 
</P>

SEETHING IS BELIEVING IN EQUALITY; POP MUSIC: ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO, WHO PLAYS 
THE COACH HOUSE ON SUNDAY, EXPLORES WHITE RACISM WITH UNVARNISHED CONTEMPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Me'Shell NdegeOcello doesn't mince her words, whether they are poetically 
splashed across a song from her confrontational debut album, "Plantation 
Lullabies," or spoken during the course of a refreshingly direct and honest 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello means freedom in Swahili, and, appropriately enough, freedom is 
what she's all about -- be it freedom of thought, freedom of speech or freedom 
to compose music that at times is almost astonishing in its revolutionary 
vision and wild eclecticism. A complex, talented and highly intelligent person, 
NdegeOcello released "Plantation Lullabies" in 1993. It is one of the most 
intriguing albums released that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist, who appears Sunday at 
the Coach House, creates music that absolutely seethes with lyrical passion and 
anger, pride and resentment, romanticism and a self-assured sexuality. Playing 
all the rhythm instruments herself, NdegeOcello is abetted on "Lullabies" by 
such heavy company as saxophonist Joshua Redman and guitarist Wah Wah Watson. 
The overall vibe is a sophisticated brand of hip-hop, with loving nods to funk, 
soul and jazz, but the voice and vision are hers alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, NdegeOcello (pronounced In-DAY-gay-o-CELLO) is quick to acknowledge her 
many mentors, both in the nods she accords them in her lyrics and during a 
recent phone interview from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm a mutant hybrid of several people," she said. "I'm a big fan of 
Prince, Miles Davis. I love Tribe Called Quest, Sly Stone, Parliament. I think 
I've just moshed them all together somehow in my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another artist she recalls in her narrative approach and social perception is 
radical jazz poet Gil Scott Heron. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have brought that up before, and it's funny, because I never 
really listened to him before," she said. "But I find it very flattering. I've 
been listening to him a lot lately, his older stuff. It's funny; maybe I 
somehow conjured up his spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello was born in Berlin and grew up in Washington, D.C. Her father and 
brother are musicians, and she was exposed to a variety of music growing up. 
But exposure to more sinister elements served to perhaps shape what she would 
become to an even larger degree. The scars left by racism have affected her 
deeply, both in her personal life and, as a result, in her art. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was in the military, one of the few blacks," she said. "He's from 
the South, and so is my mother, who is mixed. She grew up on the same 
plantation as her forefathers. I'm very much aware of racism. All my life, I'd 
be called a nigger -- by kids, adults, trying to get a job. White boys would 
say I'd better be different if they were going to sleep with me, like I have to 
be exotic for them. You know, (magazines) will show bare-breasted women in an 
African tribal scene, but you'll never see white women betrayed in that 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I began reading a lot of books by black authors like James 
Baldwin and Langston Hughes, so I became very aware of what was going on," she 
continued. "And then I took a literature class, and all they would talk about 
was William Shakespeare, who I think is brilliant. But so much was left out. I 
became so angry, I wanted to slit the throat of every white person I saw. 
Cheated, I felt cheated . Now, it's not so much anger I feel, it's a customary 
sadness I live with. I look, and I don't see our future. I don't see my place, 
and I'm struggling to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello's music would seem to serve as therapy. She explores themes of 
black pride with obvious relish and of white racism with unvarnished contempt. 
Throughout, her phrasing and singing is executed in a deep, warm, assuring 
voice that oozes intellect and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 She also delves unapologetically into her own sexuality and into gender 
relations, with some of her sentiments raising the ire of feminists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a feminist, not at all," NdegeOcello said. "Feminism is a white 
concept for white, middle-class women who want to have the same opportunities 
as their white, male counterparts. We can fight our men, or we can fight the 
system. I'm not going to fight my brothers; I'm going to try to stand beside 
them. I try to support my brothers on many terms; I cannot talk bad about them 
-- I refuse, I refuse to. I just hope they turn around and give me the same 
respect, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women take issue with what I have to say," she added. "To me, an 
issue is all the women -- black and white -- who are on welfare. To me, an 
issue is incorporating the men, who are in control of the patriarchy, into how 
we feel. If we separate them, they'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of the controversial nature of her work, radio has been slow 
to add "Plantation Lullabies" to its playlists, and NdegeOcello said she had 
been censured by executives at Maverick Records for her outspokenness -- which, 
inevitably, results in further vitriol. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want me to play those good old Negro spirituals you know and love?" she 
posed sarcastically. "Must every black person live in pain and destruction in 
order to write something that will sell? I don't get that; I find that 
insulting. But then I see it as not insulting, but, 'Wow, you're really 
uninvolved as people. You have no awareness of anyone but yourself and your 
kind. Well, I've been forced to be aware of your kind!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello refuses to compromise her vision to make it more palatable to the 
masses. Still, she has a playful, lighthearted side as well, which peeks out 
from behind the stormier elements of her nature in more unguarded moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this musician inside of me that wants to do some art, but there's 
this person inside of me that just feels cheated," she said, summing up the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 She paused for a few seconds before adding, "You know, I play a hell of an 
accordion, too." 
</P>

 The New York quartet Luscious Jackson combines subtle hip-hop rhythms, 
harmonious vocals and smooth, organic instrumentation for an odd blend of 
indie-meets-the-street dance music. Though long an underground NYC favorite, 
the all-female band recently made a dent in the larger world of alternative 
rock with an acclaimed album on the Beastie Boy's Grand Royal label and a place 
on the "Lollapalooza '94" second stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since studio manipulation makes up a good deal of Luscious Jackson's appeal on 
record, live the group hasn't always garnered the highest praise. But Thursday 
at LunaPark, the group came back with powerfully spontaneous grooves and a 
confident sense of cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Main vocalist and bassist Jill Cuniff sang in sweet yet street-smart tones, 
making the occasional noise of a police siren or emulating the woo-woos! of a 
1970s disco song, while second singer and guitarist Gabby Glaser complemented 
with sexy, low-key raps. Samples via an on-stage deejay and aggressive drum 
beats provided hip-shaking material, while ultra-relaxed, woolly bass and 
guitar evoked the nostalgic hiss of a scratchy LP. 
</P>
<P>
 The band even ditched its instruments for one song and did an amateur dance 
routine for the howling crowd, then called two audience members up on stage who 
go-go danced furiously in front of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing grandiose or larger-than-life about Luscious Jackson, but 
instead just four women playing smart and distinctive grooves, which is all 
that's really needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Luscious Jackson plays tonight at Fuzzyland, Mr. T's Bowl, 5621 N. Figueroa 
St., Highland Park, 9 p.m. $7 . (213) 969-1433.

POP BEAT: A NIGHT OF VARIED BEATS; LATIN MUSIC SENSATION SELENA IS A REAL AND 
LIKABLE PRESENCE AS SHE MIXES TEJANO, CUMBIA AND RANCHERA STYLES IN CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Years before topping the charts and becoming one of the major stars of the 
Latin pop music world in the United States and north of Mexico, Selena was 
already a hometown sensation in the Tejano clubs of Corpus Christi, Tex. 
Thursday night at the Universal Amphitheatre, her first major Los Angeles 
concert, she showed why and left the impression she'll be around for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of other acts that grew beyond the Tex-Mex circuit such as 
mega-seller La Mafia, it is clear that keeping the Tejano tradition intact is 
not one of Selena's priorities. Her pop, cumbia -flavored style inevitably gave 
her a mainstream audience and, at this show, even the regional numbers seemed 
middle of the road and lacking in the power and edge that's a trademark of the 
style. The biggest problem was that her eight-piece band, Los Dinos (including 
the solid presence of sister Suzette Quintanilla on drums), wasn't explosive 
enough to keep up with the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Selena, 23, whose 1993 "Live" recording won a Grammy for best Mexican American 
album, is not an outstanding vocalist or dancer, but few Latin stars today are 
able to jump from Tejano styles to romantic ballads to cumbia and even a 
ranchera with her ease and credibility. Her dancing, limited to easy pirouettes 
and shuffle-stepping, is only part of a charming package that had the audience 
on its feet from the opening song.  
</P>
<P>
 Selena is the ultimate girl next-door -- beautiful, but in a simple, 
down-to-earth way -- while her voice sounds like many found in dark restaurants 
throughout Latin America and, every time she spoke Thursday -- in vastly 
improved Spanish (English is her first language) -- she sounded truly likable 
and real , not a common characteristic in most Latino mainstream acts. 
</P>
<P>
 On that count, there was only one big mistake in the show: her out-of-place 
onstage pitch for a shampoo that sponsors her. Selena's primary appeal comes 
from her simplicity and authenticity, and as long as she sticks with that her 
validity will be secure.

YES, FOLKS, A YEAR LATER, DAVE'S STILL THE TOP GUY; TELEVISION: LETTERMAN'S 
APPEAL ON 'LATE SHOW' SPANS GENERATIONS AND GENDERS, GIVING A BOOST TO CBS IN 
PARTICULAR AND LATE-NIGHT TV IN GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Letterman's CBS series marks its first anniversary on Tuesday, and the 
numbers pretty much tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In head-to-head competition with Jay Leno, who beat him out as Johnny Carson's 
successor on NBC's "Tonight Show," Letterman has won all 51 weeks in the 
ratings thus far. (Ratings for this week aren't available yet.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to win all 52 weeks," says co-executive producer Peter Lassally, 
who left "Tonight" to help guide CBS' "Late Show With David Letterman." 
"Believe me, we did not expect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did CBS or NBC or sponsors or the top TV experts, who pretty much hemmed 
and hawed when it came to putting themselves out on a limb in judging who was 
most likely to succeed in inheriting Carson's crown in the new late-night race. 
</P>
<P>
 What it all proves is that your guess is probably as good as some fancily 
titled six- or seven-figure TV wizard when it comes to judging what will or 
won't triumph on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 So much has been stated and restated about Letterman's remarkable year that 
audience judgment tends to be overlooked. You'll remember that Letterman's 
previous series, a late-late entry following Carson on NBC, developed a cultish 
image of appealing chiefly to the young. And female viewers were supposedly not 
too fond of him. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to CBS research chief David Poltrack, Letterman's current series 
cuts across the board in the ratings. About one-third of the audience is 18 to 
34 years old, another third is 35 to 49 and the other third is 50-plus, says 
Poltrack. In addition, he says, 55% of the "Late Show" audience is women, 45% 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers also tell the story in the advertising rates the Letterman show 
now commands. 
</P>
<P>
 When it made its debut as a distinct underdog on Aug. 30, 1993, with only 
about 67% of CBS stations carrying the series in its regular 11:35 p.m. slot, 
the network was guaranteeing sponsors just a 4.1 rating -- with 30-second 
commercials offered at about $25,000, according to Madison Avenue sources. When 
the show took off like a rocket, the remaining scattered commercial spots were 
raised to about $40,000 each, the advertising sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the 4.1, Letterman has averaged a 5.8 and 18% of the audience for 
the full year, outdistancing its competitors -- ABC's "Nightline," which drew a 
4.9 and 14% audience share, and "Tonight," which scored a 4.4 and a 13 share. 
(Each rating point represents 942,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, advertising and network sources say, much of the upfront sales 
for 30-second spots on the Letterman show for the new season run between 
roughly $40,000 and $50,000, with other late and "scatter" sponsor purchases 
running as high as $60,000, perhaps a little more on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman's three-year deal with CBS reportedly brings his production company, 
Worldwide Pants Inc., $42 million. Part of the deal calls for him to produce 
another show that follows his own, and late-night veteran Tom Snyder has been 
signed for that series, which is scheduled to begin in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Letterman is now middle-aged -- he's 47 -- advertising executive Joel 
Segal of the McCann-Erickson agency says the series appeals to sponsors because 
"it's attention-getting" and skews young for CBS, which has traditionally 
attracted older viewers than its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman's effect on CBS' ratings and income pops out when compared to the 
action shows he replaced. Those shows averaged a 2.9 rating and 10% audience 
share, selling 30-second commercials for about $15,000 apiece, Poltrack says. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it's a 100% ratings increase over the full year, a doubling," he says. 
"But what's interesting is that 'Tonight' and 'Nightline' haven't gone down 
much at all, yet overall viewing in the late-night period is up 20%. So the 
Letterman show has been good for all of late-night television, not just CBS." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman -- whose ratings are nearly one point higher in homes with 
$60,000-plus income and household heads with four or more years of college -- 
draws an average audience of 7.2 million viewers, Poltrack says. This, he says, 
compares with an average 6 million for "Nightline" and 5.3 million for 
"Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lassally says there is potential for more growth because the Letterman show 
still is cleared at 11:35 p.m. by only about 90% of CBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Letterman contingent, though, has a lot riding on Snyder's upcoming series 
as its first outside production at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Poltrack: "One of the things ABC has going for it right now is 
'Nightline.' When something's breaking or happening, they have that extra level 
of coverage. What we will have in Snyder is not the same as 'Nightline' but 
another forum. It will be topical and have hot personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Snyder: "Certainly if there's something that warrants attention or news, 
we would do it. In no way are we CBS News, but we could at least maintain some 
kind of presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, whose current CNBC cable talk series propelled him back into the TV 
spotlight, says the target date for his CBS show is Dec. 12, "but it may be 
that or Jan. 12. It all depends on them to get ready for us. That's all being 
handled by Worldwide Pants." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the 58-year-old Snyder hold a reasonable portion of the Letterman 
audience? Cracks Poltrack: "As Generation X says, he has attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to his post-Letterman slot, Snyder says: "My show is not 
comedy-driven, so we'll complement each other. Obviously, while the time slot 
is not Valhalla, it's important to CBS. And I'm complimented to be following 
the Letterman show." Addressing the age question, he adds: "It's 
understandable. But people will watch if it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Letterman show planning something special to celebrate its first 
anniversary? 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday," says Lassally, "we will sit down and figure it out. It will not 
be ignored. Maybe we'll show a few highlights. We are known for pulling 
something together in 24 hours."

WALKING TALL DOWN 'THE RED ROAD'; NATIVE AMERICAN SINGER BILL MILLER'S MUSIC 
CELEBRATES HIS HERITAGE WHILE SOOTHING THE PAIN OF RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Subjected to the vilest forms of racism and the pain of being raised by an 
alcoholic father, Native American singer/songwriter Bill Miller's early years 
are wrought with memories he'll never forget, although at times he wishes he 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's latest album is called "The Red Road," and as a child, that road was 
a boulevard of broken dreams. But always, Miller, who performs at UC Irvine 
tonight, has walked the path proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 39, grew up on the Stockbridge-Munsee Indian reservation in central 
Wisconsin, experiencing the unique beauty of his people's culture and the 
profound ugliness that can sadly come with being born different from the white 
majority. Though he now celebrates his heritage through music with dignity and 
self-regard, there were times when just being born an Indian was a real test of 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was spit at, called 'Timber Nigger,' 'Brown S--t,' this and that," he said 
in a recent phone interview from a Los Angeles motel room. "I saw my dad 
attacked by white racists throughout my childhood, saw it turn him into an 
alcoholic and kill him. I got my life threatened a couple of times at truck 
stops. These guys grabbed us by the back of the hair and said, 'You want a 
haircut, Indian?' People would do weird, violent things to us. I grew up with a 
lot of pain and hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller turned to art and music to soothe his soul. Drawing and painting -- and 
later, singing and songwriting -- became a passion. He moved to Nashville in 
1984 to connect with the city's music scene. Nine years and three independently 
released albums later, Miller was signed to Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Red Road," released last year, is an intensely personal album, and, in 
some ways, a very painful listening experience. Miller's singing, guitar and 
flute bespeak the torment he has experienced but do so without becoming 
self-pitying or preachy. There's depth, beauty and honesty to the album, and a 
sense of wisdom born of his pain. In many ways, Miller said, recording the 
album was a catharsis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was making the album, my dad called me to tell me he was dying, so I 
had to go back and forth between Nashville and the reservation. Basically, a 
lot of priorities changed in my life by doing that. I think it really changed 
my writing, changed the attack of the album. I was home with the singing style 
I grew up with, the powwow singers, the area that influenced me not only 
musically, but life-wise. I buried my father a week after I finished the album. 
It was very intense -- it's a piece of my life I'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I had a major chip on my shoulder, and I couldn't release it," he 
continued. "I had a violent temper. I think my father's death was like a cancer 
getting off of me. I faced off with him, asked him, 'Why are you like this? 
What happened to you?' It was a cleansing thing to bury my father and realize 
that I had to go on, I had seeds that needed to be planted." 
</P>
<P>
 For the "Red Road" sessions, Miller bused musicians from the reservation into 
the Nashville studio -- drummers, flutists and tribal singers to add 
authenticity to his folky sound. Producer Richard Bennett also helped to keep 
the album spiritually pure, chasing off Nashville hacks looking for a payday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of session people starting coming into the project, and Richard just 
basically ran them off," Miller said. "He told them, 'Hey, if you're thinking 
about your next session and where you're gonna go next, you can get out of 
here. If you're not personally involved with this project, if you don't 
understand it, then leave.' He laid it on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of understanding is something that Miller has more than his share of 
experience with.  
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he wound up opening for the Butthole Surfers and Pearl Jam at a 
two-night benefit concert to save the Indian spiritual lands of Mt. Graham in 
Mesa, Ariz. On the first night, the boisterous, impatient grunge crowd booed 
Miller, threw things and spit at him. It was a night he remembers as "just 
sickening -- the longest 30 minutes of my life." Night 2 would be different 
though, thanks to Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam's lead singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was packing up after that show, just disgusted, you know. There was this 
little scraggly guy standing there, just sort of checking me out. I said, 'Can 
I help you?' He said (Miller affects a high-pitched, wheezy voice at this 
point), 'Yeah man, yeah man! Can I talk to you?' He started raving about my 
music and how much it had moved him and how he really appreciated it. I'm like, 
'No problem.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You look kind of bummed out, man.' I said, 'I am bummed out! This 
audience treated me rude; they wouldn't even listen to me. I thought a little 
respect for the Native American was due here, that's what this was all supposed 
to be about. I don't even feel like playing tomorrow night.' He said, 'You've 
got to, man!' I said, 'Who the heck are you?' He said, 'My name is Eddie, man. 
Eddie Vedder.' I go, 'You're Eddie Vedder?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And he just looks at me, and he jumps on me, he's hugging me and hanging on 
me. The crowd sees this -- it's still light out -- and we're still on stage, 
and they start shouting for him, and he turns around and yells, 'Shut up!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, Vedder lectured the crowd before Miller's performance on the 
meaning of the event, and on according Miller some respect and listening to 
him. The night passed smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-profile fan of Miller's is Tori Amos, who, after hearing "The Red 
Road," invited him to be her opening act on this tour. The pair have been on 
the road together since March, with dates currently scheduled through 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller believes he knows the reason why fans and musical peers seem to reach 
out to him for strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this passion to tell the truth. Whatever Tori went through with, you 
know, being raped and some of the things she dealt with in her life, and 
whatever Eddie Vedder has had to deal with, with his painful relationship with 
his father and whatever else -- maybe they just connect with me." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Miller opens for Tori Amos tonight at 8 o'clock in UC Irvine's Crawford 
Hall. $20. Call (714) 856-5000.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; 'LITTLE RED': PUNCH TO GO WITH LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to add some zing to the kids' lunches this weekend, you could toss 
a couple of jalapenos into theB & Js, or you could bring them here today or 
Sunday for a noonish performance of "Little Red and the Hoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'd go for the latter. Presented by the Paper Bag Players in a 
cozy 60-seat converted industrial-park space called the Children's Theatre 
Village, this snack-size production features five local teens and adults who 
offer generous portions of belly laughs and warm fuzzies for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Karen Boettcher-Tate is responsible for much of the humor. Her take 
on "Little Red Riding Hood" brims with puckish characters, ranging from a tough 
wolf who turns sheepish at the last minute, to a sweet granny who moonlights as 
a superhero. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Bunny Lawson, head of a South County children's theater school, gives 
her actors a free hand, and, at last Sunday's show, the cast responded with 
enough silliness and enjoyment to rope in even an adolescent boy.  
</P>
<P>
 A strong emphasis on audience participation keeps children involved mentally 
and physically, even before the first lines are spoken. In a twist on dinner 
theater, children are invited to bring sack lunches (hence the name) on stage 
at 11:30 a.m. While the children nosh, cast members apply their makeup and chat 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The visits give children a chance to learn more about theater craft as it is 
taking place (the most often asked questions last Sunday: "Why do you wear so 
much makeup?" and "Can I try some on?") and, for younger ones particularly, 
allows them to feel comfortable with the concept of grown-ups playing 
make-believe. One actress let a young girl help brush and style her hair for 
her role. 
</P>
<P>
 As show time nears, the makeup tables get put away; the kids take their seats, 
and the cast goes into the house to mingle. 
</P>
<P>
 Using minimal props and costumes, "Little Red" (which ends Sunday) uses a 
well-worn gimmick to bring children into the action almost immediately. 
Portraying a traveling troupe of actors who have lost their way -- not to 
mention a good chunk of their worldly goods in a nearby swamp -- the cast 
enlists the help of the audience to help them put on a show, but first they 
have to decide what show. After some quibbling, punctuated by Paul Smet's 
wonderfully garbled Shakespearean monologue, the cast settles on "Little Red 
Riding Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the hourlong show, children willingly help move (or be) props, 
perform as "dirty rotten scoundrels" to the devilish Ma Sugar or serve as a 
"super brave person," delivering the "official document of punishment" to the 
repentant wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 As the troupe's leader and the show's narrator, actress Betsey Sebade has the 
difficult task of choosing volunteers from the audience members jumping out of 
their seats in eagerness. The process does take some time and occasionally 
slows down the otherwise snappy pace of the show, but to the kids, the 
experience is apparently well worth the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Boettcher-Tate's script stays comfortingly close to the original tale but 
updates it with some contemporary quips and themes. Little Red and her mom do 
live in the forest, and they do have a granny who happens to be ill, but the 
three ladies are also budding entrepreneurs on the brink of making it big with 
Mama's fabulous, super-secret-recipe cookies. Ma Sugar and the wolf, however, 
want that recipe.  
</P>
<P>
 When Little Red journeys to Granny's, Mom sends her off with some common-sense 
tips about strangers. And when trouble comes a-knocking in the form of the 
wolf, the females don't depend on a passing woodsman for help but manage their 
own rescue quite handily, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Smet plays things wonderfully large as the wolf. He cuts an imposing figure, 
and his voice booms through the tiny theater, but he has a goofy vulnerability 
that ingratiates him to young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Fincher plays the dastardly Ma Sugar with aplomb, and Lori Barnes, a 
lanky blonde with a certain Sandy Duncan-ish appeal, is well cast as the 
ingenue who plays Little Red. Marla Weingart, as Red's Mom and Granny, 
sometimes takes the campiness too far, but is a hoot. * "Little Red and the 
Hoods," Children's Theatre Village, 23891 Via Fabricante, Mission Viejo, today 
and Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Closes Sunday. (714) 581-5402. Tickets: $5. Running 
time: 1 hour. (Note: Lunch time starts at 11:30 a.m.; the performance begins 
around 12:15 p.m.)

 Some 1,500 cable subscribers in this coastal community of long, skinny beaches 
and shrinking flower fields are spending an endless summer toe-testing the 
interactive waters of a new enterprise, Your Choice TV, the self-proclaimed 
"television of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Your Choice TV combines some new television technologies with some slightly 
used programs, allowing viewers to order reruns from a slate of 24 current 
network and cable shows. 
</P>
<P>
 It works this way: 
</P>
<P>
 Say you missed the previous evening's Jay Leno show. If you're a test 
participant in two chosen areas of Encinitas, the Dimension Cable company has 
entrusted you with a new remote control and converter box. With the set tuned 
to Channel 54's menu, you see that a rerun of "The Tonight Show" is available 
on Channel 71. To access that channel, you enter 7 and 1 on the remote control 
and hit the "order" key. Then, for almost the next 24 hours, you have the 
previous night's "Tonight Show" on 71, allowing you to watch it when you want, 
hour after hour, reel to reel, virtually nonstop until the next Leno show is 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a first for television: the almost-instant rerun. 
</P>
<P>
 And almost as instant is the 79 cents that's added to your monthly cable bill, 
establishing another television first: a price tag for watching reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more than Leno, though: 
</P>
<P>
 The daytime soap "All My Children" is available for 99 cents each day; 
"Saturday Night Live" for $1.29; an HBO movie for $1.49, even if you don't 
subscribe to the pay channel; the most recent "20/20" and "PrimeTime Live" 
shows for 99 cents each; "ESPN Fitness Pros" for $1.29; "Mr. Rogers' 
Neighborhood" for 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gas," reports Nancy Palmer, a Leucadia manicurist. "You order what you 
want and the machine says 'thank you.' I like the idea of being in control of 
my viewing. Maybe I fell asleep during a show or came in toward the end. Now I 
can order it and see it when I want, or have friends over." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's ordered "All My Children," "20/20," "Saturday Night Live" and 
"The Tonight Show." But she doesn't like all the offerings: " 'SpeedWeek,' 
nature shows, 'Booknotes': Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how many times you realize nothing is on. But now I have a chance 
to order something I might like," Palmer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Neville, an advertising salesperson, echoes the thought. "It's a nice 
option to have with your television, but the choices are not so great. I've 
only ordered 'Saturday Night Live' so far. Twice. But you know, here it is a 
Wednesday night and right this minute there is nothing I want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, Discovery Communications, the parent of cable's Discovery 
Channel, has been rolling out its rerun service in a series of four-month tests 
in different parts of the country, budgeting close to $7 million for the 
effort, partnering with various networks and local cable companies that have 
upgraded, fiber-optic systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encinitas test is Discovery's latest, the first in the West, and one of 
the more ambitious in that 24 of Dimension's 78 channels are dedicated to 
nothing but reruns. Earlier tests offered eight or 16 channels. A 24-channel 
test in Mt. Prospect, Ill., is coupled with several pay-per-view channels -- 
not the case in Encinitas -- and is called "Intelligent Television." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether choice or intelligent, the tests provide another glimpse of what might 
be programmed when cable channels grow to three digits. 
</P>
<P>
 While pay-per-view and other current interactive services require telephone 
ordering, users of Your Choice TV never have to leave their remote controls. 
It's the key to this system -- see something you want, push a button or two, 
and the order goes out, along with the billing. Necessary information, such as 
your credit card numbers and your address, can be programmed into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the current tests, there's another possible use for the new technology: 
home shopping, where viewers can punch the same "order" button when they see 
something on the screen. No telephone calls. No credit card recitations. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now the Encinitas test is concentrated on getting subscribers familiar 
with the system's workings, and Discovery people are learning which reruns sell 
and which technical aspects need improving. The test will help decide such 
questions as whether viewers act on impulse, desire or boredom when they get a 
chance to design their own program schedules, and whether they will pay for 
something they previously could have had by loading a VCR -- and, if so, how 
much? 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Stover, Your Choice TV senior vice president and general manager, said 
that in previous tests the company has found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shows such as "Saturday Night Live" have peak sales in the immediate period 
following broadcast, indicating that there's a "gee-I-missed-it" audience that 
could be served. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some shows have steady rerun-order rates with no peaks or valleys, 
indicating that viewers go shopping when nothing else appeals to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some pay-channel subscribers will pay for reruns of movies that were 
available previously. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier East Coast test of Your Choice TV, about one-fifth of all 
participants ordered reruns, spending an average of $4.40 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan is to develop a national system," Stover says. "Right now we are 
finding out if people will support the idea. We want a national menu with the 
right number of titles so that we can promise viewers that there will always be 
something of interest on. Our menu will be lively and varied and changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond testing viewer interest, Your Choice TV executives acknowledge they 
will have to face up to other concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 * How will future revenues be shared among cable companies, producers and 
networks? 
</P>
<P>
 * How will copyright issues be resolved? (Reruns currently offered are all 
owned by the participating networks, as opposed to independent producers or 
studios.)  
</P>
<P>
 * How will the residual payments required in many entertainment union 
contracts be handled? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will this system affect the syndication market in television? 
</P>
<P>
 * How will national advertisers respond? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will there be an impact on audience ratings if the service goes national and 
shows can be shifted out of their pre-ordained time periods, possibly moving 
prime time to anytime? 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery officials won't reveal how popular their "best sellers" are, 
indicating that confidentiality agreements with the networks prevent that, but 
Stover says that the service has "learned a lot. Everything we are doing is 
research, and we've learned that people are willing to pay a reasonable fee for 
the convenience and control in watching what they want on their terms and 
schedule. We've learned that all kinds of products are attractive if delivered 
conveniently."

'CALL' TO TURN ON, TUNE IN AND SPEAK UP; TELEVISION: STEVE BARR SAYS HE ASPIRES 
TO BE 'THE PROGRESSIVE, URBAN VERSION OF RUSH LIMBAUGH' WITH HIS ACTIVIST 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds like a dopey Hollywood pitch designed to capitalize on someone 
else's success -- "Die Hard on a Bus," "Rain Man Meets Zelig" -- or a quip 
calculated to get laughs at a cocktail party. But Steve Barr isn't joking when 
he says he aspires to be "the progressive, urban version of Rush Limbaugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "Look how good the right is at this," said Barr, 35, who co-founded "Rock the 
Vote" and has worked on several campaigns for Democratic politicians, including 
Jerry Brown and President Clinton. Besides Limbaugh's popular radio and 
television programs, he notes, there is Pat Robertson's "700 Club" -- "a 
political town meeting where viewers can interact and participate in the 
political process via telephone. They call up and donate money and they become 
activists." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can do it," Barr asks, "why isn't there anyone on the left offering 
answers and getting people involved?" 
</P>
<P>
 So he's trying to fill the gap. It's not that "Call to Action With Steve Barr" 
will look anything like Limbaugh's show, or that it will always contradict the 
conservative viewpoint. Barr's goal is to mobilize viewers, fed up with 
politics as it is practiced today, to become activists on behalf of a variety 
of proposals -- many of them to the left of the current political debate.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a 'Wrestlemania' with Limbaugh, but an alternative to him and 
everything else that is on TV about politics, which is skewed toward old white 
guys who own homes," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to represent the viewpoints of those he believes are rarely heard -- 
including minorities, the poor, immigrants, young people and anyone else who 
feels unserved by the current political system. Information will be provided on 
how to register to vote, how to contact government officials and how to join 
community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr, who ran unsuccessfully last year for the chairmanship of California's 
Democratic Party, believes that special-interest money has corrupted both 
parties, and he favors sweeping political reform to eliminate the influence of 
lobbyists. "I want a well-organized, angry mob of people who have gotten 
screwed out of a good education or health care to stand up and do something 
about it," he proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he will get the chance to do so is still uncertain. After viewing the 
pilot he shot this summer, Disney-owned KCAL-TV Channel 9 picked up Barr's 
option and will produce six more episodes before deciding whether to air the 
series, with an eye toward eventual national syndication.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Binkow, KCAL's vice president of program development, said that Barr's 
series probably will get on sometime this fall, but he is not going to rush it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a unique program," Binkow said. "I just want to be sure that we 
hone the concept until it's dead on." 
</P>
<P>
 Binkow frowns on comparisons to Limbaugh or anything overtly partisan. "Call 
to Action" might have a progressive slant, he said, but the primary aim of the 
show is to incite viewers of all political tastes to effect change on issues 
that affect everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, Barr is partisan and he has his issues that he is passionate about, but 
those are the issues that we are all passionate about," Binkow said. "It's not 
a left or right thing. Getting more police is not really a left or right issue. 
Stopping the pollution of the Santa Monica Bay so we can take our children 
there for a swim is not about ideology. This is more about, 'Here's the issue, 
here's the problem, and here's what you can do to help change it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Barr's views enter in when it comes to the solutions that are 
proposed, and to the organizations that are recommended as contact points for 
viewers looking to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pilot program, for example, Barr asks the question: "How can I feel 
safer walking from my house in Venice to the store?" First he suggests buying a 
gun, but after hanging out with police and gang members, he concludes that a 
gun will make him even less safe. So he explores the political rhetoric of the 
"three strikes and you're out" debate and concludes that the law won't make 
anyone feel safer walking down a dark street and that the money spent 
implementing it could be better used on another solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask people, the one thing they all say that will make them feel safer 
is more police cruising around," Barr says. He interviews Vice President Al 
Gore and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who tells Barr that if the City 
Council would pass his budget, several hundred more police officers could be 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to supporting the quest for more police, the program endorses 
community policing techniques and advocates government-funded crime prevention 
programs that Republicans have been criticizing in the recent Washington debate 
over the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will watch if we get things done and there's tension to it," Barr 
said. "And the tension is simple: I'm the everyday guy going into the halls of 
power and asking questions. I was interviewing a city councilman for the pilot 
and he made this snide remark (about Barr's casual attire): 'You must be a real 
crack reporter -- you dress really well.' And I said, 'I dress like everyone 
who votes for you.'  
</P>
<P>
 "And all those people that these politicians are so out of touch with can make 
them change their fat-cat attitude. I mean, you can watch the news and get 
punched in the face for 22 minutes and your only recourse is to buy a gun, move 
farther away or call a home security service. With this show, you can feel good 
at the end about actually doing something, changing something. You've stood up, 
you've lit a fire under a politician, you got involved in some community 
organization. Man, that's a lot better than calling Westec."

AHMANSON SEEKS MORE TIME FOR LAND DEAL; SIMI HILLS: THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO 
ACQUIRE TWO MORE PARCELS FOR PUBLIC OPEN SPACE BEFORE IT CAN START BUILDING THE 
MINI-CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co., required to donate 10,000 acres for public parkland 
before starting construction on a mini-city in the Simi Hills, will ask the 
county for three more years to complete the open-space acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 When county supervisors approved the massive Ahmanson Ranch project nearly two 
years ago, they said the developer could begin building the golf-course 
community only after deeding four mountain properties to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And they set a deadline of December, 1995, for Ahmanson to convert the 
privately owned parcels into public open space. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, two of the properties -- Jordan Ranch and Liberty Canyon -- have 
entered the public domain, their rugged trails and magnificent vistas open to 
visitors. But Ahmanson has not yet purchased two other parcels: Runkle Ranch 
and Corral Canyon, which sweep across 4,700 acres in the Santa Susana Mountains 
and Malibu bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than negotiating for Runkle and Corral -- both owned by entertainer Bob 
Hope -- Ahmanson executives have spent the last two years in court, responding 
to nine lawsuits filed against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 One phase of the litigation was resolved this spring, when a Superior Court 
judge ruled that the county acted properly in approving the $1-billion project. 
But opponents have appealed, arguing that plopping 8,600 residents on a former 
sheep ranch would snarl traffic, foul the air, trample wildlife habitat and 
strain public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Calabasas officials announced Friday that they will appeal a 
separate ruling in favor of Ahmanson. The city is trying to block the developer 
from widening Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 Until the lawsuits are resolved, Ahmanson officials cannot be sure they will 
end up with a green light to build their upscale city. So they are reluctant to 
spend millions of dollars to purchase Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon for open 
space, spokeswoman Mary Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take this one step at a time," Trigg said. "We've been 
concentrating all of our efforts on resolving the litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 With the court battles expected to continue for at least a year, Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk said she considered the Ahmanson request reasonable. Granting 
the extension, she said, "is the fair and equitable thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the Ahmanson Ranch project argued that the supervisors should 
stick to the original deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people knew full well they were going to be sued by everyone in sight," 
said Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney fighting the development. "If they didn't 
write into their contract (a clause granting them) an extension in the case of 
litigation, then they have no business building cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlock also objected to the timing of Ahmanson's request. Even without an 
extension, the company has 16 months to complete the land transactions. Rather 
than petition for relief now, she said, Ahmanson officials should work to wrap 
up the litigation and get on with the property acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 But by requesting a hearing this fall, Ahmanson executives ensure that the 
current Board of Supervisors will vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two supervisors who support the project, VanderKolk and Vicky Howard, will 
retire from the board after November's election. And one contender for 
VanderKolk's seat, attorney Trudi Loh, said she would oppose an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take a hard-headed look at this: We cut a contract . . . and now 
they're asking for the ground rules to be changed," Loh said. "This doesn't 
seem anything close to reasonable."  
</P>
<P>
 Loh's opponent in the supervisorial race, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank 
Schillo, said he would be inclined to grant an extension because the developer 
cannot control courtroom delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was their fault, a problem they had created, I would give a different 
answer," he said. "But if they're held up by lawsuits, it's only fair to give 
them an opportunity to extend the deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 The two contenders for Howard's seat, Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery, both said they would support the 
extension request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Commission is expected to vote on the Ahmanson 
request Sept. 15, and the Board of Supervisors will take up the debate in 
mid-October.

 TWO TEMBLORS: Two aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake shook the West 
Valley on Friday evening, seismologists said. The strongest temblor, of 3.3 
magnitude, hit at 9:12 p.m. and was centered two miles west-northwest of Canoga 
Park, according to Caltech seismologists. Previously, a 2.8 magnitude shock was 
registered at 5:28 p.m., also centered in Canoga Park.

ROGERS PLANS TALK TO GROUP TERMED RACIST; LEGISLATORS: CONSERVATIVE STATE 
SENATOR HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FOR HIS OFFER TO ADDRESS AN ORGANIZATION THAT SOME 
PEOPLE SAY PREACHES WHITE SUPREMACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The heat is on, but state Sen. Don Rogers, the self-proclaimed "captain of my 
ship," is cool and unbending -- even amid charges that he is planning to 
address a group of suspected white supremacists tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of his scheduled appearance before an organization that allegedly 
embraces racists beliefs have evoked such strong reactions as "reprehensible" 
and "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just from the state Senate, where Rogers represents one of 
California's most conservative districts, encompassing the Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys and beyond into oil and farming country. 
</P>
<P>
 Watchdog groups that track extremist organizations blasted Rogers' planned 
dinner-hour talk at the fourth annual Jubilation Celebration and Conference in 
Bakersfield, with the Anti-Defamation League calling it "outrageous and 
shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 And the phone in Rogers' Capitol office Friday brought at least two queries 
during the lunch break from fellow Republican officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Rogers told a U. S. congressman and an assemblyman. All he 
planned to talk about, he said, was his Senate resolution reiterating states' 
rights and putting Washington on notice that California wants no more of its 
costly federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Coalition for Human Dignity, a watchdog group in Oregon, the 
conference is sponsored by a California-based newspaper called The Jubilee. The 
paper is a national publication for the Christian Identity movement, whose 
followers believe Northern European descendants are superior to those of other 
races. People of color are derided as "mud people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of criticism, Colorado state Rep. Charles Duke backed out of his 
scheduled speech tonight before Jubilee followers. But Rogers has not. He has 
given his word that he does not share in any racist beliefs and feels that 
should be enough to satisfy critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Such willfulness is typical of a man who entered politics 20 years ago because 
he was appalled at the size of his tax bill. Back then, in the pre-Proposition 
13 era, it jumped 45% in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a businessman who got into politics for all the right reasons -- to 
reduce the role of government," said Rogers, 66, an oil geologist and partner 
in a drilling firm called Success Petroleum. "I did it to try to keep 
government from destroying us, from over-regulating and excessively intruding 
into our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Rogers at times catches himself when his message grows 
strident. "Unlawful" federal mandates -- upon quick reflection -- become 
mandates that are "probably not constitutionally authorized." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Senate floor, however, Rogers will often allow himself to be baited by 
liberal Democrats into heated debates against gun control, environmental 
protection and any perceived challenge to the protections of U. S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our most staunch constitutionalist," said fellow conservative state 
state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of the environment, Rogers is adamant. Global warming is a 
hoax. A thinning ozone layer is a lie. Oil spills have minimal impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like clean air, clean water and clean food as much as anybody," Rogers said 
in an interview. "But I think we've allowed the pendulum to swing too far, and 
we need some common sense brought back into the mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rogers has a seemingly blind devotion to the tenets of the conservative 
wing of the Republican Party, he is not without a sense of humor. He once 
greeted state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) with a demand for an 
environmental impact report on the bright green jacket Dills was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no wisecracks circulating on the Senate floor Friday as Rogers' 
colleagues contemplated the impact tonight's appearance could have on the upper 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's irresponsible -- and not even clever -- to say you're going 
before a group like this to only talk about states' rights and ignore the 
associations with the Aryan Nation types," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). "This is a group whose message is anti-Semite, anti-black, 
anti-minority. And they're the sort of group that one ought not talk to unless 
you're there to deliver a strong message of criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) noted that Rogers has acted as chair 
of the Senate's Veteran Affairs Committee since his appointment to the 
leadership post at the start of the two-year session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just really upset," Watson said. "Veterans come in all colors. They 
aren't only Northern Europeans. And for him to dignify this group with his 
presence is reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was no formal move to censure Rogers, and the senator repeated 
that he was "the captain of my ship" and that he would not be swayed into 
supporting the views of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Rogers spoke before Jubilee followers, many of whom share his 
passion for a movement to keep the federal government at bay, was just months 
before the senator himself tangled with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, federal authorities seized Rogers' private plane to cover 
payment of back taxes that he owed on investments. Rogers fought back by filing 
for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to keep ownership of the plane through a 
trust he set up while he determined a way to pay the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said his biggest accomplishment in government came 12 years ago when he 
sponsored a successful citizen-backed initiative to abolish the California 
inheritance tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, he points to his states' rights resolution (SJR 44) as a high point of 
the legislative session now winding down. Four other states have passed 
measures similar to Rogers', which "informs the President and Congress that 
California is claiming sovereignty under the 10th Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure -- and its demands that the federal government immediately end 
imposing any mandates that are beyond its constitutional powers -- has a 
certain appeal to the participants of today's Jubilee conference.

TRAINER TELLS OF KILLER ELEPHANT'S HISTORY OF TROUBLE, BAD ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even as a youngster, Tyke the elephant was a troublemaker, according to her 
former trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old African elephant killed a circus trainer last Saturday when 
she went wild during a performance of Circus International in Honolulu. Tyke 
then charged out of the arena and roamed through city streets for 30 minutes 
before police trapped and killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the rampage came as little surprise to Brian McMillan, 44, a Santa 
Clarita animal trainer who worked with Tyke about 15 years ago, when the young 
elephant was just over five feet tall. McMillan said he spent about three 
months trying to get her to perform tricks for a nightclub act, for the same 
owner she has now, before realizing she wasn't suitable for training. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would resist the training," he said. "She would run away when you tried 
to do anything with her. She just didn't have a good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan, who still trains a variety of large animals at his rural home, said 
he has worked with elephants since he was 15 and has found most of them to be 
cooperative. But he has also seen others with Tyke's attitude and "eventually 
they become dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyke was owned by Hawthorne Corp., an Illinois-based company whose officials 
have previously stated the animal was spooked when apprentice groomer William 
Beckworth, 20, walked too close behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach officials Friday at Hawthorne's headquarters in Grayslake, 
Ill., were unsuccessful. An employee at the company's facility in Richmond, 
Ill., declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckworth was thrown down by the elephant and veteran trainer Allen Campbell, 
37, was crushed to death when he tried to prevent the elephant from stomping on 
Beckworth's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the thing that shocked me the most was when I saw the trainer step in 
front of the elephant," McMillan said. "I knew he was obviously trying to save 
(the) other guy's life, but on the other hand, that's the last thing you do in 
that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been better to approach Tyke from the side and then move toward 
her front to ward off the attack, McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan said Tyke's behavior was not typical for an elephant that had been 
spooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an elephant gets spooked they normally try to get away," he said. "That 
elephant didn't want to get away. That elephant wanted blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckworth was hospitalized and is recovering from his injuries. In addition, 
about a dozen people inside the arena were treated for injuries sustained while 
fleeing the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Those investigating the incident said Tyke was known as a troublesome animal 
among trainers and she had previous outbursts on multiple occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year she broke the ribs of a trainer in North Dakota, said Mike Burgwin, 
chief investigator for the Hawaiian Humane Society. In another incident, also 
last year, it took trainers in Pennsylvania an hour to coax her back through a 
door she "enlarged considerably" by smashing through just before a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture is investigating the death to determine if 
Hawthorne met government animal-care standards, said Cynthia Eck, a department 
spokeswoman. Investigators have heard about three or four incidents involving 
Tyke, "but we cannot verify them at this time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary investigation indicates Tyke had sufficient food, shelter and 
other care, officials said. She also had no diseases likely to trigger the 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 But McMillan said that, based on his experience, her care is not an issue. It 
was not safe, he said, for her to perform in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally wouldn't work with an elephant of that kind of nature because 
I'd consider it too dangerous," he said.

DRUNK DRIVER CONNORS GETS 16 MONTHS IN TRAGIC CRASH; COURTS: VICTIM SHAKES 
HANDS WITH THE EX-FOOTBALL HERO AFTER MAKING AN EMOTIONAL SPEECH ABOUT HIS 
DISFIGUREMENT AND LOST ABILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of an emotional hearing Friday, a judge sentenced former high 
school football hero Ryan Patrick Connors to 16 months in prison for a 1993 
drunk-driving crash that disfigured a music student and ruined his singing 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Shari Kreisler Silver said she agonized over the 
sentence, calling it "the most difficult sentencing decision I've had to make 
in the five years I've been a judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Stephen A. Baron had sought a two-year sentence. Defense attorney 
Thomas F. Kascoutas had asked for probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver found the middle ground. She also gave Connors, a 20-year-old former 
Hart High School star quarterback, until Sept. 6 to surrender. Connors, who 
said he hopes to work for the FBI someday, pleaded no contest last month to one 
count of causing great bodily injury while driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's hearing featured a compelling statement from victim Gregory Moore, 
33, and a courtroom apology from Connors. It ended with a handshake between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an acceptance and an offer to him that I'm available for his 
apologies," Moore said later. "I want him to know that I feel that we're both a 
part of this story." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said that as she weighed Connors' otherwise clean record against the 
damage he'd caused, her thoughts kept returning to Moore's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate student in music at CalArts in Valencia, Moore had been accepted to 
study in France as a composer in residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No amount of money will make him whole again," she said. "He will never again 
have what he had before the impact. That life is forever gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the head-on collision between the borrowed Mercedes 
convertible Connors was driving and Moore's subcompact was like an explosion, 
prosecutor Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys disputed the notion that Connors was drag-racing at the time 
of the accident, which occurred July 23, 1993. But Baron said it was clear he 
was under the influence of alcohol and passing illegally at high speed when he 
crossed into Moore's lane.  
</P>
<P>
 When paramedics arrived at the scene on San Fernando Road near the Circle J 
Ranch in Newhall, they thought Moore was dead, Baron said. He was trapped in 
the twisted wreckage of his car, a pool of blood forming under its frame, his 
face flattened by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours after the accident, Connors' blood-alcohol level was 0.08% -- the 
level at which a driver is presumed to be intoxicated in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading from a seven-page statement, Moore asked the judge to sentence Connors 
to two years in prison. He catalogued his injuries and described how the crash 
had destroyed his sinuses, and therefore his classically trained singing voice. 
He said it has left him disfigured and impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not yet met the love of my life," he said, saying that he had put his 
career and studies first.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I wish I hadn't delayed. This past year I have craved love. I've wanted 
someone's arms around me. Just some comfort. It's difficult because I don't 
feel so ugly on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the head-on collision fractured his face and dashed his dreams, 
Moore said the focus always has been on Connors, the fallen football hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newspapers all mentioned Ryan Connors' football scores, but none of them 
mentioned my scores," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am a composer." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore had visited a friend to celebrate his acceptance in a French 
composer-in-residence program and was on his way home when the crash occurred. 
He woke up a month later in the hospital, unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $500,000 in medical bills later, he faces continual surgery, his 
movement is limited and he suffers from permanent double-vision. "I want back 
my face," he said. "I don't want these plastic teeth. I want all of my sinuses 
back, sinuses that rang so brightly when I sang. I want a forehead and eye 
sockets and nose and jaw that are not made of titanium. I want back my good 
fingers, and my arm that could reach all the bass notes on the piano. God, I 
want back my music!" 
</P>
<P>
 He then directed his words to Connors. "Understand my injuries," Moore said. 
"Understand how I feel when they roll me into the operating room at UCLA, to 
see the walls of that huge, antiseptic, terrifying room papered over with 
enlarged, gridded photographs of me, pictures of my good face, my pre-Ryan 
Connors face, all sealed with sterile plastic, there for the surgeons to study 
during the 12-hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need you to try and understand how it feels to recover from that surgery, 
and still be deformed." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Connors stood up in court, turned toward Moore and 
apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I ruined your life and this will haunt me for the rest of my life," 
Connors said, as Moore nodded. "I just want you to know that I am very sorry 
for what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearing ended, Connors and Moore shook hands. Outside the courtroom 
afterward, Moore said he was satisfied with the sentence, although he wished it 
had included community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really hopeful that he's willing to turn his life around," Moore said. 
"It's very important to me that he stand and face whatever the law requires 
because he forced me to stand and face what I've had to when I look in the 
mirror."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BOGUS SOCIAL WORKERS ARE SOUGHT BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two women who posed as government social workers to gain entrance to the homes 
of three elderly Burbank residents are being sought for robbery, attempted 
robbery and burglary, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects first struck Tuesday when an 80-year-old man who lives in the 
1400 block of Broadway reported that a heavy-set Latino woman in her 50s 
arrived at his door and said she was a nurse who had been sent to give him a 
physical examination.  
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, the woman began going through the man's personal belongings and 
was joined by another suspect, described as a white woman in her 20s or 30s. No 
items were reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the same two women struck twice Thursday, first telling an 
88-year-old woman who lives in the 1400 block of Rose Street that they were 
social workers investigating a report that she had been beaten by a man.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the woman's protests, the suspects entered the house, pushed the woman 
aside and began looking through her belongings. According to police, they took 
$40 cash from the woman's wallet, and possibly some checks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third incident, a 75-year-old man whose home is in the 1400 block of 
Clybourn Street told police that two women matching the suspects' description 
came into his house about 10:20 a.m., saying they were investigating a report 
that the man had beaten his wife.  
</P>
<P>
 The man demanded to see their identifications. The suspects left, saying 
"their supervisor" would be back to deal with the man, Sgt. Len Doran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Detective Jose Duran said the suspects may have followed the victims 
home from the store or pharmacy.  
</P>
<P>
 He said there are several reasons police think the same women are responsible 
for all three crimes. In each case, one of the suspects has been described as 
overweight and "dirty-looking," Duran said. "Apparently her hair is described 
as dirty and unkempt. She just has a dirty appearance about her, according to 
the victims."  
</P>
<P>
 In each case, the suspects' getaway vehicle was described as a late 1970s 
American-made mid-size car, with faded blue or dark paint.  
</P>
<P>
 Duran said seniors can protect themselves by "not letting anybody in." 
</P>
<P>
 "They should keep their doors locked, and they should ask for ID if anybody 
comes to the door. If the people say they don't have ID or refuse to give it, 
they should slam the door in their face and immediately call police." STEVE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; TACO BELL DONATES $45,850 TO REPAIR POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Taco Bell Foundation has donated $45,850 to the West Valley Family YMCA to 
help repair damage caused to its swimming pool by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation will be turned over at a special event Monday at 11 a.m. at the 
facility, 18810 Vanowen St., Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Stewart, Taco Bell Corp.'s vice president for the MegaWest zone, will 
present a check to David Powell, West Valley Family YMCA executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who helped arrange the donation, 
also will take part, as will City Councilwoman Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. set up the foundation in 1992 to assist nonprofit 
organizations and often help with disaster relief, officials said. The 
foundation -- a separate entity from Taco Bell Corp. -- raised the money 
through employee contributions and donation canisters set up in stores 
throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charities seeking aid from the foundation should write to Michele Myszka, 
executive director, Taco Bell Foundation, 17901 Von Karman Ave. Irvine, Calif., 
92714. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; ORGANIC GARDEN CLUB FEEDS BOTH BODY AND SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vegetables are those ubiquitous objects that conjure up a wide variety of 
thoughts and emotions -- from the dread of children to adults' hope for a 
fountain of youth or a cure for their ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been a motivation for genetic research and a boon to the 
petrochemical industry. They are the inspiration of cartoon characters such as 
Popeye. 
</P>
<P>
 And vegetables are what brings the 50 members of the Conejo Valley Organic 
Gardening Club together for the common goal of growing their own produce 
without pesticides and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcey Lober, president, launched the club when she saw that other people had 
no gardens but were eager to grow their own fruits and vegetables. Lober grew 
produce in community gardens while she was living in an apartment in Sherman 
Oaks several years ago. So she established community gardens on donated land in 
the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members meet on a regular basis and share organically grown seeds, 
surplus produce and information on non-chemical pest control and fertilizers, 
as well as philosophical thoughts on the problems of modern life.  
</P>
<P>
 Members have different reasons for participating. Jane Rimer, a vegetarian 
from Agoura Hills, was looking for good-tasting food. "If you eat a lot of 
fruits and vegetables, they have to taste good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rimer has tried to have her own garden, but fires eight and five years ago 
removed all landscaping from her property. She attends the garden club meetings 
and tours and is able to supply her family with organically grown fruit and 
vegetables through the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Rose, another member, sees organic gardening as more of a philosophical 
question. Beyond learning how to grow crops without harming the environment or 
the human body, Rose wants to become aligned with the natural processes of the 
Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 Her goal, she said, is to "watch the birds in the garden and to understand the 
growth processes of plants. I want to understand the relationships between the 
weather, the plants and the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose heard about the "crop swap," when club members exchange surplus produce, 
and began to attend meetings. She had read extensively and gardened organically 
for 15 years, but found the firsthand information from organic growers 
extremely helpful.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Rose said, lectures by people growing herbs gave her new ideas 
about the market for herbs, what they are used for and the most effective 
fertilizers and pest-control techniques. RAY PATTERSON

 Students at Glendale's three high schools scored lower on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test in 1994 than they did last year, but still managed to beat the 
average score for students in California and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High students increased their average score this year in the verbal 
portion of the SAT, the annual test given to college-bound high school 
students. But overall, students from the three campuses scored lower on the 
mathematics and verbal sections of the test than students tested in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High students had an average combined score for the math and 
verbal portions of 957, the highest of the three schools. Hoover students had 
an average score of 949, and Glendale High students had an average score of 
906. The statewide average score is 895, and the national average score is 902. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they were pleased with the results and said the SAT is 
only "one of numerous indicators" that reflect the quality of the district's 
programs. They said that although scores have dipped recently, the long-term 
trend shows that Glendale's students are improving their SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a short term of one to three years, it is not unusual for individual 
school results to fluctuate by numerous points up or down," district spokesman 
Vic Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in the last decade, however, the average scores on the math 
portion of the SAT by Glendale students have risen 41 points at Hoover, 28 
points at Crescenta Valley and 17 points at Glendale, while state and national 
averages have been "fairly constant." 
</P>
<P>
 In the verbal portion, the state average has dropped nine points and the 
national average three points, but Hoover has increased its average score 13 
points, Pallos said. The average verbal scores at Crescenta Valley and Glendale 
have dropped four points, he said. STEVE RYFLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A community committee has been formed to evaluate a soon-to-be-released Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency proposal for a redevelopment area in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. established the committee Aug. 
18, one day after residents told CRA officials at an association meeting that 
they want a formal role in the planning process for a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency wants to use a portion of local property taxes to rebuild sections 
of the quake-ravaged community. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA Study Committee, as the group is known, wants to have veto power over 
the CRA in deciding the spending priorities of the redevelopment area, said 
Richard Close, president of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no (redevelopment area) in the city in which the public has veto 
power," Close said. "In other cities it does exist, but not in L.A. So, this 
could be the first." 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment project will rebuild quake-damaged structures and could 
involve construction of new buildings, streets and sidewalks. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COYOTE CARRIES DOG OUT OF BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

<TEXT>
<P>
 A white, 8-year-old Maltese dog, on a leash in its back yard, was carried off 
by a coyote Thursday night as its owners watched in horror only a few feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until it happens to you, you don't know the pain," said Susie Eiger, who has 
lived in her Woodland Hills home above Corbin Canyon for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog, named Fluffy, had been a birthday present for Eiger's 16-year-old 
daughter, Natalie. 
</P>
<P>
 Eiger's 18-year-old son, Ronen, had brought the dog out into the back yard 
after the family finished dinner at about 7:30 p.m. Ronen Eiger said the dog 
was on the leash, but was roaming freely, though only a few feet away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 The coyote apparently was hiding in the back yard when the dog came out of the 
house, family members said. After snatching the dog, the coyote fled. Susie 
Eiger said she does not know how the coyote got into the yard, which is 
surrounded by three fences.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we knew this coyote was in the back yard, I would not have let him out," 
said Eiger. Eiger, her son and their housekeeper saw the coyote grab the dog 
and they tried to chase it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone needs to know this happened," said Eiger. "I've been crying the 
whole night. I hope this story can help other families save their pets." 
</P>
<P>
 Eiger said she had not reported the incident to city officials, but did tell 
her veterinarian about it. "Unfortunately, he had heard of this before," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the city banned coyote trapping for financial reasons and 
because of the complaints of animal rights activists. The ban was modified in 
June so that homeowners who already have taken other steps to deter coyotes 
could pay $200, sign a waiver freeing the city from liability and have a trap 
installed on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months before the trapping ban started, residents reported 511 
coyote complaints within the city, according to animal regulation officials. 
During the same period, coyotes were blamed for the deaths of 116 cats, 23 dogs 
and 50 other pets, the department said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; DIET PROGRAM GIVES PREVIEW OF SKINNIER YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mirror, mirror on the wall . . . who's the skinniest one of all?  
</P>
<P>
 You are, if you are looking into a mirror that would reflect only a skinny 
you, no matter how much extra weight you carry. This image -- a "skinny" 
version of you -- is the focus of a weight loss program at a Mission Hills 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 While many diet plans are known for their limited menus and exercise regimens, 
the Lindora Medical Clinic's approach puts the emphasis on the psychological 
side of dieting. 
</P>
<P>
 It incorporates visual imagery, a tool that founder Dr. Marshall Stamper 
believes has been instrumental in helping more than 75,000 patients reach their 
weight loss goals. His 30 clinics throughout California admit up to 80 patients 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes a large part of their success to his "skinny mirror," which he 
encourages patients to look into several times a day. Stamper created the 
mirror by altering the reflective glass so patients actually see a thinner 
version of themselves when they stand four to five feet away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the "skinny mirror" is an ideal mental imagery tool, and an essential 
part of the Lindora diet program. 
</P>
<P>
 "By putting the skinny image into your mind, you can begin to accept a new 
you," said Stamper, who said the mirror also serves as a motivational tool. 
"Patients get excited when they actually see how they'll look once they've lost 
the weight." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which costs about $75 a week after initiation fees, also follows 
a "fat-burning" diet, where patients are encouraged to eat foods high in 
protein, low in carbohydrates. Once patients begin losing weight, they are 
taught to focus on metabolic adjustment, where they increase their calorie 
intake. Patients are required to visit the clinic five days a week to receive 
frequent supervision by trained medical doctors and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills resident Rosalie Black lost more than 60 pounds in 10 weeks on 
the Lindora program. She has 24 pounds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried every diet in the world and failed," said Black, who has gone from a 
size 22 to a size 16. Black said using the "skinny mirror" contributes greatly 
to her daily success on the diet. "Every time I look in that mirror I see a 
thinner me. Today, I'm smaller than I've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Hunter, director of Lindora's nursing services and clinic operations, 
believes the program is successful because it first deals with the mental 
picture patients have of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put someone in front of the skinny mirror, we are giving their brain 
a picture of what they can be," said Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their subconscious they are thin. This is what helps them reach their 
goal." ALICIA DOYLEWEIGHT REDUCTION PROGRAMS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMPETITORS IN AEROBICS SWEAT OUT ROUTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three Burbank policemen stood against a wall, crossing and uncrossing 
their arms, trying, it seemed, with little success to stop smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 While their comrades battled heat and bad guys around the city Friday 
afternoon, Sgt. Wade Taylor and Officers Dave Decker and Brent Ambrose watched 
over the air-conditioned Media City Center -- and 100 or so Lycra-clad aerobic 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if this was the preferable duty, Decker responded, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the regional finals of the National Aerobic Championships, and while 
sponsors passed out fat-free corn cakes, fat-free men and women in very tight 
outfits were sweating themselves to a fine sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of this competition, which runs through Sunday, will go on to the 
nationals in Houston come January and then, possibly, the world championships 
in either Australia or San Diego later next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sport for all, and it's much safer than many other sports," said 
organizer Karen Schwartz, a box of bandages and ankle tape at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 With the odors of Chanel No. 5 and deep-fried mall food wafting along, the 
reigning national champions took to the stage first about 10 a.m. They wowed a 
growing crowd in the mall's rotunda with a dance part ballet, part gymnastics, 
part Schwarzenegger.  
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, it was time for the women's novice competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the participants are instructors themselves, but all were performing 
for the first time in front of an audience. Before taking the stage they 
practiced their routines and considered how best to impress the judges. They 
needed to rack up points in both the skill and artistry categories to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious shoppers with bags of golf shirts and CDs continued to gather, and by 
the time 21-year-old Stella Azocar of Marina del Rey kicked off the novice 
competition, hundreds had lined all three floors of the mall and were peering 
down and smacking the handrail to the beat of a bass-heavy, hip-hop version of 
Foghat's "Freeride." 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in purple and white, and with a stomach you could do laundry on, Azocar 
repeatedly flung her legs above her head and performed pushups a Marine would 
be proud of. A man on the third floor watched intently and spoke into a 
cellular telephone, apparently describing the limber feats to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1983 by Schwartz and her husband, Howard, competitive aerobics has 
gained wide popularity in 35 countries, Schwartz said. And, she added, the two 
are leaving next week for Paris to discuss with the International Olympic 
Committee the possibility of including the sport in future Olympic Games.  
</P>
<P>
 Aerobics is not just for women, said novice competitor Don Hostler, 25. The 
only requirement is a high threshold for pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've competed in track, I've competed in baseball, and this is the hardest 
sport I've ever done," said the former Oregon State University cheerleader. 
"It's like sprinting for two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all things are equal in the sport, including the need to remove 
body hair so judges can see unobstructed muscle definition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've shaved my legs," Hostler said. "Feels weird."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CHICK SEEKS TO EXTEND QUAKE DEBRIS AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick has proposed that the city extend 
its free earthquake-debris removal program for four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick wants the federally funded program, scheduled to end Sept. 30, to 
continue through Jan. 17, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday, Chick said the extension is 
needed because some earthquake victims are only now beginning to settle their 
insurance claims, process their loan applications and hire contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Constine, Chick's chief of staff, said 10 to 20 people a day call 
Chick's office to say they need more time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrative officer would request the extension from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. Maria Biessels, an analyst with the CAO's 
emergency operations unit, said she expects the request to be sent next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think there's going to be any problem getting FEMA's authorization 
for an extension," Biessels said. KAY HWANGBO

POLICE SEEK 2 MORE IN GANG SWEEP; CRIME: FIFTEEN ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE 
STEMMING FROM AN AUG. 16 ATTACK ON A HOMELESS PAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles police continued to search for two additional suspects Friday, the 
day after they arrested 15 alleged members and associates of a North Hollywood 
gang in a sweep of more than a dozen of their homes and hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests stem from the Aug. 16 attack on a homeless couple and the city 
sanitation workers who tried to rescue them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael and Susie Hosmun were robbed near the railroad tracks along Chandler 
Boulevard by a group of people police said they believe were members of the 
North Hollywood Locos. When city sanitation workers came to their assistance, 
about 30 members of the gang turned on them, attacking them with knives, 
bottles, sticks and rocks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the city workers are recovering after being seriously injured in the 
incident. One was stabbed in the side of the abdomen and another was struck in 
the head by a flying brick. The homeless couple suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's sweep, police said they had arrested the most violent members of 
the gang they believe were involved in the melee, but continued to search for 
two men: Moise Lino, 26, of North Hollywood, who has a warrant for his arrest 
on charges of attempted murder in connection with the attack, and another man 
whom police declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of people involved" in the attack, said Mark Aragon, a 
detective with the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit. "But they 
are a relatively small gang and hopefully we have taken the steam out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon said the most serious charges involve minors, some of whom are suspects 
in the stabbing of Jesus Reynoso, a city sanitation worker. In all, eight 
minors -- three of them girls who allegedly began the fight by shouting at the 
homeless couple -- were arrested and remain in custody at San Fernando Valley 
Juvenile Hall. Their charges range from violation of probation to attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, three of the suspected adult gang members were arraigned in Van 
Nuys Municipal Court on charges of attempted murder: Pastor Campos, 22, of Lake 
View Terrace; Freddy Ramirez, 23, of North Hollywood; and Olivardo Estrada, 18, 
of North Hollywood. Campos was also charged with robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Still awaiting arraignment are Oscar Salcido, 20, of North Hollywood, who was 
arrested Thursday on suspicion of robbery, attempted murder and assault with a 
deadly weapon; Carlos Salazar, 20, of North Hollywood, who was arrested for 
assault with a deadly weapon; and Juan Villalobos, 18, of North Hollywood, who 
was arrested on numerous misdemeanor warrants, police said. They are all being 
held at Van Nuys Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakyn Wynn, 23, of Irvine was also arrested in the sweep for giving false 
information to police, which is a misdemeanor. She is believed to be an 
associate of the gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they also recovered one knife in the dawn sweep conducted by 
officers with the Los Angeles County Probation Department and LAPD's Foothill 
and North Hollywood CRASH units.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FAIR MIXES TRADITIONAL, HIGH-TECH; LANCASTER: 
THE 56TH ANNUAL ANTELOPE VALLEY EVENT WILL INCLUDE LIVESTOCK JUDGING AS WELL AS 
A LASER LIGHT SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The 56th annual Antelope Valley Fair and Alfalfa Festival opened Friday 
afternoon, celebrating the rural roots of an area where farmland is quickly 
giving way to suburban housing tracts and bustling shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-day festival, which is expected to draw up to 300,000 visitors to the 
Lancaster fairgrounds, will mix traditional livestock judging and country music 
concerts with newer attractions such as a high-tech laser light show and a 
riding lawn mower race. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, Antelope Valley Fair Board members, city officials, the 
Quartz Hill High School Pep Band, a piano player on wheels and a man walking on 
stilts took part in brief ribbon-cutting ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited to get the gates open," said Charla Abbott, president of the 
fair board. "We promise you 11 days of fun, entertainment and some education, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Midday temperatures topped 100 degrees, triggering concerns about a heat wave 
that could cut into the festival's attendance. But by late afternoon, the 
temperature had dropped, and a breeze helped cool down the grounds. A growing 
crowd of visitors streamed into the carnival and the exhibit halls. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this year's first events was a pig race, in which 6- to 8-week-old 
animals scurried around a track to earn a treat of vanilla ice cream and Oreo 
cookies. Charlie Cook, who trains the pigs and takes them to fairs throughout 
the state, said the animals learn the routine in just three days. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fortunate, he said. "Because they grow up so fast, their racing career 
only lasts about a month and a half -- or as long as they can fit in the gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Liebel, 21, and Damian DeGoede, 19, both of Lancaster, cheered for 
their favorite porkers, while their children, 9-month-old Jason and 2-year-old 
Brooke, looked on from the comfort of rented strollers shaped like green 
lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun for the family," Liebel said of the fair. "There are lots of 
animals, lots of rides and lots of food. We'll be here next year -- probably 
tomorrow too!" 
</P>
<P>
 Equally enthused was John Schoenmeier, 11, of Mojave, who had entered his pigs 
and lambs in the fair judging for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a good time, everybody's happy," the youth said. "The only thing I 
don't like is people trying to steal the baby chicks" from an open poultry 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Fair has its roots in local harvest festivals and friendly 
cow-milking and hay-loading competitions that date back almost 100 years. The 
Antelope Valley Fair Assn. was formed in 1938 and promptly bought the current 
80-acre fairgrounds for 35 cents per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival became affiliated with the state's Division of Fairs and 
Expositions in 1941. Today, the fair has an annual operating budget of $3.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event will feature nationally known performers, such as Randy 
Travis and the Smothers Brothers, and colorful events such as World Class 
Wrestling, a "Monster Trucks" show and a rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair also is a major fund-raising event for local service clubs and other 
nonprofit groups, whose members operate food and drink booths. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, school groups and local businesses will celebrate the arrival 
of the fair today with a parade featuring nearly 100 entries marching along 
Lancaster Boulevard in the city's old downtown district. The parade, beginning 
at 10 a.m., will start at 10th Street West and move east toward Division Street 
near the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair itself reopens at noon today and Sunday, running till 1 a.m. on both 
nights. Admission is $5 for those older than 13 and $3 for children ages 6 to 
12 and for senior citizens over 65.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALAMO SENTENCING DELAYED 2 WEEKS; COURTS: 
LAWYERS FOR THE EVANGELIST CONVICTED OF TAX VIOLATIONS REQUEST A NEW DATE FOR A 
LONGER HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for evangelist Tony Alamo on Friday won a two-week delay of his 
sentencing in Memphis for federal tax violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, 59, is the flamboyant leader of the Holy Alamo Christian Church, which 
started as a street ministry in the 1960s and earned millions of dollars in 
later years through communes and businesses.On June 8, he was convicted of 
falsifying his 1985 income-tax returns and failing to file returns for the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's attorney, Susan James, requested the delay, stating that U.S. District 
Judge Jon McCalla had scheduled only a few hours for the hearing Friday. James 
said both sides are expected to present witnesses, and the defense will 
challenge the prosecution's pre-sentence report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can do it all in one day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing has been rescheduled for Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, faces up to six years in 
prison and a $550,000 fine. Court documents indicate that prosecutors will seek 
a prison term of 41 to 51 months for Alamo, who remains in custody pending his 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo faces separate charges in Los Angeles County of ordering four men to 
strike a boy named Jeremiah Miller 140 times with a large paddle in 1988 at the 
evangelist's Saugus church. He could receive up to 12 years in prison if 
convicted of felony child abuse and inflicting corporal injury on a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo and his wife, Susan, founded the church in the 1960s, taking young 
dropouts and drug users off Hollywood streets and providing them with food and 
shelter. The church prospered in the '70s and '80s, and its income soared from 
the sale of glitzy clothing such as rhinestone-studded jackets costing $600.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; RABBI CONSIDERS WHY A GOOD GOD WOULD TOLERATE EVIL; 
JUDAISM: BOOK WRITTEN BY HAROLD SCHULWEIS OF VALLEY BETH SHALOM POSITS A DIETY 
WITH A SPLIT PERSONALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dutiful synagogue member afflicted with cancer once wrote her rabbi in 
Encino that she dreaded Yom Kippur because a major prayer recited throughout 
that solemn Jewish holiday asks, "Who shall live and who shall die . . . who 
shall be at ease and who shall be afflicted?" 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer concludes that "repentance, prayer and righteousness" can avert a 
severe divine judgment. But the anguished woman protested to the rabbi that she 
couldn't believe God had given her cancer for "some terrible unknown 
transgression." 
</P>
<P>
 For his congregant, and for tens of thousands of religiously skeptical Jews, 
Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis of Encino's Valley Beth Shalom is publishing a book 
in which he offers a new solution to an ancient philosophical problem: Why 
would a good God tolerate evil happenings? 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis posits a God with a split personality, a divinity with two different 
sides -- the God of nature who shrugs and says, "It happens," and the God of 
human relations who says, "Do the right thing" and "God helps those who help 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And, rejecting centuries of Judeo-Christian belief in an all-powerful God, 
Schulweis contends that even if worshipers are dealing with the God of human 
relations, there are problems beyond his power to ameliorate; nature must be 
allowed to take its course. 
</P>
<P>
 Although praised by some Jewish thinkers for his practical theology, the 
nationally known rabbi who has headed the San Fernando Valley's largest 
synagogue for 24 years may shock believers by portraying God as weak and 
ineffective by traditional expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But people like his cancer-afflicted congregant may welcome Schulweis' claim 
that there is no capricious figure in the heavens bringing occasional 
misfortune to "test" the faith of moral individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schulweis' view, one aspect of the divinity is Elohim, the source of 
blindly implacable nature whose sunshine and rain, earthquakes and cancer 
happen whether you've been bad or good. The other is Adonai, a transforming 
force that summons a human response to suffering and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elohim is the source of the powers of nature; Adonai is the ground of moral 
goodness," Schulweis writes in "For Those Who Can't Believe, Overcoming the 
Obstacles to Faith" (HarperCollins). 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many Hebrew names of God in the Bible, the one that appears most 
frequently is Yahweh, which became replaced in Jewish worship by Adonai ("my 
Lord") because of the sanctity of the divine name. Elohim ("God") is the name 
used in the opening chapter of Genesis before the creation of man. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Adam is created, the name Adonai is introduced in the Bible. But as 
Schulweis notes in his book, only when Adam receives the breath of life and 
interacts with nature, tilling the rain-soaked soil in the Garden of Eden, are 
the names Elohim and Adonai joined, usually translated into English as "the 
Lord God" (Genesis 2:4-7). 
</P>
<P>
 The two names are commonly found side-by-side in Jewish prayer books -- 
"Blessed art Thou O Lord our God." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis said he believes that sickness is neither a divine punishment nor an 
exercise by God to somehow test the undeserving believer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when the woman with cancer recites on Yom Kippur the line that 
"repentance, prayer and righteousness overcome the evil decree," the rabbi 
wrote, "she prays for the transformative powers of Adonai that help her mold 
the givenness of nature into ideal ends." 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean that she would teach her children by example how to cope with 
life's challenges, he said, citing a Rabbinic legend that concludes: "The 
righteous are informed of the day of their death so that they may hand the 
crown to their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis' book, to be published Sept. 14, the eve of Yom Kippur this year, 
was called the "best book of its kind" by Harold S. Kushner, author of "When 
Bad Things Happen to Good People" and, like Schulweis, a rabbi in the centrist 
Conservative branch of Judaism, and as "a masterwork" by Rabbi Alexander M. 
Schindler, president of the more liberal Reform Judaism's Union of American 
Hebrew Congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Elliot Dorff, professor of philosophy at the University of Judaism, said 
in an interview that some intellectual problems may exist in the relationship 
between Schulweis' two aspects of divinity. "But the theology is really good in 
pragmatic applications," Dorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about Schulweis' approach is that he is not pretending life is 
a bowl of cherries and yet he is not acquiescing to the terrible things that 
happen to people," Dorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rabbinical traditions have distinguished between Elohim as reflecting 
God's attribute of justice and Adonai as reflecting the divine quality of 
mercy. While Schulweis notes that tradition to show that a dual-faceted God is 
not foreign to Judaism, he disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to introduce Elohim as the god of all that is, one that is morally 
neutral," he said. "I am doing theology here, presenting an alternate way of 
looking at divinity, but this is very much a Jewish practice through the 
centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The workings of Elohim could be seen in the natural forces that caused the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, although the temblor was not a purposeful "act 
of God," Schulweis wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "Adonai was evident in the earthquake through the response 
of firemen, policemen, doctors and neighbors who helped restore lives, calm the 
frightened and rebuild the shattered lives of those around them," he said. "In 
their individual and collective behavior the community testifies to the reality 
of Adonai without denying the reality of Elohim. " 
</P>
<P>
 On the wrenching topic of the World War II-era Holocaust, an unprecedented 
massacre that has sorely tested Jewish faith to this day, Schulweis wrote that 
Elohim was reflected in the Auschwitz death camp simply because nature includes 
the aberrant economic, political and military factors that coincided to create 
the Nazi state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schulweis also pointed to "the power and mystique of Adonai" at work in 
the Holocaust, based on his experience as founding chairman of the Jewish 
Foundation for Christian Rescuers, an international body that identifies and 
offers grants to non-Jews who helped victims of Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to the record of Jewish self-sacrificing heroism on behalf of 
endangered fellow Jews, there were tens of thousands of non-Jews, Christians, 
believers and nonbelievers, young and old, who came from every walk of life to 
risk their lives and those of their children to save Jews pursued and 
persecuted by the Nazis and their collaborators," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evil that men and women do must never be allowed to eclipse the goodness 
that men and women do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis said that in a predominantly secular society such as the United 
States many people are blind to signs of godliness (in Hebrew, "elohut"), a 
term that the rabbi thought might best describe the often unnoticed, sometimes 
surprising functions of Adonai.  
</P>
<P>
 The current rapprochement of Israel and Jordan is an example, he said. "We see 
this as something secular, but that's because we've replaced the idea of 
godliness at work in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The deity posited by Schulweis is neither all-powerful nor all-knowing. And 
the Bible stories indicate that he changes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mutability of God is profoundly Jewish and I would hope Christian too," 
Schulweis said in an interview. "It's certainly a more interesting God." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis, 69, said that his working title for the book was "When You're Older 
You'll Understand," because he said the big questions about religion asked by 
young people are too often postponed and usually never answered adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi said that so many people tend to think of prayer falsely as a 
magical means for change. To do so leads to disillusionment, he said. Prayer 
"must respect the world that God has created," he wrote. "We may not pray 
magically for a result that defies the laws of nature or that contradicts the 
laws of logic." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis sees prayer functioning best within the Jewish understanding of a 
covenant with God that places responsibility on individuals as "an active 
partner with the Divine Other," not a passive recipient of commandments or 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from both mystical and rationalistic Judaic sources, as well as from 
centuries of rabbinical commentaries, Schulweis said a strong tradition exists 
against taking biblical accounts of miracles literally. To insist the miracles 
actually happened and explore the story no further loses the symbolic meaning 
of the stories, he said. When that happens, the human craving for miracles 
weakens the human obligation to do good, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bible is holy not because it is the final word but because it is the 
first word of an unending tradition," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a classic rabbinical story, Schulweis said that Rabbi Akiba some 
1,900 years ago was challenged by a pagan with the question, "Whose deeds are 
greater, those of God or man?" Akiba replied, "Greater are the deeds of man." 
</P>
<P>
 To the pagan surprised by the answer, Rabbi Akiba brought forth sheaves of 
wheat and loaves of bread and asked, "Which are superior?" the raw ingredient 
or the usable finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweis said that there is a "cooperative relationship between God and man" 
that skeptics and nominal believers tend to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said, a Jewish prayer known as a kiddush benediction is not made 
over grapes but over the wine that is produced by human intelligence. "Wine, 
not grapes, represents the fullest expression of the holy, the transaction 
between the godly human and non-human nature."

GROUP PLANS JEWISH CULTURAL FAIR; HERITAGE: EVENT AT PIERCE COLLEGE NEXT MAY IS 
SEEN AS A REFLECTION OF A POPULATION SHIFT FROM THE WESTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Alliance announced Friday that it will stage a one-day 
Jewish cultural fair next May on the Pierce College campus that in effect will 
replace the now-dormant Jewish community festival once held on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see the projected $100,000 budget for the Valley Jewish Festival, which 
would surpass previous such festivals, as a reflection of the Jewish 
population's shift from the Westside to the San Fernando, Simi, Conejo and 
Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiautonomous San Fernando Valley Alliance was created earlier this year 
based on its founders' belief that the Jewish population may be as much as 
250,000 in the suburban regions to the north and northwest of the Los Angeles 
Jewish Federation Council headquarters located on Wilshire Boulevard just east 
of the Beverly Hills city line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Jewish population in the valleys has grown so large, it is 
incumbent upon us to serve our community with convenient programs," said Encino 
businessman Earl Greinetz, president of the Valley Alliance. "We have way too 
many people in the valleys for us to say a major Jewish event has to be located 
on the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor fair known as the Exodus Festival was held in the San Fernando 
Valley in 1989, 1991 and 1993, but Greinetz said attendance projections for the 
Valley Jewish Festival on May 21, 1995, reach as high as 50,000 -- compared to 
about 40,000 two years ago -- with hundreds of exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're changing the name," he said. "We felt the name 'Exodus' got people 
confused with the Exodus program that helped Russian Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Greinetz, who will be in New York City this weekend for the quarterly meeting 
of the Council of Jewish Federations, said it is not known whether another 
Jewish festival will be staged at Rancho Park on the Westside. That festival 
has not been held for three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, even the recent Exodus festivals in the San Fernando Valley 
exceeded the turnouts at the Westside fairs sponsored by the Los Angeles Jewish 
Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Shuster, a Woodland Hills businessman, was named chairman of the new 
Valley Jewish Festival. Shuster is a past president of Temple Ner Maarav in 
Encino and is on the board of directors at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan on making this festival bigger and better -- have a better children's 
park, more emphasis on ethnic food and a very professional musical concert, 
among other things," Shuster said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY FIELDS SOFTBALL DEBATE ABOUT MIXED-GENDER 
TEAMS; SPORTS: SUITS THREATENED BECAUSE A CO-ED TEAM WAS MOVED TO AN ALL-MALE 
LEAGUE AND MEN BEGAN PLAYING ON ALL-FEMALE TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The battle of the sexes has flared up on softball diamonds here, raising a 
question about fairness on the athletic field: If some women have a right to 
compete against men, do others have a right not to? 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began when the manager of a mixed-gender team managed to get it 
transferred from the co-ed league to an all-men's league. In response, men 
began showing up on teams in the previously all-women's league, provoking 
protests from the female players that it was unfair and dangerous to make them 
play against men. 
</P>
<P>
 The gender conflict, brewing for weeks, has spawned accusations of 
discrimination and threats of lawsuits from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 These are hotly debated issues in a city where softball is taken very 
seriously. Ball fields are constantly used here, with game results printed 
weekly in both a local newspaper and a separate publication for softball 
enthusiasts. About 260 teams, including nearly 4,000 residents, now play in the 
league that is administered year-round by the Santa Clarita Parks, Recreation 
and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the Northridge earthquake, while many neighborhoods still lacked 
water or power, several softball players appeared at the emergency tent outside 
City Hall and asked to register for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began in the winter of 1992 when Richard Jewett, manager of 
Softball Express, which has both men and women players, asked park officials to 
register the team in a men's division. The squad, Jewett said, so dominated 
other co-ed teams that its players were bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just not competitive," said Jewett. "It wasn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials hesitated, but were advised by City Atty. Carl Newton 
that it could be illegal to block a team from playing in the league they 
desired, based solely upon the players' gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one had really asked about this sort of thing," said Chris Daste, city 
recreation supervisor. "It was a real dilemma for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Express was admitted to play the winter 1992 season in the lowest 
category of the men's division, the lower C league. The team did so well it 
advanced to the upper C league, where it has been competing since July. 
</P>
<P>
 Male players were surprised by the presence of women players on the Softball 
Express' team, but had few protests, Jewett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest reaction to it wasn't 'They shouldn't be here.' It was 'More 
power to them,' " said Jewett. "There have been a few egos that have been 
frayed, (but) it hasn't been a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulties began, all agree, when the exception granted for Softball Express 
-- allowing a mixed gender team to compete in a single sex league -- set a 
precedent that was used the other way around by other teams. A handful of men, 
sometimes the team manager or a player's spouse, began appearing on rosters in 
the women's league. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women players complained -- vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's cheating," said Anne Marie Schoenmann, manager of the women's 
Pirettes team, which plays in the most competitive women's class, the A league. 
</P>
<P>
 Her squad has left the field rather than play against a team that fielded male 
players. Just Thursday evening, they walked off the diamond in the fifth inning 
when their opponents produced a male catcher, forfeiting the game -- their 
third for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wanted to play co-ed, we would play co-ed," said Schoenmann. "I played 
co-ed and it's a whole different game." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenmann said her players are concerned about possible injury, especially if 
there is a collision between a runner and the catcher at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 City recreation officials say they'll allow mixed teams to compete in 
single-sex leagues for the remainder of this season, but will send them back to 
the co-ed leagues in October, when the next season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Santa Clarita provides "substantially equivalent" programs for men 
and women, it can keep men and women in separate leagues, City Atty. Newton 
said he now believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all you can do in this kind of situation is make a decision that will 
try to please the majority of the people," Daste said. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Express will register for the men's league once again, Jewett said, 
and fight to stay in the male league. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials say the team will forfeit any games in which it uses 
illegal players. Since team rosters don't have to be submitted to park 
officials until weeks after the season begins, a showdown will probably occur 
at the inaugural game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we show up for the first game, we are going to put the girls on the 
field," Jewett said.

SURPRISES BENEATH THE CAP; BASEBALL: OWNERS HAVE OTHER CONTENTIOUS ITEMS ON 
THEIR AGENDA THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IF THEY IMPLEMENT THEIR LAST, BEST 
OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If baseball's major league owners ultimately declare a bargaining impasse and 
unilaterally implement their last, best offer to the players' union, it will 
include, of course, the much debated salary cap, along with significant 
restrictions on free agency and the elimination of salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The implemented offer might also include a laundry list of other less 
publicized items on which there has been virtually no negotiation, let alone 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to those items Friday, Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, 
said many in themselves represented "old-fashioned union busting" and would, as 
a package, wipe out 20 to 25 years of union progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kinds of things you do if the goal is to destroy any 
organization that represents players, and they wouldn't have even (proposed) 
them if that wasn't their goal," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union busting? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's errant nonsense," owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch said. "I've said 
many times, publicly and privately, that baseball needs a strong union. It 
can't function without the players being ably represented. They have been and 
continue to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch and the owners presented their so-called "non-economic" proposals to 
the union on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said Friday that amid the salary-cap debate, there has been virtually no 
opportunity to discuss these other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may not be able to implement them because there has been no bargaining 
on them, but that's a litigation point," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still hope it doesn't come to (unilateral implementation of a new system), 
but I still think that's their objective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they will only do it if they want the strike to continue next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times on Friday obtained a copy of the union memorandum sent to players 
describing the "non-economic" proposals. It would, among other things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow a club to terminate a player's contract for any reason. A player may 
now be terminated only if he lacks skill or materially breaches his contract, 
and in the case of a disciplinary release the club must show "just cause." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow a club to negotiate contract clauses that restrict or eliminate a 
player's rights as defined in a bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate the 20% maximum cut rule for all players eligible for free agency 
and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate the right of a five-year player to demand a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate the requirement that a player must consent to an injury 
rehabilitation assignment to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prevent any player called up in September from being credited with major 
league service time, delaying his eligibility for free agency, arbitration and 
the pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restrict a player on the disabled list to 50% service time rather than 
100%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch has said that if the salary-cap issue is resolved, all else will fall 
into place quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, disputed that, saying nothing has been resolved in the 20 
months since the owners voted to reopen negotiations a year early, so quick 
resolution to everything that would still be on the table seems unlikely -- 
particularly if the owners are serious about their "non-economic" proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap, of course, is pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 The union says it will never accept it, and the owners remain unlikely to 
remove it, since it is their last, formal offer that would be implemented, if 
it comes to that, and Ravitch has said the owners do not intend to play under 
the old rules again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 How would the union respond? By filing a grievance with the National Labor 
Relations Board and resuming the strike next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 However, neither step may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said Friday he expects Congress to move against baseball's antitrust 
exemption if the strike is still going after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case grows stronger the longer the stoppage goes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Removal of the exemption would allow the union to seek injunctive relief 
through the courts. The union, Fehr pointed out, would not have had to use a 
strike as leverage against possible implementation by the owners if the owners 
did not have protection under the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there was no indication on Day 14 of the strike when formal 
negotiations will resume. A management source said the sides may meet 
individually with federal mediators Monday, then resume talks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediators called for a recess Thursday when it became obvious again that 
owners and players were locked into their ideological positions and emotions 
began to flare. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the liveliest exchanges, according to observers, took place Chicago 
White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf kept asking the players what percentage of the 
revenue they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want and we'll cut a deal," Reinsdorf repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapped Fehr, "How much profit do you want, Jerry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf didn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some shouting and frustration, but there was also a lot of informal 
communication between owners and players who had never talked before," a union 
lawyer said. "It's hard to quantify the significance of that, but it could 
prove useful." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer added, however, that the owners' new voting rule -- requiring 21 of 
the 28 clubs to approve a settlement -- has left the union increasingly 
concerned. 
</P>

 He said it may be impossible for any group of owners -- high-revenue, 
low-revenue or in between -- to put together a deal, and "that's the worst of 
all scenarios."

FULL-SPEED AHEAD; SCHUMACHER LEADS AGGRESSIVE GENERATION OF FORMULA ONE DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 25, Michael Schumacher is on track to become Formula One motor racing's 
youngest world champion and Germany's first. He is heading into Sunday's 
Belgian Grand Prix with a 31-point lead over his closest rival, Damon Hill of 
Williams Renault, and almost a home-court advantage on his favorite circuit, 
the one that launched his spectacular career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Michael Schumacher fan club has laid claim to an entire dell near the 
Spa-Francorchamps circuit with campers, lawn furniture and German flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the Benetton Ford quarters smell like success -- or is that the 
flowers on the hospitality tables? German, Italian and British reporters trade 
kisses on both cheeks with Schumacher's stylish press aide, sip cappuccino and 
wait for the man they herald as Ayrton Senna's heir. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schumacher isn't having any premature talk about the championship. He 
looks as far into the future as the next race and will not be blinded by a 
promise of victory. That could only derail his nearly palpable concentration, 
his firm sense of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not world champion now and as long as there is a theoretical chance not 
to be world champion, I will not think I am world champion," he said. "This is 
one part of my discipline which has always kept me on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher has a deep tan that sets off his green eyes and sandy hair. Dressed 
in jeans and a suede jacket, he looks remarkably relaxed amid the controversies 
and tragedy surrounding this year's competition -- including the death of his 
idol, Senna, a personal loss and a reminder after 12 fatality-free years that 
this is, after all, a dangerous sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the suspension over missing a black-flag penalty at Silverstone 
during the British Grand Prix, which the team is appealing. If Schumacher loses 
the hearing next week, as is likely, he will sit out the grand prixes of Italy 
and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the sport's ruling body, FIA, also announced that an investigation of 
electronic drivers' aids banned last year had turned up a launch control in 
Benetton's car. The organization could not prove the Benetton team had used the 
software, and other teams have since acknowledged that they also left some of 
the illegal aids in their systems, but do not use them. All now must be out by 
the Italian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was the flash fire that engulfed Schumacher's teammate, 
Dutchman Jos Verstappen, during the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in July. 
The FIA has accused Benetton of illegally removing a gas filter and Benetton 
faces suspension if the FIA finds against the team at a hearing in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher does not want to discuss these unpleasant subjects, either. Why 
talk about penalties that might not happen? He has told the German news 
magazine Focus that it would be unacceptable if it turned out that the team 
removed the filter without permission from the FIA and that the missing filter 
caused the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does that mean? Would he leave Benetton? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need to discuss this at the moment," he said. "It's not proven in 
one direction or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 At the mention of Senna's name he clams up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had strong feelings for Ayrton. He has been my idol," he said. "I just 
can't forget what happened. It's hard for me to go through all the feelings 
again. That's why I don't want to talk too much about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But was he robbed by the tragedy of a chance to prove himself against the 
best? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I was robbed," he said. "It's a shame Ayrton did not have the 
opportunity to drive the championship through to the end. . . . On the circuit, 
there's still competition going on. I would say good competition. Certainly not 
as good as it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent that Schumacher's relaxed demeanor is part of his discipline. 
He works at putting these issues out of his mind, out of the way of his 
driving. He is dressed casually, but on closer inspection his casual leather 
shoes and belt and jacket look beautifully put together and he seems, well, 
intensely calm, if that is possible. He is cool, deliberate in choosing his 
words, very polite. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is Schumacher's guard against early fame and success, for which 
he says he was completely unprepared. He knows that he cannot allow himself to 
be thrown off course by the money and glamour, or by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher grew up in Kerpen, near Cologne, the son of a mason who encouraged 
him in Go-Kart racing, but who could not afford to finance Formula racing. 
Schumacher says he was "lucky to have had very basic parents" with whom he 
enjoyed a good relationship -- one he credits with keeping him on an even keel 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from karting to Formula Ford single-seat cars to Formula Three 
racing at the end of the 1980s, with financial help from sponsors. In 1990, he 
won the German Formula Three championship and then surprised racing observers 
by signing with the Sauber-Mercedes sports car team. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Schumacher burst into Formula One at the Belgian Grand Prix when 
the Jordan team picked him to sit in for their regular driver, Bertrand Gachot, 
and he qualified a surprising seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton grabbed him, and the next year he won his first race at Spa. This 
year he has won seven of the first 10 races in a 16-race season, leading a new, 
younger generation of drivers who are slightly more aggressive than their more 
experienced predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams are skeptical of Schumacher's meteoric rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that Benetton is cheating the whole time," Frank Williams, chief 
of the Williams Renault team was quoted as saying in Stern, the German weekly 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton team manager Joan Villadelprat responds that others are jealous. 
Schumacher attributes his success to discipline. Fitness is the key to his 
concentration, he says. He works out five days a week in the winter, three or 
four in the summer, keeps a tough regimen of cycling for the heart, muscle 
exercises for the neck and back to hold his head around high-mach corners, and 
stretching. He eats healthy food, feels guilty over an occasional wurst and 
pommes frites, and sleeps eight to 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always wanted to be more fit than necessary . . . for any 
circumstances," he said. "I didn't want to be fit just through the end of the 
race. I wanted to be fit even if I had the flu, if I'm under pressure and need 
more concentration than under normal times. I think that's why under tough 
moments, I perform normally and don't have the break people expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Disciplined in work and determined to relax. Balance is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very important that you don't lose the normal things," he said. 
"And if you suddenly can't enjoy yourself with the normal things, just looking 
at the sky and seeing the moon or the stars, then I think you have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 So Schumacher walks his dog and spends time alone with his fiancee, Corinna 
Betsch. He lived in Germany until the fans and publicity overwhelmed him. After 
one autograph-seeker barged into his living room through a terrace door while 
he was watching television, he moved to Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many famous people live there that when I went there, I wasn't a famous 
person," he said. "It's changing a little now, but not in a way that upsets 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't looking for fame and was not terribly happy with it at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get used to it, cope with it," he said. "It was a tough time. But 
there came a time when I had to decide, either I get used to it or I have to 
stop doing it. Because I love the sport so much, I had to get used to it and 
even find some excitement from it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is part of the maturing of Schumacher that his teammates describe. Team 
manager Villadelprat, a veteran in the business, says that Schumacher has grown 
enormously in the three years he has been on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have fast drivers who make a lot of mistakes, who are unhappy to be 
second when maybe that's all they need to win the championship," he said. 
"Michael realizes it's more important to win the championship than the race."  
</P>
<P>
 He likens him to Senna in his interest in the technical side of the sport, and 
in his cleverness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's clever enough to wait for the right moment to pass and has the speed of 
a young kid," Villadelprat said. "He's the type of driver who doesn't take too 
long to go fast. One lap and he's in the times."  
</P>
<P>
 In public, Schumacher is careful, diplomatic. Asked about the change from Ford 
to Renault engines announced this week for next season, he tries to thank his 
winning Ford team while embracing the obviously better Renault. But 
Villadelprat says that the driver lets his hair down with his teammates, 
happily joining them for drink at a team party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lives with us, works with us. He's there to do a job and we're there to do 
a job," Villadelprat said. "The only way to go 100 kilometers (per hour) on a 
corner is if you feel everyone is behind you. Michael's one of the boys."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; LANDING ON WHEATLEY PLACE; MICHIGAN 
RUNNING BACK FINDS OUT THIS SEASON IF HIS ROLL OF THE DICE WILL PAY THE 
DIVIDENDS HE IS SEEKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At last the truth can be told: The answer to the greatest Michigan football 
mystery since 'Why can't Bo win Rose Bowls?' is located along a stretch of 
make-believe property that runs from Atlantic Avenue to Ventnor Avenue and ends 
at Marvin Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them, 'The Flamingos,' " said Tyrone Wheatley, budding Monopoly real 
estate magnate, All-American tailback and centerpiece of the Wolverine 
off-season drama. "The reason I call them 'The Flamingos' is because it's like 
a little resort . . . right before you go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley knows all about monopolies. He and San Diego State's Marshall Faulk 
cornered the college rushing market last season and then had to decide between 
the NFL draft and returning to school. Faulk bolted, but Wheatley wasn't so 
sure. Should he stay or should 
</P>
<P>
 he go? The choice seemed like no choice at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-five pick or letter sweater? Face the Indianapolis Colts or Indiana 
Hoosiers? Advance to Go and collect millions, or settle for a Chance card? 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley thought about it for a while, trusted his instincts and gave the NFL 
one of his famous crowbar stiff-arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He was staying for his senior season. A campus rejoiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the trouble with Chance cards is that sometimes they bear bad news. 
Wheatley got his on Wednesday, when X-rays revealed a second-degree separation 
of his right shoulder, caused by a hit he had taken during a contact drill a 
day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the initial prognosis was announced -- Wheatley is a likely no-show 
for the season opener Sept. 3 against Boston College, and a maybe against Notre 
Dame Sept. 10 and Colorado Sept. 24 -- you could almost hear the 
I-told-you-so's from second-guessers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley, said his critics, took a huge, unnecessary financial risk by passing 
up the NFL. This is what he gets in return: his worst nightmare -- another 
injury to the shoulder he hurt last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nightmare. If any of this bothers Wheatley, he isn't showing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I didn't get injured many would say, 'He still should have gone pro 
and taken the money,' " Wheatley said Friday. "I haven't lost anything I said I 
wanted to strive for. Sure, a Heisman would be nice, but a degree from 
Michigan, a Big Ten championship and the Rose Bowl is what my main goals were 
and still are at this time. Am I disappointed? Yes, but I'm not out for the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned Wheatley-watchers aren't surprised by the response. Other players 
would have gone into seclusion. Wheatley returned phone calls hours after the 
bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, most other players in Wheatley's position wouldn't be at 
Michigan. They would have joined Faulk and ditched college for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, Tyrone is just a little different guy and he'll do the unexpected 
thing," said Michigan Coach Gary Moeller, who didn't have a clue about 
Wheatley's senior season preferences until shortly before the Jan. 10 news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Moeller and anyone else who hums "The Victors" in their sleep 
could have saved themselves a peptic ulcer or two by simply asking Wheatley 
about Monopoly. Understand the significance of those three yellow properties -- 
Atlantic, Ventnor and Marvin Gardens -- and in a weird sort of way you 
understand why Wheatley is on scholarship and not on an NFL payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to have a plan," said Wheatley at the recent Big Ten media day. "You 
got to have a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 And Wheatley's plan goes like this: Never over-extend yourself. Never rush to 
a decision. Never change the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wheatley wheels and deals until he collects all three Flamingos and lets 
everyone else battle for Boardwalk and Park Place in the volatile high-rent 
district. After all, what's the use of owning a blue property if you can't 
enjoy the view? 
</P>
<P>
 "The way a lot of guys get out of the game quickly is they buy early, then try 
to put hotels up and they have no money," Wheatley said. "Then if you hit me, 
you're out of the game. You mortgage your property and then I buy that 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just patience. Just collect the rent and then you get enough money. Then 
you buy your houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is mostly why Wheatley is back at Michigan. He could have left early 
and no one would have said boo, especially after he rushed for 1,357 yards and 
scored 17 touchdowns as a sophomore and 1,129 yards and 14 touchdowns as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 And just think what he might have done last year if Moeller hadn't stuck him 
on the Wolverine punt coverage team, where Wheatley first injured his shoulder 
while making a tackle against Illinois. He missed two games, including a 
crucial matchup against Wisconsin, which the Wolverines lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he faces a similar layoff. Team doctors will wait until next week to 
re-examine the newest injury, but when he does return to lineup it will be 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a lot of fancy moves," Wheatley said. "It's just me and the 
trusty stiff-arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy or not, Wheatley was usually at his best when it counted most. He ripped 
through Notre Dame for 318 all-purpose yards and two scores. He gained 192 
yards at Penn State, 105 against Ohio State, 124 against North Carolina State 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl. A few months later, at the Big Ten outdoor track and 
field meet, Wheatley won the 110-meter high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great back," said John Becker, the Rams' director of player personnel. 
"He has size (6 feet 1, 226 pounds), power, speed, productivity and he's played 
well in the big games. At this point, there's probably nobody coming back in 
their senior year with his credentials." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Ram all-pro Jerome Bettis, the former Notre Dame star who was 
there the day Wheatley blew by the Irish bench on his way to a 27-yard 
touchdown reception in 1992, "He has a Rodney Hampton stiff-arm. He gives it to 
you, keeps his balance and still gets up the field. He has all the attributes 
to be a star in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the Big Ten will have to do. Wheatley doesn't mind a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know it was going to be that big a deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't every day that someone tears up his winning Lotto ticket, but 
Wheatley sort of did. Had he left early, Becker said, Wheatley would have been 
a definite top-10 pick and a probable top-five selection. Instead, Wheatley 
stayed put, passing up the NFL's big bucks for another season's worth of 
Monopoly money. 
</P>
<P>
 This was no small decision. San Diego State's Faulk, the No. 2 choice, came 
out early and got a reported seven-year, $17.2-million contract with a 
$5.1-million signing bonus. Tennessee's Heath Shuler, another undergraduate, 
was chosen third and received an eight-year, $19.25-million deal with a 
$5-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Adams left Texas A&M after his junior season and got a five-year, 
$6.5-million package with a $2.75-million bonus. UCLA's Jamir Miller, the No. 
10 pick, bolted after his junior year and recently signed a four-year contract 
worth more than $4 million with a $2-million-plus bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley got a summer job. Now that he is back on campus, he'll get a $270 
monthly scholarship stipend to pay for a $300-a-month apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it isn't about money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is 99% true. Wheatley said he wants to leave Michigan with a degree, not 
a broken promise. He wants to set Wolverine rushing records -- he begins this 
season fifth on the yardage list, 1,359 yards behind leader Jamie Morris. He 
wouldn't mind a Heisman or another Rose Bowl appearance or, if Michigan's depth 
holds up, a chance at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, Wheatley, 22, would like to have fun. He wants to be a 
college senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to be controlled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He means it too. Wheatley saw what happened to the more prominent members of 
Michigan's basketball team, the famed Fab Five. He watched his friend Chris 
Webber leave after only two seasons for the riches of the NBA. Webber later 
told Wheatley that he missed college life. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley saw the grip basketball had on his buddy Jalen Rose, the star guard 
who, along with center Juwan Howard, left after his junior season. Rose, 
especially, couldn't wait to make basketball a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to seize the moment right there," said Wheatley of Webber, Rose 
and Howard. "I got all my life to work and pay bills. I got one more year to 
sit around and be a big kid. I can still say, 'Oops, I made a mistake.' After I 
graduate, you can't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller and the rest of the Wolverines always suspected that Wheatley liked to 
run against the grain. But to turn down millions? And for what, to pull double 
duty on the punt-coverage team? To risk another injury? 
</P>
<P>
 Said linebacker Steve Morrison: "I just can remember sitting there with some 
of the other guys and hearing them say, 'Tyrone is gone. He's going to make all 
that money.' I don't know why, but I said, 'I will not be surprised if Tyrone 
sticks around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moeller, who had gone through this sort of thing with Desmond 
Howard and John Vaughn -- both left -- tried to walk the fine line between 
coach and counselor. When Wheatley asked for advice -- and it didn't happen 
very often -- Moeller did what he could. The Michigan coach made some calls to 
friends in the NFL and confirmed that Wheatley would be gone, more than likely, 
by the seventh pick of the draft. Big money, but not as big as if Wheatley 
waited another year and moved closer to the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller also made his own abbreviated pitch to Wheatley. He told him he wanted 
him to stay, but that there would be no special favors during the senior 
season. And then he asked Wheatley the question that mattered, "If you leave, 
are you going to be happy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley said he'd think about it, leaving Moeller to wonder if that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I'd say yes, some days I'd say no," Moeller said. "I couldn't 
predict." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone told Wheatley to take the money and run. After all, a Heisman 
Trophy makes a wonderful doorstop, but it doesn't pay the bills. National 
championship rings are nice conversation pieces, but then what? And enough 
already about the Rose Bowl. What, you want another free meal at Lawry's? 
</P>
<P>
 But Wheatley wasn't married to the money. This was the guy who, after a big 
Michigan victory, would celebrate by taking his younger brother to a movie. He 
doesn't drink. He isn't extravagant. His idea of a good time is playing his 
beloved Monopoly or a football video game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it also helped that he had an NCAA-approved $2-million injury 
insurance policy. He had an education degree in the waiting. Best of all, he 
had his own timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so much weighing a gamble," said Wheatley, who renewed the 
insurance policy for the 1994 season. "It was, 'Which dream do I want?' It 
wasn't a wrong or right choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Wheatley's final decision didn't leak to Moeller until the day before 
a planned news conference. And even then, there were conflicting reports. At 
one point, Moeller, who was a semi-wreck by this time, heard Wheatley was 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley finally stopped by Moeller's office to deliver the news: He wasn't 
going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A relieved Moeller became a publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, you go home, go get cleaned up (Moeller is big on coats and ties for news 
conferences) and then you get back here. I'll put together some notes and. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, Coach," said Wheatley, "I'm better when I just talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 So he talked. And people everywhere listened and were amazed. Wheatley began 
receiving bags of mail from fans, alumni, parents, teachers and children, 
applauding him for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote one mother: "No 'Stay in School' commercial could compete with what 
you've done." 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet if any opposing Big Ten coaches dropped a note of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley was overwhelmed by the response. He said he felt proud of the choice 
and comfortable with the risks. But he also has a confession to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have gone (No.) 1, it probably would have affected (the 
decision)," he said. "Fifth through eighth is pretty large. But if you're 
guaranteed first, no way in the world you can pass that up." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no guarantees Wheatley will do better than a top-five pick in next 
year's draft. The shoulder injury could linger . . . he could have a couple of 
so-so games . . . his offensive line could struggle -- any one of them could 
affect his chances to earn, as he puts it, "the whole pot of gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller will do his part. The Wolverine offense is built around the rushing 
attack. Which means that Wheatley, if he misses no more than a few games, 
should carry 200 times. Word is that Wheatley also will be used more often as a 
receiving threat. He caught 14 passes last year, a figure that could double. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is his competition. At the moment, there is no quarterback 
or running back who can match Wheatley's resume. That may change, depending on 
the progress of quarterbacks Rob Johnson of USC and Steve Stenstrom of 
Stanford, or, say, Rutgers sophomore halfback Terrell Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Rams' Becker predicts that Wheatley will be the first running 
back taken next spring -- that is, if the shoulder is OK. And the No. 1 overall 
pick isn't out of the question, either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Brandt, the former Dallas Cowboy director of player personnel who now 
serves as an independent consultant, is even less hesitant to predict draft day 
success for the Michigan star. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, if you're going to pick today, I'd take Wheatley," Brandt said. "And 
if I were picking and I was (expansion franchise) Jacksonville or Charlotte, I 
wouldn't be afraid to step up to the podium and make him my No. 1 guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley could live with that. Mostly, though, he can live with himself and 
his decision to look long term rather than short. So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 He does it with the Flamingos. He does it with football.

 Parents of Northridge players are incensed over the way tickets have been 
distributed for today's Little League World Series final and are weighing 
options that include not allowing the team to take the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League officials provided Northridge with 190 tickets, but only 60 are 
above the team's first-base dugout, where all of the team's supporters have sat 
at games all week.The rest of the tickets are for the right-field area. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 family members of Northridge players will attend the game, which is 
expected to draw 40,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandparents, brothers and sisters who flew 2,500 miles for this can't even 
sit with the rest of us," said Jack Fisher, father of shortstop Matt Fisher. 
"This stinks, and if I have to pull my kid off the field to get it straightened 
out, that's what I will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Gentile, father of Justin Gentile, today's starting pitcher, contacted an 
ABC television producer and requested that the network, which is covering the 
game, step in on the team's behalf. The producer said he would do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable that they won't let 100 Northridge supporters sit 
together," said Tim Cunningham, father of catcher Matt Cunningham. STEVE HENSON

THESE COACHES HAVE A GOOD IDEA; LITTLE LEAGUE: BACA AND SAUL OF NORTHRIDGE LET 
PLAYERS ENJOY SPOTLIGHT ON EVE OF WORLD SERIES FINALE AGAINST VENEZUELA.

 Distractions were at a peak for Northridge Little Leaguers as the United 
States champions began practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Television cameras and reporters in large numbers greeted the players, who 
responded nonchalantly and began stretching and playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the workout, Manager Larry Baca gathered the players at the 
pitcher's mound and reminded them that this practice was special. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us it would be our last workout together, and to enjoy it fully," 
said Spencer Gordon, the team's right fielder. "Then he thanked us for putting 
in so much work." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will face Maracaibo of Venezuela, today at 12:30 p.m. PDT for the 
World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking time to thank the players was typical of Baca and his assistant, George 
Saul. The men have been close friends for years, meeting in the National Guard 
in the 1960s. They have coached Little League and American Legion teams 
together for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has watched them this week would wonder if they have ever raised 
their voices to a player during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 They are appreciated by the players and parents for their low-key approach. 
The spotlight has consistently been on the players, which is precisely how Baca 
and Saul want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have done all the work," Baca said. "Not a single player missed a 
single practice this entire all-star season. That's pretty amazing. I'd tell 
them to get to practice early to stretch, and you know what, they were all 
there before I was every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication obviously paid off. Northridge (20-1) defeated Springfield, 
Va., on one-hit shutouts Wednesday and Thursday to win the National 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo will offer Northridge its most severe test, however. The team is 4-0 
is Series play and defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 10-1, Thursday for the 
International championship, hitting four home runs in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hidalgo, a right-hander who throws harder than any pitcher Northridge 
has faced, probably will start. In a 4-1 victory over Taiwan on Tuesday, 
Hidalgo struck out the first 12 batters and finished with 15 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him pitch, I said there's no way he's 12 years old," said Matt 
Cassel, the Northridge first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same could be said of Northridge pitchers Nathaniel Dunlap and Peter 
Tuber, tall boys with live arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of them will start today, however. Although Baca had said Tuber would 
start, he changed his mind Friday and will go with right-hander Justin Gentile, 
who defeated Springfield on a one-hitter Wednesday. Tuber will be available in 
relief.

MORNING BRIEFING: BED CHECKS ARE TAKEN OVERBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Should anybody be shocked that Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Bill Cowher would use 
surveillance cameras to check on his players' late-night activities during 
training camp? 
</P>
<P>
 Give me a break, writes Philadelphia Daily News columnist Rich Hofmann. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Big Brother. This is just football," Hofmann wrote. "There isn't 
another sport on the planet where the players are locked up in a hotel the 
night before a home game -- a home game! -- in order to keep an eye on them. 
There isn't another sport that videotapes every minute of every practice and 
then has the coaches review those videotapes every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the logical extension of the mentality that has existed in 
football since there's been football." 
</P>
<P>
 Add curfew: Hofmann goes on to wonder what those surveillance films would 
sound like, say, with an NFL Films soundtrack voiced by the late-John Facenda, 
renowned for his thunderous voice. Hofmann speculates it would sound like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Months removed from the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field, he raised the 
dormitory window slowly, quietly. And just that quickly, he saw the opening and 
moved through it -- out the window, past the cafeteria, over the hill, faster, 
faster still, toward the midnight lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the NFL's active career rushing leader? 
</P>
<P>
 Big shoes to clean: What was Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones doing on the 
sidelines during the second half of the Cowboys' exhibition against the Houston 
Oilers in Mexico City? Talking to new Coach Barry Switzer, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Switzer, there was nothing wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry and I are fine," Switzer said. "I told him he'd need a shoeshine if 
he's going to be on the muddy field with those $800 shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Cowboys: Switzer said Jones had a right to be on the sideline because he 
paid $140 million for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if he brings a king or a princess to the sidelines," Switzer 
said. "The coaches and the players know who wins the games. I don't have any 
problem with Jerry on the sidelines as long as he keeps out of the huddle and 
doesn't try to call plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Marcus Allen of the Kansas City Chiefs, with 9,309 yards. 
</P>

Courier like a molar misses plaque." TIM KAWAKAMI

GOLF ROUNDUP; WOODS REACHES U.S. AMATEUR SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Tiger Woods of Cypress easily won his quarterfinal match 
Friday and moved a step closer to becoming the youngest U.S. Amateur champion 
in the golf tournament's 94-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus was 19 when he won his first U.S. Amateur in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods never trailed in defeating 35-year-old Tim Jackson of Germantown, Tenn., 
5 and 4, on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing to the semifinals were Oklahoma State teammates Kris Cox and 
Trip Kuehne, both juniors, and Kent senior Eric Frishette. 
</P>
<P>
 Frishette matched Woods with his 5-and-4 victory over John Curley of 
Osterville, Mass., a semifinalist last year; Kuehne defeated Christian Raynor 
of Tallahassee, Fla., 2 up, and Cox edged Ed Gibstein of Matinecock, N.Y., 1 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods took the lead by winning the fourth hole and was one under par when he 
closed out his match with a short putt for par on the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a three-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion (1991-93) who will be a 
freshman at Stanford next month, will meet Frishette in the semifinals. The 
36-hole championship final is set for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cox and Kuehne were extended to the 18th hole, where both won by making 
long birdie putts. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first three holes with birdies, Cox, 20, of San Antonio 
faltered and had to birdie the last hole to save his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Roberts' faltering finish in the second round of the NEC World Series of 
Golf opened the doors to a host of international challengers -- including Nick 
Price. 
</P>
<P>
 With three holes to go on the Firestone North course at Akron, Ohio, Roberts 
held a two-shot lead. Then he lost four shots to par with a 6-3-7 finish that 
left Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal (67) of Spain, Mark McCumber (67) and 
Steve Lowery (66) in a tie for the lead after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 They were at seven-under-par 133 and a shot ahead of a group that included 
Price (66), winner of the last two majors, Australian Greg Norman (67) and U.S. 
Open champion Ernie Els (66) of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, winner of the PGA and British Open, along with three American tour 
events and already assured of player-of-the-year honors, shot 66 and was at 134 
in his first start since some in-office surgery to remove cancerous moles from 
his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' late-round woes left him with a 70 and tied at 135 with Hale Irwin 
and Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Dave Stockton, Tom Weiskopf and Jack Kiefer were tied for 
the first-round lead at the Franklin Quest Championship, a senior tournament 
which got under way in Park City, Utah, despite Bert Yancey's fatal heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who set a scoring record of 199 in last year's tournament, Weiskopf 
and Keifer shot four-under-par 68s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Murphy, Jay Siegel, and Charles Coody were at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy King, who is one victory away from qualifying for the LPGA Hall of Fame, 
shot a three-under-par 69 for a share of the second-round lead at the du 
Maurier Classic in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 King is tied at eight-under 136 with rising star Kelly Robbins (70) and Martha 
Nause (71). 
</P>
<P>
 Liselotte Neumann, who won the British and Swedish women's opens the last two 
weeks, shot a 67 to share the day's low round with fellow Swede Annika 
Sorenstam, Jane Geddes and Robin Walton.

BUSH 'ENDS AN ERA,' RESIGNS AS USC TRACK COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Bush, who coached the track teams at both UCLA and USC, has resigned after 
four years at USC, the school said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, 67, helped revive the program at USC, coaching the Trojan men to a 
third-place finish in the NCAA meet in 1992 and a 10th-place finish this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of his athletes won NCAA individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bush, who also was coach of the Trojans' women's team in 1991 and 1992, 
was absent for about three weeks of practice last season after undergoing 
surgery for prostate cancer in February. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, he told a reporter, "I'm either going to die here or they are 
going to have to fire me," but privately he told school officials that he 
planned to coach only one more season, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 He apparently changed his mind after Ron Allice became director of USC's 
recently consolidated men's and women's track program in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked Jim to coach one more year, but on his own volition, he decided to 
resign," Athletic Director Mike Garrett said in a statement. "We're sorry to 
see him go. He was such a great ambassador for track. It's the end of an era. 
He did a lot for us at USC and helped revive our program." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bush, who was unavailable for comment, enjoyed his greatest success at 
UCLA, where he coached from 1965-84. His Bruin teams won five NCAA titles and 
finished second three times. They were 152-21 in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC men's team had a 15-11 dual-meet record under Bush; the women were 
4-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, a 1987 inductee into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, ranks as 
one of the sport's most successful coaches. His athletes included 36 NCAA 
outdoor champions and 20 Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1951 graduate of California, Bush started his coaching career as a graduate 
assistant for Cal's football team. 
</P>
<P>
 He later was an assistant track coach at Berkeley High and head track coach at 
Fullerton High, Fullerton College and Occidental.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; A BACKSIDE COMPLIMENT; FRESNO STATE 
CENTER JASON JAMES MASTERS NEW RIGHT-TACKLE POSITION FOR GOOD OF TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney was asked what had prompted the move of 
All-Western Athletic Conference center Jason James to tackle this season, he 
answered straight from the hip, or at least somewhere near there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our new quarterback (Adrian Claiborne) is left-handed, so we wanted to put 
our best lineman at right tackle to protect his backside, and nobody's got a 
bigger backside than Jason," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney said James might be the only Bulldog lineman who can adequately handle 
Ohio State, Fresno State's opponent Monday night in the Disneyland Pigskin 
Classic at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need Jason at right tackle, left tackle, right guard, left guard and 
center against the kind of guys we're playing against," Sweeney said. "They're 
unbelievably strong and can run like hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson, the No. 1 draft pick in this year's NFL draft, 
stayed in school, the Buckeyes would have been even bigger and stronger. But 
James, 6 feet 5 and 310 pounds, wasn't worried about facing Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play against him," said James, an All-Freeway League lineman his 
junior and senior years at Buena Park High. "Playing against the best makes you 
a better player. I was a little upset when I heard he was going pro. The 
coaches weren't, but I was." 
</P>
<P>
 How would James have fared against Wilkinson, a 6-5, 300-pounder who runs a 
4.9-second 40-yard dash? 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have done well," Sweeney said. "He would have graded about 50%, and 
that's all you can ask against a guy like that. But like (BYU Coach) LaVell 
Edwards said, 'Don't worry about Big Daddy, they've got a lot of Big Daddies.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney used to have a couple of nicknames for James, but they weren't 
anything as complimentary as Big Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was a freshman, he was like a doughboy," Sweeney said. "He looked 
like a loaf of bread, a refrigerator with no handle." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was during James' redshirt season. In the last three years, James has 
started 23 games at center, including the '92 Freedom Bowl and '93 Aloha Bowl, 
for one of college football's most productive offenses. In the last three 
years, the Bulldogs have ranked first, second and third nationally in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, James was a unanimous first-team All-WAC center for the 
third-highest scoring team in college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun because we knew we could do anything we wanted," James said. "We 
had been together for three years and we ran and threw very effectively. People 
overlooked the running game, but we could run the ball too." 
</P>
<P>
 That is until they faced Colorado in the Aloha Bowl. In a 41-30 loss to the 
Buffaloes, the Bulldogs amassed all of three yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had five turnovers and they scored on three of them," James said. "It 
seemed like someone was letting down on every play." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for disaster also appears high with Ohio State, co-champion of 
the Big Ten last year. The Bulldogs will start a new offensive line, except for 
James, and a quarterback who has thrown nine passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm awfully concerned about the protection," Sweeney said with a touch of Lou 
Holtz his voice. " . . . We're in deep." 
</P>
<P>
 James, however, isn't as glum as his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're young, but we have a lot of talent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the senior offensive linemen, James is said by many scouting services 
to be among the best. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. lists James as the 
fifth-best prospect for the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 James reads the hype and understands its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to produce," he said. "If I can make all-league as a tackle, that 
makes me twice as valuable. I would also be the first in Fresno State history 
to make All-WAC at two positions." 
</P>
<P>
 If he had it his way, James would be going for All-WAC at three positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can improve my quickness, I can play guard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney said James already has planted that possibility in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about playing Jason at guard on the counter trey," Sweeney said. 
"He said, 'Hey Coach, that would be great.' He said I could put in the tackle 
trap, too, if I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's a 6-5, 310-pounder doing acting like a guard? Sweeney said the 
thought of James playing guard isn't that preposterous anymore. In fact, 
Sweeney said James is even starting to look the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have to hold it in anymore," Sweeney said. "He has no gut." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sweeney said James does have plenty of guts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing Jason has going for him is confidence," he said. "He's got 
great courage and he's smart." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he's smart enough to know that tackles are more visible than 
centers. Holding is easier for referees to spot on the outside and missed 
blocks can't be camouflaged as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think I'm as quick as I need to be," James said. "I'm still 
getting used to being by myself. If you mess up at tackle, there's nobody there 
to help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney isn't expecting James to need much help. He's expecting James to be 
doing most of the helping. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unquestionably the leader out there," Sweeney said. "He's the pied piper 
of the offensive line. The young guys follow him all around in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe for this season at least, James will be called Big Daddy too.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; SHAH'S KNEE IS SOURCE OF CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today will be an important day for UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, who will find out 
if Sharmon Shah's right knee swells after a spirited workout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If it swells, Donahue said, arthroscopic surgery is indicated because of a 
cartilage problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be no 'scope," said Shah, the Bruins' No. 1 tailback who has been 
plagued with knee problems that have required two such operations in a year. 
"I'll be all right. I'm not worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He may be the only one. "Even if it doesn't swell, it doesn't mean we're out 
of the woods," said Donahue. "We really won't know until he has a hard 
practice, with hard cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 That's OK, too, Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was two-a-day drills, and I went too hard on it," he said. "I've 
got to learn that when everybody else goes half-speed, there's no sense in my 
running plays 60 yards down the field. I've got to learn my body, to understand 
when it's telling me to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 The message came two days ago when Shah was running plays, wearing the red 
jersey signifying injury. On a sweep, he slowed and began limping. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my body telling me, 'You'd better slow yourself down, because you're 
not ready for that,' " Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue agreed that it might be necessary to modify Shah's practice regimen to 
keep him available to play games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, we might have to be careful about how much he plays," Donahue said. 
"That's why we need to have Daron Washington and Shaun Williams and some of 
these other kids ready, because Sharmon might not be able to do what we'd like 
to have done, which is be in there carrying the ball 30 times a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah probably will not work in today's 5 p.m. scrimmage and practice at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add quarterback Wayne Cook to the ailing list. He has a sore arm, which 
limited his work in Friday's practice. It's an annual thing with Cook, annoying 
because of the timing, with a week until the season-opener against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably won't go Saturday, either," Donahue said. "I think with Saturday 
and Sunday to rest, it will be OK. But he needs to get in some work." JIM

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; SCRIMMAGE GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Rob Johnson completed nine of 12 passes during a 65-play, 
50-minute scrimmage Friday. Two passes were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Working alternate series with quarterbacks Kyle Wachholtz and Matt Koffler, 
Johnson drove the first offense to two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tailback Shawn Walters ran the ball impressively, and so did freshmen 
Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons.  
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Johnny McWilliams scored on a 12-yard pass from Johnson and Walters 
scored from the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson said he was pleased with the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting into the process of playing in games," he said. "We tried to 
accomplish some rhythm today." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and Sermons absorbed some big hits and Robinson said that was part 
of the preparation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see them get the hell kicked out of them, to see how they 
responded," he said. "It doesn't take a great runner to run through holes. 
Neither one seems overwhelmed by anything yet. Both can play (next Saturday 
against Washington) and do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson sat out the scrimmage because of a sore 
quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The projected starting offensive linemen -- Tony Boselli, Norberto Garrido, 
Kris Pollack, Phalen Pounds and Robert Loya -- average 6 feet 6 and 299 pounds. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Boselli, the 6-7 1/2, 305-pound tackle, on his size:

 "It's fun to be big. I love it. But it does have disadvantages. It's not a 
good feeling to be sitting in a friend's house and feel the chair start to give 
way. And lawn chairs are the worst. I have no luck with them." EARL GUSTKEY

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; HUMBERTO GONZALEZ IS READY TO FILL SOME MUCH BIGGER 
SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's 5 feet 1, maybe, on tip-toe, and his huge torso, long arms and short legs 
make him look like Terminator's mop-topped little brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally, figuratively or financially, Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez probably 
never will be as big as Julio Cesar Chavez, who once was Mexico's most towering 
personality, in sports or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, if Chavez's name was on a fight card, thousands of Mexican 
fight fans were sure to follow, cash in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Chavez struggles to erase the bad memories of three high-profile 
failures and the nagging idea that he never will be the fighter he once was, 
Gonzalez, the light-flyweight champion, is finding new clout as a rightful heir 
to the Mexican fight fans' loyalty. Which translates into major earning power. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, when he came out for the coin toss at midfield before the 
Dallas Cowboy-Houston Oiler exhibition in Mexico City, Chavez was given a clear 
indication of how far he has fallen, at least in the eyes of the crowd of 
100,000-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 He was booed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, that would have been unthinkable. But after the clownish 
majority-draw decision that saved him from Pernell Whitaker, the loss to 
Frankie Randall, and then the freakish head-butt-shortened technical decision 
victory that gave him back the World Boxing Council junior-welterweight belt in 
the Randall rematch last May, Chavez is clearly losing his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those familiar with the Mexican scene, fans there consider his 
rematch against Meldrick Taylor on Sept. 17 a bad joke and will not embrace him 
again him until he properly defeats Randall or Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even as a 108-pounder, Gonzalez, who is promoted by and fights most of his 
bouts at the Forum, is gaining momentum. And he could get a lot bigger in a 
hurry: A high-profile third fight with Michael Carbajal, whom Gonzalez beat 
last February for the WBC and International Boxing Federation belts, is being 
planned for either late this year or, more likely, early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still No. 2 (behind Chavez), but it's getting close," said Gonzalez's 
adviser, Rafael Mendoza. "That fight with Meldrick Taylor isn't going to do 
anything to benefit Chavez's popularity. Chavez is now in what you call in 
baseball a slump. One hundred and twenty thousand people booed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexicans are special -- too much pride. They are the first ones to discover 
that their own people aren't doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez recognizes that very few fighters in the lighter divisions are able 
to stir major fan interest. But, as he has built his career -- the first, 
stirring knockout loss to Carbajal, the victory in the rematch despite a huge 
cut -- his status as a box-office attraction is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was known as strictly a bomber in his early days but, after getting 
knocked out by Carbajal in 1993, came back with an intricate, in-and-out style 
that confused Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, Chavez is No. 1 and I am No. 2," Gonzalez said through an 
interpreter recently. "And that's not only in Mexico, but in the Latin American 
countries and in the United States too. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's enough for me now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already going to the point where I'm making good money for my weight. And 
I know that they will pay me more because people will follow me like they did 
with Chavez before. And that makes the difference -- if people will follow you. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I will never reach the status of Chavez, money-wise, because I don't have 
that weight. I am a little guy. I would love to be a heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez defends his title Sept. 10 at Caesars Lake Tahoe against Juan Domingo 
Cordoba. But for Gonzalez, the next big fight, obviously, is the second rematch 
with Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Carbajal's reasoning for leaving Bob Arum's Top Rank, Inc., and 
joining Don King was to maneuver himself into better bargaining position 
against Gonzalez. Also, King guaranteed him a $1-million purse for a third 
Gonzalez bout. 
</P>
<P>
 That may complicate matters for Gonzalez-Carbajal III. If Carbajal gets $1 
million, Gonzalez will demand significantly more, and nobody is sure if two 
108-pounders can stir enough interest to offset a $2-million combined purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can keep my career going without Carbajal," Gonzalez said. "If he doesn't 
want it that way, I'll fight somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mendoza: "Chiquita is quiet, he is happy with his title, he is happy with 
the money he is earning and he knows he needs Carbajal for the big payday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if Carbajal does not happen, he can always defend his title and go for 
the flyweight tile with the Russian (WBC champion Yuri Arbachakov), which is a 
very, very attractive fight anyplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gonzalez) has the market in Mexico that Carbajal doesn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal recently announced that he was going to give up the minor World 
Boxing Organization light-flyweight belt in order to hold his position as 
Gonzalez's No. 1 challenger in the IBF and WBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carbajal cannot defeat me," Gonzalez said. "You can beat Carbajal with two 
styles -- either slugging or boxing him. I had him beat in the first fight by 
slugging, but he got me. I boxed him in the second fight. In the third, I will 
have a third way: power and boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be knocked out." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The sport continues to stage some of its most entertaining brawls outside the 
ring. Last Friday, the World Boxing Assn. was asked in Nevada district court to 
explain its decision not to sanction the planned Michael Moorer-George Foreman 
heavyweight bout. The result was predictable, and just another sign of how 
sloppy and conspiratorial these major organizations can be. The WBA, 
represented by legal counsel Jimmy Binns and Elias Cordova, gave conflicting 
and often carelessly thought-out answers. Even though they hadn't examined him, 
they argued that Foreman was too old. Even though their championship committee 
took a vote on whether to allow the fight without stripping Moorer of his belt, 
they said no official request was made to get the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 In key testimony, Moorer's manager, John Davimos, said that before the WBA 
made its ruling on Foreman, Binns suggested that he could make sure all went 
well if he was given a share of Moorer's management interests. Also, Moorer's 
promoter, Dan Duva, told the court he believed part of the WBA's logic was to 
punish him for a conflict he has had with them over middleweight John David 
Jackson, who sued the organization successfully when it tried to strip him. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge Donald Mosley, after hearing a full day of testimony, ruled 
immediately that the WBA had to sanction the fight, set for Nov. 5 at the MGM 
Grand in Las Vegas. Cordova walked over to Foreman promoter Bob Arum, the 
instigator of the lawsuit, and congratulated him on the victory. Then he asked 
for the $250,000 in sanctioning fees owed the WBA for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's gratifying that something on occasion can be done, that 
you're not completely at the mercy of Don King and his cohorts," Arum said. "I 
think everybody has to wonder who are these organizations, who do they 
represent, what do they stand for, why should they have this life-and-death 
control over boxing and the fighters who participate in this sport? You take 
the WBA and who are they? And you see it's group of friends in Venezuela and a 
couple of people in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight's money breakdown: Moorer's camp is guaranteed $7.5 million, plus 
other incentives that could bring the total close to $10 million. Foreman will 
earn a guarantee of $1 million, plus the net gate receipts and other tie-ins 
that could bring him and Arum about $5 million. Already, the MGM is reporting 
that it is has sold $2.5 million in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 With the heavyweight fight back on for Las Vegas, the Roy Jones Jr.-James 
Toney fight now is looking for another site -- probably in either the Foxwoods 
Resort in Ledyard, Conn., or Atlantic City. The date for the pay-per-view show 
is Nov. 18. . . . Arum is talking about giving Oscar De La Hoya a spot on the 
Jones-Toney undercard. De La Hoya also has plans for a charity bout at the 
Grand Olympic Auditorium for later this year, then, once again, is looking at 
an L.A. grudge match against WBA junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez. 
Twice, Hernandez thought he had landed a big-money De La Hoya bout and twice De 
La Hoya has scrubbed those plans. But HBO is pushing hard for De La 
Hoya-Hernandez and hoping that its dollars can make it happen in early 1995. 
The bout would either be a 10-round nontitle fight or Hernandez would go up to 
135 to challenge for De La Hoya's WBO lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's happening with talks about De La Hoya fighting IBF lightweight 
champion Rafael Ruelas? "If we make Hernandez for January, Oscar and Ruelas 
will probably fight in April," Arum said. . . . Debbie Caplan, De La Hoya's 
former publicist, has filed a lawsuit to recover $5,000 in alleged unpaid wages 
against Steve Nelson, De La Hoya's former co-manager. Calendar

 How bad are the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you looked at us (against the San Diego Chargers on Thursday), you'd say 
we're not very good, to be honest with you," Coach Chuck Knox said. "Obviously 
we're not playing up to the level that I had anticipated, that's for sure. . . 
. But I think we've got a chance to get better if we can eliminate shooting 
ourselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to keep pressing on these players that they have to do the 
little things. We had 10 penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Knox hired a veteran NFL official to work at team practices in an 
effort to identify and eliminate such mistakes. He will do the same again this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do everything that we possibly can to get these things 
corrected, or change the people that are doing them," Knox said.

 Cornerback Darryl Henley, while saying he plans to be at Rams Park on Sunday 
for practice, is worried the team will release him because of his present bail 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I'm playing," said Henley, who has been indicted on charges of 
cocaine possession and distribution. "But again the system has put it back on 
the Rams, and I must say I'd be kind of irritated too. If I was John Shaw or 
Georgia Frontiere, when do you say 'Enough?' I don't think it's anything 
directly related to me, I think it's the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials met Friday night to discuss Henley's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams decide to keep Henley on their roster, they will have to agree to 
pay his $1-million bond in the event he flees. In addition, they will have to 
agree to let a probation officer fly on the team plane and remain in contact at 
all times on their trips. 
</P>

 Linebacker Ernest Jones, the team's third-round pick, was expected to have an 
MRI on his left knee, injured against the Chargers. If the injury is serious 
enough for him to be put on injured reserve, Jones will be unable to play or 
practice this season. T.J. SIMERS

RAIDERS GET LAST SHOT AT IMPRESSING; FOOTBALL: BORDERLINE PLAYERS FACE PRESSURE 
TO AVOID THE LAST CUTS IN TODAY'S EXHIBITION FINALE AGAINST OILERS AT HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Raider running backs Harvey Williams and Tom Rathman, today is the last 
chance to show they belong in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure? 
</P>
<P>
 Not compared to the task facing running back Randy Jordan. Today is his last 
chance to show he belongs on the team.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's exhibition finale between the Raiders and Oilers in Houston doesn't 
figure to be a hard-fought battle between big-name stars. Both teams are 
confident that a month of exhibition games have given them a pretty good idea 
of what they have. The object today will be to keep what they have safe and 
sound for next week's regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Raider Coach Art Shell put it, "The key thing in this game is to come 
out healthy. Our starters won't play a whole lot. We want to make sure they 
play a whole lot the following week." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-fought battles today will involve people like Jordan, who don't even 
know if there will be a following week for them. 
</P>
<P>
 To get that far, they must not only survive today, but Sunday as well, when 
clubs must cut seven more players from their rosters to get down to the 
allowable 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan signed as a free agent with the Raiders before last season after 
rushing for 1,134 yards at North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 He got only a dozen carries last year, gaining 33 yards, and also caught four 
passes for 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan could tell himself he was at least a bright prospect. Now, his 
future looks dimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched in the off-season as the Raiders brought in Williams, Rathman and 
fullback Derrick Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has carried the ball only eight times for 21 yards in four exhibition 
games, the rest of his playing time having been on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real comfortable with the offense," he said. "(If he doesn't get 
called on to carry the ball today), I'll just have to show what I can do on 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, but I understand they were looking for experience. That's 
why they brought in guys like Rathman and Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Jordan worried about Sunday's cut? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it a lot," he said. "I get nervous, but it all goes away once I 
get on the field. I know it's important to show what I can do (today). 
</P>
<P>
 "They must like something about me to have brought me this far. I hate the 
fact that they can't have a spot for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's fight for a roster spot would be easier if he could still depend on 
Steve Smith for moral support. Smith, a Raider fullback, was released in the 
off-season and signed with the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost a good friend," Jordan said. "He was like a brother to me. It makes 
you look at this not only as a sport, but as a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be off the team, looking for a job for myself, but all I can do is what 
I've always done. I've always been one to try and improve. They may still 
release me, but there is nothing I can do about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders no interest in seeing some of their banged-up players on the 
Astrodome's artificial turf. Defensive lineman Chester McGlockton, defensive 
backs Lionel Washington and Torin Dorn, offensive lineman Bruce Wilkerson and 
linebacker James Folston will play little, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Raiders, 3-1 in exhibitions, will play it safe with their starters and 
injured players while continuing to work on their running game, trying to cut 
down on penalties and attempting to develop some cohesiveness in their second 
and third defensive units. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the time for heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're Randy Jordan and you're running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Moon no longer shines in Houston, quarterback Warren Moon having moved on 
to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 That has left the starting job to Cody Carlson, with former USC Trojan Sean 
Salisbury battling Bucky Richardson for the backup spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' running game looks strong, especially with free-agent holdout 
Lorenzo White having come to terms with the team on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Brown, having gained a total of 172 yards in his previous two seasons, 
rushed for 1,002 yards last year and is racking up the yards in the exhibition 
season with a team-leading 129 and a 5.4-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (2-2) has beaten the San Diego Chargers and Dallas Cowboys but has 
lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills.

DUCKS ADD OVER $1 MILLION A YEAR TO KARIYA OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks increased their offer to Paul Kariya, the fourth overall pick 
in the 1993 NHL draft, by more than $1 million per year over three years, 
sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the new offer is for a three-year deal worth at least $6 
million, including signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures would give Kariya, 19, an average annual compensation richer 
than that of second pick Chris Pronger, who signed a four-year, $7-million deal 
with Hartford that the Ducks had previously called "an aberration." Ottawa's 
Alexandre Daigle, the No. 1 pick, signed a five-year deal worth $12.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Kariya stalled this summer when agent Don Baizley sought an 
NHL interpretation on Kariya's potential free-agent status if he doesn't sign 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Baizley says there "is no anti-Anaheim sentiment" but contends that because 
Kariya, who will turn 20 in October, will be too old to re-enter the draft if 
he remains unsigned, he should become an unrestricted free agent.

DEL MAR; OWNER DOUBLES HIS CHANCES BUT NOT HIS FUN IN CHULA VISTA 
</P>

 Sid Craig has these two mares. He loves them both, though the younger of the 
two, as is often the case, is a bit more rambunctious. 
</P>
<P>
 These two give him a problem, albeit a pleasant problem. They are competitive 
sorts, so much so that he prefers to keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig has a real dilemma this week because the vagaries of horse racing have 
caused his Paseana and Exchange to be entered in the same race here Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 With Craig's mares going head to head in the $200,000 Chula Vista Handicap 
over 1 1/16th miles, only three others have had the audacity to challenge them: 
Magical Maiden, the defending champion, Golden Klair and Glass Ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the owner does not relish the thought of watching his mares race 
against each other. In fact, he is totally against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have two different trainers going two different directions," Craig said. 
"I made suggestions and tried a bunch of excuses, but it came down to this race 
being the best for both of them when it comes to the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron McAnally trains Paseana, a 7-year-old, and Bill Spawr trains Exchange, a 
6-year-old. Both have the Breeders' Cup on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's sentiments are strictly personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work daily with both trainers," he said, "and I like them both. I like and 
know both horses. It's like you have two kids vying for the same thing. Which 
one of them do you want to win?" 
</P>
<P>
 The trainers have feelings too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We win the race and I've got my arms around one guy's shoulders and I'm 
consoling the other," Craig said. "It's not a good position to be in." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a position Craig experienced after the 1992 Breeders' Cup Distaff at 
Gulfstream, when Paseana won by four lengths under Chris McCarron and Exchange 
finished eighth of 14 under Laffit Pincay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was screaming for Paseana," Craig said, "and Pincay was covered with 
mud and Spawr was just quietly slinking away. I swore I'd never do it again, 
run these horses against one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Says Paseana vs. Exchange is a much more compelling match than Soviet 
Problem vs. Mamselle Bebette in last Sunday's match race. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called that The Showdown at the Seashore," Craig said, "but this is 
really the showdown at the seashore." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's mares present interesting contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paseana's beautiful," Craig said. "She's very feminine. Exchange is obstinate 
and won't train. She's bigger, maybe 200 pounds more than Paseana. She drives 
her jockey nuts, getting ahead and slowing down to wait for everyone else. 
Paseana isn't a problem like that. She just runs by other horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he have a favorite? 
</P>
<P>
 "The trainers will read it," Craig laughed. "They'll tell the horses." Horse 
Racing Notes

 Gold Splash, coming back from a back injury, is the 9-5 morning-line favorite 
in today's $75,000 Osunitas Stakes for fillies and mares over 1 1/16th miles on 
the turf course. Corey Nakatani gets the ride. Second choice at 5-2 is Re Toss 
with Eddie Delahoussaye and third at 3-1 is Queens Court Queen with Pat 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse Award-winner Phone Chatter might not have had her favorite distance, a 
mere 6 1/2 furlongs, for her comeback Thursday, but she won impressively 
regardless. "We're not trying to make a sprinter out of her," trainer Dick 
Mandella said. "She's naturally that good." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley and Nate Hubbard received five-day suspensions effective Monday 
for violations of riding rules. . . . Concept Win, the 4-5 favorite with Gary 
Stevens aboard, ran a 1:08 1/5 over six furlongs to win the $60,000 Crazy Kid 
on Friday. That was the fastest six furlongs at Del Mar since 1992. He paid 
$3.60 to win. Ojai was second and Recommendation, rallying from far back, was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner In Rio beat Irish Approach by a neck to win the $111,800 Seneca 
Handicap over 1 5/8 miles on turf at Saratoga. It was the second consecutive 
Seneca victory for jockey Mike Smith, who rode Fairy Garden to victory last 
year. He also rode Diwer to victory in 1990. Asserche was another 5 1/4 lengths 
behind in third in the field of nine. Dinner In Rio was timed in 2:44 4/5 on a 
course still soft from Thursday's rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Rumble, ridden by Richard Migliore, will try to go four for four in 
Saratoga stakes in the 1 1/8-mile Whitney Handicap today. Thunder Rumble, 
unraced last year because of physical problems, won the 1 1/8-mile Jim Dandy 
and 1 1/4-mile Travers for 3-year-olds at Saratoga in 1992. He returned this 
year to win the 1 1/8-mile Saratoga Cup Aug. 6. Thunder Rumble will be one of 
five Grade I stakes winners in the Whitney field; the others are Devil His Due, 
Mike Smith; Colonial Affair, Jose Santos; Pistols And Roses, John Velasquez, 
and West By West, Pat Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Red will try to become the third horse in 78 years to sweep 
Saratoga's three stakes for 2-year-olds. The winner of the six-furlong Sanford 
on June 24 and the 6 1/2-furlong Saratoga Special on Aug. 11 will run in the 
seven-furlong Hopeful on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romy caught 6-5 favorite Roman Heiress in the late stretch for a half-length 
victory in the $30,000 Double Delta Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Arlington 
International Racecourse. Romy, ridden by Juvenal Diaz, covered a mile on the 
turf course in 1:37 4/5 seconds and paid $6.40, $3.40 and $3. Roman Heiress 
returned $2.80 and $2.40 and Laura's Pistolette paid $3.30.

ARCANGUES, 133-1 WINNER OF CUP CLASSIC, RETIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arcangues, who scored one of the biggest upsets in thoroughbred racing history 
last fall, has been retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Daniel Wildenstein and trained by Dick Mandella, Arcangues was making 
his first start in the United States and his first on dirt last November when 
he won the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 A 133-1 longshot, Arcangues paid $269.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has always had a few (physical) problems and he came out of the 
(Hollywood) Gold Cup with a few others," Mandella said Friday. "He's too nice a 
horse to take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, a 6-year-old son of Sagace, had six victories in 19 starts and 
earnings of more than $1.9 million. It was not immediately decided if he will 
stand at stud in France or the United States.

NEWSWIRE: INVESTIGATION IS ORDERED OF SECRET MASSIMINO DEAL

<P>
 Outraged over a secret contract that gave Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach 
Rollie Massimino an extra $375,000 a year, Nevada regents on Friday ordered an 
investigation of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regents hinted they might try to rescind Massimino's contract to coach 
the Rebels altogether, saying they were duped when they hired him two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like the opportunity to reverse my vote," regent Jill Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member board voted unanimously to hire outside legal counsel to help 
unravel the circumstances and legality of a secret contract that guaranteed 
Massimino $375,000 a year above the $511,000-a-year, five-year contract 
approved by regents in April of 1992.

 Ghost towns -- A story in Thursday's Times confused a drop in arrests with a 
drop in reports of major crimes at some San Fernando Valley "ghost towns" -- 
apartment buildings left vacant by quake damage. The story should have stated 
that homicides, rapes and other major crimes reported in the North Hills area 
east of the San Diego Freeway declined 30% during the first seven months of 
this year compared to the year before.
