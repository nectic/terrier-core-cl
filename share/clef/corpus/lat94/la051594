SUMMER SNEAKS '94; CRANK UP THE AIR CONDITIONING; YES, IT'S SUMMER MOVIE TIME 
AGAIN. GRAB THAT AIR-POPPED YOU-KNOW-WHAT AND SEE WHAT MOOD HOLLYWOOD IS IN

 Somehow, we'll never be able to think of them as popcorn movies again. 
Nine-hundred calories for a regular box, three days' worth of fat, enough 
cholesterol to clog the Lincoln Tunnel. You go to summer movies for 
entertainment, not cardiovascular disease. How are you going to forget all your 
troubles and just be happy, when you're worried that the next handful of 
popcorn may be your last? 
</P>
<P>
 Great timing, Center for Science in the Public Interest. You wait until after 
the greatest summer of popcorn pictures in history, the summer of "Jurassic 
Park," "The Fugitive," "The Firm," and "In the Line of Fire," keep your mouths 
shut throughout a winter where there wasn't a popcorn movie in sight, then 
spring it on us just as trailers for "Maverick," "True Lies," and "Beverly 
Hills Cop III" were showing up on screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as we accompany our kids into theaters for the most family-oriented 
summer line-up in memory, we face the choice of either buying them nasty 
theater popcorn or risk getting into a wrestling match with a 16-year-old usher 
trying to confiscate that tasteless air-popped corn the Center for Science 
suggested we make at home and sneak in! 
</P>
<P>
 The action this summer could be better in the aisles than on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there aren't that many pure popcorn movies -- action/adventure films 
that cause nervous energy in the muscles around the jaw -- on the '94 summer 
schedule. Last year, there were 15 that fit the description. Between now and 
Labor Day, we'll see six ( for more on the action movies this summer, see Page 
6 ). 
</P>
<P>
 Of that group, only three -- James Cameron's "True Lies," with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Philip Noyce's "Clear and Present Danger," with Harrison 
Ford starring in the third adaptation of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels -- seem 
certain to become blockbusters. (Joel Schumacher's "The Client," starring Susan 
Sarandon in the John Grisham potboiler, also has good potential, though it's 
not strictly an action film.) 
</P>
<P>
 By accident or design, there are two movies in the field mimicking the hot 
formula of "In the Line of Fire." MGM, under new management, takes a shot at 
the action market with "Blown Away," starring Jeff Bridges as a bomb squad 
expert being taunted by bomb planter Tommy Lee Jones, and Fox offers "Speed," 
with Keanu Reeves as a SWAT team member trying to thwart another bomber, played 
by Dennis Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors who've seen "Beverly Hills Cop III" rate it only a fair chance to 
become a hit, and bolster Eddie Murphy's sagging career. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a modest crop of action films for the season. As if they'd planned to 
keep the tension level down in theaters, the studios have loaded the schedule 
with comedies (22), fantasies (10) and family-oriented movies starring kids 
(17). There are three animated features, including Walt Disney's sure-hit "The 
Lion King," three about the relationships between kids and animals (the dog in 
"Lassie," the horse in "Black Beauty," and the seal in "Andre"), and two 
fantasies about teen-age boys leading major-league baseball teams to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, a comic strip hero ("The Shadow"), a live-action cartoon ("The 
Flintstones"), and "Little Rascals," a full-length feature starring an all-new 
cast of Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat and other Our Gang look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the studios didn't learn from last summer's grosses. You just 
can't order up a dozen $60- to $100-million action movies from production and 
have them ready to glut the market in less than 12 months. John Grisham and 
Michael Crichton type fast, but they can't turn instantly adaptable novels out 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 No, you'll see that batch next summer, after the theater chains have all 
converted from coconut to canola oil, and American moviegoers are in the mood 
for a good musical. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we will complete the harvest of children's movies inspired by 
Macaulay Culkin and "Home Alone," a unique combination of talent and story that 
had studio executives grasping at air a few years back, as if to catch their 
own shooting stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Culkin's success was taken by many in the industry as evidence that the public 
was fed up with the sex and violence they have been stuffing down our throats 
for 10 years, and acted on that assumption by developing entire slates of 
children and family movies. Months before the opening of "Last Action Hero," an 
$80-million parody of cartoon film violence, Columbia Pictures chief Mark 
Canton virtually declared the dawning of a new, PG-rated age in Hollywood, with 
a child -- and Arnold Schwarzenegger -- showing the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the movie flopped, and Schwarzenegger, with his tail tucked between 
his immense legs, rushed back to "Terminator" director James Cameron to do 
another hard-edged, high body-count action movie. Mark Canton, in the great 
tradition of failing upward in Hollywood, was promoted, and his theory about 
the commercial advantage of PG movies was exposed as a non-issue by the ratings 
of the summer's five biggest hits. "Jurassic Park" and "The Fugitive" were 
PG-13, "Sleepless in Seattle" was PG, "The Firm" and "In the Line of Fire" were 
rated R. 
</P>
<P>
 People do pay more attention to ratings during the summer, and over the 
Christmas holidays, when children are more apt to wander into an R-rated movie 
and be blinded by sin. And this season, parents will find a reasonable mix. 
About a third of the 47 films scheduled for wide release are designed to appeal 
to children or families, about a third to adults, and the rest to that 
once-cherished range of 14- to 24-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 What is missing, as usual, are serious dramas, and, inexplicably, romance. 
Educated people can suspend their intellect for the summer months (check the 
best-seller lists), but hormones rage on. 
</P>
<P>
 There are films with strong romantic subplots, and featuring attractive star 
match-ups. There are Michelle Pfeiffer and Jack Nicholson, a fox and a hound, 
in Mike Nichols' "Wolf," but it's a horror film, a retelling of the classic 
werewolf legend, with Nicholson playing a book editor who really does become an 
animal in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp," the legendary lawman (Kevin Costner), has 
to tear himself from the arms of his lover (Joanna Going) to join his brothers 
for the gunfight at the OK Corral. And the summer's other big Western, the 
tongue-in-cheek "Maverick," pauses for something that, judging from the 
trailer, looks more like horseplay than foreplay between Mel Gibson and Jodie 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Romance is apparently the central issue in Charles Shyer's "I Love Trouble," 
in which Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts play newspaper rivals -- he's a cagey 
veteran, she's a wary cub reporter -- who end up sharing sheets and a double 
byline. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in serious romance, you may look for Gramercy's "Foreign 
Student," an interracial love story based on French writer Phillipe Labro's 
autobiographical novel about a Paris exchange student ("Europa, Europa's" Marco 
Hofschneider) who falls in love with a black woman (Robin Givens) in 1956 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 As for serious dramas, directors Oliver Stone and Jefery Levy both take a hard 
look at the mass media's obsession with violent crime in "Natural Born Killers" 
and "S.F.W.," respectively. If you want more, check the art-house schedule. 
Miramax will soon release Bernardo Bertolucci's "Little Buddha" (how serious 
can it be with Keanu Reeves playing the incarnation of Siddhartha?), and Sony 
Classics has a little Swedish gem coming called "Slingshot," for those charmed 
by "My Life as a Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The three movies being talked about most in Hollywood seem to be Universal's 
"The Flintstones," which industry insiders speculate might become this summer's 
"Last Action Hero," Fox's "True Lies," a special-effects thrill ride that is 
reportedly costing the studio more than $100 million, and Paramount's "Forrest 
Gump," which many feel could become the season's sleeper hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors who've seen "The Flintstones" say that they're worried that it is 
too cartoonish (true, from the trailer, it's hard to tell John Goodman's Fred 
Flintstone from the real Fred Flintstone) and that children the right age for 
it have never heard of Bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the story line of "Forrest Gump" vaguely recalls Hal Ashby's "Being 
There," it still sounds like the most original movie in the entire season. 
Starring Oscar winner Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis ("Back to the 
Future"), it tells the epic story of a boy with an IQ of 75 who becomes a 
college football star, a war hero, a business mogul, and the White House guest 
of three presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump," say those who've seen it, is a triumph of innocence in a 
complex world, which sounds like a fair -- and commercial -- tonic for our 
times. The only criticism anyone has leveled at it is that the studio is making 
a mistake releasing it in the summer, as if it were casting pearls before 
swine. We don't have to take that. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Donner's "Maverick," and "City Slickers II," in which Billy Crystal 
and his pals hit the trail with the late Curly's twin brother (Jack Palance) on 
a treasure hunt in the West, look like the surest bets among the comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 There are others from Rob Reiner ("North," a comedy about a boy who divorces 
his parents and hits the road in search of perfect replacements), Penny 
Marshall ("Renaissance Man," starring Danny DeVito as a boot camp instructor 
teaching Shakespeare to jugheads), Andrew Bergman ("It Could Happen to You," 
about a cop who accidentally tips a waitress a winning lottery ticket), and Bob 
Clark ("It Runs in the Family," which revisits the Cleveland family in Jean 
Shepherd's now-classic "A Christmas Story"). 
</P>
<P>
 On the broader end of the comedy scale, there is another Pauly Shore film 
coming from Hollywood Pictures ("You're in the Army Now") and, before theaters 
will have "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" removed from their screens, Jim Carrey 
will be back in New Line's "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to order a tub of popcorn after all.

ALWAYS CRESCENDO; LEONARD BERNSTEIN'S METEORIC RISE SEEMED TO LAST ALL HIS LIFE 
-- BUT SO DID HIS SENSE OF BEING TORN: WAS HE A COMPOSER OR A PERFORMER? 
HIGHBROW OR POPULAR? GAY OR STRAIGHT?; LEONARD BERNSTEIN, BY HUMPHREY BURTON 
(DOUBLEDAY: $25, 581 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Swed, Mark Swed is a music critic based in New York and is currently 
writing a biography of John Cage for Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a marvelous life. And Leonard Bernstein, of course, knew it. As a young 
conductor, he once urged on a student orchestra, telling the players in 
rehearsal: "Give it all you've got and then crescendo." Having done just that, 
himself, in the most celebrated musical career in America for the next 45 
years, he said, on his 70th birthday: "I feel that I have lived five lives or 
so already." A few days before he died at age 72, his body no longer able to 
beat the odds against such an accelerated lifestyle, he began his own elegy: 
"Cut down in the prime of his youth." He meant it. 
</P>
<P>
 We all knew Lenny well. He lived in public. He made music accessible. He was 
both a showman and a man of self-absorbed reflection. He analyzed himself 
endlessly to friends, to journalists, in his music, in his writings. He talked 
and talked, and taught and taught, to television audiences, to concert 
audiences, to students. He partied and partied, living to the hilt the life of 
a major celebrity. He entertained presidents, kings and emperors; he seduced 
young writers and musicians. People talked about him. He was biographied, in 
sober German manner, in American fanzine style and, in a controversial 1987 
psychobiography by Joan Peyser, in sensationalistic style. Memoirs have been 
written by family and friends over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are going to get to know him a lot better. There are at the moment, 3 
1/2 years after his death, 21 books about Bernstein currently in progress. All 
will have to contend, however, with Humphrey Burton's biography. Burton, a 
British television producer who made concert videos of Bernstein for 20 years, 
was allowed by the Bernstein heirs exclusive access to the Bernstein archives, 
including his correspondence. The result is the most detailed report, by far, 
of Bernstein's life. 
</P>
<P>
 In a disclaimer, Burton says that despite the invaluable support from the 
Bernstein family he wrote only what he wanted. That's probably true. The 
biography does not seemed whitewashed. But Burton is a close friend of the 
family -- Bernstein played organ at his wedding -- and could clearly be 
trusted. Not a practiced writer, Burton has very little voice in the book. The 
writing is dispassionate, flat, seldom judgmental. But the style is also a 
relief, with none of the motherly clucking over Bernstein's sexual excesses as 
Peyser does. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton simply tells a story. He appears to rely more on the Bernstein archives 
and the correspondence than on his own investigations. The facts, however, are 
engrossing. He sees Bernstein's life in great dramatic arches, which are surely 
oversimplifications -- one of Bernstein's great attractions was the sheer 
complexity of his life -- but that life did have its share of genuine theater, 
full of public incident and inner conflict. First there was the provincial 
youth, the boy genius growing up in Boston suburbs with Russian immigrant 
parents, his father a pragmatic salesman of beauty supplies and devoted student 
of the Torah. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bernstein had to fight his father to enter a life of music, there seems 
never much question that he was destined for it. At an early age he already 
mesmerized everyone he came in contact with, from piano teachers (one, Helen 
Coates, became his devoted personal secretary for the rest of her very long 
life) to the siblings and friends he organized into impromptu kid summer stock 
opera companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Harvard, Bernstein became sophisticated fast and made a mark early. By the 
time he graduated he was already part of Aaron Copland's circle. He made New 
York friends, such as Adolph Green and Betty Comden, with whom he would soon 
write hit Broadway musicals. He was taken under the wing of Serge Koussevitzky 
at Tanglewood, and his career rise was meteoric. With Koussevitzky and Copland 
behind him, he was soon conducting everywhere. In 1943, at age 25, he made his 
famous Carnegie Hall debut, conducting the New York Philharmonic in a Sunday 
afternoon national broadcast as a last-minute substitute for Bruno Walter, 
garnering a front page New York Times review -- and he was famous. His first 
symphony, the "Jeremiah," was an instant success the next year. It all kept 
happening faster and faster, and he just got more and more famous. By the 
summer of 1957, he went from one of the most celebrated Broadway openings of 
modern history, "West Side Story," which looked as if it could pave the way to 
a new kind of American musical theater, to assuming the helm of the New York 
Philharmonic a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's great ascent was accompanied by much self-doubt, however. Burton 
briefly develops the theme of duality in Bernstein's character (as much as any 
theme can be developed in such a purely expository approach). Bernstein was 
constantly torn. Should he be composer or performer? If performer, was he 
conductor or pianist? Whether composer or performer, was his place in high art 
or in popular art? Was he teacher or entertainer? Was he gay or straight? 
</P>
<P>
 For a while Bernstein thought that he could have it all. In the summer of 
1941, for instance, Burton presents Bernstein at Tanglewood absorbed in 
conducting one month, composing the next; one week he might be flirting with a 
"charming" boy in the box office, the next discussing marriage with a beautiful 
woman. "I suppose it's a little crazy to do all the things I do," he told a 
journalist a few years later, "but that's my curse." 
</P>
<P>
 In our Multicultural Age, those conflicts seem now more blessing than curse, 
and we now appreciate Bernstein precisely for them. That he brought serious 
purpose to the Broadway stage and some real popular theater flair into the 
concert hall proved just what each needed. But while those forces in his youth 
made him so appealing, they also in the end tore him apart. After a protracted 
and hesitant five-year engagement to Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, 
Bernstein finally married her in 1951 and raised a family. When he became music 
director of the New York Philharmonic, he concentrated more on conducting than 
composition, and built the most brilliant career any serious American musician 
has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1960s, his life seemed to him to be falling apart. Depressed 
about his lack of composing successes, weary of a mostly heterosexual 
lifestyle, he resigned from the New York Philharmonic, and a couple of years 
later left his wife for a young man. He manicly roamed the world, winning over 
Europe. He composed weird melanges, such as "Mass" (for the opening of the 
Kennedy Center in Washington), a Jew writing a Catholic Mass as hippie 
mixed-media ceremony; it was derided in serious music circles when premiered 
but has now come to seem prescient postmodernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton chronicles the sexual dalliances, listing all those young men who 
passed through Bernstein's later life. He doesn't fail to present the regal 
character Bernstein became at the end of his life, traveling with his lordly 
entourage. He reveals a conductor who had gotten so out of control that he was 
actually competing with one of his daughters for the sexual attention of a 
young pianist, Justus Frantz. He labors over Bernstein's terrible guilt that 
followed him through the rest of life, after the death of his wife from cancer 
in 1978 (Bernstein had returned to her at the end). He shows him to be a 
composer of ever greater insecurity, finishing some projects but not getting 
very far on many others, including an opera based on "Lolita," which he planned 
to write for the great German baritone, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, as Humbert 
Humbert, and a Holocaust opera that obsessed him at the end of his life. And we 
get a morbid, blow-by-medical-blow account of Bernstein's grim last days. 
</P>
<P>
 A few careless mistakes make one question Burton's musical insights 
altogether, such as referring to Pierre Boulez as a minimalist in 1959, long 
before minimalism came about as a reaction against Boulez. A typo at the end, 
where Bernstein collapses dead in Wagner's arms (rather than those of his 
friend Michael Wager), is so cosmic that it would surely have amused Bernstein. 
Fortunately, too, Burton's blandness makes Bernstein less self-promoting than 
might be expected, given his love of speaking to Hollywood Bowl audiences when 
he served as guest conductor a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But one misses far too much the life of the mind, of the musical and 
intellectual and spiritual forces that shaped Bernstein. The most fascinating 
aspect of Bernstein is that his mind was as hungry for knowledge, for 
understanding and for art as his body was for sex and food and his ego was for 
fame. And both Bernstein's greatness and weaknesses came from his inability and 
unwillingness to separate them. Bernstein was not a subtle man, but he was a 
deep one, and that amazing life force may have led as close to outright musical 
transcendence as any musician has ever gotten. Somehow, 21 more Bernstein books 
doesn't seem excessive.

HENRY LUCE AT THE END OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY; HENRY R. LUCE: A POLITICAL 
PORTRAIT OF THE MAN WHO CREATED THE AMERICAN CENTURY, BY ROBERT E. HERZSTEIN 
(SCRIBNER'S: $30; 521 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Champlin, Champlin, former arts editor of The Times, spent 17 years 
as a Time-Life writer and correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Robinson Luce died in 1967 at the age of 68 in Phoenix, where he had 
been living in semi-retirement with his wife Clare Boothe Luce. He was wealthy 
beyond the dreams of need. Life magazine, which at one point was read by one in 
every three Americans, was being gravely wounded by television's competition 
for ad dollars and would die as a weekly only four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Time Inc. remained a major force and profit center in American print 
journalism, and Time's prose style, even minus the excesses ("pig-faced, 
gat-toothed") of its brash early years, had profoundly influenced and reshaped 
the writing of news with its use of intimate details and you-are-there scenes 
to dramatize and humanize events large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelf of books about Luce (and the Luces) and Time Inc. is wide and, 27 
years after his death, not yet complete. The histories have ranged from the 
adversarial, especially W. A. Swanberg's deeply researched "Luce and His 
Empire" (Scribner's: 1972), to the official: the first two volumes in 
particular, by Robert T. Elson, of "Time, Inc.: The Intimate History of a 
Publishing Enterprise" (Atheneum: 1968, 1973). 
</P>
<P>
 The Elson volumes, taking Luce and Time Inc. through 1960, four years before 
Luce retired as editor-in-chief of his magazines, were certainly not 
adversarial but they are remarkably candid about the infighting and the fierce 
policy disputes of the early days. 
</P>
<P>
 The infighting and the policy disputes are central to the latest addition to 
the shelf, University of South Carolina historian Robert E. Herzstein's "Henry 
R. Luce: A Portrait of the Man Who Created the American Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The main thrust of Herzstein's book (like Swanberg's, extremely 
well-researched and annotated) is actually Luce's long and blinding obsession 
with China, which left him unable to accept the corruption and unpopularity of 
Chiang Kai-Chek's Guomindang government and the growing strength of the 
Communists under Mao Tse-tung, but which influenced U.S. foreign policy for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Luce's American Century was born of three speeches he then honed into a LIFE 
article (Feb. 17, 1941) and later a book. The U.S., Luce cried, "must undertake 
now to be the Good Samaritan of the entire world," to see that "free economic 
enterprise" prevails in the world, to guarantee the freedom of the seas, to 
export to the world its "technical and artistic skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But none of it would happen, he added, without "a passionate devotion to great 
American ideals . . . a love of freedom, a feeling for the equality of 
opportunity, a tradition of self-reliance and independence and also of 
cooperation" and it must fail without adherence to "the great principles of 
Western civilization -- above all Justice, the love of Truth, the ideal of 
Charity." We are called, Luce concluded, "to create the first great American 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry Luce's American Century," Herzstein says, "was thus reverent, generous 
and humanitarian, it also brooked no rivals, took the world for its stage and 
assumed its own moral superiority." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the first 1,200 letters LIFE received, Elson reported in his Vol. 1, only 
75 were negative. But the Nation, as Elson also reported, called the piece 
"smug, self-righteous, superior, and fatuously lacking in a decent regard for 
the susceptibilities of the rest of mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the boy becomes the man, Herzstein takes a leisurely tour through the 
fairly familiar ground of Luce's childhood as a Presbyterian missionary's son 
in China, which engendered the love he never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzstein is freshly interesting about the early days of Time, when a fanatic 
and prolific Foreign News editor named Laird Shields Goldsborough infused the 
pages with an implicit anti-Semitism (Bernard Baruch was "Jew Baruch"), 
downplayed the plight of European Jews and hailed the rise of Franco. "On the 
side of Franco are men of property, men of God and men of the sword," 
Goldsborough wrote in an answering memo to fellow editor Archibald MacLeish's 
complaint about the slant of Time's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzstein had access to the irascible private journal kept by an early Luce 
editor John Shaw Billings, and now archived at Herzstein's university. 
Billings' uncensored comments are like lightning flashes, illuminations of the 
official traffic in memos. 
</P>
<P>
 Luce ultimately had to demote Goldsborough, who in 1950 leaped to his death 
from the Time-Life Building, still carrying his gold-headed walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Luce crusade to save the China he remembered and create a modern China he 
envisioned, is a sorry chronicle of evidence -- supplied by the bright young 
Bostonian Theodore White and his colleague Annalee Jacoby -- dismissed and 
ignored. Herzstein's documenting of the rising tension between White and Luce 
is detailed and saddening. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a double irony. To the end of his days Luce remained convinced China 
need not have been lost to the Communists. But White, accurate as he was in 
depicting the corruption of the Chiang government and the dynamism of the 
Communists, "devoted little time," Herzstein says, "to pondering the 
totalitarian ideology and discipline that had energized the Communist state 
within the state. . . . In fact, China was caught in a time-warp in which a 
failed authoritarian regime did battle against an embryonic totalitarian 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his American Century, Luce, Herzstein says, reacted with "occasional 
annoyance," when anyone mentioned it after 1947. The Cold War and anxiety at 
the possibility of nuclear annihilation "undermined the self-confidence and 
peaceful development essential to Harry Luce's original idea of American 
globalism. Though his United States won the Cold War 27 years after his death 
in 1967, it paid a terrible price for victory in lives, social cohesion and 
fiscal stability."

 By the time he died, Herzstein concludes, Luce "felt that the mood of the 
country had turned sour." Even at that, he did not live to experience Vietnam, 
rising racial tensions, Watergate and the Nixon resignation -- or the 
Time-Warner merger and the erosion of Time's magisterial editorial voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The years after World War II are telescoped in Herzstein's book. There were 
fabulous earnings and new magazines (Sports Illustrated, Money, Entertainment 
Weekly) yet to come. But the two great crusades of Harry Luce's life were over; 
his reputation as an innovating force in print journalism, unrivaled by Hearst 
or anyone else, remains intact. Herzstein's book is fascinating to anyone who 
cares how we are made to perceive and misperceive the world; it is also a study 
in melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry Robinson Luce's idealistic patriotism and faith in human progress 
resulted in . . . great achievements, but they also led him into defeats and 
disappointments," Herzstein writes. And little in the later world would likely 
have eased the disappointments.

RICHARD EDER: AMAZING GRACE; SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND, BY DENNIS MCFARLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 73, Francis Brimm has retired from wandering the world as a celebrated news 
photographer, and returned to Florida's Gulf Coast where he was raised and 
where his older sister, Muriel, still lives. He had imagined catching up on the 
slow pleasures his airy career left him no time for: gardening, preparing meals 
and savoring the fullness of days passing. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these answer his restlessness. Instead of cooking he eats fast food. 
Having bought seed and fertilizer, he wonders: Why not pay a gardener? Instead 
of mellow self-reflecting he stands at the window at night, hoping to catch a 
glimpse of a beautiful neighbor naked. Lastly, a vision keeps appearing on his 
bedroom ceiling of a terrible wartime scene he had photographed. A French woman 
collaborator is hustled, shaven-headed and holding her German-sired baby, 
through a jeering mob. (It is one of the Second World War's most reproduced 
images; it is odd to find it attributed here to a fictional character.) 
</P>
<P>
 Muriel, who balances surface practicality with religious devotion, gets him to 
consult their new Episcopal rector. Francis is taken aback to find that she is 
a woman. He is even more taken aback when she advises him to shut his eyes and 
try to become the woman in his vision. When he objects that this is therapy, 
not religion, the rector cheerfully offers to go into the history and theology 
of visions if that will make him feel better. The spiritual, it seems, is 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the more telling scenes in "School for the Blind." Dennis 
McFarland, author of "The Music Room," has written a novel that teeters on the 
edge between the immanent and the mundane. The story of Francis and Muriel, 
nearing the end of their lives, has one foot delicately poised in the 
psychological and the other in the mystical. It is an interesting balance but 
an uneasy one; reminiscent in some ways of the Anglican explorations in the 
theological detective stories of Charles Williams and the theological science 
fiction of C. S. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis' vision will ultimately reveal to him the real purpose for which he 
has returned to Florida: not to retire but to die. And, once he accepts this it 
will turn out to be his salvation. A life spent in evasion -- photographing 
history is the path of the voyeur, in McFarland's image -- will become a dying 
in which life is modestly embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Francis' return sets off a series of events that will 
produce an equivalent self-deliverance for Muriel. Her cheerful busyness and 
assiduous church-going are a different kind of evasion, stemming from a common 
history. The siblings, as children, had been through a shocking ordeal of abuse 
-- she as victim, he as helpless witness -- which both have hidden from 
themselves ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland treats the twin ordeal and redemption of brother and sister in a 
style that embeds an essentially providential allegory in a novel which, though 
dramatic, moves by largely realistic narrative and psychological detail. For 
example, the persistent questions that Francis begins to ask about their 
childhood are one of the instruments that contribute to the sensation, as he 
puts it, that "the ground has begun to shift beneath our feet." But they are 
explicable simply in terms of the mental and emotional restlessness of an old 
man suddenly confronted with nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The same restlessness makes it perfectly plausible that he should awake at 
night and go for solitary walks. On one of these he comes upon a dog digging 
bones out of a golf-course sand-trap. They are human bones, he realizes, and 
notifies the police. The subsequent events run more or less along the lines of 
a detective story. At the same time, though, the disinterment will become, both 
symbolically and in fact, the revelation of what Francis and Muriel have for so 
long forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Day by day the lives of Francis and Muriel proceed in prosaic, sometimes comic 
detail. He tries to busy himself; she is busy with meetings, piano duets and 
book study, much of which is conducted with two aging friends. The friends are 
attentive and irritating; there is nothing wrong with them but they exasperate 
Muriel more and more. Her life has begun to shake with strange portents. An old 
friend seems deliberately to look away when Muriel passes (he was distracted); 
crossing a footbridge she sees a bowler hat in the water (it is an otter). And 
in her house -- her childhood home -- the entire upstairs, where she and her 
parents once slept, seems haunted. Looking into the mirror she sees other 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland impressively blurs the lines. Is the charged, sinister light that 
bathes the Florida landscape an illusion of two aging minds, one of which -- 
Muriel's -- is on medication? Is it the psychological pressure of an old secret 
asserting itself against a septuagenarian's diminished power to armor the 
present against the past? Or is it the onset of a spiritual ordeal with 
religious implications. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate ordeal is Muriel's. The bones turn out to be those of two 
schoolgirls, raped, killed, dissected and buried. The killer writes anonymously 
to the local newspaper. He tells of horrifying sexual and physical abuse by his 
father in a letter that McFarland has brilliantly devised to reflect poignancy 
and madness. Reading it propels Muriel into her own suffering past; she goes 
through a weeklong collapse that manages to suggest both clinical breakdown and 
a dark night of the soul. For his part Francis suddenly recalls what the French 
mob shouted at the woman: "Angel of Death!" It is, retrospectively, something 
more than a natural presage: He learns that he has a fatal blood disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's last part contains a series of reconciliations and deliverances. 
Muriel takes in the dying Francis; she also takes in Deirdre, a young woman who 
had worked for her and whom she had fired for her turbulent way of life. 
Pregnant, Deirdre becomes for Muriel a means -- the phrase is a little too smug 
-- "to work out my salvation." She is also a form of angel. Redeeming Francis 
from his lifelong isolation, she and the dying man fall deeply and chastely in 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland has woven together the natural and religious with considerable 
intelligence; the result, though, is more striking than convincing. His 
removed, elaborately Jamesian diction can be a drawback, although he balances 
it amusingly with the querulous, down-to-earth rhythms of his aging 
protagonists. Childhood sexual abuse is a risky device for a novelist, not 
because it is shocking but because it can be a pat explanation for almost 
anything. McFarland avoids that risk; patness, on the other hand, clouds his 
religious currents. With exceptions -- Francis's happy deathbed is poetically 
convincing -- the author's transcendental is sentimental; his divinity is 
abstract and unctuous at the same time.

RIFLING THE DRAWERS OF THE DEAD; THE SILENT WOMAN: SYLVIA PLATH & TED HUGHES, 
BY JANET MALCOLM (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $23; 208 PP.)

<P>
 Ours is not an age in which literary events create much stir, but the 
publication in the New Yorker last summer of Janet Malcolm's study of Sylvia 
Plath and Ted Hughes was an exception. Brilliantly packaged by Tina Brown, with 
reprints of the Plath poems that had been originally published in the New 
Yorker, the issue was a sellout on both sides of the Atlantic, and for weeks no 
dinner party from Westwood to Hampstead was complete without a discussion of 
it. Now published as a book, "The Silent Woman" is a scathing denunciation of 
the ethics of literary biography, as well as a defense of Plath's survivors -- 
Ted Hughes, now poet laureate; his fiercely loyal sister Olwyn, and indirectly 
the writer Anne Stevenson, whose book about Plath, "Bitter Fame" (1989), was 
"pilloried" because it was seen as a vehicle for the Hughes family's view of 
the marriage. Writing less about Sylvia Plath's life than about her afterlife 
as a legend, Malcolm takes arms against the hordes of biographers, journalists 
and feminist literary critics who have probed the mystery of Plath's suicide, 
and blamed Hughes for his infidelity in life and his iron control of Plath's 
copyrights in death. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Malcolm, biographers are just professional burglars, snooping 
through the drawers of the dead for loot -- that is, intimate, scandalous or 
damaging information. Readers of literary biography are driven by "voyeurism 
and busybodyism," deceiving themselves that they are having "an elevating 
literary experience," when they are actually "listening to backstairs gossip 
and reading other people's mail." Journalists are the cruelest of all these 
scavengers, trading in "sadism and reductionism"; and even the subject's 
relatives, "the biographer's natural enemies," can be sucked into hapless 
collusion. Among the seven deadly sins of literary biography, Malcolm warns, 
greed also plays a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Malcolm herself has been involved in a notorious case about libel and 
invasion of privacy brought by the modest and reclusive Jeffrey Masson, the 
topical ironies of the book have attracted a great deal of attention. We might 
well ask why she is eagerly publishing big chunks of previously unpublished 
correspondence between Ted Hughes, Olwyn Hughes and Anne Stevenson, let alone 
why she is sneaking around Ted Hughes' garden in Devon. The magnetic pull of 
Sylvia Plath's story, and Malcolm's personal attraction to it despite her 
proclaimed scruples, produce the tension that makes "The Silent Woman" so 
fascinating. The book is a tour de force, the best thing Malcolm has ever done. 
Apparently a journalistic expose of sorts, it is more like an epistolary novel, 
a Jamesian quest for American innocence and European corruption, and an 
exploration of the terrible costs of female creative achievement for the 
American generation of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Sylvia Plath's story so compelling? Malcolm quotes an excerpt from 
Plath's own journal of 1958: "Liz Taylor is getting Eddie Fisher away from 
Debbie Reynolds, who appears cherubic, round-faced, wronged, in pin curls and 
house robe -- Mike Todd barely cold. How odd these events affect one so. Why? 
Analogies?" She finds many analogies between Plath's experience, Anne 
Stevenson's and her own; indeed, she claims, Plath was a paradigmatic figure of 
her generation -- "the fearful, double-faced fifties." For intellectual women 
with literary ambitions, the times were particularly inauspicious; in the years 
before the sexual revolution (the 19th Century in America, Malcolm writes, 
didn't really end until the 1960s), women's destinies seemed bounded by their 
choice of men. And while all writers must struggle against convention and their 
own resistances, "women writers seem to have to take stronger measures, make 
more peculiar psychic arrangements than men do to activate their imaginations." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while other women surrendered or failed, Plath resisted the period's 
blandness and confronted its concealed horrors head-on. In her life, as in her 
writing, Plath "was able -- she elected -- to confront what most of the rest of 
us fearfully shrank from." Asking herself how Plath, the scrubbed and shiny 
college girl from Massachusetts, became the terrifyingly mature and powerful 
poet of Ariel, Malcolm hypothesizes that expatriation was an important element. 
In one sense, she argues that Plath was alienated in postwar England, and 
closed out by the feline British intelligentsia, so different from the 
burnished image that appealed to bookish and romantic American undergraduates 
in the 1950s. Yet she also believes that Plath had to flee the puritanism and 
duplicity of Eisenhower America; she "did not write -- and could not have 
written -- 'The Bell Jar of Ariel' in her native Massachusetts." Plath had to 
shed her American accent, appearance, identity, to become an artist. In a 
parable of American women's writing, which has functioned at least since the 
19th Century, she was Persephone: "Like so many women writers, she had to leave 
the daylight world and go underground to find her voice." 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the book, Malcolm becomes a Persephone too, following Plath, 
and also Anne Stevenson, into darkest England. Beginning in February, 1991, in 
a London deserted by tourists because of the Gulf War, she travels in freezing 
weather and incompetent British Rail trains to interview Plath's friends and 
enemies, her survivors and her critics. Ironically, Malcolm never meets Ted 
Hughes, although she finds "a kind of Chekhovian largeheartedness and 
melancholy" in his letters. Indeed, the further she travels, the more complex 
the "truth" appears to become, and the more sympathetic the motives of all 
involved. Malcolm's quest ends, during another trip, in September, 1991, when 
she meets Trevor Thomas, who lived in the flat below Plath's when she killed 
herself, and who was the last person to see her alive. He is a self-obsessed 
eccentric, whose account of Plath's emotional distress is mingled with his own 
grievances, and whose house is crammed with a lifetime's accumulation of junk. 
Malcolm takes it as "a kind of monstrous allegory of truth" and "a metaphor for 
the problem of writing." How can a biographer shape a narrative from this 
chaotic material? Ultimately the journalist, like the novelist, picks a card 
from the deck, but in the Plath game the room is "so dark and gloomy that one 
has a hard time seeing one's hand; one is apt to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm calls the book "The Silent Woman" in reference to an anecdote about a 
quarrel between Plath and Olwyn Hughes, which ended in Plath's mute glare. This 
"(Medusan) speechlessness," Malcolm writes, "is the deadly, punishing weapon." 
It is also a metaphor of suicide; Plath stopped the conversation forever, and 
spoke only from beyond the grave with the blazing poems that have made her one 
of the most widely read writers of our century. In their stunning achievement, 
Malcolm writes, the books and poems are also "full of threatening silences . . 
. we stand before the Ariel poems as Olwyn stood before the stone-faced 
Sylvia." Plath's art is "threatening," I assume, in its challenge to the 
reader's own compromises and timidities. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally the silent woman in this book is Janet Malcolm herself. Repeatedly 
but with tantalizing vagueness, she draws connections between herself and 
Plath, between herself and Stevenson, who was one year ahead of her at the 
University of Michigan, and seemed to have lived out her own "fantasies of 
nonconformity." It seems clear that Malcolm has used journalism as a shield and 
a passport into alternative lives, places where women both long to go and fear 
to tread. Plath's story is a thread she follows into the labyrinth of 
sexuality, art and death, and into the uncertainties of nonfiction where "we 
almost never know the truth of what happened." Beneath its high-minded 
denunciations of biography, "The Silent Woman" is a step across a threshold, 
and the first tentative notes of a personal voice. As Malcolm knows very well, 
it's not Sylvia we mourn for.

COVER STORY: LIFE'S RIFFS; SHOWTIME'S 'LUSH LIFE' EXPLORES A RELATIONSHIP BASED 
ON MUSIC, FRIENDSHIP AND FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the characters populating the new Showtime movie "Lush Life," jazz is more 
than just a popular form of music. It's a way of life, bordering on religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in New York, "Lush Life" focuses on the relationship between two jazz 
musicians, saxophonist Al Gorky (Jeff Goldblum) and trumpeter Buddy Chester 
(Forest Whitaker). Though not superstars, they're well-respected sidemen, 
playing everywhere and everything from bar mitzvahs and weddings to 
commercials, Broadway and be-bop. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky's love for the horn, though, has waned. A middle-aged Peter Pan, he 
spends most of his time chasing women, much to the dismay of his wife Janis 
(Kathy Baker), a former singer who's now an assistant school principal looking 
for another way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Their carefree existence changes forever when Chester is diagnosed with an 
inoperable brain tumor and has only a few months to live. Chester asks Gorky to 
throw him a great party and invite all of his musician friends -- without 
letting anyone know about his illness. As Gorky prepares for his buddy's party, 
he begins to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lush Life" was filmed in New York and Los Angeles. For the past few days the 
production has taken over the Wilshire Ebell Theatre near downtown Los Angeles. 
The building's big hall has been transformed into the Park Avenue apartment 
where Gorky holds Chester's party. As writer-director Michael Elias yells, 
"Action," the cast dances to prerecorded jazz music penned by Lennie Niehaus, 
who wrote the music for Clint Eastwood's "Bird" and "Unforgiven." 
</P>
<P>
 This project is a change of pace for Elias, who was co-creator and executive 
producer of the ABC sitcom "Head of the Class" and also wrote the screenplays 
for the feature films "The Jerk" and "The Frisco Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias wrote "Lush Life" eight years ago, but discovered the feature world 
didn't think it was commercially viable. 'It was cursed," Elias explains. "It 
was a small movie. I kept saying, 'I can make it big. I really can. I will 
spend as much money as you would like me to spend.' I thought it was a 
perfectly nice movie about three people who love each other, and one of them 
dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the project found its way to Showtime, where Elias hooked up with 
executive producers Jana Sue Memel and Jonathan Sanger of Chanticleer Films, 
who have produced several award-winning shorts for the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Showtime was great and entirely supportive and nonobtrusive," Elias says. And 
more importantly, they allowed him to direct. "I had to direct this one because 
there's a lot of personal things in it. But this is the one I knew I was going 
to direct. I could have sold it from time to time and let somebody else direct 
it. I held out." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias was interested in depicting the healing and corrective power of music 
and work. "In 'Lush Life,' the Jeff Goldblum character sort of gets his soul 
back because he starts practicing again and repairs his life through his work, 
which is what Forest Whitaker's Buddy really intended for him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky and Chester are not great musicians, Elias says, but "they are 
excellent. That's what I think most artists, in a funny kind of way, are. This 
is also what I wanted to write about: those people who are not extraordinarily 
famous or great. But without them, you wouldn't have enough musicians to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias' love affair with jazz began when he was a youngster in upstate New 
York. "You couldn't listen to the radio because it was all country and 
Western," he recalls. "My father used to go to New York. Every time he would 
bring back a jazz record. Boy, that started it." 
</P>
<P>
 He loves jazz because it's both ordered and free. "I love Dixieland, which is 
sometimes called traditional," Elias says. "I especially love mainstream and 
be-bop, which is Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. They work within boundaries. 
What they do within those boundaries and how they express themselves to such 
unbelievable heights seem to combine discipline, order and freedom all at the 
same time. A lot of that music is in the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias was thrilled when Niehaus agreed to compose the film's original music 
and arrange the standards. "I was amazed. I was thinking, 'We have this little 
television cable movie' and his last movies were 'Bird' and 'Unforgiven.' But 
he threw himself into this. We had a great collaboration. I knew what kind of 
music I wanted. He was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Several jazz musicians appear in the film, including Jack Sheldon of "The Merv 
Griffin Show" fame and Buddy Arnold, who played with Stan Kenton. "The music 
was recorded by a lot of jazz musicians who are here," Elias says. "Lennie 
assembled them." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias thinks his cast is pretty terrific too. "When I wrote it I don't know 
who I had in my mind," he says. "'But when these guys, the three of them, all 
agreed to do it, it turned outthey were who I had in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldblum, who was last seen being chased by dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park," 
thought the character of Gorky would be a real challenge. The film, he says, 
"has got interesting and difficult and real-life issues in it that were a 
mouthful. I felt for this character, you know. I guess we all have to grow up 
in our own way -- certainly confront death and the loss of our friends and the 
potential loss of major relationships, if they be family or wives or husbands. 
I'm not unfamiliar with that. This fellow, I think, heroically faces growing up 
in his own adult way and that Zen act of giving to someone sort of changes him. 
It's a nice human story. An adult human story. These days, they don't do many 
of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's Janis Gorky also is a complex woman, says the Emmy Award-winning star 
of CBS' "Picket Fences." "She's an artist inside but trying to be mainstream 
because she probably makes the money for the family. I thought she was pretty 
much a modern-day woman. She has a pretty realistic relationship with her 
husband, finally telling him that she has had enough of his philandering. She 
stayed with him a long time. I think that is more typical of a woman to stay 
for a long time. She is a woman who has had to give up a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Before filming began, Baker says, she, Goldblum and Whitaker sat down to 
create a history for their characters. "They met at clubs hanging out," Baker 
says. "Jeff was more persistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is especially fond of a poignant, subtle scene she has with Whitaker 
near the film's conclusion. "I love that scene," she says. "If I hadn't had 
that scene with Forest, I don't think I would have wanted to do it as much. It 
gives her great balance; otherwise, she is just sort of the wife and getting 
screwed over. But that great scene with Forest where they talk about the past 
and she tries to get him to talk about what is going on with him and he won't. 
It's just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Chester wants to commit suicide before he gets too ill. "He 
realizes he won't be able to care for himself," Whitaker explains. "He's the 
person who takes care of everything. He is the one who books the gigs. Al is 
the one who comes along for the ride. He supports Al and his wife in that 
relationship and himself. But he won't be able to do anything. He is (already) 
starting to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving rave reviews five years ago as Charlie Parker, the legendary 
man with a horn in "Bird," Whitaker relished the opportunity to play a working 
musician who was not at all famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "This character is not as complicated," Whitaker explains. "I'm not saying he 
doesn't have complexities in his own life, but the range, emotions and 
complexities are not really comparable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Whitaker was concerned about looking like a musician. "People 
look at me and say, 'You really look like a musician, in the way we behave.' 
Musicians are all different, but there are certain things they do alike. I can 
look at guys and tell who is a good player and who is not by the way they 
handle their instrument. It's an attitude about the horn itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Whitaker and Goldblum came to "Lush Life" with their own attitudes about 
music and horns, as well as strong musical backgrounds. "I like the sound of 
jazz," Goldblum says. "It is poetical and kind of sexy and romantic and 
evocative and exciting. Even my acting, the kind I like to see and aspire to, 
has some structure to it, but there is room for spontaneity and immediacy. I 
guess that's what I like about jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldblum, who plays the piano daily, was taught how to play the sax to the 
prerecorded music by a professional saxophonist. "I could play by the time I 
got (to the set). I could play songs because I could read music, so I learned 
all the notes. We luckily prerecorded the music, so I would just listen to it 
over and over again and practice with the horn. With all those long 
improvisational solos, I just listened to it and tried to get familiar with the 
breathing, kind of wiggled my fingers along and tried to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker also was guided by a coach. "I worked out the fingers and I practiced 
to make it as correct as possible," he says. "Some of the stuff thrown at me -- 
sometimes decisions are made on the spot -- it isn't as accurate as it could 
be. Most of the songs I knew I was going to play, so the way I play them is 
pretty accurate. Lennie and I worked together on 'Bird.' He trusts me. Music is 
something I have a pretty strong handle on." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lush Life," Elias says, will be released theatrically this year in Europe. In 
fact, it recently screened at the London Film Festival. "It got a great 
review," Elias says. "I went over because I wanted to see it in front of a huge 
audience. It did very well." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a European feature," Baker concludes. "It has a European feel. If 
it was a feature in America, it would last about a minute. So it's good it's on 
cable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lush Life" premieres Friday at 9 p.m. on Showtime and repeats May 26 at 8 
p.m.

CONSTRUCTING FANTASY; A LOOK AT SOME LOS ANGELES ARCHITECTURE BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WEBB, Michael Webb is the author of two recent books: Architects 
House Themselves: Breaking New Ground and Architect's Guide to Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five thousand architects from across the United States are expected to attend 
the centennial convention of the American Institute of Architects, which began 
Friday at the new Los Angeles convention center. For a city battered by a 
string of frantically publicized disasters, this is an opportunity to show our 
guests, and remind ourselves, how much of value remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Students visiting Los Angeles from Europe and Japan have a keener appreciation 
of our architecture, past and present, than many Angelenos. They know that you 
have to get off the freeway and explore the neighborhoods to find the treasures 
and curiosities. Most Americans are intimidated by the scale of the city or are 
blinkered by prejudice. "Because the principal business of Los Angeles has been 
to produce some of the world's best fantasies, perhaps it is inevitable that we 
think of its architecture as largely composed of palatial homes and restaurants 
in the shape of a hat," reads a New Yorker's blurb for "Landmarks of Los 
Angeles." It's a view that's widely shared by people who know the city only 
from television or a bus tour of stars' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you decide -- and find -- what is worth seeing? The Baedeker for 
architectural explorers is "Los Angeles: An Architectural Guide" by David 
Gebhard and Robert Winter (Gibbs Smith Publisher: $21.95; 520 pp.). This is the 
fourth incarnation of what began, in 1965, as a modest listing of mostly recent 
buildings in Southern California. I still have my well-thumbed copy of the 
original, which I bought as a first-time visitor from London. It led me to such 
now-vanished gems as Angel's Flight on Bunker Hill and the black-and-gold 
Richfield building downtown; to Irving Gill's Dodge House in West Hollywood and 
Richard Neutra's silvery space ship for Josef von Sternberg in Northridge. I 
was hooked, and eventually moved here to find my own piece of Neutra and to 
enjoy more of what I had briefly sampled. 
</P>
<P>
 The new edition is 10 times as dense as the first, and limits itself to 
greater Los Angeles, leaving surrounding areas for a future publication. It's 
encyclopedic in scope and generously illustrated; an invaluable resource for 
anyone who is curious about the growth and flowering of Los Angeles. Too bad 
the publisher didn't catch the many typos and factual errors, some reproduced 
unchanged from the 1985 edition. The Pacific Design Center never built its red 
hall. The Pacific Theater and the Menzies house in Beverly Hills were 
demolished years ago, as were a score of other buildings listed here. To be 
useful, a guide should supply current names and the latest credits for 
conversions and rehabs. The McDonald's in Downey was not the first of the 
golden arches, and there's no mention of the fact that the parent company is 
threatening to demolish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebhard and Winter boast of their catholic taste, but too many of the more 
adventurous recent buildings are omitted or dismissed with a derisive label. 
Surrealist-Expressionist is an oxymoron and doesn't describe either "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" or Frank Gehry's idiosyncratic buildings. The authors 
would blush to characterize a Victorian house in such unscholarly terms, and 
should recruit a more open-minded collaborator to cover work they cannot relate 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has done more to promote classic modern architecture than the veteran 
photographer Julius Shulman. For every person who has sat in Pierre Koenig's 
1959 Case Study house in the Hollywood Hills, thousands have enjoyed the 
romantic image of two young women in white dresses, chatting within a steel and 
glass room that's cantilevered over the lights of Los Angeles. Another 
memorable photo shows Ayn Rand with friends in the silver-walled yard of the 
Von Sternberg house. "A Constructed View: The Architectural Photography of 
Julius Shulman" by Joseph Rosa (Rizzoli, distributed by St. Martin's Press: 
$50; 224 pp.) shows how Shulman manipulated reality to create images of 
enduring beauty, and a vision of Southern California as the promised land of 
modernism, full of machines in nature's garden. The superficial text fails to 
develop this theme or to reveal the quirky, opinionated man behind the camera. 
But the images, well-chosen and superbly reproduced, recapture the excitement 
of an era -- from the late 1930s through the 1960s -- when a few bold spirits 
believed they could change the world. Shulman kept at it for another two 
decades, and he has never lost his faith in the power of architecture to enrich 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners still get excited by the promise of "World Cities: Los Angeles" 
edited by Maggie Toy (Academy Editions: $95; 400 pp.), the second in a British 
series of tomes that juxtapose history with a portfolio of pace-setting 
buildings and projects. The price is high but, at about 60 cents an ounce, this 
book is a bargain, and it can also be used to build the pecs or to tether a 
balloon. However, as a portrait of L.A., it suffers from a severe case of 
schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
 The introductory essays evoke the spirit of place. Planners Elizabeth Moule 
and Stefanos Polyzoides describe a city that has been built and rebuilt four 
times as it grew from "a tiny and unimportant village" to a metropolis, and 
they outline their plan to revitalize downtown Los Angeles as a regional hub. 
Architectural historian Diane Ghirado denounces the rape of Southern California 
by greedy developers and irresponsible officials. Architect Kim Coleman 
intercuts her personal insights on the city with musings on a visionary plan 
for West L.A. There are other essays, and the transcript of a forum, held in 
London, at which a dozen authorities talked at cross purposes, generating much 
heat and little light. 
</P>
<P>
 Series editor Maggie Toy introduces a selection of recent buildings that were 
proposed, built, or are still to come. The selection is heavily tilted toward 
the arresting diagrams of the avant garde, and the most radical built work, 
with 48 pages of work by Eric Owen Moss alone. Frank Israel's uncompleted house 
in Berkeley has strayed in (perhaps the Brits thought it was a far-flung 
suburb) but there's almost no coverage of his brilliant warehouse conversions 
in Los Angeles. There's nothing on Frank Gehry's urbane Loyola campus; photos 
of his own house and the Chiat/Day offices in Venice are accompanied by 
descriptions of other buildings. There are pages of unbuilt projects, but not a 
word on a score of recent landmarks, or the thoughtful work of Frederick 
Fisher, Hank Koning, Julie Eizenberg and other leading talents. The color 
images are dazzling but unreal. Three spreads and several full pages present 
the downtown skyline as the Emerald City, untouched by graffiti, traffic or the 
homeless. A clogged freeway yields a visual poem of moving lights. Every 
building is pristine and backed by an azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to this beauty queen, "Landmarks of Los Angeles" by Patrick McGrew 
and Robert Julian (Abrams: $49.50; 288 pp.) resembles an apple-cheeked granny. 
Over 500 Historic-Cultural Monuments of the City of Los Angeles are described 
by date and illustrated with authors' charmingly old-fashioned photos. They 
include a giant fig tree, a fire boat, the Hollywood sign and buildings that 
reflect every imaginable style and fantasy. Several of these registered 
monuments have succumbed to greed or vandalism. As this paper remarked in 1991, 
Los Angeles has "one of the worst preservation records in the nation (and) has 
been left with relatively few protected structures." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate L.A. fantasy may be living beside the ocean, and "Beach Houses 
From Malibu to Laguna," text by Elizabeth McMillian, photographs by Melba 
Levick, foreword by Frank Gehry (Rizzoli: $50; 208 pp.), shows two dozen ways 
to do it. Designers and owners discuss their choices with the former 
architecture editor of "Architectural Digest," and the images are as seductive 
as the surf. Standouts include contemporary places by John Lautner, Richard 
Meier and Bart Prince; the richly tiled Adamson house in Malibu, and Robert 
Graham's live-in artwork for the Doumanis in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Lloyd Wright in Hollywood: Visions of a New Architecture" by Robert L. 
Sweeney (The MIT Press: $50; 256 pp.) explores a frustrating decade in the life 
of an architect too often portrayed as a superman. Wright came to Los Angeles 
to design the Hollyhock house for oil heiress Aline Barnsdall while working on 
the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. On his return from Japan, he tried to secure major 
commissions here, but was able to design only four small houses. Sweeney, who 
oversees the Schindler house in West Hollywood, shows how Wright struggled to 
develop a new system of construction, using cast-on-site concrete blocks. It's 
a tragic tale of a visionary frustrated by unreliable clients and contractors, 
a persistent lack of funds -- and his own hubris. For, Sweeney suggests, Wright 
was determined to claim credit as an inventor, and ignored the experience of 
others in using concrete blocks. His legacy -- of leaky artworks -- falls far 
short of what he might have achieved.

 I just want to express my delight in reading "The Amazing Story of the 
Tonellis in America" (by Bill Tonelli, April 17). It was one of the most 
engaging articles I've read in a long time, starting with a great concept and 
culminating in a magnificent follow-through by Bill Tonelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonellis arise! Today the nation, tomorrow the world!

 I recently celebrated the results of 10 years of study involving the origins 
of my family name of Lozzi. The search included studying every phone book in 
every city in the United States and leafing through countless genealogical 
records in libraries. I contacted 140 families of the same name, sending a 
questionnaire and then planning a reunion. Last October, 40 Lozzis met in New 
Jersey for a weekend. They came from California, Nevada, Illinois, Kansas, New 
York and New Jersey. The group included second and third generations of 
families who had immigrated almost a century ago. By the end of the weekend we 
had formed a committee to plan more reunions and research. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States cannot succeed without a knowledge and comprehension of 
history. Every immigrant brings part of the place of their origin with them and 
it is this gathering of parts that built this land. I believe this next 
generation will seek to learn about the past, and will gain a new respect for 
continuity.

 It is always a surprise when you see your name in print. I am a Tonelli; in

 My father and his brothers and sisters are very proud of their heritage. My 
father was the first born in America, and his one regret was "losing" the 
language of his parents. They desired that he learn and use English to be 
successful in school and later in business. But he never forgot his ethnicity. 
A career Air Force officer, he looked for the name Tonelli wherever he 
traveled. To this day, there is an "authentic" coat-of-arms hanging in our 
family room. And he made his sauce from scratch; it wasn't sauce if it hadn't 
simmered for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was proud of his Italian descent but he was also proud to be 
American. Even with all its perceived faults, this is still the best country in 
the world.

MAN'S INHUMANITY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The romancing of Mexican rodeos in "Ride 'Em, Charro" (by David James Rose, 
photographs by Thomas R. Dey, April 17) was incredibly irresponsible. One does 
not need to be an animal activist to object strenuously to the practice of 
tripping horses at full gallop for "sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Horses break their necks, their limbs are literally torn from their sockets 
and those that do manage to get up are forced to re-enter the arena until they 
are fatally injured. The reason legislation forbidding these horrors is 
proceeding is because there are enough people who feel that the unnecessary 
cruelty and pain caused to these beautiful animals must end.

 I am a fifth-grade teacher with the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
Two-thirds of my students this year are of Mexican background. Only last week, 
in response to recent television coverage of the so-called "sport" of 
charreria, these youngsters wrote impassioned letters to protest the 
classification of these barbaric events as part of Mexican culture. They 
discussed the contests with their parents who, according to the children, do 
not consider them part of their culture, pronouncing them instead the lowest 
sort of cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 And here we have your magazine lauding the people who partake in these 
dreadful events, which you categorize as "an interplay of style and beauty." As 
for this being a "tradition" and therefore worthy of being taught to a new 
generation: This is the United States of America, and although other cultures 
are part of what has built this nation, deliberate cruelty and torture of any 
sentient being are not an acceptable "tradition" in our world.

 My sister and I stable our horses in the Pico Rivera Equestrian Center, 
adjacent to the Pico Rivera Arena. We observe many charros in action. The use 
of pain and fear is rampant in the horse world, and nowhere is it more evident 
than in the charreada. The wild mares mentioned in the article are terrorized 
by the charros. No cowboy or charro working on a ranch would risk breaking 
horses' legs and shoulders by roping them by the legs. And no "tradition" can 
justify such cruel and stupid behavior.

 It was depressing to read of charreria so soon after your piece on 
bullfighting. This is 1994, and what were once thought of as expressions of 
man's dominance over animals are now only the acts of cowardice.

 As a result of their being roped and thrown violently to the ground, many of 
the horses used in charreria are crippled. Those same horses are used 
repeatedly throughout the charreada season, generally April through October. 
All will ultimately be sent to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Latina, I say there are many things to be proud of about our culture, but 
this is plain cruelty. Ban horse tripping!

 I've attended the charreada at Pico Rivera and at Riverside. However, I failed 
to appreciate the "equestrian ballet." Instead, I witnessed frightened horses 
being driven at a run, then intentionally lassoed and tripped. I sat in horror 
as this "artistry" was performed on weanlings and yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
 I must take The Times to task, too, for the implication that the bill in 
Sacramento, which would prohibit the intentional tripping of a horse by the 
legs for entertainment or sport, is being carried forward by animal rights 
activists. In fact, the bill is being furthered by members of preeminent 
associations in the areas of law enforcement, equine veterinarian care and 
responsible horsemanship, who deem this practice to be inhumane.

 THE MUSEUM OF HAPPINESS by Jesse Lee Kercheval (Faber and Faber: $22.95; 276 
pp.) Who's in charge here? Certainly not Jesse Lee Kercheval, a talented young 
author who prefabricates a book-and-a-half's worth of off-center personae, then 
watches in astonishment as they gyrate to their own nachtmusik .Certainly not 
Ginny Gillespie, Kercheval's doppelganger , who hauls ash (her late husband's) 
to Paris in 1929 and becomes enmeshed with Roland Keppi, an Alsatian with 
webbed fingers whose prescient family "know things they have no way of 
knowing." They meet in Montmartre where Roland is feeding the birds and proceed 
to consecrate a demi-innocent love affair. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pleasant bagatelle, a delight to read, not quite straightforward but 
close enough. Such is Kercheval's wile that you are thigh-deep into the 
narrative and pausing for a smile before you're fully aware of whom you're 
dealing with. There's Claudia, a restaurateur who "had been a nun once, or was 
it an artist's model?" and who refuses to serve the well-off ("Go eat at 
Maxim's, you can afford it"). There's a couple of Gypsy pickpockets named 
Bathsheba and Beelzebub. There's big-eared Fuss, a German "as ugly as liver" 
who involves Roland in a murder, and Schmidt, who tries to commit suicide by 
overdosing on carrots. And Marie-Louise, a career ladies-room attendant worth 
knowing: "The third from the end has the most comfortable seat." By windup, it 
seems normal that they all end up running a lace factory in the town of Le Puy. 
Nobody in charge there either.

 Regarding "World War II: When Lions Roared" (NBC, April 19-20): I was very 
disappointed in Part 2 of this movie.It was very shallow. No mention of Japan 
and Italy's part in the war. No mention of the atomic bomb dropped on Japan; no 
mention of Hirohito -- or Mussolini. No mention of the surrender to Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur on the battleship Missouri. No mention of Adm. Nimitz. In 
other words, very shallow.

 DEPARDIEU: A Biography by Paul Chutkow (Knopf: $24; 351 pp.) It is not true -- 
not quite -- that French producers are required by law to star Gerard Depardieu 
in at least 50% of their movies.What is true is that when the actor was 
fustigated in the American press over some nasty business with women, the 
National Assembly issued a formal declaration of solidarity, while the 
government sent Washington an official note of protest (something akin to a 
U.S. Senate vote of confidence in Errol Flynn). Just who is this actor sui 
generis, this "living, breathing part of the patrimony," this icon of whom 
normally unflappable Times film critic Sheila Benson wrote, "Depardieu has an 
almost indecent magnetism"? In a deeply researched if somewhat obeisant 
biography, American Paul Chutkow tries to harness, a least for a moment, a 
"force of nature" of such monumental eccentricity as to constitute a living 
labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
 A less likely star never graced the silver screen. "Bearish and barrel-shaped, 
with unkempt hair and a nose that cannot be made to look straight from any 
angle," Depardieu has overcome not only an Everyman physique but also a brutish 
childhood and a debilitating speech defect. Diagnosis: a mental block stemming 
from a family that spoke, if at all, in grunts. Prescription: listen to Mozart 
two hours a day. Result: Sensation. Acting, Depardieu tells Chutkow in this 
rich biography, fulfilled "a terrible need to communicate." Acting, says 
director Paul Regy, is "a way for him to avoid madness or prison."

 "The Painting on the Wall" (by Wanda Coleman, Three on the Town, April 17) was

 Public support and funding for art contribute to positive growth and 
development of people and communities. Absent from Coleman's piece was credit 
for this support. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural featured in Coleman's column was funded by a grant from the L.A. 
Arts Recovery Program, part of the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs 
Department in cooperation with the California Community Foundation. The program 
was established to create cultural and artistic projects that contribute to 
rebuilding L.A. and encourage artistic empowerment in the wake of the 1992 
civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was made possible through a unique funding partnership -- AT&T, 
the California Arts Council, the California Community Foundation and Cultural 
Affairs Department, the J. Paul Getty Trust, the L.A. Art Association, the 
National Endowment for the Arts and the Los Angeles Times.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

 More elaborate than the original but just as shrewdly put together, James 
Cameron's 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) 
cleverly combines the most successful elements of its predecessor with a number 
of new twists to produce one hell of a wild ride. And would you believe a 
kinder, gentler Terminator? Arnold Schwarzenegger again stars; Edward Furlong 
plays the son of Linda Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Good-natured but insightful fun, Fred Schepisi's smart and sassy 1992 Mr. 
Baseball (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is more culture-clash comedy than baseball 
flick. Tom Selleck, never better, plays a veteran New York Yankees hitter who 
finds himself traded off to a Japanese team. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of its effects derived not from Alfred Hitchcock but his imitators, 
Final Analysis (NBC Monday at 8:30 p.m.) is a misfired 1992 thriller starring 
Richard Gere as a psychiatrist treating disturbed patient Uma Thurman. Gere 
ends up passionately and ludicrously enmeshed with her older sister (Kim 
Basinger). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the original was hilarious, this 1991 sequel, The Naked Gun 2 1/2: 
The Smell of Fear (CBS Wednesday at 8 p.m.), finds the filmmakers beating a 
dead horse into the ground, with only the opening credits good for a chuckle. 
Leslie Nielsen is back, this time to save the country from vested interests 
trying to block a new energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Gun (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.) is that wildly popular 1986 movie, a 
male-bonding adventure that's both mind-boggling and vacuous. Allegedly based 
on the Navy's crack fighter-pilot program at San Diego's Miramar Naval Base, it 
sucks us into a high-tech world of multimillion-dollar aircraft and hell 
bent-for-leather flyboys. Tom Cruise stars with Kelly McGillis (look for Meg 
Ryan and Val Kilmer's minor but key performances). 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing anyone human does in the rather conventional 1991 smoke opera 
Backdraft (NBC Friday at 8 p.m.) can hold a candle to the eye-popping 
pyrotechnics. Kurt Russell and William Baldwin are brawling hothead firefighter 
brothers; with Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Scott 
Glenn and Rebecca DeMornay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Kasdan's enjoyable but elusive 1985 Western Silverado (KCOP Saturday 
at 8 p.m.) is affectionate and caring of the form but a little bit too cooled 
out to be truly satisfying. It tells of four very different men (Kevin Kline, 
Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover) who join forces to go after the 
bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Short on style and pace but strong in conviction and performances, the 1990 A 
Thousand Pieces of Gold (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) tells of a young Chinese 
woman (Rosalind Chao) who ends up the "property" of a fellow countryman in an 
Oregon gold-mining village, circa 1880.

 If ... (Bravo Tuesday at 3 and 8 p.m.; Saturday at 6 and 11:30 p.m.) and O 
Lucky Man! (Bravo Tuesday at 5 p.m., Wednesday at 2 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m.): 
Lindsay Anderson's dazzling, surreal 1969 study of rebellious boarding school 
students, and its 1973 sequel, which follows one of its students (Malcolm 
McDowell) into a rocky career as a coffee salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Last of the Mohicans (AMC Wednesday at 3 a.m.) is not as swiftly involving 
as the recent Daniel Day-Lewis remake of the James Fenimore Cooper novel set 
against the French and Indian War. But director Maurice Tourneur's 1920 version 
possesses the very quality the newest version lacks: pictorial grandeur. 
Barbara Bedford and Albert Roscoe star.

 HIGH STAKES: Inside the New Las Vegas by Gary Provost (Truman Talley/Dutton: 
$23.95; 320 pp.) If you build it they will come. They did, and they do. They 
are building it so fast, the "new Las Vegas," and they are coming in such 
numbers that Gary Provost's book went out of date between writing and 
publishing. The spectacular, garish, pyramidal Luxor; the exuberant 
free-show-an-hour Treasure Island; the new MGM Grand, biggest hotel in the 
world (they had to buy an adjacent golf course to fit it in) -- all have opened 
since Provost's deadline, and all support his overriding theme: This is the Age 
of Total Entertainment, and despite proliferation of gambling across the United 
States, Vegas is six or seven years ahead of anybody else, Disney included. As 
MGM CEO Robert Maxey says, "We can turn this place from being a gambling town 
to the great American vacation spot" (with gambling, of course), to which 
Provost appends: "The old Las Vegas, if it is not dying, is at least sucking 
serious wind." 
</P>
<P>
 As near as any book on Mach-3 Vegas can be, Provost's is timely, observant, 
somewhat visionary and funny. (Circus Circus chief Bill Bennett on a dreaded 
fundamentalist convention: "They came with the Ten Commandments in one hand and 
a 10-dollar bill in the other and they didn't break either one.") Coming close 
to total entertainment himself, Provost observes the metamorphosis of the city 
from Mob to Mickey, gives a history of the games (the roulette ball used to be 
a live, if dizzy, mouse), tells us why rooms and meals are so cheap (a $4 steak 
will run you $54 after you navigate the casino en route to the restaurant), and 
explains, not that he needs to, why we gamble: "Not as good as sex, but better 
than peanut-butter pie."

 MILE HIGH MADNESS: A Year With the Colorado Rockies by Bob Kravitz (Times 
Books/Random House: $22; 257 pp.) There's this pitcher called Curtis Leskanic, 
plays for the Colorado Rockies.Shaves his legs and arms. Says the shaved legs 
make him feel "you know, liberated." Says a shaved right arm adds 3 m.p.h. to 
his fastball. And there's heavy-lidded ex-Angel Dante Bichette, whose 
otherworldly demeanor and "nice butt" draws hosts (hostesses?) of female fans 
to the right-filed seats. That's it, character-wise. The rest of the Rockies 
are pretty bland, devoid of idiosyncrasy, which is odd in itself, since they 
are players -- veterans, rookies, slugs -- whom "other people did not want," 
the very essence of eccentricity. Bob Kravitz chronicles the first year of this 
expansion baseball team in a competent but bloodless bio long on finance but 
short on zest. The team was a raging success in "the time zone that baseball 
forgot." Considerably more ept than, say, the 1962 Mets (the Rox even had a 
batting champion, Andres Galarraga), they drew 4 1/2 million fans, a million 
more than the population of Colorado (the equivalent of the Dodgers' drawing 35 
million). Kravitz leaves the impression, though, that the team was widely liked 
, not loved as were those Mets, immortalized in Jimmy Breslin's "Can't Anybody 
Here Play This Game?" Hey, Galarraga is no Marvelous Marv Throneberry; manager 
Don Baylor is no Casey Stengel; Kravitz is no Breslin.

 THE CELESTINE PROPHECY: An Adventure by James Redfield (Warner: $17.95; 246 
pp.) Heaven is real. It's right here, only we can't see it.Not yet. That's what 
James Redfield says. Picking up where Harmonic Convergence (HC) mercifully left 
off, Redfield would have us believe that a "spiritual renaissance" is imminent, 
a new world order based on love, trust, beauty, rapture, old-growth forests . . 
. good things like that. When? Well, the year 2000 is at hand. Something about 
those zeros elicits hope, a cleansing, sort of a New Millenium Resolution -- 
all of which the world could use. The trouble is, AD 2000 is an arbitrary 
number, man-made, just as significant as 1748, say (or better, 1996: Jesus was 
born in 4 BC). Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 While HC was based on the Mayan calendar, Redfield's New Age centers about 
"The Manuscript," written in 600 BC and only now coming to light. Its "Ten 
Insights" are scattered about Peru (nobody says why). As the Insights are 
unearthed (conveniently in numerical order) their Wisdom is revealed. Such 
action in a book that's 95% exegesis is provided by a handful of gutty little 
philosopher/scientists racing to find the Truth before the enemy does. The 
enemy is the Peruvian government, led by the clergy who want "The Manuscript" 
suppressed: a matter of unemployment. And what is revealed? That there is no 
such thing as coincidence; that beauty is truth, truth beauty. That we can 
improve crops by thought-projection. "Humans," says Redfield, "are carrying 
forth the universe's evolution toward higher vibrational complexity." Apropos, 
the Mayans didn't disappear, they vibrated themselves into a new dimension. No 
kidding.

 TROZAS by B. Traven, translated from the German by Hugh Young (Ivan R. Dee: 
$22.50; 272 pp.) The mysterious B. Traven, long dead, long unread, opens 
another vein; incenses us; makes us cry. An itinerant American of rare gifts, a 
seaman/journalist/actor who grew up in Germany, Traven settled in Mexico in the 
1920s, where he observed a form of bondage worse, in its way, than that of the 
American South. "Trozas" (mahogany tree trunks), one of Traven's "Jungle 
Series" just being published in English, unfolds in Chiapas -- the southern 
province whose recent rebellion has come 100 years late. Exploited, 
manipulated, abused, eternally in debt, naked and exhausted, generations of 
Traven's peons labor their lives away in the fetid jungle hacking at hack-proof 
trees, hauling two-ton trunks through tropical swamps that are the natural 
habitat of reptiles, insects and pumas, and the unnatural habitat of vicious 
foremen with bull whips. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, there is no way out. Traven traces a typical path, that of Vicente, 
only 10, whose father has died. It is only "honorable" to assume the father's 
debts of 92 pesos. A priest demands 30 pesos more for invoking God's blessings 
on the corpse. A "labor contractor" pays the priest in return for Vicente's X 
on a pact promising to repay the agent, with interest. Vicente owes another 25 
pesos "recruitment commission," another 25 "tax." He must buy stripped-down 
essentials -- a blanket, a tiny cooking tin -- at the company store, marked up 
1,000%. He is paid a few centavos a week. "Everyone," writes Traven, "needed 
between 6,000 and 8,000 years to be absolved of his debt through his work." 
This is a harsh, brutal novel, gashed with satire, Conradian in scope. And 
bleak. When a comrade dies, the laborers cannot believe he will be received in 
heaven as an equal. Maybe a new shirt and bits of dried meat in his tortilla, 
but he'll be hauling trozas there as well -- "For Eulalio had left without 
paying his debts."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; JALEEL WHITE PACES HIS GROWTH WITH 
URKEL'S -- STEADY, SURE AND FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's another side to Steve Urkel. There's also another side to actor Jaleel 
White, who plays TV's most popular nerd, on ABC's Family Matters. Both are 
revealed Friday on the show's fifth-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 White returns as Stefan Urquelle, introduced in an episode last December. This 
is an Urkel with rearranged genes -- in other words, a totally cool Urkel. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor hopes the suave Urquelle will show audiences that he's more than 
just the bespectacled kid decked out in high-water, suspendered trousers whose 
nasal proclamations have tickled -- and sometimes irritated -- the public's 
fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent lunch at a Downtown Los Angeles restaurant, White chats politely 
with fans who interrupt him at least a dozen times as he tries to explain 
Urkel/Urquelle's future. Even though he describes Urquelle as "everything I 
wish I could be," White in person seems to be a lot more Urquelle than Urkel. 
</P>
<P>
 The alter ego is just one device producers hope will keep audiences interested 
in the sitcom, which, they acknowledge, now places Urkel at its epicenter. 
Originally, the show intended to focus on a loving, extended African American 
family; it now centers on the antics of its nosy neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaleel did one spot" in the first season, explains co-executive producer Gary 
Menteer, who also directs many episodes. "He broke out so big we could tell 
before it aired, from the audience reaction, that he was going to become a 
regular." 
</P>
<P>
 When Urkel became an instant hit, Menteer acknowledges, there was some 
resentment from the original cast members, but it "was very short-lived. They 
recognized his comedic talents." White has been in every show since. "As long 
as the ideas are fresh, I know it's going to be outrageous playing him and that 
it'll be fun," the self-confident actor says, laughing. And in a voice 
significantly lower than Urkel's nasal twang, he explains how it all works: 
"Steve likes Laura. Steve visits the Winslows. Trouble happens. Bottom line. 
That's the process." 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be hard to imagine a grown Urkel, White is no longer the 
12-year-old he was during the first season. Five seasons later, at 17, he's a 
foot taller at 5-foot-9. And as far as White is concerned, Urkel's changing in 
many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a character who can still grow," insists White, saying he can picture 
himself taking Urkel post-college. "I can't put any limitations on Steve. When 
people ask me, ' What will you do next season?,' I just say, 'Same as last 
year.' He has a car already; it's really cartoonish and very Urkel, but it's a 
car. People don't realize through little things like that, he's growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 As for being typecast, White scoffs: "I get asked that by more unemployed 
actors than anybody! The object of the game is to work and have fun while 
you're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 White's not concerned about what lies beyond "Family Matters." "I'm not in a 
hurry to do something else. I'm not interested in saying, 'Look, look, I'm not 
Steve Urkel now. I'm not out to do that. If I wanted to do that, I already 
could've." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, White plans to attend UCLA, where he hopes to study economics and 
business for the first two years and focus on television for the last two. He 
hopes to emulate his idol, Bill Cosby, and write and direct. White's already 
penned an episode of "Family Matters," which aired last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's taking his time, just as his folks always suggest. "We're the turtle 
family and we just watch all the rabbits out there," says the only child. "I'm 
only 17! I'm young, I have a lot of time to do what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the basketball fanatic gets to do Saturday is appear as himself on 
NBC's "Fantasies of the Stars": He'll be playing ball with his favorite team, 
the New York Knicks. After that, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "Family Matters" airs Fridays at 8 p.m. on ABC. Syndicated reruns air daily at 
6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on KTLA. "Fantasies of the Stars" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. 
on NBC. For ages 6 and up.

THREE ON THE TOWN: THIS BUD'S FOR YOU; ROSES ARE RED. VIOLETS ARE BLUE. WHY 
BOTHER TALKING TO EACH OTHER WHEN FLOWERS WILL DO?

<P>
 The august Pasadenans who trundled down Colorado Boulevard in their 
rose-garlanded carriages on the first day of 1890 were using a now-forgotten 
language: the dialect of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same genteel Victorians who put trousers over the bare mahogany legs of 
their pianos conveyed their blunter sentiments in a 19th-Century FTD code. A 
sprig of wild sorrel signaled its humorless sender's warning: "He makes a foe 
who makes a jest." A bouquet of smelly tansy meant: "I declare war against 
you." A dozen dianthus said that the lovelorn sender felt "repulsed, but not in 
despair," meaning he wasn't taking no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunt floral sentiment of that first Rose Parade -- and all 104 since -- 
was addressed to the frost latitudes, and it went something like this: " We 
have roses in January; how d'ya like them apples?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though the California State Floral Assn. still sends its members a version of 
the old posy code (clovers for luck, chrysanthemums for sympathy), something 
else is in order for a society that expresses its profoundest sentiments with 
forward bumper stickers, talk radio and semiautomatic weapons fire. Just say it 
with flowers, then leave town: 
</P>
<P>
 Bachelor's buttons with palm fronds: "I'm divorcing you and running off to 
Tahiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruned cockscomb in a bed of thistles: "Oh yeah? Does the name John Bobbitt 
mean anything to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus fern with potato blossoms: "Eat your vegetables! Love, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Baby's breath with money plant: "Where's the child support check, you bum?" 
</P>
<P>
 An arrangement of bulrushes: "That guy Limbaugh is full of it, and so are 
you." (Alternately, as used in New York: "Somebody ought to drop you in the 
river.") 
</P>
<P>
 Iris: "Time for an eye exam." (Bearded iris: "Time for an eye exam and a 
shave.") 
</P>
<P>
 A single anthurium among dogtooth violets: "Congratulations on getting your 
braces off and getting rid of that lisp." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild oats and wild cherry blossoms: "I'm being tested for sexually transmitted 
diseases, and I think you should be, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelweiss with aspen leaves: "Want to go skiing next weekend?" 
</P>
<P>
 A nosegay of snowdrops: "I hear you got busted for drug smuggling." 
</P>
<P>
 White camellias: "Don't be silly, darling, it's just a little cough." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowslips in a basket of wild grasses: "Sorry you fell on that pasture patty 
during the company picnic." 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer plant and gerbera daisies: "I'll be back on Sunday -- be sure to give 
the baby some of that new food." 
</P>
<P>
 A sage plant: "Congratulations on making Phi Beta Kappa!" 
</P>
<P>
 A lotus: "Call the orthopedist -- I can't get my legs untangled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lady slippers and bluebonnets: "You must accessorize better, dear." 
</P>
<P>
 Poppy with weeping willow: "I just can't get over George Bush losing the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon blossoms, torch-lily and rubber plant: "I want my money back on this 
crummy car or I'll set it on fire and roll it through the window of your 
dealership." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogwood blossoms with pussy willow: "I hear there's a job opening down at the 
ASPCA." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal roses and goldenrod: "Darling, we need to talk about a prenuptial 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Morning glory and nightshade: "It just won't work out. I'm a morning person, 
and you think Letterman is on too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy and hemlock: "I won't let you go! If you leave me, I'll kill myself!" 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of chickweed: "Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia creeper: "Has anybody seen Oliver North lately?"

 THE GUNS OF AUGUST by Barbara W. Tuchman (Ballantine: $14; 511 pp., 
illustrated). In her Pulitzer Prize-winning history, Tuchman delineates the 
personalities and events involved in the outbreak of World War I with the skill 
of a novelist. Thirty-two years after its initial publication, "The Guns of 
August" contains ominous echoes of the current crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
The Great War erupted at a time when popular wisdom insisted that their 
economic interdependence made large-scale war impossible for the crumbling 
empires that had dominated the globe during the previous century, and Bismark 
predicted "some damned foolish thing in the Balkans" would ignite the next war.

 FIBERARTS DESIGN BOOK FOUR edited by Nancy Orban (Lark Books: $21.95; 208 pp.) 
. This attractive volume is part of an ongoing survey of the work of artists 
and artisans from 24 countries. The most effective pieces remain true to 
traditional crafts and the nature of the material: weaving, tapestry, quilting. 
Many of the "art pieces" suggest unsuccessful copies of other media.

 BURMESE LOOKING GLASS: A Human Rights Adventure and a Jungle Revolution by 
Edith T. Mirante (Atlantic Monthly Press: $12; 333 pp.). In a combination 
memoir, travelogue and political statement, Mirante explains how she documented 
the Ne Win regime's persecution of Burmese ethnic minorities. She gets carried 
away by her sense of mission, illegally crossing the Thai-Burmese border to 
consort with heroin kingpin Khun Sa. Because she finds him charismatic and is 
encouraged by his statements about minority rights, she soft-pedals his 
responsibility for widespread misery, corruption and death. Expelled by the 
Thai authorities, she essentially dares them to rearrest her when she visits 
her flaky boyfriend (This is Khun Sa?) in jail. Mirante's call to end the 
mistreatment of the Burmese people is weakened by her self-righteous pose.

 BOHANNON'S COUNTRY by Joseph Hansen (Penguin: $5.95; 174 pp.). Set in the 
small coastal towns of central California, these neatly crafted mystery stories 
involve not Hansen's popular detective Dave Brandstetter, but ex-sheriff Hack 
Bohannon and his friends, a group of interesting, but never self-consciously 
"colorful" supporting characters.Hansen effectively depicts the kind of nasty 
little secrets that fester beneath the calm facades of small towns, especially 
in "Molly's Aim," in which a mildly retarded woman waits to take revenge on the 
high school hero who used her and discarded her.

 Once, the only highways the American Communist Party seemed concerned with 
were the ones they blocked with peace protests. But these days the Communist 
Party is demonstrating on a new road -- the information superhighway; as of 
this month, communism has gone on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this technology, we can reach straight to the people and they can do the 
same back to us," explains Evelina Alarcon, chairwoman for the party's Southern 
California district, which, she says, has 1,000 members. "There is the ability 
to reach millions. The system is opening up so those of us on the left can get 
our message out. The access has not really been there for the people's 
movement, and we're going to have to fight for it, but more and more 
working-class people are getting involved in computers." 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from hammer-and-sickle to mouse-and-floppy has been a quick 
one. According to Alarcon, planning began late last year for the Communist 
Party bulletin board on the Internet system that became available this month. 
Like any good multinational corporation, the party has also learned the art of 
teleconferencing, and recently conducted a 54-city town hall meeting with the 
theme "For Real Change Today and Socialism Tomorrow." The intent is to bring 
the Communist message to more people in less time, but the move is also good 
public relations: It helps counter the impression that the party is a relic. 
Membership hasn't moved much beyond 20,000 nationally over the past five years, 
but getting hip with a computer chip offers an image makeover that could lure 
new, younger activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see us as Soviet plants anymore," says Alarcon. "We're getting a 
positive response, and already have hundreds of e-mail messages inquiring about 
our positions on issues." 
</P>
<P>
 And if this plan works, what's next? A video game? "Sure," jokes Alarcon. 
"We'll call it 'Class Struggle.' " Craig Tomashoff

 BLACK SNOW by Liu Heng, translated from the Chinese by Howard Goldblatt 
(Grove: $11.; 261 pp.) and RUNNING WILD: New Chinese Writers edited by David 
Der-Wei Wang with Jeanne Tai (Columbia University Press: $15.95; 320 pp., 
paperback original). The struggle of the individual to escape the constraints 
of traditional societal expectations permeates recent Chinese fiction."Black 
Snow" depicts the efforts of ex-tough Li Huiquan to create a new life in 
Beijing after three years in a labor camp. Chafing under the restrictions of 
the corrupt central bureaucracy and the constant supervision of political 
instructors, police and neighborhood committees, Li Huiquan grows so alienated 
he makes Camus' Mersault look like a glad-hander: "No matter where he went, 
there was always someone telling him what to do and what not to do; by 
demeaning him, they reaffirmed their own superiority." Liu's grim novel 
presents a bleak portrait of blighted hope. Wang includes the work of ethnic 
Chinese writers living in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States in "Running 
Wild." In Yu Hua's chilling "One Kind of Reality" a family misunderstanding 
escalates into a series of murders in a grisly metaphor for the excesses of the 
Cultural Revolution. The narrator of Tang Min's "I Am Not a Cat" contrasts her 
experiences at an icily efficient state abortion clinic with the care her pet 
receives, while Gu Zhaosen juxtaposes two versions of the immigrant experience 
in the moving "Plain Moon."

 CHAPTERS FROM CHILDHOOD: Reminiscences of an Artist's Granddaughter by Juliet 
M. Soskice (Turtle Bay Press: $12.95; 223 pp., paperback original). Juliet 
Soskice was the granddaughter of Ford Maddox Brown and the niece of both Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.Long out of print, her charming memoir 
recounts her childhood in a warmly Bohemian milieu. At 8, Soskice and her 
cousins became self-proclaimed social reformers, distributing their own 
anarchist journal in Hyde Park. (She grew up to become a noted translator of 
Russian poetry.) But the humanistic values she learned at home brought her into 
conflict with the nuns at the religious schools she attended: "The thing was 
that I didn't really believe in hell. I thought if it was true it would have 
been in all the papers and I should have heard about it somehow." Soskice's 
impish good humor will beguile readers.

 YOU NEVER KNOW by Isabel Huggan (Penguin: $9.95; 241 pp.). Huggan's sharply 
observed stories depict middle-aged women examining their lives to discover 
what became of their hopes, plans and expectations.In "Throwing and Catching," 
an idealistic woman, disillusioned by her experiences in college, finds her 
life entangled with a retarded neighbor she knew as a child. Returning to the 
remote Hebrides village where she spent an idyllic summer, the narrator of 
"Knowing People" ponders, "Why we enter each other's lives and how we are meant 
to fit together is more than is given us to know. And yet that's what we want, 
isn't it? That's what we want to understand."

 Steve Wesolowski walks into Brennan's Pub in Marina del Rey with a swagger 
befitting his more than 500 victories. He studies the arena, a round green 
carpet about 12 feet in diameter, and takes a seat at ringside. Nearly every 
Thursday night for the last nine years, Wesolowski has come here with one goal 
-- to win. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no place for sissies. The regulars understand that. And no one is more 
of a regular than Wesolowski and the 25 speedsters on his Terrapin Station 
Racing Team. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all his -- no rentals (amateurs can rent a reptile for the evening for 
$3). He and his wife, Kelli, have even gone on trapping excursions in a 
Louisiana bayou searching for the perfect specimen -- a beast that will improve 
his team's best time of 1.8 seconds from the center of the carpet to the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, he's hoping to pit his Terrapin Flyer against the reigning queen of 
the Monster Division. Her name is Lascivious Lady -- and this four-pound turtle 
has won more than 600 races. Joe Gresko is her trainer and coach. "Joe and I 
have a little unspoken rivalry going," Wesolowski says, "but I've beaten him 
many times before with my mainstays -- Smokestack Lightning, Snowblind and 
Terrapin Flyer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lascivious Lady is taking it easy these days -- she's pregnant. So tonight 
Wesolowski has to be content with practice runs against lesser turtles. He 
stands and paces, claps his hands and gives his turtle a pep talk. The wins 
come fast and easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'd call myself," Wesolowski admits. "A sportsman, 
outdoorsman, a professional turtle racer. I tell my buddies and people at work 
'This is the king of sports.' They don't quite understand what it's like, or 
what I do or sacrifice. I feed the turtles fish and shrimp. They eat better 
than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesolowski is building a natural habitat complete with a pond in his back 
yard. And he's waiting. When Lascivious Lady returns, it will be a grudge 
match. Geoffrey Martin

CLOSING THE BOOK ON CHATTERTON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lionel Rolfe 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Los Angeles' last great bookstore is dying -- with the proverbial 
whimper, not a bang. The end is near, says one dejected employee -- maybe in 
weeks, maybe in days. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatterton's Bookshop, 1818 N. Vermont Ave., is the last of the great Los 
Angeles literary and political bookstores. On the same block of Vermont Avenue 
as the Los Feliz Theater and the Onyx Cafe, billed as the city's oldest 
coffeehouse, the bookstore seems to have given up on its mission of carrying on 
as the city's only real literary and political citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 Once shelving more than 75,000 volumes on subjects from Zen to Anais Nin (who 
had been a frequent customer), the store's new book stock has dwindled to 
nothing, and even its once exciting magazine and newspaper rack is mostly bare 
-- even of the standard titles. Its dwindling staff, once the font of 
cutting-edge knowledge in political and literary goings on, are dispirited, and 
all complain of never being told what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The proprietor, William (Koki) Iwamoto, rarely shows up anymore; the general 
manager, artist Tom Antell, is no longer on the payroll; Tony Russo, the former 
poet (he made a decision years ago not to write anymore) who serves as what 
there is of management, sometimes will admit his frustration at how little he 
knows of what's really going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chuck, the young anarchist who usually prides himself on the latest 
exciting developments in the fast-paced world of techno-anarcho-syndicalism, 
seems to be just going through the motions now. Margaret, whose former husband, 
Paul Vangelisti, an early partisan of Charles Bukowski, mostly wears a beatific 
smile and avoids all questions requiring direct answers about anything having 
to do with the store. Vangelisti led a modern European avant garde poetry 
movement centered around his magazine "Invisible City," whose activities 
defined much of the atmosphere at Chatterton's throughout the store's heyday in 
the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline has been particularly precipitous in the last few months. For a 
good long while, it was as if everyone was in a state of denial. No longer. Now 
the staffers only declare, "Each day I come to work I'm amazed we're still 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that Chatterton's drew on the tradition established by Papa 
Bach Paperbacks in the '60s, when that late, lamented West Los Angeles 
bookstore was the center of the city's then burgeoning counterculture. Koki was 
an employee of Los Angeles poet, publisher and Papa Bach proprietor John 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, when Papa Bach closed, Koki, a tall, healthy and strapping man 
who was almost always on the premises at Chatterton's, took stock. He closed 
the second Chatterton's he had opened in Pasadena, and despite his horror at 
the battle that his and other bookstores were up against, namely the extent of 
illiteracy in the upcoming generation, vowed to fight on. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties of Chatterton's fight for survival have been apparent just by 
looking at the empty shelves. Then, during the Northridge earthquake, signs 
went up in its windows announcing that the store was closing a few days for 
earthquake repairs. Actually, earthquake damage was not the only thing getting 
fixed. Problems with creditors were so bad that something had to be done. So 
Koki declared personal bankruptcy. And the store gained another small lease on 
life. Short of a miracle, though, the prognosis now is grim. Lionel Rolfe

TO SEEM IS NOT TO BE; AND OTHER RULES OF LIFE, LOVE AND AUTISM DONNA WILLIAMS 
TAUGHT ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY KAY BLAKELY, Mary Kay Blakely's last article for this magazine was 
Psyched Out, about depression and activist therapy. Her memoir, American Mom, 
will be published in October by Algonquin Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, shortly after publishing "Nobody Nowhere, The Extraordinary 
Autobiography of an Autistic," Donna Williams met me in the lobby of 
Manhattan's Mayflower Hotel. That is, Donna avoided me. After emerging from the 
elevator, she immediately shielded her face behind a sheaf of papers -- her 
written answers to the questions I had submitted -- and quickly bolted out the 
door. Wispy blond curls around a prettily freckled face gave her a waif-like 
appearance, camouflaging the iron will that led her to liberty after more than 
20 years in what she calls the prison and sanctuary of autism. Avoiding any 
brush with passersby, she fled down the street and headed into Central Park as 
I trotted breathlessly behind. Donna didn't have much use for people then. Even 
less for journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent my first two hours with Donna trying to conduct an interview as she 
walked briskly through Central Park. Pacing reduced the terror of speaking to 
strangers, and provided a rhythmic pattern for conversation. She didn't lower 
her defenses until she could be sure I had mastered the rules: No touching, no 
inflections, no fluttery gestures, no tape recorders, no changes in plan. 
Especially, no eye contact. Interviews had to be conducted outside. Sentences 
had to be simple -- subject, verb, object -- until she got used to strange 
voices. Questions had to be drawn in pictures if words didn't work. Goodbys had 
to be speedy, without any emotion. These were the strict terms of Being with 
Donna. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms vary among individual autistic people -- about 1% of the U.S. 
population -- and have been blamed on everything from demonic possession to bad 
parenting to sleep deprivation. Today, autism is known to be a neurological 
disorder in which sensory information floods the brain. It is, as Donna 
experiences it, "like having a brain without a sieve." When people speak to 
her, especially excited people with booming voices, she sees only waving hands 
and hears only "blah, blah, blah." Overstimulation can trigger a "shutdown" -- 
the catatonic stare and frozen body that Donna has said is like being 
"involuntarily anesthetized." 
</P>
<P>
 With obsessive concentration, another symptom of autism, she managed to write 
her first astonishing autobiography in four manic weeks. She had plopped the 
500-page manuscript on the desk of a child psychiatrist at the London clinic 
where she was a temporary clerk, asking him "to read it and tell me what kind 
of mad I was." At age 25, she finally learned that the massive confusion and 
mighty frustration she had been wiring around all her life had a name: autism. 
Despite severe sensory and neurological impairment, she is a high-functioning 
autistic individual with exceptional talents ("idiot savant" in psychological 
lore). The doctor passed the manuscript to a literary agent in London; it 
became a bestseller in the United States and abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 Donna has now completed another memoir describing the obstacles she overcame 
to move from "Donna's world" to "the world." The New York Times described Donna 
as "prodigiously talented. . . . And oh, can she write. The windows through 
which she allows us to view her experience are metaphor, perfectly rendered 
details and wonderful surprising phrasing." "Somebody Somewhere" is an almost 
incomprehensible achievement for someone who never thought of words as her 
first language.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout childhood, Donna communicated mainly through gestures and objects. 
Objects had life: "My bed was my friend; my coat protected me and kept me 
inside; things that made noise had their own unique voices which said vroom, 
ping, or whatever. I told my shoes where they were going so they would take me 
there," she wrote.

 Since words were meaningless strings of sound, she was never moved to ask the 
ubiquitous childhood question: But why, Mom? Why do I have to look both 
ways/turn off the TV/kiss grandma goodby? Instead of learning how and why 
people did what they did, she learned to copy conversation and behavior, 
exhibiting the echolalic and echopractic habits of autistic children. During 
her childhood in Australia, she memorized episodes of "The Brady Bunch." 
Whenever a situation triggered this stored dialogue, she would become Marcia or 
Greg or Alice. She responded to questions at school or home with the answers 
she thought people expected: "I said a lot of yes, yes, yeses. Cups of tea 
arrived without any connections between their arrival and the yes that had 
brought them there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Life was just a great long game of strategies and battle tactics to hide the 
flaws, holes and deficits," she wrote. Information did not translate from one 
situation to the next. "If I learned something while I was standing with a 
woman in a kitchen and it was summer and it was daytime, the lesson wouldn't be 
triggered if I was standing with a man in another room and it was winter and it 
was nighttime," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Her alcoholic mother interpreted Donna's strange behavior as a sign that she 
was possessed by evil spirits. Aside from a weekly paycheck, her father largely 
absented himself from his troubled family. At age 16, Donna left home. She 
supported herself with routine factory jobs, but the next 10 years were a 
constant struggle, including episodes of homelessness and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually she moved to London, where her exceptional ability to store facts 
helped her pass the entrance exam for college. (Donna has scored both genius 
and retarded on IQ tests.) Haunted by the constant threat of 
institutionalization, she hid her difficulties from most of her teachers and 
fellow students. After watching Donna for a few months, however, an observant 
classmate tried to confirm her hunch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Donna, you're different, aren't you?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess so," Donna said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just how different are you?" she pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it this way," Donna replied. "I'm a culture looking for a place to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Passing a London consignment shop on her way home from work one day, Donna saw 
a used typewriter and decided on impulse to buy it. She put in a sheet of paper 
and, four sleepless weeks later, had the book that "both saved me and destroyed 
me."  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lawrence Bartak, an Australian specialist in autism, offered to help Donna 
begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds. "I think I can now 
accept that I am disabled, with a very big abled and still quite a dis," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 While Donna had much to gain by joining "the world," there were excruciating 
losses as well -- she learned that without a nervous system, inanimate objects 
could not think or feel. Her treasured objects lost their life with this 
concept. "I realized I'd lived in a world of object corpses. God has a curious 
sense of humor," she wrote. She braved the initial loneliness and shock because 
"I was in love with my own aliveness and completeness." The alternative was not 
to give a damn. "I gave a damn bigly." 
</P>
<P>
 I HAD NOT IMAGINED THREE YEARS AGO that this woman from another world would 
move me so deeply, introducing me to another way of seeing, another way of 
knowing. Donna and I stayed in touch after our first memorable meeting, by fax 
and phone and once, when she returned a year later, through a long weekend 
visit at my home in Connecticut. Conversations with her are often a humbling 
experience -- though that is never her intention. "What have you been doing all 
summer?" I'd ask. Well, she'd learned French and German, written another book, 
composed a musical score for a movie, finished several paintings and was 
preparing an instruction manual for teachers of autistic children. "What have 
you been doing?" she'd ask. Well, I was almost finished with the essay I 
started three months ago. One of us was once thought to be retarded and one of 
us was not -- and all of us, it seems, should rethink the usefulness of labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ours was not to be a conventional friendship. Donna is a wholly mature 
intelligence with a highly original take on life, questioning the meaning of 
everything and forcing me to do the same. Last year, as we were walking through 
my neighborhood, Donna looked up at the sky, stopped abruptly and sang a tune I 
had never heard before. Did she write that song? I asked. No, she replied, the 
birds wrote it. She pointed to the telephone lines where dozens of blackbirds 
were perched. At least I saw birds. Donna saw a musical phrase. The universe is 
full of unsung music most of us never hear. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot has changed in the past three years. She has gained greater insight into 
the ways of Red People (the "so-called normal people" who are like noisy, 
vibrating colors to her) and though one is never cured of autism, Donna now 
grasps more meaning from speech. "You don't have to speak so slowly now," she 
told me recently.  
</P>
<P>
 She's also found a way to reduce the distracting visual overload. Donna's 
earliest companions were bright spots of translucent color dancing before her 
eyes -- a mesmerizing light show no one else seemed to notice. Much later, she 
learned that she wasn't hallucinating -- the spots were real: Because of her 
acute vision, she can see air particles of reflected light that are invisible 
to Red People. Now, she has more visual mastery with a pair of special glasses 
that "provide context," minimizing the distracting details that could lock her 
attention for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also ceased the tapping, pounding, beating behavior commonly observed 
in those with autism, "the outward sign of the earthquake nobody saw," Donna 
wrote. When her senses overloaded as a child, she would bite her flesh like an 
animal bites the bars of its cage, not realizing the cage was her own body. "My 
legs took my body around in manic circles as though they could somehow outrun 
the body they were attached to. My head hit whatever was next to it, like 
someone trying to crack open a nut that had grown too big for its shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she learned new strategies, the rhythmic tapping, pounding and slapping 
also helped her keep track of where the edges of her body left off and the Big 
Black Nothingness began. In "Somebody Somewhere," she describes the two painful 
extremes of autism, both of which obliterate any concept of self: "Autism makes 
me feel everything at once without knowing what I am feeling or it cuts me off 
from feeling anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Though human touch and emotions present the risk of shutdown, Donna discovered 
she could brave these hurdles between autism and intimacy with Paul, her new 
husband. She met Paul, a musician, in a London music store. After noting his 
shy mannerisms and abrupt conversation, she correctly concluded that "he is 
like me." She wrote her phone number on a piece of paper and gave it to him. 
Four weeks later, he rallied the courage to call.  
</P>
<P>
 For an autistic couple, the recognition of love is not a wholly pleasant 
sensation. As her emotions approached "five on a scale of one to five," Donna 
battled to keep the self she had worked so hard to uncover from submerging 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something awful is happening," she told Paul. "I have a feeling I don't 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it something you ate? Are you upset? Do you need to eat?" Paul asked. 
</P>
<P>
 She finally worked her feelings out on paper and wrote him a letter: "The 
safer and happier I feel, the more it will make me want to run and escape. Do 
you realize this? Do you care enough, have patience enough and understanding 
enough, to support my fight against this stupid compulsion? If you do not, it 
is OK. But it would just be too hard if you didn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 He did understand. Together, they developed systems to keep the "self" from 
disappearing during frightening emotions -- Donna into her characters, Paul 
into his "faces," both manifestations of memorized behavior that they had used 
previously to cope with everyday life. They established what Donna calls their 
"ongoing specialship, a place of belonging." They had to talk a lot about 
sexual desire -- or the lack of it. They could both remember sexual experiences 
in their past when there was no "self" involved. An adult going through the 
motions of sex without a self, Donna said, feels much the same as a child who 
is "molested, abused and confused." The worst part, they agreed, was having to 
pretend to feelings they didn't have because that's what the Red People 
expected. "We were a pair of comrades discussing a decade each of self-rape," 
Donna says, "a pair of prostitutes talking trade." The desire to touch came 
slowly, with respect for their acute sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting their courtship was tricky -- the usual gift exchanges held no 
appeal for Donna, who rarely wants to own anything. The things she most enjoys 
are clouds, sunshine, trees, plants, flowers, wind and waves, a fire in a 
fireplace. How to wrap up the ocean? Paul once adopted the persona of 
man-romancing-woman and tried to buy a crystal Donna had admired in a gift 
shop. She told him to put it back -- she didn't want it. "There was too much 'I 
want to please you' in the air," she wrote, "too much 'let me escape me by 
focusing totally on you.' I could accept nothing in this atmosphere." Such 
blunt honesty is crucial to their relationship. Maintaining the self -- not 
characters, not facades, not routinized behaviors or patterns -- was perhaps 
the first and most critical rule of specialship. 
</P>
<P>
 I FELT MY ANXIETY RISING AS I DROVE INTO MANHATTAN TO MEET Donna and her 
husband for the first time. Traffic was moving at a crawl after a blizzard had 
dumped a foot of snow on the streets. I was already an hour late that February 
morning when I parked outside the Lyden Gardens, hoping their rule against 
changes in plan was flexible during natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna had always stayed at the Mayflower because familiarity was necessary to 
a sense of security. Whenever she enters a new room, she feels secure only 
after memorizing every detail: the windows, the blinds, the wallpaper pattern, 
the color of the furniture, the marks on the floor and, of course, the position 
of the door. Change frustrates autistic people because this memorizing is hard 
work. If one item is moved, the whole room has to be memorized again. When 
Donna returned to the Mayflower last year and asked for the same room, she 
instead was given an identical room with exactly the same furniture, colors, 
paintings, floor plan. But it might as well have been a tent in Central Park. 
What was so different, the concierge wanted to know? The view from the window. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, they had switched hotels so as to have a suite with a kitchen. 
Because of their multiple food allergies -- to milk, cheese, wheat, onions, 
among many others -- Paul preferred to cook their meals rather than risk eating 
unidentified ingredients in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our suite looks like a biscuit," Donna had said over the phone, meaning that 
it was beige. "It gives me a floaty feeling." Strongly affected by color and 
light, she was unmoored by beige. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna opens the door when I ring the bell, then steps immediately back into 
the foyer. She hums softly, makes a chuckling sound, then hums again. I 
recognize this pattern as her way of reducing terror. Though we have spoken 
freely on the phone, the initial moments of being together again are still 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello-Donna," I say evenly, looking over the shoulder of her yellow sweater. 
She puts her fingers on her lips, as if deciding whether to bite her nails or 
invite me in. I stand still as she hums, chuckles, hums, letting her take me in 
peripherally through her dark, tinted glasses. Finally, she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please take off your hat," she asks in her flattest, most mechanical tone, 
like a voice in a car telling me to put on my seat belt. I realize she can't 
see me yet. Even with the special glasses that provide context, I am The Friend 
Donna Mistook for a Hat. I remove the obstacle and she smiles in recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 She introduces Paul, a slim, tall man standing very still in the foyer. He 
looks past me and says hello, then disappears. Behind his colored glasses, the 
lower half of his handsome face appears stoic and solemn. Paul seems ill at 
ease, which I attribute to the presence of a stranger, my being late and their 
jet lag after a harrowing trip from London to New York. The blizzard had 
delayed their flight, the airports at both locations had been filled with 
frenzied crowds and they were living in a biscuit that made them feel floaty. 
</P>
<P>
 When Donna sits on the carpeted floor and immediately begins talking to me, I 
sit down on the floor, too. Our plan for the morning had been to take care of 
business first -- she had called the night before, greatly upset, because her 
printer wasn't working. Since Donna did her thinking on paper first, the broken 
printer rendered her mute, as it were, just as she was headed into a full week 
of media interviews. I had offered to take them to a computer store first, then 
visit for a while, then take a walk through Central Park together, blizzard or 
no. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul had picked up his coat as soon as I arrived, preparing to go out, then 
had put it down again when Donna and I sat down and began talking. He keeps 
walking in and out of the room. Half an hour later, his level of anxiety seems 
to escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you doing an interview?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really an interview," I explain. "We're just visiting." He gives no sign 
that he appreciates the difference, but my remark triggers a question about 
whether we want a cup of tea. Paul is the member of their team in charge of 
food and refreshments. We both say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Paul makes two cups of chamomile tea, a loud knock on the door abruptly 
halts all conversation. Donna, startled by the sudden sound, stares at the door 
as a key slips into the lock. The hotel maid materializes in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop!" Donna calls. "Don't come in!" Paul hollers from the kitchen. A clamor 
of raised voices -- from Donna and Paul, from me, from the maid -- fuse in 
mutual alarm. "We told them at the desk . . . do not disturb . . . I'm sorry . 
. . thought you were out." The maid quickly disappears but all equanimity is 
destroyed in an instant, as if a tear-gas bomb had dropped into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul delivers two cups of tea, then sits down on the couch away from Donna and 
me. Then he gets up. Then he sits down. He becomes absorbed in making a list of 
some sort. His jaw is set in grim endurance, as if he is lifting weights. Donna 
sees his distress, recognizes a case of the "jubblies" coming on -- "the yukky, 
gripping things inside your stomach under stress." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul, what's wrong?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 No response. Paul looks straight ahead, his face frozen. Emotional overload. 
Her words aren't getting in, so Donna steps over to the couch and gently bows, 
putting the crown of her head in Paul's face. Humming softly, she holds 
perfectly still for a few minutes, letting him smell and feel her hair. Then 
she reverses position, burying her face in his hair. This must be what they 
call a "jubblie-ectomy -- a ritual to get rid of the jubblies." Paul's jaw 
finally unlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Words now flood out. He reminds Donna of the plan -- and how anxious she had 
been all morning about the broken printer. Having absorbed her anxiety, he was 
prepared to take action as soon as I arrived. Now here we were, sitting on the 
floor, acting like two talking heads. All order and structure had 
disintegrated. Donna apologizes for abandoning the agenda. My appearance had 
started a chain reaction of triggered behaviors -- the compulsive speaking, the 
rote social questions, the automatic "yeses" that once more brought cups of tea 
seemingly out of nowhere.  
</P>
<P>
 In record time, we don our coats, get in the car, complete our chore. After a 
brief autistic tour of the city -- noticing the honking horns and the loud 
behavior of the Red People, seeing how the air conditioners just outside of 
apartments form a pattern like black boxes in a crossword puzzle -- we return 
to the hotel. Errand accomplished, everyone is more relaxed. I am invited to 
stay for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker than I can make a peanut butter sandwich, it seems, Paul arrives with 
three plates of steak, broccoli, cauliflower and beans.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk while we eat," Paul informs me when I start to chatter. "If you 
start talking, Donna won't know what she's eating." We click knives and forks 
and "simply be." Occasionally, a hum meets a good bite or signifies a private 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention after lunch that Donna doesn't seem to be interested in "buzzing" on 
colors and sounds as much as she used to. I remembered standing under a pink 
street light with her late one evening, our faces turned up to catch the 
falling snow directly -- it felt like we were speeding through space, rushing 
through a field of tiny pink planets. Did the willful control of autistic 
symptoms that imprisoned her also mean giving up the extraordinary pleasures of 
her acute sensory perception? What activities does she now enjoy? 
</P>
<P>
 She says the concept of "enjoy" is a whole new realm. She and Paul have 
"developed a checking procedure which gives us, for the first time, an ability 
to tell compulsion from 'want' or 'like.' " That was a huge breakthrough in 
autism terms; now that she knows the difference, she buzzes only when she 
"wants" to and not because the snow is there. 
</P>
<P>
 I put on my coat and prepare for terse farewells. The first time Donna and I 
parted company, she said, "Good-by" and closed the door. The next time, as if 
teaching herself to be more social, she said, "Goodby . . . and thank you. You 
have been a great bagful of information." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the blunt honesty of her real self, she says: "I can't say I've 
enjoyed your company. But I didn't mind it." She means to be clear, but then 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did that hurt your feelings?" she asks. Red People have complicated feelings 
that are always cropping up unexpectedly, getting hurt unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I answer honestly. After three years, I understand that while I may be 
enjoying Donna, she is most likely enduring me. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER A WEEK IN NEW YORK with another week of interviews to go, Donna calls to 
ask whether she and Paul can come to Connecticut for the weekend. When I come 
to pick them up, Paul asks me to look directly at him before we leave. It's a 
necessary hurdle to surmount before he can move into close proximity with me. I 
make eye contact, which, just like loud voices and fluttery gestures, can cause 
sensory pain. He jumps, then laughs loudly, then shivers. "It's like being 
pelted with ice cubes," he explains. It hurts, but it's done. Now he can bear 
my company for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna mentions that she and Paul have a firm house rule: No leaving soap suds 
in the sink after doing the dishes. Suds contain rainbows of color, and they 
can nearly paralyze an autistic person. If one of them happened by the sink, he 
or she could get stuck until the bubbles burst. I ask Donna if they have any 
other household rules. Here is a partial list: 
</P>
<P>
 No reading newspaper headlines in gas stations or newsstands. No watching 
Oprah Winfrey or Sally Jesse Raphael without checking first if I want to. No 
making the fruit bowl symmetrical. Attempt to keep track of your face and your 
body at all times. Say, "It's important to me," instead of just going ahead and 
doing things when you face opposition and can't battle verbally. Don't force 
yourself to stay in rooms or situations, eat food or be with people that are 
allergenic or that force you to disassociate or overload. Say "time" instead of 
throwing wobblies. Don't talk or answer people in a triggered way -- triggering 
gets out of control and the consequences are entirely out of your hands. To 
seem is not to be. No lining feet up with the furniture. Scrub your underarms 
-- just putting soap on your body is not washing. Take your glasses off before 
dressing (and put them back on afterward). Dare to mess. Don't use stored 
voices, stored intonation, stored movements or stored facial expressions. Never 
buzz on a road. Be nice to your body.  
</P>
<P>
 I have instructed my son Ryan, who is home from college, on the basic rules of 
Being with Donna and Paul. He's a gregarious kid with a ready handshake and 
hearty laugh. I tell him to reverse all his usual instincts: "You'll make them 
most comfortable by ignoring them." When we enter through the back door that 
afternoon, he quickly turns off the TV and disappears so that they can get 
acquainted with the house. After depositing their copious luggage, computer 
equipment and grocery bags in the guest room and kitchen, they begin feeling my 
house -- touching objects, tapping walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that noise?" Paul asks suddenly. I recognize the faint electrical hum 
of the refrigerator -- which Paul hears reverberating off the walls, blasting 
his ears. When they are acclimated, I bring Ryan back into the kitchen to 
introduce him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello-glad-to-meet-you" he says, looking down at his feet and speaking like a 
robot. He stands awkward and still for a moment, like a rookie actor who 
doesn't know where to put his hands. Donna wonders whether he is autistic or 
well-educated. She asks: "Are you always this quiet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, we answer, "Never" and "Sometimes." I mean that Ryan is not 
autistic; he means that he can handle the rules. Getting a straight answer from 
the Red People is a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan and I go out for lunch to give Donna and Paul the kitchen to themselves. 
When we return, they have cooked, eaten, done the dishes and are now outside in 
their snowsuits. My yard, front and back, is filled with exquisite snow 
sculptures: A perfect cat, with thin twiggy whiskers; a penguin on an iceberg 
with a fish at its webbed feet; a large snail with antennae. Their masterpiece 
is a two-story cottage landscaped with shrubs and trees; Paul is placing 
lighted windows in the second story. He asks if it was OK to take a few yellow 
Post-It notes from my office.  
</P>
<P>
 Without a word, Ryan goes to the front porch and picks some flakes of chipped 
concrete off the steps. As Paul puts the last Post-It in a second-story window, 
Ryan makes a flagstone path to the front door. Donna hums. "There are other 
ways of communicating besides language," as she often says. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of their food allergies, I ask whether Paul would like to cook dinner. 
Paul freezes at the suggestion. I don't know what part of my question has 
thrown him. Donna, reading his expression, calmly begins what I now recognize 
as a familiar litany of questions: 
</P>
<P>
 "Does Paul want to cook?" No response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does Paul not want to cook?" A faint smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do Paul's defenses want to cook?" No response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does Paul want Mary Kay to cook?" A faint smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does Paul want Ryan to cook?" A big smile. 
</P>
<P>
 So now we know. 
</P>
<P>
 AS WE GET INTO THE CAR the next day, Paul says, "Look, Donna! The big black 
arm is swinging back and forth instead of around in a circle!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes!" she says, like a tourist spotting a cultural peculiarity in a 
foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
 I look up from the ignition to see what they're talking about. What black arm? 
</P>
<P>
 "There," Paul points to the house next door. I look at the broad white 
exterior, the windows, the shrubbery. I see no arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the electric meter," he explains. I squint and focus, finally spotting a 
tiny black dot moving along a slotted opening. Even with perception glasses, 
Paul and Donna take in every minuscule movement. I start to understand Paul's 
earlier comment that 80% of the information overload is visual. I have lived 
next door to the big black arm for four years and never noticed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna's agent has invited us all to her country house for Sunday brunch. It 
qualifies as a "dinner party," which is never fun -- but Donna knows Ellen will 
appreciate the effort and she chooses to go. She and Paul have established 
their decision as a "want to" and not a compulsion to be polite. ("Mary Kay can 
take care of the 'blah, blah, blah,' " Paul says.) 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch as Ellen and and I talk, Donna overhears a remark that gives her 
a new insight. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you don't just sell books for the money -- you keep them for a while and 
make them better. You have feelings about the books?" Donna asks. "You care 
about them before you sell them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that's right," Ellen clarifies. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, you are like a baby-sitter of books?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Ellen says, smiling broadly. They connect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen walks us to the car after lunch. "Goodby, Donna," she says warmly. "I'll 
miss you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good-by," Donna says, and closes the car door. 
</P>
<P>
 We drive in silence for a while. "Why did she say, 'I'll miss you?' " she 
asks. I explain the concept of missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't she keep that feeling to herself?" There is no accusation in her 
questions -- she is merely consulting her bag of information, trying to 
understand the mysterious ways of the Red People. We like to blah-blah, we get 
attached, we love and enjoy, we miss. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER DINNER SUNDAY night, we realize we are getting close to our own goodby. 
Donna starts twirling a napkin on the table, buzzing on the spin. "Stop that, 
Donna," Paul says, then looks toward me. "She's doing that to make you 
irrelevant," he states matter-of-factly. Donna laughs her real laugh. She is 
delighted to be understood so perfectly, to be called on her "autie" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 When a similar exchange occurred the day before, Paul wondered if I had taken 
his comment as criticism of Donna. He explained their agreement to help each 
other this way, to recognize autism and assist each other in controlling it. 
Several times throughout their visit, one or the other had issued a reminder -- 
"Don't use 'voices' when you tell a story" . . . "That's a 'stored dialogue,' 
not a 'conversation' " . . . "Build a sculpture but don't 'perform' for 
people." The No. 1 rule: Be your real self. Which means you have to have a 
self. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna can mesmerize audiences with her ability to recite whole books on the 
subject of autism -- and just about anything else -- but Paul recognizes that 
those compelling speeches are not always what she means to say. Her own 
conversation is much more of a struggle. Much harder, but authentic. "It's like 
if someone you knew could walk sat down in a wheelchair and wouldn't get up," 
Paul explains. "You could push her around, but that wouldn't be good because 
you know she really wants to walk." He sees his role as her companion walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna now looks directly at Paul. "I think you are a good man," she says. It 
is a whole, emotional speech. His real smile lights up as he simultaneously 
laughs and cries in soft, quiet gulps. It's painful, but he stays with the 
emotion. He doesn't overload. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize then that their rules for an autistic marriage would be useful to 
all married couples: Pay attention to details -- they matter; don't aggravate 
each other with compulsive, thoughtless habits; don't assume you understand -- 
check feelings out with each other; be tolerant of comforting quirks; teach 
each other what you are learning about the world; get out of your wheelchair 
and walk on your own two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister hopes that Donna will write another book, called Everybody 
Everywhere, a kind of etiquette manual that would teach people to be more 
sensitive and less presumptuous about the rules and expectations we impose on 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an accidental educator," Donna says when I tell her she has taught me a 
lot about my own life. She had no choice about instructing the Red People in 
the ways of autism if she wanted to come out of her private world. Now that she 
has, maybe she doesn't need to write any more books. All she wanted, for nearly 
30 years now, was to find a specialship where she could belong -- a place where 
her culture could happen. 
</P>

 I drive my odd couple to their next destination. Then, after speedy goodbys, I 
drive home, numb with exhaustion. Being a chauffeur to two autistic people in 
love -- explaining, learning, running interference between small planets -- I 
feel like I'm approaching overload myself. I recognize shutdown not as an 
absence of emotions but too many at once. A surge of affection rises, a fierce 
yearning for happiness and safety and cosmic understanding. The two small red 
taillights from the car ahead disappear around a bend and my mind goes blank.

QUAYLE STRIKES BACK AT THE MEDIA; STANDING FIRM: A VICE-PRESIDENTIAL MEMOIR, BY 
DAN QUAYLE (HARPERCOLLINS: $25; 336 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Qayle's "Standing Firm" is a fine memoir: briskly written, closely argued, 
nuanced and persuasive. But reactions from the Beltway have been harsh. The 
politicos have damned Quayle for underscoring former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's 
grandstanding and occasional public breaks from the Reagan Administration; and 
for hammering former Secretary of State James Baker for his handling of both 
Quayle's selection in 1988 and the entire Bush campaign. And there has been 
hand-wringing over Quayle's perceived play toward the Christian right. The 
former criticisms elevate some asides in the text to an undeserved prominence. 
The latter's just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle has, first and foremost, delivered a devastating indictment of 
journalism. It has teeth. It scores. It cannot, in fact, be answered. And in 
Round 1 of reactions to "Standing Firm," that indictment has been ignored. This 
happens to arguments that cannot be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists, to an extent far beyond any other profession, suffer from a 
conceit about who they are and what they do. It is bred in their bones. They 
believe themselves to be gatekeepers, to be the elect, and the collective ego 
of the profession can only be compared to the hierarchy of the medieval church. 
They are the anointed, and it is their job to speak, yours to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude condemned Quayle overnight, following his selection as Bush's 
running mate, and the machinery of the media then organized itself to confirm 
the initial snap judgment. Others could gaffe away, including Al Gore, who, 
without repercussion, once commented that a leopard could not change its 
stripes. The media's cheat sheet had judged Gore to be serious and thoughtful. 
Slips of the tongue could be ignored. And they should be -- no public figure 
can avoid a stumble here or there. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Quayle there would be no quarter given. The media coverage of the vice 
president was more akin to surveillance. And when that surveillance yielded 
sound bytes supportive of the orthodox view, the gang retailed the clip over a 
thousand outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 To have spoken against this tide would have been courageous. And it would have 
been right. But courage and ethics are not much in evidence among the exclusive 
club of opinion makers. Quayle's reputation was a sacrifice to this abandonment 
of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely that some of the commentators didn't read the book, and went on 
the air with a quick glance at the excerpts. That is standard operating 
procedure for folks from whom half-baked opinions are demanded on a weekly 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a larger share appear to have latched on to the trivia in order to avoid 
responding to the argument Quayle makes with a steady and finally overwhelming 
array of examples: The country's opinion aristocracy has become untethered from 
traditional notions of the media's role and its standards. This nation's media 
elite has abandoned the old virtues of journalism; including objectivity, 
fairness, balance, context and -- critically -- any sense of relative import. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Quayle does lay out cold some of his colleagues from the Bush 
campaign and the GOP, the biggest hits are not on other possible contenders for 
the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. Quayle instead strafes the 
growing legion of political apparatchiks, including consultants, pollsters and 
PR spinners. "They (have) no ideology," Quayle comments. "Their loyalty is to 
themselves." The list of names that comes up for evaluation here is a who's who 
of opinion page experts. 
</P>
<P>
 And, necessarily, Quayle does provide an estimate of the talent of the GOP's 
first string. The surprise is not that he found some to be incapable of 
delivering advice inconsistent with their own personal ambitions, but that so 
many potential rivals are given their due, including Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, 
Pete Wilson and Bill Bennett. Quayle's most complete portrait is of former 
Office of Management and Budget head Dick Darman. Quayle concludes that, on 
balance, Darman's strengths and contributions far outweighed his faults, a 
treatment that should stun the conservative faithful for whom denunciations of 
Darman are now the equivalent of Cato's call for the destruction of Carthage. 
</P>
<P>
 The political history that Quayle provides of the Bush years does add some 
critical insights, such as the account of the December 1988 meeting, in which 
the future Secretary of the Treasury, Nick Brady, campaign pollster Bob Teeter, 
James Baker and Quayle met with the president-elect to discuss deficit policy. 
Teeters' contribution, that Bush would "probably be going to have to raise 
taxes," is for Quayle the first signal of the 1990 budget "deal" that would 
sink George Bush's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 And Quayle's thoughtful reconsideration of the defeat of John Tower's 
nomination for Secretary of Defense is a crucial opportunity to reflect on what 
might have been had Tower not been denied. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quayle's lasting contribution to the political literature is in the 
recounting of his four-year battle with the press. He does not grant his own 
record immunity. Every one of his gaffes is recounted in unsparing detail, 
including the "defining moment," as Lee Atwater would have called it, involving 
the potato(e). Quayle understood, it seems, that to critique the media would 
require an unflinching review of his own deposits in the media's vast reserves 
of anti-Quayle lore. 
</P>
<P>
 And he practices a useful restraint. Where intelligence, balance and 
perspective were employed by one of the media's leading players, Quayle 
acknowledges the performance. He recounts, for example, Dan Rather's "grasp of 
issues" on the eve of Desert Storm: "Rather threw all of his political acumen 
into this conversation, raising possibility after possibility and I left glad 
that Saddam Hussein hadn't been able to overhear it, because had he followed 
Rather's line of reasoning he might have come closer to outfoxing us." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, unvarnished contempt for the ethics of individual journalists is rare 
in this memoir. Certainly the New York Times' Maureen Dowd -- "who's earned a 
reputation as the Princess of Creative Journalism . . . doesn't let the facts 
get in her way . . . " -- will find the book bracing, as will Sam Donaldson, 
Strobe Talbott, Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quayle's argument is not so much founded on the by-now cliched assertion 
that the elite media is "liberal." Quayle levels far more serious charges: that 
media folks are lazy and, crucially, self-interested. 
</P>
<P>
 At the highest level of the media food chain, Quayle posits, there is an 
orthodoxy, a set of assumptions about people and policy, and to break with that 
orthodoxy is to risk exile from the initiated's ranks. Unfortunately, orthodoxy 
forms quickly. The media's theology on Quayle was arguably cemented in place 
within 72 hours of his selection as Bush's running mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Bush years, very few of the opinion aristocracy were willing to 
break with the pack with regards to Quayle's reputation. Three who did, Michael 
Barone of U.S. News & World Report, and the Washington Post's Bob Woodward and 
David Broder, stood on such secure ground that they could afford to enter 
dissents to the otherwise solid wall of contempt for Quayle erected by our 
opinion barons. When Woodward and Broder committed themselves to an objective 
inquiry "to find out if Dan Quayle was qualified to be President and they 
answered yes," they did so on the reality of his centrality to the 
Administration and his substantial achievements in forums as varied as the 
Space Council and the regulatory watchdog unit run by the Veep -- the 
Competitiveness Council. But their evolving evaluation of Quayle was ignored. 
The vast majority of opinion purveyors "had invested too much of themselves in 
the caricature," comments Quayle, and "to change it now would have called into 
question their credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Quayle is correct. Certainly he's right that the media's opinion of 
him could not be changed. But I doubt the issue was one of concern over 
credibility. I believe it was rather an overwhelming concern for their status 
within their peer group. Only the most secure could cross the room and admit 
that Quayle had been the victim of a thorough bias. The vast majority huddled 
together, secure in their giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy who tapped the keg," said one media friend of mine, in 
disbelief, on learning that I had found Quayle's book to be compelling reading. 
"You don't believe he wrote it, do you?" Well, to the extent that any celebrity 
politician "writes" a book, yes, I do. I give Quayle the same credit for 
"writing" this book as I do Gore for his "Earth in the Balance," or Mario Cuomo 
for his diaries. The same standard ought to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 It is neither productive nor relevant to use "Standing Firm" as a platform 
from which to speculate about who's up and who's down in the race for the 
Republican nomination in '96. The book is, first and most importantly, an 
indictment of the elite media. It should be read for that reason alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The book will not dent the opinion industry. As the chattering class has 
already demonstrated, Quayle's principal and principled arguments will not even 
be discussed. But the reading public ought to turn off the background noise 
long enough to judge Quayle and his book on their own merits, which are 
considerable. To do otherwise is to be led, and by a group of folks who may 
command attention, but cannot command respect.

ON BUKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed Suzanne Lummis' tribute to Charles Bukowski (April 10). Thank you 
for publishing it. I attended the March 26 event at Arundel. For another take 
on what happened that evening, please note the enclosed poem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wake 
</P>
<P>
 Buk died and Andernach slept another day and the 
</P>
<P>
 wake was held at a bookstore 
</P>
<P>
 and maybe 3 poets and 30 typists and 300 secret poets 
</P>
<P>
 showed up 
</P>
<P>
 only two drunks showed up and one of 
</P>
<P>
 them was dead

 "boo-kowski" 
</P>
<P>
 and they kept reading 
</P>
<P>
 they kept putting it out over the 
</P>
<P>
 radio waves 
</P>
<P>
 they kept it up for

 someone

<P>
 up into the ceiling

<P>
 somewhere, 
</P>
<P>
 like a raging vapor

<P>
 there was much shouting and cursing

<P>
 (I heard this) 
</P>
<P>
 "go home!"

<P>
 there was only one way to

 truly honor the man so

<P>
 I thought Lummis' tribute was right on the mark. So we've lost Bukowski and 
gained the information superhighway. What is wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN GRULA, LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
 The eulogy of Bukowski caused this old observer to remember Betty Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Rowland (the "Original Ball of Fire") was a striptease artist. Like 
Charles Bukowski, she pursued a long career in this city. Rowland's career, 
like Bukowski's, was an extended exercise of self-exposure. Like Bukowski, 
Rowland learned that self-exposure, if practiced diligently, could develop an 
enthusiastic, if not exceptionally literate, audience. While the two careers 
had a number of parallels, there was one genuinely significant difference: What 
Betty Rowland exposed was well-made and worthy of scrutiny.

STYLE: ARCHITECTURE; L.A. ARCHITECTS: THEY DID IT THEIR WAY; CLASSICISM BOWS TO 
OFFBEAT DESIGNS, DECLASSE MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI, Writer and architect Joseph Giovannini's last article for 
the magazine was about the renovation of the Central Library in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a two-wine, three-fork luncheon in New York's Plaza Hotel a couple of years 
ago, when editors of Progressive Architecture announced their choice for the 
year's best designs, alarmed New York architects stopped sipping their decaf as 
they realized that Angelenos were walking off with every other award. By the 
end of the roll call, it dawned on the audience, including front-row arbiter 
Philip Johnson, that something momentous had quietly happened: The baton of the 
profession, so firmly gripped by the Postmodernists of the East Coast in the 
1980s, had passed to the West. The offbeat buildings in Santa Monica and 
Venice, the daring houses perched on Hollywood hillsides and Frank Gehry's 
designs for museums and cultural centers added up to a national phenomenon that 
challenged the notion that New York's sovereignty in architecture was God-given 
and forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York made a fatal turn in the 1980s and stepped off the trajectory," says 
Santa Monica architect Craig Hodgetts, whose spirited, tent-like Temporary 
Powell Library at UCLA, designed with his partner and wife, Hsin-Ming Fung, 
landed a cover feature in Architectural Record a year ago. "Their Postmodernist 
architecture was about the history of architecture. It didn't draw on 
contemporary life, so it severed itself from a source of vitality." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike New Yorkers, who excavated the architectural past for styles and 
precedents, the young and irreverent Los Angeles avant-garde looked to movies, 
sports cars, Nintendo games and the ordinary street-side vernacular for 
inspiration. They browsed the shelves of hardware stores, cruised plywood racks 
at lumber yards and ogled the quilted stainless-steel panels of lunch trucks. 
Their designs did not pretend to be built anywhere else or at any other time. 
And they did not aspire to sentimentality or cuteness but directly and 
poetically acknowledged their sites, times and clients in materials assembled 
from the cityscape. More than 15 years ago in Venice, designer Brian Murphy 
reveled in projects with next-to-nonexistent budgets, daring to use declasse 
corrugated fiberglass and asphalt shingles on facades because the material was 
cheap and unexpected. Quiet, understated architect Frederick Fisher, practicing 
a layered collage architecture, made common bathroom tiles and concrete block 
look original. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings were hardly meant to be timeless. The basic notion was not to 
remake the city in the image of a utopian ideal, but to take parts of what UCLA 
classicist and architectural theorist Ann Bergren called "the most 
deconstructed city in the world" as cues for buildings that do not add up to 
balanced wholes. If discontinuity is the urban reality in Los Angeles, then it 
is realistic to design buildings as pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City architect Eric Moss, one of the first to break into shelter 
magazines with his own home and the graphically florid Petal House in West Los 
Angeles, explained the design of one building as a process of taking it apart 
at all scales -- roof, walls, doors, windows, screws, washers -- and assembling 
the pieces in different ways: "Apart and back together -- both." There was a 
logic to disjunction, and strangeness and beauty in the complex and irrational. 
Architects were learning to release the Parthenon from their minds and step out 
of the Wilshire mainstream into the wilder margins of Venice, Ocean Park and 
Santa Monica, a petri dish for this new architecture culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 awards were the offspring of the 1980s national design boom and Los 
Angeles' prosperity, but even in today's troubled local economy, architecture 
-- like film and art -- remains a point of cultural pride. Architects with 
small offices need only a couple of adventurous clients with an idea or friends 
with a house requiring an addition. Or, like husband-and-wife team Mark Cigolle 
and Kim Coleman, architects simply hire themselves to build a cliffhanging 
statement on their own "unbuildable" hillside site. With most of Los Angeles 
occupied by first-generation buildings, the loosely structured, relatively open 
metropolis invites additions and replacements more readily than more "finished" 
cities like New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural institutions offer other opportunities: The recent break-out 
installation design for two shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art -- 
"Expressionist Utopias" and "John Heartfield" -- introduced the radical 
Viennese firm of Coop Himmelblau, whose Culver City office designed tilted, 
dancing walls of acrylic and construction board that were as brilliant and 
daring as the Expressionist work displayed. The installation upped the design 
ante, challenged conventional notions about neutrality in exhibition design and 
brought the new architectural thinking to a broader public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the preciousness of materials or even character that's bankable now 
in Los Angeles -- originality is held in higher esteem," muses the thoughtful 
Hodgetts. "What's seen as valuable is intellectual property, how even ordinary 
things are put together. Los Angeles is, after all, about making a piece of 
celluloid valuable. Maybe the high level of Frank Gehry's executed work has 
made people see the sky doesn't fall." The design Hodgetts and Fung did for the 
Temporary Powell -- known on campus as the Towell -- is a throwaway building 
much valued for its wit on a shoestring: a lightweight structure made from a 
kit of brilliantly assembled aluminum parts. Lights are suspended like trapezes 
and steel columns sprout articulate industrial uplights, all under a 
yellow-and-white big top of industrial-standard polyester. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings have always been status symbols, but L.A. designers changed the 
perception of architectural prestige and value. A house became not only a 
house, design not simply a matter of "value added." Design could provide an 
enriched environment that enhanced the everyday pleasures of living, looking 
and thinking, and it could express something about a building's creators, 
owners and times. Some buildings are cultural artifacts, and some are theses, 
all are objects of imagistic intensity and density, with a heightened visual 
presence and strong tactile charisma -- an architecture of complexity rather 
than simplicity that offers the richness of "more" rather than the austerities 
of "less." 
</P>
<P>
 While space in a city like New York collects buildings, it keeps them apart in 
Los Angeles, and the new breed of buildings that began surfacing here a dozen 
years ago was a peculiar, almost Darwinian adaptation to L.A.'s context of 
fragmentation, dispersal and privacy. Post-suburban Los Angeles, even as it 
fills in, is still lax enough to need the charge of these birds of paradise and 
disjunctive enough to absorb their shock. They invigorate the city with a 
punctual rather than linear urbanism; they "read" from a passing car. "L.A. has 
become the cultural repository of a certain kind of building -- the 
small-scale, low-budget building that allows for a level of experiment that 
much larger buildings don't," notes Bernard Tschumi, dean of the graduate 
school of architecture at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings resulting from this less-trammeled creativity have become a 
serious body of architectural work, even though few are large or public. As a 
class, buildings like the Towell have established a mystique and a romance 
about Los Angeles that attracts foreign architects and students for whom parts 
of the city have become exhibitions of contemporary architecture. The American 
Institute of Architects is holding its national convention here this weekend, 
and a substantial perk is the opportunity to visit buildings known only through 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. projects honored in New York were not flukes. Los Angeles' late, 
great lady of architectural letters, Esther McCoy, credited the city's 
traditional spirit: "L.A. always had a larger population (than San Francisco), 
it had more thieves and more speculators, and it was livelier from the 
beginning. It's always from these lively places that new design comes." 
</P>
<P>
 PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN CITY, LOS Angeles has supported 
experiments in Modernism, and the brave new forms of the most recent generation 
add to an open-ended rosary of buildings that make up a brilliant, but taken 
for granted, architectural tradition in Southern California. Unexpectedly, the 
tradition was cross-pollinated 25 years ago with L.A.'s contemporary art scene, 
with Frank Gehry acting as the bee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, crisp, open Modernism was dislocated, not by 
Postmodernist historicism from the East Coast but by the messy vitality 
emanating from Venice's art world. Artists were roughhousing their studios, 
treating them as objets trouves to be ripped open and rearranged: Studios were 
works in perpetual progress. The artists -- Ed Moses, Larry Bell, Billy Al 
Bengston, Robert Irwin, Tony Berlant -- inspired Gehry, Venice's architect in 
spiritual residence, to look at buildings as hands-on sculpture rather than as 
the products of flat drawing boards. In 1978, he combined many sculptural 
experiments in his famous house in Santa Monica, a modest two-story, 
gambrel-roofed bungalow onto which he grafted an addition of corrugated metal 
and chain-link fencing. Influenced by local artists, he designed skylights that 
cast light and shadows on interior walls. For his family, the house still 
worked like any other house, but its visual presence outweighed its function, 
and design outweighed technique and details. Gehry, who has since remodeled the 
house, was importing a logic foreign to architecture, one that allowed 
unmethodical processes to generate design; he was questioning the boundary 
between art and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1960s on, painting came out of the frame and sculpture off the 
pedestal, eventually migrating into the open landscape. Architects in Los 
Angeles were designing buildings that could be interpreted as site-specific 
urban sculpture. A small but slowly widening circle of architects was 
practicing in the fertile blur between architecture and the arts, generating 
nonconformist buildings that defied the laws of featureless design blended into 
common denominators. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the blur extended to movies. "The icebreaker is somewhere in the 
entertainment industry -- more than architectural theorists and historians," 
Hodgetts says, citing the powerful production designs for MTV, which 
established a precedent for stimulating design. The late production designer 
Anton Furst, for example, came off the "Batman" set to design the restaurant 
Planet Hollywood. Reciprocally, Hollywood called on architecture when it 
discovered that special effects could deliver the power of great buildings to 
the screen. Visual futurist Syd Mead, who created the look of "Blade Runner," 
devised intergalactic megastructures, far more powerful than walk-through sets 
because of their overwhelming scale. Hollywood's notoriously closed movie 
studio Kremlins opened for architecture: Movie people and architects schmoozed. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgetts, who worked as an art director in film, created buildings with a 
filmic presence that heightened reality through controlled exaggeration, as in 
an unrealized hillside house he designed for himself. His cinematic buildings 
were not so obvious as to look robotic but seemed to have recently landed, with 
antennae and dishes and an aura of strangeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Israel, an Ivy League-trained Rome Prize winner who moved from New York 
to teach at UCLA and work in set design, also crossed architecture and film, 
creating sets that were strongly architectural and buildings that are strongly 
cinematic. Several independent production companies hired him to design office 
interiors in cavernous warehouse spaces that he transformed into architectonic 
wonderlands. Shapes changed unpredictably from different points of view, 
enhanced by chimerical effects of light, shadow and translucency. His 
high-spirited design also posited that architecture offers the possibility of 
entertainment -- that buildings need not labor under the Modernist 
self-delusion that they are to solve global problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in Hollywood, architecture became a lifestyle choice, and the 
architect who pushed choice the furthest was the California Fauvist Brian 
Murphy, whose loose, anything-is-possible attitude put off his more academic 
colleagues. A former lifeguard, UCLA art student and architecture school 
dropout who turned guerrilla contractor, the T-shirted Murphy redefined the far 
edge in L.A. architecture when, in the early 1980s, he designed his Venice 
studio by throwing the I Ching. Like Duchamp, Murphy invited chance into the 
studio. He also cultivated spontaneity. In a house he designed in Santa Monica 
Canyon, he dragged a charred log down the wall on either side of a fireplace, 
creating a room-size charcoal drawing.  
</P>
<P>
 Often explaining his designs merely with a chuckle, he went on to flirt with 
the ultimate taboo, bad taste, recently clustering gaudy chandeliers en masse 
for David Sheffield, screenwriter for "Coming to America," and his wife, 
Cynthia Walker, a poet and editor. The house is comic, with a chandelier 
grouping that, during tremors, sways in a slow-motion hula. For Murphy, there 
were no rules, just attitude: "My clients love inviting bosses and colleagues 
who live in houses paneled with exotic woods to come over to see how we've 
mixed deeply veined marbles with Astroturf, corrugated fiberglass and put a 
picket fence around the cat litter box." 
</P>
<P>
 Society architects have always designed houses that function as the ultimate 
social asset, but society at the beach and in the hills in the 1980s redefined 
itself, less formally, less seriously, and sometimes with irreverence. Fresh 
notions about originality and the more relaxed and inquisitive character of 
nesting baby boomers were dislocating conventional displays of good taste, 
elegance and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PHENOMENON OF ARCHITECTURE AS ART, ATTITUDE and lifestyle might have been 
confined to the high-style culture-vulture ghettos of the Westside and the 
Santa Monica Mountains, except that in the early 1980s, Los Angeles "got" 
design through its stomach. Restaurants introduced a wider public to 
avant-garde design at what might be considered a particularly vulnerable 
moment. "In restaurants, you're about to get laid, so you're in a receptive 
mood," notes Hodgetts. "Some of the good feelings rub off." Restaurateurs 
gradually discovered that design helped sell food. The young, hard-working firm 
of Morphosis in Santa Monica, with Thom Mayne and then-partner Michael Rotondi, 
went public with its hyper-architecture in a series of restaurants, starting 
with the corrugated-metal interior of the former L.A. Nicola in Silver Lake, 
Angeli on Melrose and 72 Market Street in Venice, where people dined under 
seismic steel rods strapped to a bronze column by Venice sculptor Robert 
Graham.  
</P>
<P>
 Morphosis intensified buildings by exaggerating structure, flirting 
outrageously with steel and breaking the whole down into proliferating numbers 
of parts, a design tactic that became widespread. Venice restaurateur Bruce 
Marder hired Gehry to design Rebecca's and artist Chuck Arnoldi for DC3. 
Michele Saee, who had worked with Morphosis, went on to design a series of 
restaurants -- Angeli in Santa Monica and in Marina del Rey -- each venue more 
elaborate than the last, and all different. Saee, an Iranian-born, 
Italian-educated architect, was among the first of the second generation 
branching into what is now a mature and complex genealogical tree of 
architectural influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, perhaps the first Deconstructivist fast-food outlet anywhere -- a 
tall, irregular spiral wrapping a two-story structure -- appeared at the corner 
of Western and Oakwood avenues in Los Angeles. Designed by disciples of Gehry, 
Jeffrey Daniels and Elyse Grinstein, the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet was many 
notches more sophisticated than its self-advertising fast-food design 
predecessor, the famous but simplistic hot-dog-shaped Tail o' the Pup in West 
Hollywood. "People are going to stop, eat and experience architecture," 
Grinstein said. Not much later, a meticulously built and detailed armature 
resembling a billboard was installed over a simple rectangular structure in 
Marina del Rey by the L.A. firm Central Office of Architecture, a small 
partnership of three young and ferociously intellectual architects. The 
billboard had no message other than the name of the now-defunct restaurant 
tucked in a corner -- Brix. The armature acted as a facade and scrim and 
exploded the scale of the 1,200-square-foot restaurant while offering roadside 
surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brix nor the KFC building was architecture designed for a rarefied 
community that collects Warhol Marilyns. It was avant-garde architecture gone 
populist. Architecture might season haute cuisine for cognoscenti, but it also 
sold hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the longest leap for L.A.'s new wave has been the dozen-mile jump from 
the Westside into the pin-striped community Downtown, several social systems 
away. Restaurants again are proving to be agents of change. In the belly of a 
skyscraper, among its monumental columns, Michael Rotondi, now head of the 
Southern California Institute of Architecture, has designed a new Nicola, a 
Jonah of floor-to-ceiling ribs that carve out comfortable spaces for intimate 
meals. Several blocks away, motifs that Rotondi designed with Thom Mayne for 
Westside buildings seem to have influenced the architects who conceived the 
brushed-metal appointments, lighting fixtures, railings and elevator doors in 
the Gas Company Tower opposite the Central Library -- elevating details to the 
status of high-tech jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest force of change Downtown has been the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art, under the direction of Richard Koshalek, who trained as an 
architect. The museum has actively sponsored architectural shows, including a 
brilliant assessment of Los Angeles' postwar Case Study Houses and an exhibit, 
"Urban Revisions: Current Projects for the Public Realm," which opened Friday. 
Koshalek was the guiding spirit in the committee that designated Gehry to 
design the Walt Disney Concert Hall, now under construction on Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many forces at work -- the concerns of the community and 
clients, and just the simple codes -- conspiring against individual expression 
that it takes tremendous self-confidence to do an interesting building," says 
Koshalek, whose museum was designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki and 
who has greatly raised Los Angeles' architectural awareness. "Gehry's example 
in Los Angeles encouraged younger architects to have confidence in their own 
ideas, and their new community of buildings is like a community of individuals. 
When we interviewed internationally known architects about the influence of the 
Case Study Houses, we heard time and again how architects everywhere were 
influenced by them. Now, we're starting to hear the same thing again, whether 
it's from architects in Japan or Europe, that the major influence in their work 
is coming from California."  
</P>
<P>
 The potential power of this spirited architecture to capture and define the 
nature of the city has not been lost on civic leaders. When newly elected Mayor 
Richard Riordan sought solutions to the city's urban problems, he also looked 
to the avant-garde architects as one of its success stories and attended 
meetings with Gehry in hopes that this creative community could be enlisted to 
solve problems and enhance the city. He approached the possible coalition of 
city and architecture from a business point of view. To succeed in business, he 
reasoned, you've got to be open to innovation, and innovation comes from the 
most gifted people. For the city to succeed, it should hire and exploit the 
area's best talents and reduce bureaucratic restrictions. A city can make 
itself a landmark through its buildings and planning -- the beauty of Parisian 
buildings, after all, is big box office. 
</P>
<P>
 AS IN L.A. GENERALLY, THE CREATIVITY AND RESILIENCE of this growing community 
resides in its many small studios, so much more adaptable than large New 
York-style offices. What started out as a cluster in the 1970s -- 10 architects 
designing for each other and indulgent clients, often themselves -- has 
mushroomed several architectural generations later into an energetic 
environment, with threescore talented avant-garde firms vigorously pursuing 
their own muses and clients. Gehry, Hodgetts, Moss, Mayne and Rotondi are 
uncles and grand-uncles of a second and third generation of like-minded 
architects, a generation that includes many women, notably Venice-based 
architect Victoria Casasco and Dagmar Richter, who teaches at UCLA. A large 
number of husband-and-wife teams and other couples are the principals of small 
offices. As a loose group, the architects have attained a critical mass, 
especially on the Westside, where architects constitute a social force and a 
miniature star system. 
</P>
<P>
 What fuels their ambition is the realization that idea-driven buildings 
economically produced in offices can yield artistic satisfaction. The atelier 
rather than the corporation is the modus operandi for architects who prefer to 
stay hands-on. Especially in these recessionary times, the architects support 
their independence and artistic integrity by teaching at the Southern 
California Institute of Architecture, an iconoclastic school that has been the 
sounding board, employer and advocate for many gifted teachers. Under Dean 
Richard Weinstein, UCLA has also welcomed avant-garde architects as teachers 
and graduated students who now underpin the Westside architecture culture. 
(Administrative restructuring, however, now promises to hobble UCLA's 
architecture school.) 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade and a half, the buildings of Ocean Park, Santa Monica and 
especially Venice have opened a dialogue even more varied than the one in 
Silver Lake during the 1920s and '30s. A recently completed two-story office 
building by the Santa Monica husband-and-wife firm Mulder Katkov, for example, 
adds great levity to Abbot Kinney Boulevard, with front corners winging up from 
the roof to form fluttering clerestory windows. Another Westside 
husband-and-wife team, Koning Eizenberg, has completed several cost-conscious 
housing projects nearby on Electric Avenue and Ocean Park, projects that 
combine standard construction techniques and Modernist lines. 
</P>
<P>
 These architects practice wherever clients call. Santa Monica designers Daly, 
Genik recently performed an act of lyrical Deconstructivism inside an existing 
house in Tarzana, where they bent wood panels into faceted planes that separate 
open spaces. A sculptural fireplace with a bright, burnished aluminum surface 
and a distorted shape that suggests invisible forces divides the living room 
and den. 
</P>
<P>
 Even large firms have chosen artist/designers rather than executive architects 
to lead their offices. The 33-year-old Harvard-trained Mehrdad Yazdani, for 
example, was chief designer at Santa Monica's Ellerbe Becket Inc. before moving 
on to Dworsky Associates. He is largely responsible for Ellerbe Becket's Metro 
Rail Red Line Station at Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard, a 
mysteriously floating ellipse that was honored in New York at the Plaza 
ceremony, and he designed Showscan Prototype Theater-Cinemania, a 
motion-reality theater at Universal CityWalk, with a folded fiberglass screen 
on the facade that functions like an electronically liquid marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Mayor Riordan has proposed opening the city's policies to more 
enlightened building, UCLA campus architect Charles (Duke) Oakley has invited 
these designers to join mainstream architects on university projects. Permanent 
new buildings include the east building of the Corrine A. Seeds University 
Elementary School by Barton Phelps, another Gehry-studio graduate who has 
emerged as a mature and independent talent. The simply built but complex 
two-story school successfully humanizes the original buildings by Richard J. 
Neutra and Robert Alexander and reshapes the campus as a small town. Near 
Westwood Village, Wes Jones, along with other partners at Holt Hinshaw Pfau 
Jones, has turned a power plant into an intricately complex fugue of steam 
generators, cooling towers, turbines, chiller pumps, condensers and ammonia 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ARCHITECTS AS A GROUP SHARE MANY TRAITS, BUT for all the similarities, 
they differ in many respects. Gehry and others who have passed through his 
office do not design buildings demanding fine craftsmanship or industrial 
precision. Instead, they often leave materials rough and exposed, cultivating a 
sense of physical energy. Form displaces craft and detail. Thom Mayne still 
tailors buildings almost obsessively, depending on metalsmiths and other 
craftsmen to fabricate parts. His machine-like images depend on old-fashioned 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, seven years ago, a surprising four-story note of dissension was built 
on Main Street amid the casual collection of brat-pack buildings. The strictly 
geometric steel-and-glass structure, the Marine/Main Center by James Tyler, 
threw down a classically Modernist gauntlet in the face of buildings designed 
on a looser premise. A handsome structure in the Miesian less-is-more 
tradition, the building trumpeted a call back to Modernist order and cooled the 
heated designs that were becoming the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the pendulum theory of architecture -- that design swings back 
and forth between the mysteries of Gothic styles and the certainties of the 
Classic -- a Calvinist period should now be challenging the exuberance. The 
recession also discourages risk.  
</P>
<P>
 A cautionary critic has emerged in the voice of L.A. author Mike Davis, who 
has written that architecture is a public art and that the avant-garde fails to 
communicate to many L.A. constituencies. Often, he says, the city's diverse 
cultural groups consider the buildings hostile and anti-humanistic. Davis has 
reprimanded Gehry, somewhat unfairly, for turning his buildings away from the 
public realm and shortchanging what should be a public experience. As perhaps 
the first knowledgeable and well-reasoned voice of dissension to emerge here in 
years, Davis gives pause to the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Some self-criticism has also come from within, especially among younger 
architects who have grown up in the amnesiac candy store of the Westside and 
want to find roots. They are looking back to Los Angeles' fine architectural 
traditions -- to the Modernist classics by Neutra and R.M. Schindler, to the 
Case Study Houses of the 1940s and '50s and to the still-active, creatively 
monumental John Lautner, a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright. Susan Lanier of 
Lubowicki Lanier Architects recently took a client to see Schindler's own 1922 
house in West Hollywood, a spatially intricate structure built elementally in 
exposed redwood and concrete. "He used simple materials and let them come 
together as they needed, without pretension," says Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Case Study Houses and the Pacific Palisades house by Charles Eames, a 
colorful steel warehouse made of off-the-shelf parts, inspired Marc Angelil and 
Sarah Graham, partners and spouses, in their own rigorously engineered house in 
the Hollywood Hills. The two-story building, terraced on a steep hillside, 
combines steel and wood in an outrigger structure as taut as a sailboat. Its 
originality is technical. The young architects invented a hybrid wood-and-metal 
support structure pertinent to a low-rise, quake-prone area. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability has been an issue for the avant-garde, even though their 
architectural flamboyance seems to deny it. In a refreshingly direct house 
expansion in Brentwood by Robert E. Mangurian and Mary-Ann Ray of Studio Works, 
the architects simply jacked up the existing house over an open living loft and 
studio. A visitor steps into the areas on the ground floor, and a staircase 
wends its way up to the newly decorated rooms of the original wood-frame house 
on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 So many avant-garde designs are for houses or restaurants that their lessons 
seem limited in application, if not downright elitist. But in Santa Monica, one 
of the unsung architects, William Adams, created an original complex of 
affordable apartments with "masked" facades, whose suggestion of eyes, nose and 
mouth give the building a strong identity and street presence. The overall 
organization offers sociable terraces akin to a commons, along with livable 
layouts. Art Center College of Design in Pasadena has taken up the issue of 
industrial housing under the direction of Harvard-trained Steve Diskin -- an 
obvious issue in a time of homelessness but neglected altogether because of 
national housing policies in the 1980s. Classes have tried to yoke industrial 
design and architecture in studies for easy-to-erect temporary shelters, with 
the riots and earthquake lending a sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, yet another wave of powerful new designs was recognized in an 
architectural awards ceremony, this time by the Los Angeles chapter of the AIA. 
While the winners included the usual suspects -- Gehry, Moss, Morphosis, 
Hodgetts and Fung -- less-established firms like Adams and Angelil/Graham 
broadened the subject matter. What is remarkable about the avant-garde is that 
it remains open to change and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles has lost factories, jobs and a competitive edge in some 
industries, the good news is that the city remains a generating center from a 
cultural point of view, and architects are among the leading contributors. The 
recent AIA awards showcased a unique set of buildings, yet another wave in the 
ongoing design tsunami emanating from Los Angeles.

PASSAGE TO INDIA; AT BOMBAY CAFE, IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS -- SAVORIES AND 
CHUTNEYS -- THAT MAKE THE MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila

<TEXT>
<P>
 India is very large and our kitchen is very small," reads the menu at Bombay 
Cafe, a modest but enticing Indian restaurant set in a mini-mall at Santa 
Monica Boulevard and Bundy Drive. A milky neon light, sputtering and faint, 
heralds the upstairs location, yet Indian-food aficionados find their way. The 
decor consists of vermilion-framed mirrors and a naive mural of an Indian 
village, where children lead elephants outside the gates, women balance jugs of 
water on their heads, and rooftops sprout TV antennas. From the open kitchen 
comes the sound of chopping and the clang of pots. Drifts of cardamom, ginger 
and cumin perfume the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe's kitchen may be small, but Neela Paniz and her partner, David 
Chaparro (who met at her first restaurant, Chutneys), manage to pack a world of 
flavors into the array of vividly spiced Indian dishes. What they can't fit 
onto the menu turns up sooner or later as one of the daily specials. Still, 
don't expect to find a full panoply of meat dishes and main courses. The real 
interest here lies in the delicious and unusual savories, snacks, chutneys and 
side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombay Cafe is just what its name implies: a cafe, with food that is very 
close in spirit and taste to Indian home cooking. Many of the recipes come from 
Paniz's family; others she has re-created, with ingredients available here, to 
come as close as possible to a remembered taste from her childhood. A few are 
her Indian-California innovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at most Indian restaurants in this country has a discouraging 
sameness to it, and it often tastes as if it's been sitting in a buffet steam 
table for days. Here, the spices are all freshly ground, and each masala (spice 
blend) is mixed at the restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Most appealing are the street foods Paniz relished as a student of economics 
in Bombay. Puffed rice appears in an exotic guise as bhel puri , tossed with 
potatoes, sev (crispy chickpea - flour noodles) and crushed puri (fried dough), 
onions, cilantro and bright-tasting chutneys. Sev puri consists of crisp, 
miniature puri heaped with chutneys and potatoes and buried under a blanket of 
ocher sev.  
</P>
<P>
 The triangular Gujerati-style samosas, stuffed with potatoes and peas, have a 
thinner, crispier wrapper than the usual doughy Punjabi-style samosas and are 
served with a sweetly sour tamarind sauce. Chutneys are a passion with Paniz, 
and she usually has 10 to 12 vibrant homemade ones on hand. Perhaps the best 
way to enjoy them is thoroughly untraditional: an order of deep-fried samosa 
wrappers served like chips with a changing trio of chutneys -- often, a 
smoldering pumpkin-tomato chutney, a fresh coconut one laced with black mustard 
seeds and a traditional Kashmiri walnut chutney made with yogurt, garlic and 
green chiles. Hot, deep-fried bites of fish, dipped in a golden-brown 
chickpea-flour batter, are homely but completely delicious with lime squeezed 
over and a dab of sweet tomato chutney. And I'm crazy about chola baturas , a 
Punjabi truck-stop snack -- pillowy rounds of deep-fried naan to dip in a 
tangy, homemade yogurt, or cholas , a soupy chickpea stew redolent of browned 
onions and ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankies, a popular snack on Bombay's Breach Candy Beach, look very much like 
an egg-washed burrito. The best here is filled with a dark and fragrant lamb 
masala and lime-drenched onions. Vegetarians can get it with green-chile-spiked 
cauliflower. Or try the 14-inch-long dosa , a South Indian "crepe" folded 
around turmeric-dyed potatoes flavored with cumin and kari (curry) leaves. Add 
sambar (soupy toor dal , a kind of lentil, cooked with coconut and chiles) and 
a dab of the snowy fresh coconut chutney to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the cafe has the requisite tandoor that brings the average customer 
in the door. It's better than most, though, like so much tandoor, the meats and 
especially chicken can emerge somewhat dry from the searing hot clay oven. Here 
I favor the shaan-eh-murg , chicken marinated in yogurt and freshly ground 
ginger, garlic and green chiles. The spicy tandoor-cooked lamb sausage called 
malai seekh is also juicier than most. 
</P>
<P>
 The runaway favorite at Bombay Cafe has to be the Sindhi chicken, a 
traditional dish from the province, now part of Pakistan, where Paniz's mother 
was born. Quartered chickens are first gently poached with onions, ginger and 
green chiles, then left in the spiced broth to cool. Just before serving, the 
bird is dusted with sour mango powder, cayenne and coriander and then sauteed. 
The gentler spices seem to penetrate to the very bone while the bright, intense 
heat resides in the crust. There is also a chicken special each night, such as 
Punjabi-style chicken curry, chicken korma or dahi pepper chicken flavored with 
black pepper, ginger and green chiles.  
</P>
<P>
 There is Indian beer and a handful of California wines, including the Bonny 
Doon Vin Gris de Cigare, a rose that plays off the complex spices in this food. 
Paniz uses her mother's recipe for nimbu soda, which involves making a syrup 
with lemon and sugar and then spiking it with fresh ginger juice and sparkling 
water. Her own invention is an iced version of Indian tea flavored with 
cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, green cardamom and mint. It's served with sweet 
milk on the side.  
</P>
<P>
 While none of the food here is what I would call searing hot, desserts seem 
designed to soothe the palate with cool, smooth textures and sweet spices. 
There's a comforting, creamy rice pudding shot with cardamom and two kinds of 
kulfi , cone-shaped Indian ice-creams-on-a-stick. The first is laced with 
candied ginger, the other suffused with ripe mango. From start to finish, 
flavors ring out bright and true. It is Neela Paniz' abiding affection for the 
simple foods of India that makes Bombay Cafe hard to resist.

STAGE WATCH: SAN JOSE BECKONS TO EL TEATRO CAMPESINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Teatro Campesino, built around the groundbreaking works of 
playwright/filmmaker Luis Valdez, is probably America's most famous Latino 
theater company. But for years it has been based not in a prominent urban 
center, but rather in the small town of San Juan Bautista, near Salinas in San 
Benito County. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporarily, however, El Teatro is focusing its creative energy on Los 
Angeles, as it prepares to present "Bandido!" in a co-production with the Mark 
Taper Forum, opening June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 And within the next week, the company hopes to receive the go-ahead to begin a 
whole new phase of its life -- in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the struggling company faced a deficit that reportedly reached 
$500,000 (though company officials declined to confirm that figure). Half the 
permanent staff was laid off, and the spring tour of "I Don't Have to Show You 
No Stinking Badges" -- which would have come to several venues in the 
Southland, among other places -- was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the deficit has been reduced by 75%, according to El Teatro 
managing director Philip Esparza. And the company plans to "shed a major skin" 
by moving most of its production activity out of San Juan Bautista into the old 
Jose Theatre in downtown San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out of the loop" in sparsely populated San Benito County, which just 
doesn't have the resources that are necessary to support El Teatro, Esparza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the move hinges on a vote of the San Jose city council, expected 
sometime this week. El Teatro's use of the Jose Theatre, which would get a 
$13-million publicly funded renovation, is only one part of a large 
redevelopment package that will be before the council. The package also would 
provide a new home for the San Jose Repertory Theatre, among other cultural 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 While they're waiting for the news, Valdez, Esparza and two other staff 
members are working on "Bandido!" at the Taper -- where El Teatro's biggest 
production, "Zoot Suit," also got its start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bandido!" has a budget estimated by Esparza as $800,000-plus. Besides the 
normal Taper production funds, this includes a $100,000 AT&T Foundation grant 
that El Teatro brought with it, $100,000 from the Taper's giant Latino Theatre 
Initiative funded by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, and a $25,000 grant 
from philanthropist/producer Timothy Childs. The Childs grant had originally 
gone to playwright David Mamet, who returned it after he and the Taper clashed 
over the casting of the Taper's aborted production of his "Oleanna." Childs 
agreed to reroute the money into "Bandido!" 
</P>
<P>
 DOS BANDIDOS: Pancho Villa, too, was a bandido . The Bilingual Foundation of 
the Arts, currently presenting "Pancho Villa and the Naked Lady" at Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, has arranged a deal with the Mark Taper Forum so some Angelenos 
can see two bandidos for the price of one. The offer was available by mail 
order only, and the flyers went to lists of single ticket buyers at both 
theaters. For $25, recipients of the mailings can buy tickets to both 
"Bandido!" (normal price range: $30-$37.50) and "Pancho Villa" (normal price: 
$15). In addition, Taper subscribers are being offered discounted tickets to 
"Pancho" and Bilingual subscribers can get discounted tickets to "Bandido!" 
</P>
<P>
 The deals were inspired by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, which last 
year awarded grants to both theaters as part of an effort to diversify theater 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 GET RICH QUICK: As an example of requests that come into Theatre LA's job 
bank, the organization published this (fictional) composite want ad in one of 
its publications: 
</P>
<P>
 "WANTED: Equity Waiver theatre seeks energetic, brilliant self-starter. Duties 
to include: box office, publicity, audience development, mailings, fund 
raising, bookkeeping, concessions, light janitorial. May be some deferred pay. 
MFA and 3 yrs. experience required. Must own flatbed truck."*

ON THE RECORD: SOME OF THE BEST AND WORST OF BAROQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fabled 1974 recording of Handel's "Water Music" by Nikolaus Harnoncourt 
and his Concentus Musicus Wien, too long absent from the catalogue, is back at 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Recordings this awful should always be available: not to provide cautionary 
lessons, since no one is likely to follow Harnoncourt's perverse examples, but 
to provide a measure of relief from the excess of sanity that pervades so much 
of what is in an average month's new releases. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Teldec's mid-priced "Das alte Werk" series (93668) this "Water Music" 
is cheaper (and better recorded) than the Spike Jones reissues to which it has 
been unfavorably compared. 
</P>
<P>
 First, for those who have forgotten, there's the sound of the Harnoncourt 
tutti, strangely evocative of something large and ungainly crashing into a 
chain-link fence. Then there are the legendary horn trills, in effect the most 
obscene of raspberries. And less amusing things, such as the occasional 
somnambulistic tempo, some surpassingly sour oboe playing, and several numbers 
that aren't weird or poorly executed at all. But don't let that put you off. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing laughter-evoking in the companion pieces, a pair of Handel 
organ concertos, so vivaciously, imaginatively -- and not eccentrically -- 
presented by soloist Herbert Tachezi, Harnoncourt and the gang that one should 
regard the "Water Music" as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, an infinite variety of irrational musical behavior, as 
Harnoncourt shows in his brand-new edition of Handel's deep, dark and grandiose 
Milton-based oratorio, "Samson" (Teldec 74871, 2 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 The performance is not without its blandishments: Roberta Alexander's proud, 
flawlessly sung Dalila, the powerful Manoa of Anton Scharinger, Alistair Miles' 
thunderous Harapha, and Anthony Rolfe Johnson displaying his customary 
intelligence and more than usual dramatic punch in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the sumptuous and agile work of Vienna's Arnold Schoenberg Chorus 
and you would seem to have the makings of long- overdue recorded justice to one 
of Handel's great inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 But no. First, there's alto Jochen Kowalski's alternately overheated and 
impossibly fey Micah and that man Harnoncourt demanding -- and receiving -- 
laggardness and density from the Concentus Musicus when mobility and 
transparency should be the watchwords. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all is the conductor's evenhanded cutting of expendable recitatives 
and crucial arias, including among the latter one of the work's most familiar 
numbers, "Why does the god of Israel sleep?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetorical question: Is there any other conductor extant who is allowed as 
much interpretive latitude, to put it kindly, as Harnoncourt? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his odd notions about tempo turn up again in a low-voltage reading of 
Vivaldi's familiar "Gloria," with the Arnold Schoenberg Chorus wasting another 
fine effort, and a snooze-inspiring performance of Pergolesi's lovely "Stabat 
Mater" (Teldec 76989). 
</P>
<P>
 Pergolesi's gentle masterpiece is much more convincing in the hands of an 
ensemble new to this listener, Les Violons du Roy, under the direction of 
Bernard Labadie, a Quebec-based string band that uses modern instruments, but 
with a sure command of the niceties of period style (Dorian 90196). 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Robbin employs her creamy mezzo to exquisite effect both in the 
Pergolesi, where she is joined by an appropriately sweet-toned soprano, 
Dorothea Roschmann, and in that other ineffably lovely, consoling "Stabat 
Mater," Vivaldi's, which is roughly contemporaneous with the Pergolesi setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is filled out by a Vivaldi rarity, the motet, "In furor 
giustissimae irae," which sounds very much like one of the composer's better 
concertos, but with a soprano voice taking the part normally assigned to the 
solo violin. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an effective, attractive piece, particularly in the fiery reading by 
Roschmann, whose voice assumes unexpected weight here. Highly recommended.

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT (****); ROY HARGROVE, "WITH THE TENORS OF OUR TIMES" ( VERVE ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hargrove, at 24, has really arrived. He exhibits the kind of maturity and high 
musicality that his chief influence, Freddie Hubbard, did at the same age. 
</P>
<P>
 The trumpeter is in esteemed company: Johnny Griffin, Joe Henderson, Stanley 
Turrentine, Joshua Redman and Branford Marsalis are the guest tenorists, and 
the trumpeter's tenorman, Ron Blake, plays on several tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no throwaway notes, no forgettable compositions. Turrentine explores 
a gusty blues and a sun-dappled-cum-potboiling bossa nova, Griffin plays his 
gorgeous evergreen, "When We Were One," and a lip-smacking shuffle, Henderson 
his sadly neglected '60s opus, "Serenity." Marsalis ardently approaches Sonny 
Rollins' "Valse Hot," while Redman is fluidly brilliant on the brisk "Mental 
Phrasing." Blake proves he can play with the best on "Once Forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever you listen, Hargrove -- who leads his quintet Thursday at Ambassador 
Auditorium -- is doing something right. On "Wild Is Love," his soothing tones 
are thick and pliant, mirroring the elastic rhythm going on under him; on 
"Valse Hot," he is biting and direct, the voice of reason wedged between 
wham-bam solos by Marsalis and Blake; on "Never Let Me Go," he is tender 
without being cloying. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus Chestnut (piano), Rodney Whitaker (bass) and Gregory Hutchison (drums) 
do so much more than just back-up: they drive the proceedings, and sparkle 
solowise. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

ALBUM REVIEW (***); BOINGO, "BOINGO" ( GIANT ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorten the name, lengthen the songs. Several tracks on this album run longer 
than seven minutes -- one of them, "Change," clocking in at a full 16! Aside 
from that tendency toward bloat, this is the best album by Danny Elfman and 
crew since, well, not long after they first shortened their name from the 
Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfman's time in the Hollywood soundtrack mines has apparently been good for 
him, judging by the new ideas he brought to this album. Gone with the Oingo are 
his tired, sinister sneer, replaced by a warmer and more down-to-earth 
presence. Gone too are the horn section and the excessive frills of the old 
Boingo arrangements, giving way to a pared-down, guitar-rock attack. And the 
version of "I Am the Walrus" is such a Boingo natural it's amazing they didn't 
do it years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). STEVE HOCHMAN

 SOUND CHECK: Remember how easy it used to be to go to a concert? 
</P>
<P>
 You just stood in line for hours to get the ticket or paid a scalper some 
outrageous amount, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you still have to do that -- but you've also got to remember to bring 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Batteries? 
</P>
<P>
 Haven't you heard about the Yes concerts July 17 at the Glen Helen Blockbuster 
Pavilion and July 21 and 22 at the Greek Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if the person in front of you in line is carrying a 
transistor radio and headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of catching every sonic nuance of progressive-rock faves Yes on 
headphones at home, fans will now be able to listen to them on headphones at 
the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 A special area has been set aside at the concerts for fans to bring the 
devices so they can pick up a "special mix" of the show beamed from the stage. 
Other fans will listen to the music over the regular sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tickets already have been sold for the shows, but more than 50 
tickets for this section have been held for each night and will be given away 
as part of radio station promotions -- with the winners also receiving new 
radios and headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 If the experiment works, it's possible that all fans will be able to listen 
through headphones at some future concerts. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: If Tom Petty's new single sounds awfully familiar, there's 
a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The MCA release is "American Girl," one of the best-known tunes in Petty's 
rock repertoire for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The song was included in Petty's 1976 debut album and released as a single at 
the time, but it failed to break into the Top 100. It was "Breakdown," a bluesy 
rocker from the same album, that subsequently introduced Petty to the pop 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA is turning now to "American Girl" -- which is part of Petty's recent 
greatest-hits album -- in hopes of following up the Top 10 success of "Mary 
Jane's Last Dance," according to Randy Miller, the company's senior vice 
president of marketing. "We think it's a timeless single. It sounds as good now 
as it did (in the '70s)."*

 The Black Crowes are recording in an L.A.-area studio for a new album due in 
late August. The band has already finished 24 songs and there's talk of a 
double-CD or a possible second album to be released in mid-tour after the band 
hits the road in the fall -- or a collection of the "extra" songs to be issued 
only through the band's fan club. . . . Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval guests on 
the first single from the Jesus and Mary Chain's upcoming album.Sandoval and 
the band's Jim and William Reid just shot a video for the song in the Arizona 
desert, directed by Sophie Muller, who did recent clips for Hole and Bjork. 
There's talk of a fall tour pairing the Mary Chain and Mazzy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Stevie Nicks' "Street Angel" album is now due June 7 and includes one song 
about Greta Garbo, another about Jane Goodall and a version of Bob Dylan's 
"Just Like a Woman" -- with the lyrics changed to make it a first-person 
narrative and Dylan himself on guitar and harmonica. The album also has 
appearances by David Crosby and Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 A deal is in the works to get R. Kelly on the soundtrack for "Dirty Lowdown 
Shame," the Keenen Ivory Wayans movie due in November. And Kelly raps on the 
upcoming debut album by 15-year-old singer Aaliyah -- which he also produced. 
Meanwhile, Kelly's "12 Play" album has been banned in Singapore due to the 
sexual nature of some songs, so he's releasing a "5 Play" EP with only the 
tamer titles -- but he says he'll perform the naughtier numbers when he tours 
there this year.*

POP EYE: ONLY A 9-MONTH GESTATION FOR PEARL JAM'S LATEST ALBUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Pearl Jam coming back too soon with its new album? 
</P>
<P>
 Though conventional wisdom in the record business says it's best to wait a 
year or two between releases to build up a hunger among fans, the word is the 
Seattle band may have a new collection in stores as early as July. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just nine months after the release of the blockbuster "Vs." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether fans will see the quick return as a daring and 
spontaneous move by a band that claims it's out to break down the mainstream 
rock convention -- or as a sign that the band is trying to strike while the 
commercial iron is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even U2's "Zooropa," which seemed to come out last year on the heels the 
band's "Achtung Baby," was actually 18 months after its predecessor. In that 
case, the "quick" release was hailed as a bold step. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do people in the industry think about Pearl Jam's plans? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly an unconventional strategy, but right now they're pretty much 
the biggest rock band in the world, so if anyone can get away with it, they 
can," said Bob Bell, new-release buyer for the Wherehouse retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe the move could restore some credibility that may have 
been washed away by the band's huge success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may get excited when they see the band maybe getting excited 
themselves about making an album, rather than waiting the requisite time 
between records," says Megan McLaughlin, editor of the CMJ New Music Report 
alternative-rock trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial fan reaction to material that presumably would be on the album has 
been strong. The band played one new song, "Not for You," on "Saturday Night 
Live" last month, and others on its live radio satellite broadcast from 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Some radio stations, including KROQ in Los Angeles, have already, in effect, 
been previewing the album-in-progress by playing "Not for You," taped off 
"Saturday Night Live." Gene Sandbloom, the station's assistant program 
director, says that it's among the most requested tracks on the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect, however, to have any clarification from Pearl Jam. Just as the 
group tried to release "Vs." with little fanfare, manager Kelly Curtis says the 
plan is to release the new album "as quietly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about tour plans? 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which canceled its summer dates in part because of the death of 
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, may be on the road this summer or fall if it can work 
out details of a plan to hold ticket prices to $18. Steve Hochman

 Disney's 30th full-length animated feature -- its most satisfying in decades 
-- has a striking and detailed look plus a strong story line. Sure to charm a 
wide audience for a long time to come, it benefits strongly from the brilliant 
lyricist Howard Ashman, who, with composer Alan Menken, created captivating, 
exceptionally alive songs. As executive producer, Ashman also was instrumental 
in conceptualizing the turning of the ancient fairy tale into a sprightly 
modern musical (Disney, Monday at 3:30 a.m., Saturday at 10 a.m. and 9 p.m.).

 Directed by Michael Apted, this 1992 release is a kind of spiritual thriller, 
a moderately diverting programmer in which a predictable shoot-'em-up plot is 
slickly intertwined with Native American religious customs and beliefs. 
Although the film tends to take itself too seriously, it is enlivened by some 
appealing acting and vivid camera work that saves it from the abyss.Inspired by 
the controversial arrest and imprisonment of Native American activist Leonard 
Peltier, it stars Val Kilmer (left) as an FBI operative, Sam Shepard (right) as 
his formidable superior, John Trudell as Peltier, Walter Crow Horse as a tribal 
police officer and John Fusco as a wily tribal elder. Interestingly, Apted also 
made "Incident at Oglala," a documentary on Peltier (Showtime Sunday at 8 
p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Like a Cuban-American version of "The Commitments," this 1992 film shows how 
much we are willing to forgive if only a movie fills the screen with gaudy 
life. Cliche actors, cartoonish emotions, an uncertain plot -- none of this 
seems to matter much in the face of a motion picture that is able to hook into 
as potent a musical force as the sexy, sensual mambo of the 1950s. Armand 
Assante (left), who galvanizes the film with his recklessly dynamic presence, 
and the quietly effective Antonio Banderas star as rumba-loving Cuban emigre 
musicians (HBO Tuesday at 3:10 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 A confident 1992 caper movie with a pleasant sense of humor, this film goes 
about its business in such a good-spirited way that it manages to make its 
familiar "Mission: Impossible" plot seem new. Its light spirits are due to both 
its ensemble cast, headed by Robert Redford (right) as the head of a San 
Francisco security systems firm and to director Phil Alden Robinson, who wrote 
the smart though convoluted script with producers Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence 
Lasker. Helping Redford test his systems to see if they're really secure are 
his staffers Sidney Poitier (left), Dan Aykroyd, David Straithairn and River 
Phoenix (TMC Friday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; CHRISTIAN CLEMENSON ON THE VIRTUES OF PLAYING SOCRATES 
TO 'BRISCO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christian Clemenson's prep school/Ivy League background suits Socrates Poole, 
his character on "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.," quite well. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemenson attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in Andover, Mass., and then 
went on to Harvard and Yale. Socrates, a kind of Sancho Panza to Brisco's 
(Bruce Campbell) Don Quixote, is a skittish, snobby attorney. But the gentle 
Clemenson says modestly of himself: "Nothing defines me quite so accurately or 
compellingly as Iowa," where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old actor manages to maintain his solid Midwestern roots and apply 
a prep school-like attitude toward his role in Fox's irreverent Western -- and 
still have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be hard to believe, but the 6-foot-2 actor dropped 100 pounds between 
filming 1987's "Broadcast News," in which he played the unflappable video 
editor, and 1990's "Bad Influence," where you may remember him as James 
Spader's pot-addicted brother with a conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight loss, courtesy of "eating responsibly," led to a whole new set of 
roles, including "Brisco's" Socrates. Still, Clemenson acknowledges, "I don't 
go out for romantic leads. I still think of myself as a character actor. I'm 
not the handsome leading man. I have too many quirks." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemenson jokes that he now auditions for roles of "the boyfriend who screws 
up or the boyfriend who gets dumped." 
</P>
<P>
 One perk of shedding pounds he really enjoys is, "You get a much better 
wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his "Brisco" wardrobe consists of prissy suits instead of 
traditional cowboy garb, he's thrilled to be working on a Western. "It was 
always my dream to be in a John Ford Western, shooting in Monument Valley," he 
says. The Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank may not fit that bill, but "since I'm 
blessed with great powers of imagination, at least when I'm on a horse, it's 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Carleton Cuse, executive producer and creator of "Brisco," praises Clemenson's 
"tremendous range of acting talents. You can't give him anything he's not 
capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our 
cast. He's also a lot of fun, a gifted comedian and a good dramatic actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in an "idyllic and rural" existence on the outskirts of Humbolt, 
Iowa, Clemenson never entertained any thoughts of acting as a profession. At 
14, he went to prep school at Exeter. Contrary to his expectations, he found 
the boarding school to be a progressive place. But he developed an interest in 
acting to ease his homesickness. "My mom said, 'Do something fun -- audition 
for a play,' " he says dryly. "I blame her for my career." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the Yale School of Drama, he went on to NBC's daytime 
drama "Another World." Soaps, he says, are "one of the hardest things to do. We 
struggle (on "Brisco") to do seven to eight pages of script a day, and they do 
an entire hour with up to 90 pages." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemenson's no stranger to working at a variety of paces. His university 
theater background helped him land the role of the stage manager in Broadway's 
"Noises Off," which he played for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite turns in series television and the movies "Heartburn" and "Hannah and 
Her Sisters," Clemenson continued to live low-rent, "in a pretty bad area of 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, the bachelor bought his dream home in Los Angeles. "I was 
always working and saving pennies," he says wryly. "Really, one of the basic 
components of my personality that I bring from the Midwest is my incredible 
cheapness. This is the classic case of the worst house in a great 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Another basic Midwestern trait is steadfastness, which Socrates offers on 
screen: "A lot of what Socrates does is provide a lot of information for 
Brisco," the actor says. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-screen, says a Fox representative, Clemenson is "the glue who holds the 
show together." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." airs Fridays at 8 p.m. on Fox.

ON VIEW; POWER TRIP; HBO OFFERS ITS 11 MEN-ON-A-RAFT STORY AS A METAPHOR FOR 
THE CORPORATE RAT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year's Emmy Award-winning HBO movie "Barbarians at the Gate" took a 
sardonic look at the corporate greed that came to symbolize the nation's 
business climate in the 1980s. "White Mile," the cable channel's latest movie, 
explores similar themes, but in the context of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact-based "White Mile" stars Emmy Award-winning Alan Alda ("MASH") as Dan 
Cutler, an aggressive, demanding president of a successful Los Angeles ad 
agency. Each year he organizes a wilderness expedition for his top executives 
and clients. He believes the trips promote bonding and help his men develop a 
more competitive edge. This year, Cutler decides to take his group to the 
Canadian Rockies to raft the Chilko River, one of North America's most 
treacherous stretches of water. Among the invited are Cutler's right-hand man, 
Jack Robbins (Peter Gallagher), a dissatisfied client (Dakin Matthews) and a 
former executive (Robert Loggia) who took early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time to ride the raging Chilko, none of the 11 men bow out. And 
no one refuses to enter the boat, though there are too many men for one raft. 
The men wear life vests, but the guide does not supply them with helmets or wet 
suits. All goes well until they enter White Mile. Suddenly, the boat strikes a 
rock and upends, plunging the group into the freezing river. Six die; one of 
the widows ends up suing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This story is almost a metaphor, a punctuation mark to the '80s," says 
executive producer Allan Marcil. "It's not a black-and-white story. They went 
on a trip and just through a coincidence and lack of planning, disaster 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter Baldwin is putting members of his cast through their paces this 
morning at the former Bullocks Wilshire department store, which is doubling for 
the ad agency. Alda and Gallagher are filming a sequence in which they sell 
their client (Matthews) a new ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, over lunch in his trailer, Alda explains he was drawn to "White Mile" 
because he was intrigued with the relationships among the characters -- 
"between those people in power and those people with less power. What the give 
and take is. What we give up to the ones who are telling us what to do, and how 
much the ones who are telling us what to do are willing to take on their own 
shoulders without sharing it with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tricky situation," Alda explains. "It's very complicated and yet 
it seems so simple: 'Don't put people in danger like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alda recalls reading trial testimony from a survivor who acknowledged everyone 
was afraid not to go on the raft. "It was a male thing. No one wanted to look 
like he was the one who wasn't brave enough not to do it. This corporate 
mentality was even worse in the '50s with the gray flannel suits. People gave 
up their lives for the corporations. They spent their whole lives doing the 
company thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher ("sex, lies and videotape") believes the movie illustrates the 
limits of power. "If you are in any kind of a powerful position where you can 
pick up the phone and get what you need, you forget the circle of power is not 
limitless. When confronted with a force of nature like a raging river, the 
things that are important in your world are suddenly useless." 
</P>
<P>
 On the actual trip, Gallagher says, a "conspiracy of natural events" caused 
the fatal situation. "They didn't go rafting on they day they had planned 
because it was pouring rain, so the water level was higher. Maybe had it not 
rained and the water level was somewhat lower, they might have been fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher says he doesn't know if he personally would have gone on such a 
trip. "I think anybody who says, 'This is what I would do if ...' is just 
talking through their hat. I think it has to do with the circumstances of the 
event. For my character, it's part of the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Alda: "You might get out there and get caught up in the excitement. I've 
been invited on trips like that, but it doesn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast and crew shot the thrilling rafting sequences last winter on the 
American River near Placerville in Northern California. Scores of river guides 
assisted in the filming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were super careful," Alda says. Still, he adds, "There's this moment where 
they say, 'Action,' and you are going to jump in those rapids. It's like 
jumping off a building. Even though you checked, you really don't know if 
there's a rock in front of you. I got washed over a rock. Thank God, it was a 
smooth rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher acknowledges he was scared, especially when guiding the raft by 
himself. "I was with one of the guides, but he wasn't using a paddle. I was 
trying to cross a minor eddy line. I could feel the river just pulling me down 
river. You realize what a fine line it is between sheer panic and quite 
literally, going with the flow. You can't fight the river." 
</P>
<P>
 "White Mile" premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

ART; REVIEW; ILLUMINATING FOUQUET'S PRAYER BOOK; THE GETTY MUSEUM HAS 
'REUNITED' MASTERPIECES OF 15TH-CENTURY FRENCH ARTIST JEAN FOUQUET FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a cross between the sweet, radiant simplicity of the early Florentine 
Renaissance painter Fra Angelico and the vaguely intimidating, revelatory 
mystery of the Flemish master Jan van Eyck, and you'll have something of an 
idea of the unusual tone of Jean Fouquet's best paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today touted as the greatest French artist of the 15th Century, Fouquet didn't 
really have a lot of competition. He was in many ways the first distinct 
personality in the history of French art. His work displays a budding European 
Renaissance sensibility that was northern in its origins and southern in its 
shadings. 
</P>
<P>
 If this distinctive artist and his compellingly quirky, hybrid style are not 
nearly as well-known today as are Fra Angelico and Jan van Eyck, several 
explanations offer themselves. One is Fouquet's role as something of a 
brilliant synthesizer of independent innovations, first made elsewhere. Another 
is the relative paucity of his extant work, which amounts to a small number of 
panel paintings and a variety of illuminated manuscripts. And still another is 
his commitment to the genre of manuscript illumination itself, an art central 
to the culture of medieval Europe but on the brink of eclipse at the very 
moment Jean Fouquet was wielding his brush. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1455, Johann Gutenberg and his assistants printed their famous bible in 
Mainz, Germany, the first book mechanically produced with movable type. 
Printing was to become a revolutionary means for spreading written and visual 
ideas far and wide, in a manner and for purposes completely different from the 
one-of-a-kind luxury items that are decorated manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year in Paris, Fouquet completed six miniatures for a diminutive, 
completely handmade prayer book commissioned from a wealthy nobleman. The Hours 
of Simon de Varie, as the prayer book is called, is neither as lush nor as 
elaborate in its decoration as the Hours of Etienne Chevalier, the lavish 
manuscript on which much of Fouquet's reputation now rests, and which was 
completed at around the same time. Still, four of the six little paintings at 
the front of the smaller book are extraordinarily beautiful in design and 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, two of those little masterpieces can now be seen by the general 
public for the very first time. "Fouquet's Century: Transformations in French 
Painting, 1415 -- 1530" is the fourth exhibition in an exceptionally 
significant series to focus on a single great manuscript in the celebrated 
collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum. Examining the Hours of Simon de Varie, 
it has as its magnificent centerpiece a diptych showing an exquisitely rendered 
Virgin and Child enthroned on one page, and the book's patron and a servant 
kneeling in devotion on the facing page. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, organized by Getty curator Thomas Kren, also marks the publication 
of the museum's first monograph about a manuscript in its collection. Unlike a 
facsimile edition, which copies an entire manuscript, the Fouquet monograph 
reproduces in color and actual size only those pages with miniatures and 
decorated initials, as well as a few text pages with secondary decorations. 
(About 70 pages in all are reproduced.) This "book about a book" also includes 
dozens of black and white illustrations of related material and several 
enlightening texts about the manuscript and its history. 
</P>
<P>
 That history is remarkable, too, especially as it intersects razor-sharp 
scholarly insight with plain dumb luck -- the stuff from which art historians' 
dreams are made. For the Getty's manuscript, which is one-third of a larger 
book whose remaining two volumes have been in a library in The Hague (the 
Koninklijke Bibliotheek) since 1814 and 1887, respectively, came into the 
museum's hands pretty much by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Prof. James Marrow, a highly regarded medievalist then on the faculty 
at UC Berkeley, made one of his regular visits to the San Francisco antiquarian 
book dealer, the late Warren R. Howell. There he was introduced to Gerald F. 
Borrmann, a bibliophile who had in his possession a small manuscript acquired 
in London four years before, about which he knew little. Could Prof. Marrow 
take a look and tell him what he thought? 
</P>
<P>
 Marrow could and did. But not before overcoming momentary speechlessness. 
Struggling to maintain his composure as he leafed through the four frontispiece 
miniatures, which included two full-page, heraldic representations enclosing a 
diptych of the donor kneeling before an enthroned Virgin and Child, he 
announced that he thought the paintings were exceedingly rare examples by Jean 
Fouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years and much productive research later, the extraordinary manuscript 
entered the collection of the Getty Museum, a partial gift of Borrmann and his 
wife. The exhibition and its accompanying monograph are the culmination of 
those early efforts at understanding the lovely little book and its serpentine 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still a good bit of sleuthing to do. Fouquet did the six miniatures 
at the front of the book, but he didn't illuminate the main text. The 
identities of the two principal illuminators who did are unknown; currently, 
they are attributed (in typically arcane art historical manner) to the Master 
of Jean Rolin II and to the Chief Associate of the Bedford Master, because of 
stylistic similarities to other painted books. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the museum's exhibition is thoroughly engrossing. The two separately 
bound volumes of the Varie hours that are housed in The Hague library have been 
reunited in Malibu with the missing third for the first time since they were 
split up in the 17th Century (probably to fetch more money on a flourishing 
manuscript market). Because an open book can only show two pages at a time, 
color transparencies of other illuminations in the Varie hours are in cases 
that ring the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also includes nine additional illuminated manuscripts, five 
independent folio leaves and three panel paintings. Except for the two Hague 
portions of the book and one leaf borrowed for the occasion from a private 
American collector, everything in the show is from the Getty's permanent 
collection. It is a measure of the Getty's impressive strengths in this area 
that the museum hasn't needed to turn elsewhere to set Fouquet in considerable 
context. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it would be nice to have a painting by Jan van Eyck to show off with the 
two small Fra Angelico panels on view, each depicting an elegantly rendered 
pair of saints. (Fouquet visited Rome before 1447, when Fra Angelico was 
working there.) But a fine crucifixion panel attributed to the Master of the 
Parlement of Paris remains a good example of the saturation of color and 
intensity of observed detail common to great Flemish art of the first half of 
the 15th Century, such as Van Eyck's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show is divided into four parts, with the Hours of Simon de Varie at the 
intersection. It looks at the artistic background on which Jean Fouquet built 
his style, while also giving examples of the work of several of his 
contemporaries. Subsequent illuminations that owe a debt to Fouquet's precedent 
are included, as are examples of his considerable legacy: Perhaps the most 
far-reaching feature of Fouquet's art was that it acted as one convincing 
conduit for the spread of Italian Renaissance influence throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 A striking feature of Fouquet's paintings is the sense of monumentality 
achieved in very small images. Each half of the magnificent Getty diptych is 
barely more than three inches wide and four inches high; and yet, the scale is 
dramatic and commanding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the right is Simon de Varie, dressed in a ritual suit of armor to designate 
nobility. (He worked in the finance ministry of Charles VII, not slaying 
English knights; that was left to Charles' devoted Joan of Arc.) He kneels in a 
ramrod straight posture with hands clasped before him in prayer. As sturdy, 
upright and enduring as the stone pilasters that mark the wall behind him, 
Simon casts an undifferentiated gaze across the page, not really looking at the 
Virgin and Child on the facing page as much as looking into a dreamy, 
contemplative inner space. 
</P>
<P>
 If the right panel depicts the earthly world with spiritual overtones, the 
left one shows the spiritual world in earthly terms. With a motherly grasp 
underneath the Child's arms, the enthroned Virgin holds the infant upright on 
her knee. She looks warmly at the boy, a faint smile on her lips, while he 
advances in Simon's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon may not be looking directly at the infant Jesus, but the infant is 
certainly looking at Simon. In fact, he strides toward him across his mother's 
lap. One outstretched hand offers a blessing, the other, an apple for Simon, 
the dedicated "new Adam" of the savior's church. 
</P>
<P>
 The space enclosing the enthroned Virgin and Child is far shallower than the 
one in which Simon and his attendant kneel together. Red velvet drapes close 
off the throne. Amazingly, Fouquet joins together the disjunctive spaces of the 
facing pages in a unified, one-point perspective articulated by the 
checkerboard floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, however, he underscores a subtle separation between the two: 
The Virgin and Child fill the page in a way Simon and his servant do not. 
Sacred figures dominate the diptych. The brilliant spatial interplay between 
pages convincingly establishes just who fits where in the culture's 
all-important hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other Fouquet miniature on view is from The Hague, a Madonna and Child of 
gravely beautiful, slightly nerve-racking simplicity. Veiled in lapis blue with 
golden highlights, and shown with head bowed in three-quarter profile, the 
Madonna cradles her child. Her gaze is concentrated on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, retaining just a hint of the medieval convention of displaying the 
features of a little old man, thus filled with wisdom beyond his mortal years, 
stares straight out of the lower left corner of the frame, gazing all-knowingly 
into the waiting eyes of a mesmerized viewer. Then, as if that rattling stare 
were not enough, Fouquet also painted the child's hand as if resting on the 
decorative border of columbines and heraldic shields that frames the 
two-dimensional page, separating the pictorial world of imagination inside the 
frame from the world of flesh outside. 
</P>
<P>
 With this simple gesture, which magically breaches the separation, the kid 
seems poised to crawl from his mother's pictorial lap into our actual one. The 
word is ready to be made flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouquet is something of a show-off in these gorgeous little paintings. And why 
not? That's what his patron was after, a pyrotechnic display of visual and 
conceptual theatrics worthy of Simon's vaunted perception of his own exalted 
station in life. 
</P>
<P>
 The patron's mottoes, painted on parchment scrolls unfurling above and below 
him on his diptych page, pretty much tell the tale. Vie a mon desir , they 
forthrightly declare, plus que jamais . 
</P>
<P>
 Life according to one's desire -- more than ever.*

RETRO; ABC THROWS ITSELF A HAPPY 40TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years of broadcasting can be summed up in two hours. ABC does it 
Saturday night in a birthday bash attended by a multitude of actors who've 
appeared in one of the network's series, movies or miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's 40th Anniversary Special is hosted by network stalwarts Tim Allen, Brett 
Butler, Dick Clark, John Forsythe, Judith Light, Susan Lucci, Jim McKay, Craig 
T. Nelson, Bob Saget, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Strauss, Jerry Van Dyke, Barbara 
Walters and Henry Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sprinkled throughout the audience are more members of the ABC family: 
Muhammad Ali ("Wide World of Sports"), Gene Barry ("Burke's Law,") Barbara 
Billingsley and Jerry Mathers ("Leave It to Beaver"), Edd Byrnes ("77 Sunset 
Strip") Michael Cole and Clarence Williams III ("The Mod Squad"), Vince Edwards 
("Ben Casey") and Hugh O'Brien ("The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"). 
</P>
<P>
 Clips are divided into 14 topics: 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing Up Before Our Eyes" focuses on family comedies over the years, from 
"Ozzie and Harriet" to "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops, Angels and Private Eyes" examines police and private-eye series ranging 
from "77 Sunset Strip" and "Charlie's Angels" to "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "ABC Daytime" salutes the history of soap operas such as "All My Children" and 
"General Hospital" and other daytime fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday Night Football" pays tribute to the long-running sports series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movie of the Week" explores the many award-winning movies, including "The Day 
After" and "Brian's Song," which have aired on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Clark Salute" honors the oldest living teen-ager who kept audiences 
hopping for nearly 30 years with "American Bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
 "Live Annual Events" looks at the live special events that have aired on the 
network from "Night of the 100 Stars" to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV Drama Comes of Age" is a retrospective of such trend-setting miniseries as 
"QB VII," "Roots," "The Thorn Birds," "The Winds of War" and "War and 
Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching History Happen" examines the historic and dramatic events chronicled 
by ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best Friends, Odd Couples & Strange Bedfellows" looks at some of the 
network's unconventional comedy fare, from "The Odd Couple" to "Three's 
Company." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Salute to Drama Series" looks back at such landmark series as "The Naked 
City," "Family," "thirtysomething" and "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer John Moffitt acknowledges that producing the special was 
difficult. "We worked very hard on it," he says. "The worst part was my late 
partner, Bill Lee, produced the 25th anniversary special of ABC for dick clark 
productions and they had four hours to do 25 years. We pleaded for more time." 
</P>
<P>
 But ABC informed Moffitt the network wasn't keen on asking audiences to invest 
four hours on one program, considering competition from cable and other 
channels. Still, Moffitt managed to cover everything but children's 
programming.

 Don't look for a lot of clips from ABC's early years. Some of the material, 
Moffitt says, has been lost. And a lot of what they found wasn't very good.

 "ABC's 40th Anniversary Special" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: GO SOUTH AT HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 This winter when Ken Frank took off his apron and closed up for the last time 
at La Toque, he had already signed on as chef for House of Blues down the road. 
The immense hall clad in weathered tin siding opened on May 1 and as for Frank 
cooking, well he is and he isn't. As head chef, he oversees the in-house 
restaurant one floor above the performance stage. But the only hands-on cooking 
he is doing these days is for the Foundation Room upstairs, a private venue 
open only to members of the International House of Blues educational foundation 
and their guests. So for most of us, it is goodby to truffled eggs and Frank's 
extravagant French cooking. We're going to eating in the regular restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the confusion of opening week, the food in the restaurant downstairs 
-- when you could get in -- was a cut above most club food. The two-level room 
with an eye-popping bar along one wall is an exuberant homage to the blues and 
to Southern folk artists. Every inch of surface is painted, patterned, 
stenciled, hung with naif paintings and sculpture or embellished with bottle 
caps and cutouts. While you eat, the sound system belts out the blues in all 
its permutations. Hey, I had a great time munching golden puffs of deep-fried 
catfish while listening to old cuts of B.B. King and Clarence (Gatemouth) 
Brown. The music definitely inspires you to order Southern. I'm sorry, but 
diced tuna fettuccine or roasted garlic pizza are simply no competition for 
jambalaya laced with shrimp and andouille sausage or the tasty chicken-fried 
steak smothered in gravy and flanked with mashed potatoes and vinegar-splashed 
mustard greens. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good half-pound burger, too, topped with your choice of cheese -- 
choose the blue, natch. And put your money on the Jack Daniel's hot sauce for 
the Tennessee-style baby back ribs. My next mission: the New Orleans po' boy 
the fervent waiter just set down two tables over. On a clear day, I'll take it 
outside on the veranda, thank you, with its big view of L.A. skies. 
</P>
<P>
 * House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 650-0247. Open from 
11:30 a.m. daily until midnight weekdays, until 1 a.m. weekends. No

<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank you for your wonderful interview with the legendary Gene Kelly 
("It's Been So Entertaining," by Hilary de Vries, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
 I have long been an admirer of Kelly's work, as I am a huge fan of movies from 
the '40s and '50s.Kelly is second only to Fred Astaire in talent, even though 
their styles are so very different. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kelly's "dancer's instrument," it was thrilling to watch him in action, 
especially in the classic "Singin' in the Rain" with Debbie Reynolds and Donald 
O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the most part I did enjoy De Vries' take on Gene Kelly, especially the 
references to his opinion about Louis B. Mayer. At one point De Vries quotes 
Kelly: " 'I hated the man,' he says simply." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the story, De Vries writes, "Indeed, Kelly remains ambivalent . . . 
about Mayer."Indeed. Kelly must regret that his comment sounded a mite 
wishy-washy to De Vries. I can only hope that in future interviews Kelly learns 
to speak more plainly. 
</P>

 I'm sure Katharine Hepburn, Greer Garson and James Stewart are greatly amused 
at Kelly's promotion to the oldest living alum of the late great MGM. Long may 
all their stars glow.

DANCING FOR DOLLARS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The American Way . . . That's Litigation!" (Film Clips, April 24): 
</P>
<P>
 I was appalled that Robyn Astaire is charging to show clips from Fred 
Astaire's movies; how rich does one have to get? I understand he left her 
millions.Fred & Ginger movies are part of our American heritage; they are part 
of movie history. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think she'd be proud to lend out clips from his movies so that many more 
people in the world can be enriched to see Fred & Ginger dancing, like only 
they could do. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't believe Fred would have wanted it this way!

EDDIE VEDDER'S ANGST  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "He Didn't Ask for All This," by Robert Hilburn (May 1): 
</P>
<P>
 Hilburn persists in comparing Eddie Vedder to people like Dylan and Lennon; 
with all of their incredible success and adulation, did they ever really 
express Angst , anger or alienation in such a negative way? Did they attend 
award shows and then frown at the audience and say, "Well, I guess I have to 
say thanks"? If they had wanted to make a statement, then they would have 
stayed home, instead of attending the MTV awards show and dumping on it at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he honestly think he's the only poor kid who ever had to get a job in 
high school? "I resented everybody around me who drove up in a car that someone 
provided for them," he says. Well, Eddie, it sounds like you had a real bad 
case of self-pity. Just because Hilburn insists on putting you in the same 
company with Lennon and Townshend, don't worry so much about it. The fact is, 
there aren't that many people out here who agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 NORM MATEW 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Hilburn's interview with Vedder was simply another chance for 
our rock "expert" to blame the terrible specter of fame for the death of his 
current god Kurt Cobain, and to recite for us heathens his litany of saints 
(Dylan -- Lennon -- Springsteen -- Bono). 
</P>
<P>
 In 15 years of playing my own music and trying to make it, I have never met 
any musician (whether their music mattered or not) who didn't want to be 
noticed and who didn't get excited at the idea of playing their music Big Time. 
True, not everybody is comfortable with media attention, but you don't get your 
message out there without it, and every band that works hard for that big break 
is doing it on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's fragile emotional state couldn't handle the inevitable pressures of 
the real world around him, and that was his problem. Fortunately, Vedder is 
made of sterner stuff, because he did ask for all this. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB LOZA 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Eddie Vedder. It must be so hard coping with the success and popularity 
of fronting one of the most popular bands in the entire world. 
</P>
<P>
 What is wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
 Where the rebellious Alice Cooper, Sex Pistols and Metallica spoke for an 
entire generation of teen Angst and aggression, these so-called grunge rockers 
can only piss and moan about how miserable everything is. And then, when their 
message is finally reached by millions, they complain even more! 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to rock 'n' roll? Wasn't it supposed to be fun? About having a 
good time? 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't these poor, wretched, so-hard-done-by rock stars just throw on an 
old Ted Nugent album and cheer up! 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL KUBAT 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 In the same paper I'm reading about children being slaughtered by machetes in 
Rwanda, and children being killed and getting limbs blown off in Bosnia, I have 
to buy as something of extraordinary pain Vedder's story of parents who weren't 
there for him (welcome to the club), and high school envy of rich kids with 
nice cars and the pretty prom date on their arm (welcome, welcome, and it 
sounds like a John Hughes movie), a group any kids Vedder might have will 
qualify for, now that he's probably richer than the parents of most of those 
kids he disdained? Boohoo.

<P>
 I am 29 years old, and I too feel the anger and alienation at being 
shortchanged by the American Dream. Please don't alienate me and those of my 
"age group" any further simply because we are not "aged 15 to 25."

 As a member of the so-called Generation X, I only have one thing to say about 
Hilburn's article pertaining to Eddie Vedder -- thank you. Now please leave Mr. 
Vedder alone.

THE TABLOID TRAUMAS OF THE TALK-SHOW PRESIDENT; WHEN YOU LIVE BY THE CULTURE . 
. . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven D. Stark, Steven D. Stark, who has written for the Atlantic, is a 
commentator on National Public Radio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether or not you believe Paula Corbin Jones' charges against Bill Clinton, 
the filing of a lawsuit against a U.S. President for personal behavior -- on 
raunchy sexual-harassment charges no less -- constitutes a unique turn in 
American culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
 A century ago, Grover Cleveland may have been identified as the father of 
Maria Halpin's illegitimate son, but no one thought of hauling him into court 
to answer for his behavior. Even if Jones' charges are found to be untrue, few 
relish the spectacle of a President possibly having to plead immunity or be 
deposed about his private life. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the Jones lawsuit is just another sign the country is going to hell 
in a handbasket. Maybe so. Still, a number of cultural and political 
developments that brought us to this juncture are worth examining -- if only to 
understand how we got here. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the suit is the culmination of a diminution of the stature of the 
presidency, due both to the end of the Cold War and changes in mass 
communication. From 1945-1990, the Cold War led to an increase in executive 
power. What's more, because Presidents can act in foreign policy largely 
unimpeded by congressional critics, they tended to be preoccupied by it. Before 
Clinton, virtually all Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt devoted much time 
to foreign policy. With the end of the Cold War, however, the importance of a 
strong foreign-policy leader has diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 This postwar rise in presidential power coincided with the growth of 
broadcasting -- allowing Presidents to go over the heads of Congress. This, 
too, created a more powerful and "personal" presidency (in Theodore J. Lowi's 
phrase), as Presidents became our prime political movers, supplanting the 
party. Now, however, with the rise of cable "narrowcasting," the President's 
ability to sway the nation has been curtailed. With more competition over the 
airwaves, presidential speeches now often draw roughly two-thirds the audience 
they drew only 15 years ago. That, too, weakens the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's response has been to take his presidency on the road with televised 
town meetings -- becom-ing, in effect, his own cable network and an even more 
"personal" President. Yet, by closing the distance between himself and the 
people with a "talk-show presidency," Clinton has allowed the office to become 
further demystified. It's not an exaggeration to contend that a President who 
reveals to an MTV audience that he wears briefs rather than boxers is likelier 
to be sued by someone alleging he may have improperly taken off those briefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, this action represents the culmination of a decades-long trend in 
which the line between entertainment and politics has blurred. Clinton hardly 
started the trend: Woodrow Wilson entertained D. W. Griffith at the White 
House; John F. Kennedy's presidency was a press agent's dream, and Ronald 
Reagan treated the presidency as the role of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly news that Washington has become a kind of Hollywood on the Potomac 
-- where the image of what happens is far more important that what actually 
transpires. It's now a world where leaders are measured almost solely by 
popularity polls; where candidates are judged by how well-groomed and glib they 
appear in TV debates, and where David Letterman and Jay Leno are the Walter 
Lippmanns of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In this atmosphere, it's no surprise that the press and public now treat their 
leaders in much the same fashion they deal with their entertainment icons. 
Hollywood stars are in the business of image, so when the image shatters, it's 
big news to the public -- and rightfully so. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the same rules now apply to Clinton. The real precedents for this 
scandal aren't Cleveland's political travails but the show-biz troubles of 
Fatty Arbuckle and Michael Jackson (down to tabloid details of anatomy). 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are other currents at work. We recently concluded a period 
of mourning when there were constant reminders of how much Richard M. Nixon's 
Watergate lessened respect for the presidency. Thanks, in part, to the legacy 
of the baby boomers -- who grew up distrusting all paternal symbols -- all 
authority figures tend not to command as much respect as they once did. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the baby-boom generation, which defined the personal as political, 
private behavior comes under increasing scrutiny. As respect for official 
authority has declined, there's more of a tendency for Americans to resort to 
legal remedies. In an age of narcissism, lawsuits are the counterpart to 
consciousness-raising or health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The press has obviously played a role. With the growth of tabloid journalism, 
the news has become a kind of national gallery of vileness. This is due, in 
part, to what might be called -- for lack of a better term -- the 
pornographication of American culture. Throughout the culture, standards for 
public discourse about sex have widened considerably -- even in legal 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, over the years, the press has developed a kind of pervasive distrust 
of public servants. Whether or not one attributes this to justified skepticism 
after Watergate, the result has been the nurturing of a kind of grouchy 
cynicism about leaders that has further lowered respect for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, all these sentiments are nothing new in American life -- even if 
they have now been taken to new heights. More than 150 years ago, Alexis de 
Tocqueville wrote about how Americans are always drawn to gossip -- the better 
to demonstrate why the famous are no better than anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 The irony, of course, is that Clinton came to office embodying a number of the 
cultural forces that now threaten to overwhelm him. He is a member of the 
baby-boom generation that brought many of these anti-authority sentiments into 
the cultural mainstream. He had the support and sympathy of many groups that 
favor an expansion of just the sorts of legal rights and remedies Jones is now 
employing. Clinton may resent being treated as if he were just another show-biz 
figure, but he once courted the comparison, in everything from the way he 
played the sax to his adopted nickname, "Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton perfected the talk-show approach on his ascent into office -- remember 
the second debate when he took questions from voters -- but he ended up 
lowering his stature in the process. What's more, the "I feel your pain" 
trademark of his presidency first gained cultural prominence as a talk-show 
staple -- the whole point of talk shows like Oprah Winfrey's is that they 
encourage "victims" to "feel their pain" as a way of empowering themselves to 
strike back against those who seem more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton took the language of the talk-show movement and brought it to 
politics. He apparently never realized that once elected, he would become the 
nation's most powerful figure and thus Public Enemy No. 1 to all these 
anti-Establishment elements. The rest, as they say, is history. The forces 
tapped and unleashed by Clintonism now threaten to engulf their leader.*

FOR ANY SOLUTION TO HAITI, U.S. MUST INCLUDE ARISTIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Wilentz, Amy Wilentz is the author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since 
Duvalier (Simon and Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian problem is growing thornier by the minute. Amid a deluge of 
proposals to end it, the issues that caused the crisis are growing clearer: an 
entrenched business elite unwilling to part with an iota of its power nor share 
a penny from its pocketbook; a military that traditionally acts as paid agent 
of the business elite's agenda; an overwhelming majority of poor and 
disenfranchised who hoped change would come when they elected Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, a president unique in Haiti's history because he represented the 
people's interests, and a large contingent of jobless, uneducated young toughs 
who see no hope for a future and are willing to join whatever death squad will 
pay for a house, a month's meals or a bottle of rum. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's election was supposed to have produced a peaceful overthrow of the 
status quo, but because he went about changing things in Haiti, and didn't do 
it slowly or subtly enough, he was overthrown instead, taking things in Haiti 
back to square one -- to square zero, in fact. He tried to purge and 
professionalize the military, to tax businesses, to eliminate the drug trade, 
and to grant workers certain basic rights. These reforms, which seem 
elementary, are exactly what the elite in Haiti will not stand for. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the amusing and not so amusing solutions being bandied about 
in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bay of Pigs Jr. Since Bay of Pigs Sr. worked so well. This solution proposes 
that the U.S. government -- rather than send its own boys -- arm a group of 
Haitian exiles and send them in boats to retake Haiti and install a new 
government. The question is, what group of Haitians would the Americans arm? 
There are so many. Taking a leaf from the Bay of Pigs, there are the crazed 
right-wingers; there are the crazed left-wingers (split, of course, into many 
warring cells); there are Christian groups and voodoo groups, friends of the 
United States and avowed anti-Americans. There are relatives of the elite, 
groups of professionals (send in the doctors) and people militating for a mass 
movement of the proletariat (as if Haiti had one). There are Aristide 
supporters, former Aristide supporters and anti-anti-Aristide supporters. You 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Black King of La Gonave. This is my personal favorite, actually 
mentioned for two days running in the national press. (This proposal, at least, 
has a historical precedent, sort of: During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, 
Marine Lt. Faustin Wirkus of Pennsylvania, civil administrator of La Gonave, a 
barren and impoverished Haitian island about 40 miles from Port-au-Prince, was 
crowned king by the people there, and was known as "The White King of La 
Gonave.") 
</P>
<P>
 The Black King solution proposes that Aristide should be flown to La Gonave. 
There, he should gather and organize his people for an armed attack on the main 
land. The United States could then remove itself from the continuing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Aristide and the men and women he would need to take back 
Port-au-Prince, there is not enough drinking water or food on La Gonave now to 
support the current population. This plan also seems to posit that Aristide's 
physical removal from the United States would somehow enable Washington to wash 
its hands of the matter. "You're on your own now" is the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States has never let the Haitians go it alone. America has been 
involved in Haiti since the beginning -- since Haitian slaves declared 
independence from France in 1804, while the United States still relied on 
slavery ; since United Fruit and the National City Bank became major players on 
the island; since the United States invaded and occupied Haiti from 1915-1934; 
since the Cold War, when we supported the cold-blooded dictator Francois (Papa 
Doc) Duvalier as a reasonable alternative to an imperceptible communist threat; 
since the fall of his son, Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, in 1986, when we 
supported the Haitian military as a force for democracy. And now, since the 
post-Aristide era, when the United States has obfuscated and generally 
encouraged an atmosphere in which the military regime believed it had the tacit 
support of Washington and the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think Tank Option. Form a multi-party interim government that would permit a 
U.N. force to oversee next year's elections and stay in place afterward to 
protect the results. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're just reading along, you don't notice how no one says who is going to 
form this new government. You don't notice that no one mentions the military 
high command stepping down. You don't notice that justice is not mentioned in 
this high-minded-sounding solution, nor the elected government of Aristide. You 
don't notice how that omission implies an amnesty for crimes committed by death 
squads and the military in the coup aftermath (some 3,000 killed). You don't 
notice that "multiparty" government in a country where parties are tiny staffs 
of self-important politicians really means a U.S.-led and -directed 
"transition" committee. You don't notice that next year's elections are 
presidential elections in which Aristide cannot constitutionally run, because 
Haitian law does not permit successive terms for the president. You aren't made 
aware that there is hardly a Haitian who would vote in such elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, you don't notice that the Think Tank Option has been the U.S. 
government's underlying solution to the Haitian crisis all along, and that the 
only way it could work with the high command in place is at the whim of the 
generals, as a tool of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Which are, in case anyone has forgotten: to wipe out all opposition; to 
destroy the progressive movement for the next generation or two; to prohibit 
the return of Aristide by any means necessary; to end literacy, education and 
health care for the Haitian people, and to enrich themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 What all these solutions share is a subtle but unmistakable plan to dump 
Aristide. Yet Aristide must be a willing part of any solution, or it will not 
be a real solution. To the Haitian voter, Aristide is the living symbol of 
Haitian democracy. Any plan that excludes him excludes democracy, as far as 
they are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been the Bush and Clinton administrations' problem: They don't like 
Aristide, but they can't create anything even faintly legitimate without him. 
So, to solve the Haitian problem, the Americans have to do something they don't 
want to do: reinstate Aristide. This has been the reason for the stalemate in 
U.S. policy, and why the generals perceived that Washington was not really 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most important goals for any real solution are the high command's 
resignation from the Haitian Army and Aristide's reinstatement. For more than 
two years, the Haitian business elite has been paying lobbyists to get the 
sanctions lifted -- thus one must believe the sanctions are working. The 
Clinton Administration is now trying some of the right things: tightening U.N. 
sanctions; pressuring President Joachim N. Balaguer of the Dominican Republic 
to close his border with Haiti where goods banned by the sanctions are still 
pouring through. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Administration should do more. Take away the military's motive for 
staying. (Hugh profits from contraband are enriching them.) Bomb the new 
highway that brings oil and other contraband from the border to Port-au-Prince. 
Include families of the elite in the ban on visas and the freezing of assets. 
Shut down commercial as well as non-commercial air traffic to Haiti. Help 
Aristide's government set up an offshore radio station to provide Haitians with 
information and give them hope. Convince Balaguer -- by threatening an aid 
cutoff or elimination of the Dominican Republic's special sugar-trade status -- 
to allow a multilateral force to patrol the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before military intervention becomes necessary, the high command will 
step aside -- though it might take some months of tough talk and tougher 
measures. Is the Clinton Administration capable of maintaining a steady course 
with this policy, or will it cave to expediency and hope that a fast military 
action (a la Panama) will give it a needed boost in public opinion? Because the 
Administration's recent, positive maneuvering on the Haiti front has been so 
timid, so lacking in moral backbone, the long, painful crisis goes on.*

WHY NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME SURVEYS ARE INDISPENSABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David D. Dotson, David D. Dotson, former assistant chief of police of the 
Los Angeles Police Department, is working on a book on the history of the 
department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The current uproar over the Los Angeles Police Department's 
neighborhood-by-neighborhood violent-crime surveys recalls an earlier 
controversy over how statistics should be used to determine where police are 
deployed in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, then-Deputy Chief Jesse A. Brewer ordered a study of 
police-deployment criteria in his South Bureau. After reading the internal 
report, Brewer concluded that his command was entitled to a larger share of 
available resources. Somehow, the study results became public before then-Chief 
of Police Daryl F. Gates had had an opportunity to review and act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, residents in South-Central, the major part of the South Bureau, 
began demanding their "fair share" of police protection. This meant that 
officers patrolling other areas of the city would have to be reassigned to the 
South Bureau. The reaction of these other areas, especially the San Fernando 
Valley, was swift and vociferous. No way! Some went so far as to cast the issue 
in racial terms: mostly minority South-Central vs. mostly white San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was blind-sided, and he understandably reacted in anger. Unfortunately, 
he did not resolve the deployment questions raised by Brewer's study. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gates, Police Chief Willie L. Williams and his staff had not been able to 
review the neighborhood-survey data before portions were leaked to the public. 
Although the surveys, yet to be officially released, are apparently not 
intended for use as a rationale to shift police resources from one area of the 
city to another, conclusions to that effect are being drawn. Many people, 
including some politicians who should know better, have seized upon the 
incomplete data to call for a reassessment of how police resources are 
distributed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the department moves toward community policing, these 
neighborhood-crime analyses, and the numbers they produce, become extremely 
important. They provide the detailed knowledge necessary for the police and the 
community to interact effectively in reducing crime and the fear of crime. The 
LAPD, however, must remain mindful of the wealth of community-policing 
opportunities that the mere act of performing the analyses provide. The sooner 
citizens who are directly affected by crime are involved in the planning, the 
better the chances that a successful policing strategy will be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the opportunity to enlarge community involvement to include people 
who never believed themselves capable of influencing how government serves 
them. Among this group may be new residents with diverse national and cultural 
backgrounds; young people; tenants in public housing; the homeless; welfare 
recipients, and just plain working folks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the opportunity to broaden the cross section of the traditional 
stake holders in the community to add representatives of agencies, public and 
private, social scientists, politicians and ordinary citizens. With community 
policing, the advisory councils and support groups now selected by police 
administrators, which tend to be dominated by business and homeowners' groups, 
are no longer viable instruments for developing police problem-solving 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 This more inclusive approach would produce fresh perspectives on such stubborn 
street-crime problems as drug sales and use, and violent gang activities. A 
better understanding of these problems may lead to development of new and more 
effective policing operations, if not strategies for improving the social 
conditions that breed criminal behavior. Clearly, current and past efforts -- 
gang sweeps, targeting drug suppliers -- have not abated the crime problem nor 
alleviated fear of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, discussions of community-based policing have focused on 
decentralization of command responsibility, structure and various enforcement 
mechanisms. But community policing is not simply a choice between, for example, 
storefront police offices or foot beats. It is principally an attitude that 
starts at the top and settles down through the ranks of the entire 
organization. The importance of attitude cannot be overstated. All the latest 
crime-fighting weapons, faster patrol cars and a 10% annual raise will not 
produce effective community policing if the officer on the street perceives the 
chief and his commanders to be soft on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing is not a new concept. Sir Robert Peel, English prime 
minister during the first half of the 19th Century, captured the idea in 
"Police Principles of the London Metropolitan Police." He wrote "(T)he police 
are the public and . . . the public are the police." 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred and fifty years later, LAPD Chief Ed Davis included Peel's 
concepts in his "Twenty Management Principles of the Los Angeles Police 
Department." The centerpiece of Davis' approach was the assignment, on a 
round-the-clock basis, of nine officers to specific areas. In addition to their 
regular duties, they were charged with helping residents develop community 
responses to crime. Neighborhood Watch groups were one result. Regrettably, 
this approach to policing was gutted by subsequent police administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 If the police are truly serious about joining with the community, what better 
time than now while conducting these crime studies? Statistics are important 
but in community policing, it is far more important that everyone understand 
how they were derived and what they mean.*

THE NATION; CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE AT THE MERCY OF CAMPUS 
HEALTH CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Heltzel, Paul Heltzel is an editor on fellowship at U. The National 
College Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While studying for my undergraduate degree in Virginia, a medical problem I 
had was misdiagnosed and I endured low-quality care at the university health 
center. When I learned that one of the center's doctors had called a friend of 
mine for a date following her gynecological exam, I decided it was time to look 
elsewhere for serious health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, my experience was not exceptional. Budget cuts have forced 
layoffs of physicians, nurses and other medical specialists at campus health 
centers across the country. Student claims of misdiagnoses are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Many college health centers, further-more, are not government regulated. 
Although most states require unannounced inspections of hospitals, nursing 
homes, home-care agencies and ambulatory surgical facilities, campus centers 
are exempted in 39 states. School administrations provide the only oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 1,650 campus health centers in the United States, about 75 
are accredited by either the Assn. for the Accreditation of Ambulatory 
Healthcare or the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care 
Organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 These organizations set high standards for centers that offer care comparable 
to that received in a hospital. But most facilities that specialize in services 
similar to those provided at walk-in clinics -- that is, campus health centers 
-- are neither regulated nor accredited because they supposedly aren't 
providing services that could put patients at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, some students do have access to inexpensive and high-quality care 
at some universities -- especially those with strong medical schools. 
Otherwise, they have little choice but to visit their campus center when they 
need care. Students juggling part-time jobs or Pell grants simply cannot afford 
a trip to a private physician; uninsured students are worse off. 
</P>
<P>
 Although President Bill Clinton's health-reform plan does not address 
regulation of campus clinics, it does aim for universal coverage, which, if 
accepted, would at least give students better medi- cal choices. But universal 
coverage bypasses the problem. Students dealing with health problems for the 
first time should receive better treatment for their money. They have entrusted 
their well-being to universities and, in some cases, they are being let down 
miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the University of Arizona praised their campus' health center, but 
20% annual budget cuts for three consecutive years have taken their toll. 
Between 1991-1993, Arizona unloaded seven of its 20 full-time physicians and 
health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers' health centers sustained annual cuts of 3% to 14% over the last five 
years. To make up the difference, student fees have been raised, reserves drawn 
down and hiring for certain positions frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of budget cuts and a system of inconsistent regulation makes 
for a disastrous situation. While little can be done to staunch dwindling 
finances, state governments can require that university health centers be 
regularly inspected. While this would not guarantee improved treatment, it 
would at least let students know just what sort of treatment they can expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, students need to look out for themselves. If the treatment provided 
at their health center is untrustworthy, students should seek a second opinion 
off campus. Lining up a primary-care physician before they need one is also 
important. Every state and county has a local medical society that can offer 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Students should shop around for health insurance, which is relatively cheap 
because they are usually healthier than the general population. For students on 
a tight budget, physicians often will work out a payment plan or even a 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
 These options are hardly ideal, but until state legislators and universities 
take health care for college students more seriously, there isn't much choice. 
It is unfortunate that with all the attention focused on health-care reform, 16 
million college students have little reason to believe that any change will 
come to their campus health centers.*

CLINTON FOCUS ON INFLATION SQUEEZES MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Lee, Susan Lee, an economist, is the author of Damaging Delusions, 
which will be published next year by Viking-Penguin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hey, remember the presidential race of 1992? Remember the put-upon middle 
class? Remember the folks whose pain candidate Bill Clinton felt and whose 
plight he wanted to remedy? You know, the ones he promised a tax cut and a 
faster-growing economy with more jobs and fewer entitlement programs? 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to those people once candidate Clinton became President 
Clinton? Forgotten and put-upon, once again. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they watched the middle-class tax cut disappear, then they endured an 
economic recovery that turned out to be limp and jobless, then they heard new 
entitlement programs proposed -- more government spending for health-care 
reform and welfare reform. Now, they are being squeezed by the great 
interest-rate run-up, or, actually, creep-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve has nudged up rates three times -- with another bump-up 
expected this week. This sort of creepy-creep unsettles the markets -- 
particularly the long-bond market, where interest rates have shot up from a tad 
more than 6% to 7.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration hasn't complained. Nope, its economists have 
begun to talk about the inflation menace. Indeed, the Administration has gotten 
angry at the bond market for responding, appropriately, to the Fed's actions, 
not at the Fed for trying to dampen what little economic growth there is. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't good reasons to inch up interest rates: There are 
certain signs, however faint, that the rate of inflation is accelerating. 
Commodity prices are on the way up. After three years of being on the flat 
side, food prices have begun to rise; gold prices are smartly off their lows of 
last September, while prices for other precious metals and some industrial 
metals, such as copper, have jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other anxieties as well. Some economists find high 
capacity-utilization rates and lower unemployment rates worrisome; others are 
bothered that the Fed's monetary policy has been too loose for the past two 
years, while others fret the Fed waited too long to tighten. 
</P>
<P>
 But some inflationary augurs are a self-created political problem. And herein 
lies a great puzzle. It is widely believed that Clinton won the election with 
the simple focus of "It's the economy, stupid." Yet, Clinton's actions in 
office indicate a great ignorance. Indeed, coming after a decade of hard-won 
and welcome disinflation, his policies almost suggest a wish to re-inflate the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Clinton Administration's policy on the dollar: the weaker the better. 
After two years of talking the dollar down to promote exports -- the 
Administration suddenly decided the dollar was "too weak." A weak dollar 
promotes inflation in two ways: Consumers must pay more for imports, and those 
higher prices provide a shield for domestic manufacturers to raise their 
prices. Hence, two weeks ago, the Administration reversed itself and led an 
effort to boost the value of the dollar by intervening in currency markets and 
inviting speculation that the Fed would again push up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also adding to the dollar's weakness, and thus to the threat of inflation, has 
been the Administration's foreign policy, or lack of a coherent one, which has 
unsettled investor confidence worldwide. Specifically, the Administration's 
trade threats against Japan have fostered global nervousness. And the potential 
impact of money and sex scandals on the effectiveness of presidential 
leadership has not helped world confidence in the dollar, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Administration hasn't helped the anti-inflationary case by 
appointing two inflation doves to the Federal Reserve to fill positions opened 
when two inflation hawks retired. 
</P>
<P>
 But are these inflationary prickles strong enough to heed? Probably yes. 
Accelerating rates of inflation are always serious. Price volatility that 
accompanies inflation is a drag on economic growth through the uncertainty it 
generates. Worse, once inflation becomes embedded in people's expectations, it 
not only aggravates the initial problem but is hard to reverse -- without a 
nasty recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But why fight inflation by raising interest rates and therefore running up 
mortgage rates, interest rates on car loans and credit cards? Why slow an 
already sluggish economy? 
</P>
<P>
 For cynics, the answer lies with the political-economic cycle. This view holds 
that the Administration wants an economic boom in 1996, a presidential election 
year, so it is trying to slow growth now. If this is true, Clinton owes the 
working middle class a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has other options for fighting inflation. After all, an 
economy growing at 2% to 3% a year is not exactly gangbusters. Especially now 
that the rate of growth in productivity seems to be, finally, recovering from a 
two-decade slump. Rather, the Administration should concentrate its efforts on 
accelerating productivity growth. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, a review of business-tax policy would be in order. It is 
business investment and technological breakthrough that drive productivity 
gains, and tax law ought to encourage such activity. Instead, the 
Administration raised some corporate tax rates in its 1992 budget and is hoping 
to hit business with another tax -- to pay for health-care reform. In addition, 
the tax rate on capital gains ought to be lowered to encourage the 
entrepreneurial effort that is a main engine of technological breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration could also improve the general climate for economic 
activity by crafting and maintaining a stable and dependable policy 
environment. Long-term investors don't like surprises. They don't like going to 
bed under one regime and waking up to find government has changed the rules 
with another "initiative" that requires intervention in the economy. The less 
government activity in the economy, the more room there is for business and 
private investment activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the Clinton Administration is doing plenty to promote inflationary 
expectations and its response to those expectations -- cheering the rise of 
interest rates to slow growth -- will hammer those who can least sustain a hit 
in the head. A faster growing economy is what Clinton promised the middle-class 
and he should match his policies to his promises. As long as he is about it, 
how about that middle-class tax cut?*

THE WORLD; SOUTH AFRICA'S STRENGTH: A BIAS FOR MODERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger writes 
frequently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The post-Cold War world has witnessed what may prove to be one of its most 
hopeful moments: the emergence of the first democratic multiracial government 
in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of Nelson Mandela and the creation of a government of national 
unity in South Africa is only the first step of what is bound to be a long and 
difficult journey. Conflicts among and within ethnic groups, devising a balance 
between central and provincial authorities and the possible insistence by the 
newly enfranchised majority on more rapid social and economic progress than the 
system can bear have the potential to defeat the promise. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa encompasses more ethnic groups than almost any other country: 
Europeans, Africans, Indians and Cape Coloreds -- descendants of the original 
Hottentot population in the Cape province. The European population is divided 
between those of English and Dutch origin who fought each other earlier this 
century and continue as political rivals. Within the African population, the 
Zulu leadership claims autonomy from the Xhosa-dominated African National 
Congress, a federalism perceived by many in the ANC as the forerunner of 
secession. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic rivalries are complicated by what Mandela describes as the tendency of 
veterans of the anti-apartheid resistance to apply a definition of democracy 
relying on consensus and intolerant of opposition. Nor is proclivity to 
violence confined to one group.  
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha has a militia and the European Community's militant wing has always 
rejected a multiracial solution. Moreover, societies reared on the British 
parliamentary system find the concept of checks and balances alien. Even 
Mandela has expressed perplexity with the idea of judicial review, on the 
ground that a non-elected body should not be able to overrule an elected one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, these problems are being addressed by an extraordinary array of 
leaders. When defending himself against the charge of treason in 1964, Mandela, 
whose career is the embodiment of endurance made possible by spiritual depth, 
affirmed his devotion to a multiracial society. He has kept his word. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of Frederik W. de Klerk is equally astonishing. Until he 
came to power, apartheid had reigned supreme for half a century. Its end 
occurred with a speed unimaginable even a decade earlier and with only a 
minimum of violence. By 1991, De Klerk could pronounce as an Afrikaner goal 
what had only yesterday been illegal: 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make all South Africans proud; we want to build a South African 
nation in which, yes, all the various composite parts can feel safe, in which 
there will be acceptance of joined and common goals. . . . A new vision for our 
country is crystallizing, a vision of justice, fairness, equality and 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 As an essentially tribal leader, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi had 
less reason to change. His insistence on autonomy and some kind of federalist 
solution has remained constant. Still, he deserves credit for raising a crucial 
challenge to South African democracy: how to reconcile the rule of the majority 
with the rights of ethnic minorities. For as long as voting largely follows 
ethnic or tribal lines, the minority can never hope to become a majority. At 
the same time, the ANC has reason for its concern that if the ethnic divisions 
are enshrined as sacrosanct, unity may remain elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In overcoming its problems, however, South Africa has advantages that 
transcend personalities. The legitimacy of the state is well-established, and 
the existing groupings have considerable experience in dealing with each other 
within a larger political framework.  
</P>
<P>
 While governments of national unity are generally more useful in papering over 
differences than in resolving them, the interim institution created by Mandela 
and De Klerk -- in which every party achieving a certain percentage of the 
votes also achieves representation in the Cabinet -- creates a useful framework 
for the practice of mutual cooperation in the crucial early stages of power 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Few countries have as much to gain from a moderate evolution as does South 
Africa. It has vast resources, a well-established infrastructure, significant 
manufacturing base and higher level of education than any of its neighbors. 
Furthermore, the very multiplicity of its ethnic groupings provides a certain 
insurance against civil conflict. For once that Pandora's box is opened, the 
consequences are ultimately unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 This built-in incentive for moderation was brought home to me when Lord Peter 
Carrington and I, among others, were asked by Mandela and Buthelezi to mediate 
the constitutional issues between the ANC and the Inkatha parties for the 
five-year interim government. We found that the interim constitutional issues 
seemed capable of fairly rapid resolution. What we could not resolve was the 
issue of participation by Inkatha in the election. As mediators, we refused to 
address the issue on the ground that outsiders have no right to determine the 
date of a people's emancipation. 
</P>
<P>
 After we left the country, the prospect of civil war produced an unexpected 
solution. Inkatha agreed to participate. For its part, the ANC chose 
compromise. As a result, the interim constitutional issues were settled, 
although federalism is certain to re-emerge as a principal bone of contention 
in the drafting of the final constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections seemed to confirm the trend toward moderation. Whether by 
prearrangement or thanks to the good sense of voters, the outcome is almost 
ideally suited for reconciliation. The ANC achieved a preponderant vote that 
was, nevertheless, a few percentage points short of the two-thirds needed to 
rewrite the interim constitution unilaterally; the National Party transformed 
itself into a multiracial entity (though appealing mostly to Indians and 
Coloreds) and became the second largest grouping. Inkatha achieved some 10% of 
the vote and -- surprisingly -- a majority in Natal, assuring itself three 
seats in the Cabinet and a political base. And Mandela has done his part in 
creating a Cabinet largely tilted toward inclusiveness, even giving Buthelezi a 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to so many other parts of the world, there is reason to hope and 
cause for the maximum moral and material support. The industrial democracies 
can best help by encouraging private investment, and they must take care not to 
impose their own domestic experiences on South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 South Africa is not the place to test liturgies for either the radical left or 
the radical right. For a moderate evolution would give hope to all of Africa 
and to every other region where men of goodwill seek to rescue cohesion from 
the hatreds history has spawned.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DALAI LAMA; USING NONVIOLENCE AGAINST A POWERFUL 
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John-Thor Dahlburg, John-Thor Dahlburg is New Delhi bureau chief for The 
Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the veranda of his audience hall, in the shadow of the saw-toothed Outer 
Himalayas, Tibet's "god-king," who lost his kingdom when the Chinese invaded, 
walks briskly forth to greet his people. More than a hundred visiting Tibetans 
crowd under the corrugated roof. At the appearance of the Dalai Lama, they bow 
low, many so in awe they dare not look him in the face. For them, the owl-eyed, 
bespectacled Buddhist monk with a passion for flowers and mending watches is 
their nation incarnate.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama fled into India in 1959, following a failed revolt. Ironically, 
this apostle of nonviolence escaped the Chinese by grabbing a soldier's coat 
and rifle to disguise his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 58, the spiritual head of Tibetans lives with his exile government in 
Dharamsala, in India's Himachal Pradesh state. Five years ago, he won the Nobel 
Peace Prize. He does not hide his regret that his commitment to using peaceful 
and democratic means to restore Tibet's freedom has not brought Beijing to the 
bargaining table -- despite Deng Xiaoping's assurances, in 1979, that any 
option short of independence would be considered. They have not even been 
enticed by the high lama's 1988 proposal that Tibet be a self-governing entity 
in China, with the Chinese in charge of foreign policy and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Lhamo Dhondrub to a peasant woman with 16 children, the Dalai Lama was 
recognized at age 2 as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the 13th Dalai 
Lama, and thus an incarnation of Avalokitesvara, the Buddhist Bodhisattva of 
Compassion. Since 1642, Tibet had been ruled by the Dalai Lama, whose title can 
be translated as "ocean of wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 28, he met briefly with President Bill Clinton in the office of Vice 
President Al Gore. The format was designed to minimize offense to China. 
Nonetheless, Beijing accused Washington of "serious interference" in its 
internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing burgundy socks that match his sleeveless monk's robe, the Dalai Lama 
spoke for nearly an hour in a long, cool room off the porch where he receives 
delegations. Punctuating his words frequently with his infectious laughter, he 
talked about policy toward China, Beijing's "Final Solution" for Tibet and his 
indomitable hopes for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Last March, in your address marking the 35th anniversary of the 
Tibetan uprising, you noted with dismay that your offers to talk have failed to 
elicit any positive reaction from the Chinese. Has your approach been an error? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't consider it a mistake. No. One of the main purposes of my 
proposal is to start meaningful negotiations with the Chinese government or to 
bring China to the negotiating table. That, so far, has failed. Another 
objective is to reduce Chinese-population transfer into Tibet. That also 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for the past 14 years, my approach has raised more interest on the 
international level and made it easier for foreign governments to support the 
Tibet issue. And then, in the eyes of ordinary Chinese people -- I mean 
intellectuals and students -- in their eyes, my approach is very reasonable and 
suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what can you do now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm waiting to see how much effect will be caused by international pressure 
on the Chinese government. So if, you see, that also fails -- doesn't produce a 
result -- then I am going to ask the Tibetan people, outside (Tibet) as well as 
inside. The people outside I can ask openly in a referendum. Inside, through 
visitors, we can communicate. I can collect their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I would like to give them some few options. One option: My approach for 
the past 14 years. Another option is what critics say about my approach. They 
say we should stand firm on independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of choices, the United States has to decide about China's 
most-favored-nation status by June 3. As you know, last year President Bill 
Clinton made this renewal conditional on Beijing achieving progress in certain 
human-rights categories, including safeguarding of Tibet's culture and 
religion. Do you think the United States should continue MFN for China ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The decision taken by the President last year was perfect. This year, I 
have no particular suggestion. However, I do feel it is very important to take 
a decision according to the wishes of the Chinese -- those Chinese who are 
really carrying out the struggle for democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So Chinese advocates for democracy should decide an issue that also 
concerns your homeland?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I feel the Tibet issue is very much linked with the overall Chinese policy 
or situation. So long as the hard-line or authoritarian system remains there 
(in Beijing), frankly speaking, there is not much chance for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It has been five years since the suppression of China's "democracy spring." 
Reports from China now say apathy and the desire to grow rich seem to be 
replacing political consciousness. Who are you pinning your hopes on?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Usually, I make three categories among the Chinese. The top category is the 
leadership and the Communist Party. Their main concern is keeping power in 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The second group I consider the most important. That is the intellectuals and 
the thinkers and the students. These people in the last several years have 
really carried out a life-and-death struggle for democracy and freedom. This 
group is the force which ultimately will bring democracy in China. No one else. 
No outsider, not the United States, nobody, can bring democracy to China, 
except these people. 
</P>
<P>
 Then third, the Chinese masses. Their main concern is their daily livelihood. 
They may not be so concerned about democracy, but democracy is not much 
relevant in their day-to-day life. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the entire future of China, and, I think, particularly this region of 
the planet, is very much linked to (the second group's) spirit and their work. 
So if their spirit diminishes, that is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What of the argument that imposing economic sanctions on China is 
counterproductive because more two-way trade will foster greater democracy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: More economic prosperity ultimately affects political liberalization. That 
is logical. But in the meantime, there is a risk that the people in the second 
category get the impression that the outside world doesn't care about their 
struggle, that the outside world is content with the authoritarian regime in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside world is very much concerned about Russian authoritarianism, but 
Chinese authoritarianism seems to be OK. If that kind of impression develops 
among the Chinese democratic movement, I think it will be very, very harmful. 
If they feel more pressure in the economic field is more useful, more 
effective, in order to bring democracy in China and isolate these communist 
leaders in the public eye, then (the approach) should be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Once their spirit gets stronger, the democratic movement becomes stronger and 
political leaders will be compelled to carry out more liberalization. 
Liberalize China more, and I am 100% sure we can have a true discussion and 
find a proper solution to the Tibetan problem. There's no doubt. After all, I 
am not insisting on complete separation from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And what of your critics who say you aren't hard-line enough?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Quite often they say, "The Chinese know only force." It's not a 
generational matter. There are many, many elder Tibetans who think violence is 
the ultimate answer, too. Sometimes, perhaps, I think among the younger 
generation, there is more attraction toward Yasser Arafat or the moujahedeen in 
Afghanistan. They often tell me, "Oh, look at them. Through violence, there is 
more publicity, more support from the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And your reply?  
</P>
<P>
 A: First, my fundamental belief is that human nature lies in gentleness. Human 
nature is compassionate, is affectionate. Therefore, using violence is against 
human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, because of this factor, violence creates a lot of hurt in the human 
mind. Therefore, through violence, you may solve one problem. But you sow the 
seeds for another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there's our case. Tibetans and Chinese have to live side by side in the 
future. In the past, we lived like that. So in order to live in a friendly, 
peaceful and neighborly way, while we are carrying out this freedom struggle, 
we must pursue nonviolence, so that our struggle will not affect our long, long 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, I ask the hotheads, let them visualize this. If we follow violent 
methods, a few hundred guns will not be effective. At least we need several 
thousand, at least a few thousand . . . around 100,000. Now, from where will we 
get those weapons? Is there some country willing to supply us with them? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But are Tibetans benefiting from China's economic liberalization?  
</P>
<P>
 A: A few years ago, one European who spent some time in Tibet and knows 
something about economic theory told me, "In Tibet, there is certainly an 
economy, but it belongs to the Chinese, not the Tibetans." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, because of the Chinese population increasing, local people find even 
small manual jobs difficult to get. One part of the blame is the Tibetans' 
themselves. They cannot work as hard as Chinese people -- as tailors or 
carpenters. Even a Tibetan-style painting is now painted by some Chinese! The 
ordinary Tibetan finds it easier to ask a Chinese painter rather than a 
Tibetan. It's less costly, and you get the results quicker! 
</P>
<P>
 So you see, this gives an opportunity to the Chinese settler. Now that there's 
competition under the more liberal economic system, in many cases, the Tibetans 
cannot compete with the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned the influx of Chinese. Is it continuing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the name of more development, now the Chinese are demolishing the old 
part of Lhasa. According to our information, in 1959, old Lhasa was 
three-square kilometers in size. Now it's become smaller: one-square kilometer. 
Only that. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, according to our calculations, the Tibetan population (of 
Lhasa) was about 50,000, and the Chinese population around 100,000. Now, the 
mayor has stated the total population at 400,000. The Tibetan population is 
100,000, maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With this huge population disparity, can Tibetans survive as a distinct 
nation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Time is running out. In fact, I think the Chinese leaders are thinking 
exactly on these lines. To the outside world, they have stated they are open to 
dialogue with the Dalai Lama. But whenever we approach them, there's no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest policy is to completely suppress (the Tibetans), and in the 
meantime, to increase the Chinese population, so that in a few years time, the 
Tibetans become insignificant in their own land. Some of my friends call this 
the "Final Solution" of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So Tibet is doomed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I do believe that the international situation is now changing, and 
particularly, as I mentioned earlier, that there are democratic forces in China 
proper. So actually, the present Chinese government, the authoritarian regime, 
is in a state of transition. So I'm quite hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are somewhat of an expert on reincarnation. The Chinese leadership is 
of a certain age. On July 6, you turn 59. How do you see the future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the Chinese case, it's very difficult to predict. Even the Chinese 
themselves do not know what will happen. So I think they are very, very anxious 
about what will come after Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Tibetan case, I don't know. While I'm alive, I'll do my best. After my 
death, then other people, the new generation, will manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So there will be no 15th Dalai Lama? What's to stop Beijing or Tibetan 
communists from announcing that you have been reincarnated as a member of the 
Chinese Communist Party?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If something happened today to me or my life were to cease, if the Tibetan 
people want another reincarnation or want another Dalai Lama, then certainly my 
reincarnation, my rebirth will take place among Tibetans. And not among 
Chinese! Because the real purpose of reincarnation is continuing the previous 
life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 That means while we are outside (Tibet), if I pass away, then certainly if the 
Tibetan people want another reincarnation, they will find it among Tibetans, 
and not in Chinese hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But if death takes place at the time when we have already returned to Tibet, 
and there is some kind of freedom there, I have officially stated that the 
Tibetan people should decide whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should 
continue or not. If people feel there's not much relevant about this 
institution, then it will automatically cease. That's no problem.*

REMAKE CALIFORNIA'S UNWIELDY CONSTITUTION; IT'S FAR TOO LONG ABOUT FAR TOO 
MUCH; COMMISSION CAN GIVE US A FRESH START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some say California's current fiscal distress began in 1978 with the passage 
of Proposition 13, the constitutional limitation on local property tax. Others 
argue that Proposition 13 and its progeny -- including Proposition 4 (1979), 
limiting state expenditures, and Propositions 98 and 99, earmarking state 
revenues for education and anti-smoking efforts, respectively -- only 
exacerbated the inherent structural problems in the state's 115-year-old 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the reality is this: California's Constitution is now 
longer and more convoluted than those of the federal government and most other 
states. And the document has produced a government that, in practice, operates 
far too slowly and inefficiently. Too much state revenue is earmarked for 
special purposes. Too much constitutional law is enacted through voter 
initiatives pushed by special interests. And instead of reform, the 
Constitution's deficiencies have, over the years, spawned angry initiatives 
that appeased some but also deepened fiscal and governance problems. The 
California Constitution, adopted in 1879, is now much less a set of guiding 
principles than an overly detailed and increasingly cumbersome blueprint for 
day-to-day fiscal operation. 
</P>
<P>
 FRESH START: The first meetings of the California Constitutional Revision 
Commission this month could, and should, mark a turning point. The 23-member 
commission came into being through legislation sponsored by Sen. Lucy Killea 
(I-San Diego). Like many others, including this newspaper, Killea hopes that an 
independent, policy-savvy group whose recommendations are to be approved or 
rejected by the voters and the Legislature will be able to do what needs to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 Killea's legislation directs the commission to focus on four broad weaknesses 
in the Constitution: the state budgeting process, insufficient accountability, 
the ill-defined state/local relationship and poor delivery of community 
services. These priorities mean that virtually any and every governmental 
matter affecting Californians is on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-ranging group, whose members were appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson and 
the Legislature, will submit its recommendations for reform by August, 1995. It 
includes Democrats and Republicans, policy planners as well as politicians, 
judges and lawyers. This is only the third time Californians have taken such a 
systematic look at their Constitution since the state joined the Union in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will achieve the most, in our view, if it directs its work 
toward the following goals: 
</P>
<P>
 SIMPLIFICATION: The state Constitution has been amended hundreds of times. 
Each election -- this June's primary is no exception -- voters graft onto the 
Constitution policy changes that more appropriately would be enacted as 
statutory, more easily changeable law. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the commission should dramatically reform the initiative 
and amendment process to conform more to the federal model, under which such 
changes are rare, more difficult to make, pertain to broad governmental 
principles and are the result of overwhelming public consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 EFFICIENCY: Even the worthiest of bills crawls through legislative committees 
and oscillates between the Assembly and Senate before -- perhaps -- landing on 
the governor's desk. Killea is intrigued by the idea of a unicameral 
legislature, like Nebraska has. She also wants to explore replacing 
Sacramento's annual fight-to-the-death budget process with a more rational, 
fiscally responsible two-year budgeting cycle. Both of these ideas have 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 PREDICTABILITY: To fulfill their responsibilities, the three major local 
governmental units -- counties, cities and schools -- must have predictable, 
reliable revenue sources. Local governments must also have more connection both 
to the money they raise, through taxes and fees for example, and the money they 
spend. They have had neither predictable revenue nor control over it for some 
time. Changes in school financing, in particular, should be authorized with a 
simple majority vote instead of the high hurdle of two-thirds approval. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the state constitutional commission faces a tough task. But with the 
governor and Legislature suiting up for the coming budget battle, and voters 
beginning to pore over the complex June ballot, the need for reform that will 
benefit California in future years is manifest.

DARYL GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The action of U.S. District Chief Judge John Davies in dismissing former 
Chief Daryl Gates as a defendant in the Rodney King lawsuit (May 10) is an 
affirmation of a keystone ethical principle: An individual is responsible for 
his own actions. This responsibility is not relieved by poor leadership or 
circumstances, no matter political correctness of the left or right.Our 
democracy lives or dies on this principle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' expressed feeling of vindication is the instinctive reaction of a 
failed bureaucrat and leader. His failure to inspire the Los Angeles Police 
Department to the highest ideals in a vital but difficult role in society -- 
while not alleviating the individual police officers' responsibility for their 
own actions -- didn't help. Gates is no longer chief for a good reason; until 
he understands that, he cannot contribute to the healing of the world. 
</P>

 * Judge Davies feels that Gates should get off the hook unless King's 
attorneys can show that Gates himself got on the LAPD radio and told his men, 
"I directly order you to beat the stuffings out of that so-and-so after you 
catch him because he is such a rotten fellow." What a contrast with that famous 
sign on Harry Truman's desk, "The Buck Stops Here."

GNATCATCHER, HUMAN HABITATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Gnatcatcher Taken Off Threatened Species List" (May 3), I 
say Bravo! Pave it! Develop it! You missed a spot, there on the coast between 
Newport Beach and Laguna. Quick! Build houses, fence it off, plant palm trees, 
hide the view. Now quick, build a freeway across the hilltops, flatten it, mow 
it down. We will need it so that all those people who buy those new homes have 
a way to get there. Wow, just look at all that land south of Capistrano! Let's 
get started! 
</P>
<P>
 I was born, raised and have lived 38 years in California. I have 
systematically watched the paving of Southern California from Ventura to San 
Diego; from Lancaster to Indio. That is a very short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than redevelop the interior of our urban mass, we continue to destroy 
and develop the natural open lands that surround us. The threatened species 
here is not some bird. It is us, we humans that live side by side for hundreds 
of miles in an endless suburb without a break. It is nearly impossible to look 
at our coastline, a sunset, rolling hills, oak trees, the ocean, even little 
blue birds and the insects they catch, because of endless development. Get a 
clue to the real endangerment here. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUG E. ROBERTS 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I was struck by the irony when I read the front-page article regarding the 
fate of the gnatcatcher. It is being decided in court. The developers, perhaps 
correctly, state that the bird is not endangered. According to the scientific 
records, the gnatcatcher exists in Mexico and California. If we follow this 
logic, the developers argue that it is OK to destroy the gnatcatcher habitat in 
the United States because it exists elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Have any of the developers ever taken a walk in a wildlife preserve? Have they 
heard the quiet "mew" of the gnatcatcher? Have they observed all the other 
birds that exist in the coastal scrub and sage, the wren, the bush tit, the 
Say's phoebe? Have they asked us, the taxpayers, the residents, if we want to 
destroy the habitat of our native birds?  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has lived and grown up in Orange County has observed the change 
from paradise to concrete jungle. Let us preserve the last remnants of our 
natural environment. If it is the call to preserve the gnatcatcher, then so be 
it. But do not throw away, for the sake of profit, our native heritage.

VOTE 'YES' ON PROP. 180 IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Big Sur to Death Valley, California is blessed with great natural beauty. 
Historically this state's electorate has wisely voted to preserve some of that 
wonderful landscape by approving bonds to purchase or maintain state 
parklands.Another opportunity to do so is offered by Proposition 180, on the 
June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled the 1994 Parks and Wildlife Initiative, Proposition 180 authorizes up 
to $1.98 billion in general-obligation bonds for state parks. Although the 
measure allows purchase of some new parkland, most of it adjacent to existing 
parks and wildlife preserves, most of the money would go to maintenance. Due to 
the state's fiscal crisis, millions of dollars in maintenance for park 
infrastructure -- roads, campgrounds, bathrooms, tables -- has been deferred. 
The problem was compounded in 1990 when state voters for the first time 
defeated a park bond issue, largely because it was lost amid several 
controversial initiatives that also were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the popular facilities that will benefit if Proposition 180 passes are 
Griffith Park and Kenneth Hahn Park in Los Angeles, Vasquez Rocks Park near 
Santa Clarita, Chino Hills State Park in Orange County and Boney Ridge Park on 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the initiatives more appealing to urban voters, the initiative's 
authors included language that would allow cities like Los Angeles and Santa 
Ana to use some state park money for gang-prevention programs like the Los 
Angeles, Long Beach and Orange County Conservation Corps. Proposition 180 also 
sets aside some funds for the state museums in Los Angeles and other cities. To 
some voters this may give the proposition a "Christmas tree" look, but there is 
no denying the merit of the urban park programs that will benefit if 180 is 
approved. It deserves a "yes" vote.

RECORDING INJUSTICE IN CHIAPAS; GERTRUDE BLOM'S REMARKABLE PHOTOS GIVE EVIDENCE 
OF THE ROOTS OF THE STRIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtually all of the photographers whose work is displayed in the Armand 
Hammer Museum's exhibit "Mexico Through Foreign Eyes" -- among them some of the 
great names in the history of photography -- went to Mexico just to visit. One 
who went to stay is the extraordinary Swedish photographer Gertrude Blom, who 
devoted half a century to documenting the beauty and defending the rights of 
the Lacandon Indians of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Blom, who died last December at 93, never considered herself a professional 
photographer, but there is no more haunting photograph in this exhibit than her 
1959 portrait of Lacandon men standing traumatized on a tract of newly cleared 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lacandon, whom she met in the early 1940s when they were thriving in a 
still-virgin rain forest, have lost their home and their identity to the 
world's appetite for mahogany and beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Blom, an activist as well as a photographer, fought to save the forest and the 
Lacandon people alike from the loggers and the ranchers. But 1 million 
clear-cut acres later, when she was 82 years old, she told an interviewer: "I 
was a fighter all my life, but that's a sad story. The Nazis came; then we 
tried to avoid the war and the war came. I fought for the Lacandones and the 
forest, and that's lost too." 
</P>
<P>
 The violent uprising by the indigenous people of Chiapas against the Mexican 
government last January, still a mystery to U.S. observers despite the best 
efforts of the press, has everything to do with that loss; and for deep 
background on the revolt, Blom -- the founder of Na-Bolom, a Lacandon study 
center in San Bartolome de las Casas -- deserves rediscovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hammer Museum has performed a service by including her in its exhibit. Its 
bookstore has performed another by laying in a supply of available books on the 
exhibited photographers: Edward Weston, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, 
Andre Kertesz and Karl Lumholtz, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand: "Gertrude Blom Bearing Witness" (University of North Carolina 
Press, 1984), which includes a selection of her photographs as well as a 
bibliography of her writings.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: WHEN A CHARGE OVERWHELMS CIVIL LIBERTIES; THOMAS, 
PACKWOOD AND NOW CLINTON -- THE ULTRAFEMINISTS HAVE GONE TOO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer, former Times national correspondent, has 
written extensively on politics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The great line that fueled the witch hunt was "they just don't get it." Hack 
politicians who happened to be women could suddenly exude a history of wronged 
innocence as they demanded the head of Clarence Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
 Not "getting it" meant that you believe that everyone, including a man accused 
of sexual harassment, is innocent until proved guilty. Not "getting it" meant 
holding that there ought to be a reasonable statute of limitations on such 
charges. Not "getting it" meant believing that a complaint of sexual harassment 
should not automatically overwhelm judgment of the totality of a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, alleged feminists and others who had claimed a strong commitment to 
due process were suddenly willing to toss principle aside. Others, myself 
included, were simply cowed by the endless repetition of the historic crimes of 
a male-dominated society. Even the American Civil Liberties Union, with its 
proud history of defending due process in the most difficult of circumstances, 
copped out.  
</P>
<P>
 The result was to abet an increasingly irrational climate in which the very 
legitimate effort to reverse sexual discrimination and exploitation has been 
engulfed by an end-justifies-the-means hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if we are to be consistent, President Clinton must be sacrificed at this 
same altar.  
</P>
<P>
 It is insulting to our intelligence to suggest that the charges raised by 
these two women are dissimilar. Any honest person must concede that Paula Jones 
has as good a case as Anita Hill and that a presidential candidate should be 
held to a higher standard than a nominee to the Supreme Court. The only serious 
difference concerns the politics of the accused.  
</P>
<P>
 The trap is that a major error in judgment by liberals is now being compounded 
by conservatives. Both sets of charges were poorly documented, offered in a 
suspiciously untimely fashion and just not that important to judging a Supreme 
Court nominee or a President. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the ultrafeminists who pilloried Thomas will now, after some 
indecision, do the same to Clinton. We know this because of the shabby 
treatment of Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) by those who had long cheered his 
voting record on "women's issues." We know this because every profoundly felt 
social movement self-destructs when the purists get the upper hand. When that 
happens, the world comes to be divided between "us" and "them," and "they" are 
no longer guaranteed human rights because they are no longer perceived as fully 
human.  
</P>
<P>
 Do I exaggerate? How else to explain the venom unleashed on Clarence Thomas? A 
harsh critique of his legal opinions or limited judicial experience is one 
thing, but this man was personally vilified. Instead of being viewed as an 
imperfect person who nonetheless overcame great odds, he is even now, to many, 
the object of snickering and contempt; a thing, rather than an individual.  
</P>
<P>
 The same process of dehumanization is being applied to Clinton. It makes no 
difference that the smear campaign here is led mostly by men who probably spent 
more of their lives celebrating sexual harassment than combatting it. The point 
is that Clinton, like Thomas, is being denied any sense of a personal history 
that is complex, contradictory, but ultimately redemptive. Who among us, male 
or female, could not be similarly turned into a tin person to be contemptuously 
swept off the table of the honorable ones? 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the pure souls who have never in a private moment been racist, 
homophobic, ageist, insensitive to the disabled or exploited undocumented 
labor? How many politicians have not dramatically failed their children and 
spouses, how many journalists have ignored the needs of their parents? We are 
all of us exploiters; the real issue is whether we are capable of transcending 
those limitations and becoming something better. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone seriously believe that either Clinton or Thomas failed that test? 
No, they were attacked on the character issue precisely because they stood for 
and achieved a great deal that their opponents disapprove of. Instead of 
battling them on the firm grounds of their public actions and positions, the 
character issue was brought to the fore as a flanking motion around arguments 
that are more difficult to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time we recognize the character issue for what it is -- nothing more 
than the logical fallacy of the ad hominem argument. Our focus should be on 
public policy. If Clinton's relations with women led him to implement sexist 
policies, then produce the evidence. Perhaps it is too much to hope for, the 
common ground that Jesse Jackson is always preaching about. But at the very 
least, we should learn to fight fair.

PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA; FIX AMERICA'S CHINATOWNS FIRST; THE U.S. SHOULD EXAMINE 
ITS OWN HUMAN-RIGHTS RECORD BEFORE WIELDING IT AS A WEAPON IN DETERMINING TRADE 
STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL R. MILLER, Russell R. Miller is chairman of an insurance industry 
specialty investment bank. His family links to Asia include a governor general 
of Hong Kong; his grandfather was instrumental, at the turn of the century, in 
bringing peace to warring factions in San Francisco's Chinatown. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco is fast becoming the first large America city with an Asian 
majority. Its 35% Asian population by the end of the decade will exceed 50%. In 
the heart of San Francisco, on Vallejo Street, are three-story wooden-frame 
buildings occupied by elderly Americans of Chinese descent whose human rights 
are being violated every day. The fragile, elderly poor are packed into 
"standing room only" rooms, with a bed, bureau and a pole for hanging laundry. 
The tenants spend nearly all their income on rent. They have minimal health 
service. They fear leaving the buildings because of constant and unmerciful 
street crime. These people have unfulfilled human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a Californian, says that China will not 
have most-favored-nation status extended this summer until "it provides 
concrete assurances" in a number of human-rights areas. The Clinton 
Administration thinks it knows how 1.2 billion Chinese people should arrange 
themselves as a nation-state. They feel it is a moral imperative to hurt China 
if it doesn't embrace today's values of our 250-year-old republic. If you want 
to sell to us, you must meet our moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
 These arguments are reminiscent of the late 19th-Century traders from Western 
Europe and the United States who thought it was their right to force open the 
ports of China for their goods, which in those days included Indian poppies. 
Today, China is being forced to accept the new opium of misplaced values that 
has resulted in a society torn by guns, gangs and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Which moral standards should China emulate? Those that the California 
Legislature passed long ago as the Chinese Exclusion Act? Those that jailed our 
California citizens of Japanese descent during the war and confiscated their 
farms and homes? Those that allowed California miners to slaughter Asian 
railroad workers solely because they were beginning to prosper? And what do we 
say to their descendants who were discriminated against in the admission 
policies of the University of California? Are they the standards of the San 
Francisco school board that long ago forbade Asian students to sit in a 
classroom with Europeans or the same school system that 50 years later denied 
credit to the Chinese students unless they attended public schools instead of 
successful Chinese schools? 
</P>
<P>
 How would Americans have felt in the 1940s if China had set as a condition of 
being our ally in World War II that America had to desegregate the South, give 
equal opportunity to blacks and integrate the armed forces? How would the 
United States have responded in the '60s if China had placed as a condition for 
better relations that Martin Luther King be released from the Birmingham jail? 
</P>
<P>
 Premier Li Peng, meeting with Secretary Christopher, said, "China and the 
United States have different concepts regarding human rights." He said that the 
progress expected from a developed country will be different from that of a 
developing country. Western values place the individual as the keystone of 
society. Asian societies place the general welfare of its members above that of 
the individual. Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed put it succinctly 
when he said that it seems that America liberates the individual while 
imprisoning society. American values have failed in their eyes, so why insist 
on imposing them on others? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, has China done anything positive lately? It affirmed its support for the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights; opened talks with the International 
Committee of the Red Cross to allow access to Chinese prisons; gave the State 
Department an accounting of 235 prisoners; helped in ending the war in 
Cambodia; signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and, so far, has not 
obstructed the United States in its U.N. efforts to bring some rational 
behavior from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the Administration trying to change China, how about just 
Chinatown? Defend the human rights of the elderly on Vallejo Street by ensuring 
them a decent place to live, freedom from physical harm and an education system 
in which their grandchildren learn how to prosper rather than being shot dead 
by drug-numbed 15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to be very careful -- China may insist that we observe human rights 
for our own people or they won't trade with us.

THE STATE; WHAT RON UNZ TELLS US ABOUT PETE WILSON -- ROUGH SLEDDING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to 
Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Pete Wilson reelectable? 
</P>
<P>
 The question blares through the barrage of attacks directed at the governor by 
his Democratic rivals and by conservative Ron Unz, a 32-year- old entrepreneur 
who seemingly emerged out of nowhere to challenge Wilson in the GOP 
gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's all over, Unz may prove little more than a footnote. But right now, 
his campaign can shed some light on the perils Wilson might face in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Wilson's poll ratings were at a historic low, press and 
pundits began composing his political obituary. Then Wilson's fortunes 
reversed, aided by a positive perception of his response to the Northridge 
earthquake, slight movement in the state's turgid economy and what looked to be 
a clear path to the GOP nomination while the Democratic Party was in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Democratic rivals even allowed him to take control of the campaign 
agenda and maneuver the debate onto GOP-friendly turf: Voter anxiety over the 
economy was replaced by voter fear of crime. Front-runner Kathleen Brown, in 
particular, played right into Wilson's strategy, trying to out-tough ex-Marine 
Wilson on her weakest issue. That's when the governor began to look reelectable 
-- or, at least, not unelectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things changed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although national unemployment continued to decline last month, California's 
jobless rate jumped up. Seizing the state's apparent resistance to economic 
recovery, Brown began seriously challenging Wilson for issues control. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, intraparty harmony helped Wilson conserve campaign resources till the 
fall, when he went up against Dianne Feinstein, who had come off a bruising and 
expensive primary. Wilson eked out a narrow general-election victory. But with 
Unz in the race, he will not emerge from the primary unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, a self-styled "Reagan Republican," says he's running to replace a 
governor who is out of step with the party's "mainstream." Along the route of 
his quixotic journey, Unz has become the latest poster boy for the GOP right 
wing and an eclectic assortment of Wilson foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly visible around the Unz campaign are the GOP war horses who have been 
snubbed by Wilson over the years. Also in for a piece of the action are 
political operatives who have been shut out by the close-knit band of 
strategists -- derided by one GOP insider as "Pete Wilson, Incorporated" -- who 
have long guided Wilson's career. And speculation is widespread that the 
Christian right is using Unz as a stalking horse for their political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent a miracle or a major gaffe, the million dollars or so Unz has 
personally invested in his campaign thus far won't be nearly enough to knock 
off an incumbent in a statewide primary. Nonetheless, when the Democratic 
gubernatorial hopefuls file their next campaign finance disclosure reports, 
they ought to list Republican Unz as a major contributor. He has run the 
toughest Democratic campaign of them all against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz's radio and TV ads challenge Wilson's anti-crime credentials; they attack 
the governor for signing the record 1991 tax increase, claiming that the higher 
taxes deepened the state's recession and cost more jobs and businesses. Such 
criticisms would sound hollow coming from the mouths of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson supporters dismiss the Unz campaign as a minor nuisance perpetrated by 
a gaggle of malcontents. But Unz's candidacy shows that there is a personal 
element, as well as an ideological one, in the GOP opposition to Wilson. And 
the governor has to find a way to counteract both if he wants to prevail in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Los Angeles Times Poll taken in late March, Wilson was viewed unfavorably 
by 49% of registered voters. And 59% of independent voters, the group that will 
likely constitute the prime battleground this fall, were unfavorably impressed. 
Worse yet, 50% of the electorate and 57% of independents disapproved of 
Wilson's job performance. That's heavy baggage to carry into the general. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a basic political axiom that, when an incumbent runs for reelection, the 
race inevitably becomes a referendum on the incumbent. Ask former New Jersey 
Gov. Jim Florio. In the wake of a record tax increase, Democrat Florio's 
approval ratings plummeted to 18%. By shifting the debate away from the economy 
and taxes, and aided by some campaign blunders by GOP challenger Christine Todd 
Whitman, Florio almost won. 
</P>
<P>
 But as TV reporter Michael Aron explained in "Governor's Race," his chronicle 
of the 1993 Florio-Whitman race, "When people got into the privacy of the 
voting booth, personality came into play. . . . A politician who had generated 
enormous personal goodwill might have been able to survive the tax anger and 
the bad economy, but Florio generated respect in some quarters, admiration at 
best, and never love." 
</P>
<P>
 A California Republican similarly assesses Wilson's candidacy. "Pete's 
greatest failing," this analyst observed, "is that he doesn't have anybody who 
says 'I love Pete Wilson.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Is Wilson reelectable? The primary campaign has raised that question. The 
general election will answer it.*

MODERN-DAY BATTLE OF ALAMO BREWS IN TEXAS; HISTORY: THE TRADITIONALISTS SEE THE 
SHRINE AS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM AND BRAVERY. BUT REVISIONISTS SAY IT'S JUST A BIG 
LIE PERPETUATED BY A 'REDNECK CULTURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KELLEY SHANNON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're fighting at the Alamo again. This time, it's the legend that's under 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are the traditionalists who see the Alamo as an undeniable symbol 
of Texas pride and independence. On the other are the revisionists who see it 
as just a big lie perpetuated by a "redneck culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Reputations of longtime heroes like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, killed more 
than a century ago defending the fort, are under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the allegations seem downright blasphemous: Bowie took part in an 
elaborate slave-running scam. Crockett was a washed-up politician who didn't 
even wear a coonskin cap. William Barret Travis, the Alamo's commander, 
suffered from syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
 What in Sam Houston is going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's just kind of a general re-evaluation of the Alamo that is 
occurring, not just among Mexican-Americans but among other people," said 
Avelardo Valdez, a sociologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a century, the tale of the Alamo was the same: In 1836, fewer 
than 200 Texans fighting for independence defended a fortress against more than 
4,000 Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans won; all the Texans were killed. But their bravery was 
celebrated, and "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry when Texas fighters 
marched to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the cry is over how to remember the Alamo. Was it a heroic struggle for 
freedom or a ruthless display of imperialism and racism? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel that Mexican-Americans do not view the Alamo as something that 
symbolizes some kind of symbol of freedom or liberty. . . . I still believe 
they see it more as a symbol of racism," Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the Alamo -- and its reputation -- this time is the Daughters of the 
Republic of Texas, a group of mostly white women who trace their ancestors to 
when Texas was a nation, from 1836 to 1845. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has managed the site since the state entrusted it with the task in 
1905. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics scorn the group as an exclusive club. Valdez calls the Daughters 
representative of an archaic "redneck culture" that doesn't represent Texas' 
increasingly diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
 "This exclusive little clique has nevertheless succeeded in convincing many 
that their baseless mythology is fact," San Antonio Express-News columnist 
Carlos Guerra wrote. "As they see it, Texas history is about how freedom-loving 
Anglos came to Texas and brought civilization to the local savages." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra, Valdez and others want to force the Alamo's caretakers to show off a 
larger slice of the monument's multicultural history. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal would restore the Alamo and adjacent grounds as San Antonio de 
Valero, the Catholic mission established at the site by Spaniards in the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, city officials closed a street in front of the Alamo to keep tour 
buses from running over an area that is believed to be a mission-era graveyard 
holding the remains of 921 Native Americans and three dozen others. Upcoming 
Fiesta parades also have been rerouted. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions were taken over the strong protests of the Daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mission, but that's not what made it famous," said Arthur Cavazos, 
the group's spokesman. "It's a place where a small group of men decided to make 
their stand and fight for liberty until the death." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Bill Thornton, a mayoral hopeful and a vocal critic of the 
Alamo's status quo, contends that "there is absolutely no context of history" 
on the Alamo grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Alamo is big enough, the message from the Alamo is strong enough, for 
everyone to be included and everyone's voice to be heard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he's right. And maybe the battle is already making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Two tourist information signs recently appeared in front of the famous 
edifice. 
</P>
<P>
 One begins: "The Alamo has a long and diversified history."

COLORADO HEIGHTS HIT BY WAVE OF POPULATION; ROCKIES: LAND IS EXPENSIVE, 
SALARIES ARE LOW. MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE AND CANNOT AFFORD DAY 
CARE. COUNTY GOVERNMENTS END UP SUBSIDIZING BOTH, STRAINING THEIR BUDGETS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elegant epitaphs often grace tombstones in old mountain towns, but there are 
no tombstones here. The land is too expensive in this Rocky Mountain ski 
resort, and some worry headstones might spoil their view. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Minturn is the nearest resting place for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people can afford to live here, either. That has helped make the 
celebrated mining town of Leadville, 45 miles away, perhaps the world's highest 
bedroom community, at 10,200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe it's symptomatic of what's gone wrong in Colorado's high 
country, since the mining industry was replaced by tourism. Mining work was 
dangerous, but the companies paid well and provided health care and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of ski resort employees in Vail and Aspen drive at least 30 miles 
to find affordable housing. A starter log cabin 40 miles west of Vail in Gypsum 
goes for $134,000. At the same time, the median salary in Eagle County, where 
Vail is located, is $1,400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers don't have health insurance and cannot afford day care. County 
governments end up subsidizing both, straining their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the counties most heavily affected -- Pitkin, Garfield, Eagle, Lake 
and Summit, whose combined populations grew 33% in the last decade -- recently 
met and formed an alliance to address the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's solid economy, second only to Arizona, and perceived quality of 
life are drawing more people than at any time since the first resort boom. The 
state showed a net gain of 70,300 last year, the highest since 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash from the boom 20 years ago resulted in Coloradans rejecting a 
plan to play host to the Winter Olympics at an undeveloped site 10 miles west 
of Vail. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash didn't slow the boom, though. Vail Associates went ahead with 
plans to develop Beaver Creek into a major ski resort. Vail became the nation's 
biggest and busiest ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vail Associates President Andy Daly said Vail isn't the driving force in 
recent development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a social trend all over the United States, and particularly Los Angeles 
and New York," he said. "People are moving to rural areas for a better quality 
of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The population in Eagle County grew 60% between 1980 and 1990. Last year, 
building permits set a record. In March of this year, the county issued 112 
permits, compared with 48 in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen Skiing Co. President Bob Maynard said, "They can stop the growth in the 
city of Aspen. But it will be wall-to-wall people in Rifle and eventually in 
Grand Junction." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Junction and virtually Colorado's entire Western Slope are reporting an 
influx of people trying to escape urban areas. Many are from California, and 
some tag them the "New Okies." 
</P>
<P>
 Once-sleepy towns like Montrose are drawing small companies, whose owners and 
employees want a safer place for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials such as Eagle County Commissioner James E. Johnson Jr. are 
pushing the ski industry and other companies that benefit from tourism to help 
pay the social cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who did everything from waiting tables to maid's work when he first 
moved to the area, said skiing draws many to the high country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ferguson, who is retiring from the Carbondale Town Council just a few 
days before her 88th birthday, said, "People are leaving California and other 
places because they think this is the grandest place in the world. We have 
skiing, fishing, hunting and low taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Many fear the new arrivals bring their problems with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbondale, a bedroom community of Aspen, reported a 33% increase in serious 
crimes last year. Glenwood Springs Police Chief Rick Hollar is worried about 
signs of gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rat race is catching up with us," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-county alliance said the ski bums who once ran the lifts and cleaned 
the rooms are now being replaced by working families whose salaries do not 
match the high cost of living. In 1992, 45% of the births reported in the five 
counties were to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise that the counties turn to the big ski companies for help. The 
ski companies say they already pay more and offer better benefits than most 
other businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vail and Aspen companies subsidize transportation, day care and housing. 
The companies offer health care to employees who want to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 When the five counties announced their alliance, Vail Associates was quick to 
offer to discuss ways it could help. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the ski industry and associated businesses must "realize that in the 
long term this is going to come back and bite us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Lorig, an Eagle lawyer and 33-year resident, said growth itself is the 
main problem. "The county is going to be full of trailer homes," he said. "It's 
politically unacceptable to be against growth." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Telluride, another mountain town trying to control growth, Lorig 
said, "I liked it a lot better when I could take a gun and go out and not see 
anybody all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said county officials and others can try to manage growth and persuade 
developers that building near already established centers will be cheaper and 
better for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the big money dictates where it wants to build," he said. "If 
you've got enough money and want to live underground, you can do it and still 
have the sun rise for you."

RWANDA GORILLAS BELIEVED UNHURT

 Rwanda's rare mountain gorillas have remained unharmed despite a month of 
ethnic fighting in the Central African country, a conservationist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no fighting in the forest of the Volcanoes National Park, which is 
home to the primates popularized in the Hollywood movie "Gorillas in the Mist," 
said Jose Kalpers, coordinator of the International Gorilla Conservation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 There remain about 600 mountain gorillas in the world, about half of which 
range through volcanoes straddling Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire. The other half 
live in a park farther north in Uganda.

BUONICONTI WORKS HARD FOR HEALING OF SPINAL CORD INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the nine years since Marc Buoniconti sustained a spinal cord injury during 
a college football game, his father, Nick, has dedicated much of his life to 
his son's rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a commitment to Marc when he got hurt," said Nick Buoniconti, a former 
All-Pro and Pro Bowl linebacker with the Boston Patriots and Miami Dolphins. "I 
said money would not stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, every night, Marc dreams that he will walk again. And he will." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Buoniconti, who was a sophomore middle linebacker at the Citadel when he 
was injured in the game against East Tennessee State on Oct. 26, 1985, was left 
a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 To help his son reach his "impossible dream," Buoniconti co-founded the Miami 
Project to Cure Paralysis, an organization dedicated to spinal cord research. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, there was nothing in the country for people with spinal cord 
injuries," Buoniconti said. "When Marc got hurt, the Project was born out of 
necessity. Now, it's a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
 To fulfill the Project's mission of treating as many spinal cord injuries as 
possible, Buoniconti has launched a $30 million campaign to build a huge 
research facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting Buoniconti are some of the biggest names in business, sports and 
entertainment: NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue; former football star O.J. 
Simpson; former tennis star Chris Evert; Wayne Huizenga, chairman and CEO of 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and owner of the Florida Marlins, Florida 
Panthers and Miami Dolphins; Frank Biondi Jr., president and CEO of Viacom 
International Inc.; Phil Knight, chairman and CEO of Nike, Inc.; and singer 
Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people on the board are friends," Buoniconti said. "I told them what we 
need to accomplish, and they're going to help us do it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most enthusiastic supporters is Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she heard about it, she immediately wanted to be a part of it," 
Buoniconti said. "When she had her bus accident (in 1991) and was paralyzed for 
more than a month, she thought she would never walk again." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Buoniconti, 27, is not the only football player taking advantage of the 
Miami Project. Another is Mike Utley, the former Detroit Lions lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be at the Project for about the next four months," the elder 
Buoniconti said. "He's still a paraplegic, but I think he eventually will get 
on his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Another NFL player who sustained a paralyzing injury was former Patriots wide 
receiver Darryl Stingley, who was injured when hit by the Oakland Raiders' Jack 
Tatum in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl never has reached out," Buoniconti said. "He's never gone very public 
with his injury. Some people become introverted, unresponsive, bitter. They 
climb into themselves. Everybody deals with it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marc has been just the opposite. He's dealt with it publicly. He's taken 
spinal cord injuries out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga has been impressed with Marc's attitude and fortitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marc Buoniconti has inspired and given hope to people the world over with his 
courage, his spirit and his dedication," Huizenga said. "And he has inspired us 
as well -- inspired us to do our utmost to help the Miami Project transform 
that dream into reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $30 million, approximately $16 million is being earmarked for 
construction of a six-story, 83,000-square-foot facility, and $4 million will 
be used for equipment. The balance will be used to endow research programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking will be Oct. 26, 1995, the 10th anniversary of Marc 
Buoniconti's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Buoniconti and his wife, Terry, contributed the first $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are very mindful of the enormous costs of spinal cord injuries -- 
emotionally, physically and economically," Buoniconti said. "Spinal cord injury 
is a major national health concern, and this is why we are working diligently 
to develop a state-of-the-art facility that will speed the day when the Miami 
Project gives our country a cure for paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
 "To realize a cure, we must sustain the momentum achieved since 1985," said 
Dr. Barth Green, who co-founded the Miami Project. "A dedicated building will 
remove our current space constraints, and enable us to meet our emerging 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Buoniconti's progress has been slow but encouraging. He goes to the 
Project three times a week and works on a shoulder machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing something he thought he would never have to do: rebuild his upper 
body," his father said. "It takes him about an hour and a half for a normal 
10-minute workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way he'll have full function is if we can find a cure for paralysis. 
I feel positive that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety to 95% of spinal cord injuries happen to males under 25, and they are 
in wheelchairs for a long time. The cost to their families is astronomical. 
Something has to be done."

OFFERMAN DELIVERS IN BOTTOM OF NINTH; BASEBALL: ONE-OUT SINGLE BY SHORTSTOP 
GIVES DODGERS A 2-1 VICTORY OVER PADRES, EXTENDING THEIR WINNING STREAK TO FIVE 
GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ho-hum. Same old, same old. Death, taxes, and the Dodgers pouring out from the 
dugout for a celebration at home plate in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking steadily to the new routine, the Dodgers made all the right steps and 
kept to the beat to defeat the San Diego Padres, 2-1, Saturday night before a 
Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,137. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? Jim Gott earned the victory with one inning of relief, the 
Dodgers got another strong performance from a starting pitcher, and, with 
single runs in the seventh and ninth, the Dodgers racked up another one-run 
victory, their 12th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Jose Offerman dropped a soft line drive barely in front of diving 
center fielder Derek Bell with one out in the ninth, scoring Mitch Webster from 
third and giving the Dodgers their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to be up there like that because you know if you get a hit, 
it's going to be a good game for you," Offerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Dodgers' eighth consecutive one-run game -- they've won six -- and 
their 12th come-from-behind victory this season. They have 19 victories 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hard with a team as hot 
</P>
<P>
 as we are in the late innings," said Gott (5-1), who pitched the top of the 
ninth to earn the victory. "The story is how we continue to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 After Tim Wallach singled to lead off the ninth, Mitch Webster came in to 
pinch-run and was singled to third by Henry Rodriguez. With none out and 
runners on first and third, Padre Manager Jim Riggleman brought Bell in as a 
fifth infielder and Eric Karros grounded to first. 
</P>
<P>
 After an intentional walk to Raul Mondesi to load the bases, and with Bell 
back in center, Offerman got his 21st run batted in, fighting off a fastball 
from reliever Trevor Hoffman (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 But the key run, according to Manager Tom Lasorda, came in the seventh to tie 
the score, 1-1, when Dodger starter Orel Hershiser was struggling to keep his 
team in it and it looked as if Padre starter Andy Ashby might never slip up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried about when we were going to score that run," Lasorda said. 
"That guy, he couldn't have pitched a better game. He made such great pitches 
on (Mike) Piazza. He was that much off the outside corner, that much off the 
inside corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the seventh, Ashby had allowed only two Dodger baserunners -- a 
single by Offerman in the third and a Brett Butler groundball that shortstop 
Ricky Gutierrez could not handle for an error. Neither runner scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby retired the side in order in the first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth 
innings and struck out six batters through six with sweeping pitches that had 
the Dodgers' right-handed hitters lunging for balls out of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' only other threatening ball until the seventh was a sinking line 
drive into the right-field corner that was snared at shoe-top level by Tony 
Gwynn in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the seventh, after Piazza fouled out, consecutive singles by Wallach 
and Rodriguez gave the Dodgers their first serious scoring opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with two out, Mondesi fought off an inside fastball, broke his bat, and 
blooped a ball into left field for a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we tied it up, it was like we got a second chance," Offerman said. "When 
you get a second chance, you have to try hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Ashby) was good today. Everything he threw was good. He was good until the 
last two innings -- that's when we started to get hits." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, after some major struggles in the early going, Hershiser had settled 
down. He gave up three consecutive singles to open the game but didn't allow 
the Padres to score when he got a popout from Phil Plantier and a double-play 
ball from Scott Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a battle," said Hershiser, who pitched eight innings, giving up seven 
hits. "I struggled mechanically throughout the game, but I managed to battle 
and keep us in it. Compared to Ashby, who was just painting that outside 
corner, I didn't feel that way at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Tim Hyers singled, went to third on Tony Gwynn's ground-rule 
double over Butler's head in center field and scored on Livingstone's grounder 
to second, but Hershiser stranded Gwynn and Plantier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser was helped by another double play in the fourth, erasing Luis 
Lopez's single, and got away with walking the pitcher when Bell grounded hard 
to second to end the inning.

A 7-0 LEAD IS BLOWN BY ANGELS; BASEBALL: FAST START, FUELED BY SALMON'S HOME 
RUN IN THE SECOND, IS WASTED AS THE BULLPEN LETS THE MARINERS ESCAPE, 10-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Angels had the Seattle Mariners pinned to the Kingdome turf two innings 
into Saturday's 10-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 They had Seattle starter Greg Hibbard teetering on the brink of disaster after 
a five-run first inning. Then, they had a seven-run lead -- provided in part by 
Tim Salmon, who continued to terrorize opposing pitchers with a two-run homer 
in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, they had already dented the Mariner bullpen in Friday's 11-1 
rout. 
</P>
<P>
 But things aren't what them seem with these Angels. A seven-run lead slipped 
away by the eighth inning. It was the Angel bullpen, not the Mariners', that 
faltered and Salmon went hitless after his second-inning blast. 
</P>
<P>
 And an easy victory turned into a dreadful loss for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 They had good reason to lean on Salmon as they sought their fourth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 His second-inning blast over the 380-foot sign on the right-center field wall 
ran his streak of consecutive hits against the Mariners to eight, dating to 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his 14th hit in 16 at-bats, his fourth homer and 11th run batted in in 
the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Seattle made Salmon's heroics a moot point, tying the score in the 
eighth inning on a two-out run-scoring single by Jay Buhner and taking the lead 
on pinch-hitter Jerry Willard's three-run homer against reliever Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle reliever Bobby Ayala pitched a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out Dwight Smith 
to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mariner relievers held the Angels scoreless and hitless after Goose 
Gossage entered the game with two out in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of three innings, the Angels held a 7-4 lead and the question was 
this: 
</P>
<P>
 Were the starting pitchers that bad? Or were the hitters simply that hot? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was probably a little of both. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels jumped on Hibbard right from the start. Seattle waited a while to 
knock around the Angels' Mark Leiter. Hibbard outlasted Leiter, although that's 
not saying much. 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbard has been nothing short of a disappointment for the Mariners since 
signing as a free agent in January. They had hoped he would bolster a rotation 
that included 19-game winner Randy Johnson and still could be one of the 
American League's best. 
</P>
<P>
 But he went into Saturday with a 1-2 record and a 4.19 earned-run average in 
seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered little challenge to Angel batters before leaving after giving up 
seven runs and seven hits with six walks and two strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbard walked Salmon in the first, which rated as about the smartest move a 
Mariner pitcher had made in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he walked Chili Davis, gave up run-scoring singles by Bo Jackson and 
Chris Turner, walked Rex Hudler, hit Spike Owen in the backside and gave up a 
two-run single by Gary DiSarcina. 
</P>
<P>
 Angels 5, Mariners coming to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second, Salmon hammered a 2-and-1 pitch and the Angels led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, a seven-run lead would be cause for jubilation in the Angel 
dugout. But they quickly learned they had lost Davis for the rest of the game 
after he needed six stitches to close a wound below his left kneecap after a 
home-plate collision with catcher Dan Wilson in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is not expected to play today and will be examined when the Angels 
return to Anaheim on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter wasn't exactly providing good news when he was on the mound, giving up 
run-scoring singles by Tino Martinez and Wilson in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle then closed to 7-4 on Reggie Jefferson's two-run homer to center in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
 After a walk to Edgar Martinez, Rodgers replaced Leiter with Craig Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning later, Hibbard was gone, replaced by Gossage, a former hard-throwing 
closer reduced to a role as a middle reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts and Gossage restored some order to the game, keeping the opposition 
relatively quiet.

UNSER JR. BEATS THE RAIN, TAKES LEAD; INDY 500: HE AVERAGES 228.011 M.P.H. AS 
TEAMMATE FITTIPALDI, SEVEN OTHERS ARE FORCED TO WAIT UNTIL TODAY TO QUALIFY. 
</P>

<P>
 For a day at least, Al Unser Jr., in one of the Penske-Mercedes, is the 
fastest qualifier for the 78th Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser drove four laps Saturday at 228.011 m.p.h., but morning and afternoon 
showers that drenched Indianapolis Motor Speedway prevented the full field from 
receiving a qualifying attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending 500 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, Unser's teammate and the 
pre-qualifying favorite for the pole, was left sitting on pit row when the gun 
sounded at 6 p.m. to end the first day of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, Mario Andretti, Jimmy Vasser, Stefan Johansson and four other 
drivers will receive their chance at the pole when trials resume today. The 
pole winner is not decided until every driver has an opportunity to drive his 
four laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy that Al Jr. did a very strong run today," Fittipaldi said. "I was 
looking forward to going out because the car was fantastic in morning practice, 
but the weather didn't cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not really nervous or anxious about having to wait a day, but I think it 
will be very difficult to beat Al Jr. I just hope the track conditions are the 
same as today." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser had an unusual lap pattern, starting off with 225.722 before jumping up 
to 228.351, 228.525 and 229.481. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on that first lap, I was still spooked from the morning practice when 
I was going for a 229 and ran into rain," Unser said. "It was like looking down 
a double-barreled shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "During qualifying, when I saw the (first-lap) 225, I thought, 'Oh, man, I 
need to get going.' There weren't any radio communications, but I knew what 
Roger (Penske) would have said. I knew it was time to run as fast as I possibly 
could." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tracy, the third Penske driver who suffered a concussion when he crashed 
during practice Friday, might make a qualifying attempt today, but he is not 
eligible for the pole because he was unable to answer the call Saturday when 
his car's number was called. Tracy was released from the hospital and was at 
the track, but could not get a release to drive from Dr. Henry Bock, track 
medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one drivers, including seven rookies, posted qualifying speeds. Five of 
the 21, headed by second fastest Raul Boesel at 227.618, were from car owner 
Dick Simon's stable. 
</P>
<P>
 The two biggest surprises were the performances of rookie Jacques Villeneuve, 
who put his Reynard in the front row with a 226.259 m.p.h. run, and Lyn St. 
James, whose 224.154 put her in the middle of the second row -- ahead of PPG 
Cup Indy car champion Nigel Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really something to out-qualify Nigel," she said. "I know he's going to 
get razzed, but he has a great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 St. James shattered her own four-lap record of 220.150 and one-lap record of 
221.119. Her fastest single lap of 224.282 was her fourth as she picked up 
speed on every lap. By starting fifth, she also erases Janet Guthrie's 14th 
starting position in 1979 as the highest by a woman driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve shattered the rookie record of 222.313 set two years ago by Vasser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not expect to be this fast," the Canadian rookie said. Villeneuve is 
the son of the late Gilles Villeneuve, Canada's legendary Formula One driver. 
"Some things are retained from your parents. I hopefully retained the good 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 John Andretti made his first step toward an Indy 500-Coca Cola 600 double on 
May 29 when he qualified at 223.263, good enough for the middle of the third 
row. Andretti, who practiced here Thursday, flew to Sonoma, Calif., on Friday 
to qualify 38th for today's SaveMart 300 at Sears Point Raceway. After 
qualifying at Sears Point, he returned to Indianapolis for Saturday's effort 
and then turned around and returned to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some anxious moments today thinking about what if we don't 
qualify, but we were fortunate," Andretti said before heading for the airport. 
"There are times when you look at it and you wonder if you can see the end of 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti's plan is to drive in the Indy 500, then fly to Charlotte, N.C., to 
drive in a 600-mile Winston Cup race that night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disappointing day for Robby Gordon, Scott Brayton and Teo Fabi, all 
of whom had practiced at 226 m.p.h. or faster but could not find enough speed 
to qualify when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Honda drivers Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff both made the 33-car field 
-- at least temporarily -- both were also disappointed. Rahal, at 220.178, and 
Groff, at 218.808, are the two slowest qualified cars and are in danger of 
being bumped from the field in next weekend's qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal knows that feeling. Last year, as the reigning Indy car champion, he was 
bumped from the race on the final day of qualifying.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; CLARK'S GOALS FINISH OFF 
SHARKS FOR MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wendel Clark, shut down by the Chicago Blackhawks in the Toronto Maple Leafs' 
opening playoff series, took it out on the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scored twice and assisted on another goal in the seventh game of the 
playoff series Saturday, and outstanding goaltending by Felix Potvin helped 
give the Maple Leafs a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs advance to the Western Conference finals against Vancouver, 
beginning Monday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs, who sputtered for much of the series, put together their 
finest game to finish San Jose, the only team to make the playoffs with a 
losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, held to one goal and three points by Chicago, had seven goals and five 
assists against San Jose. He put the Maple Leafs ahead, 1-0, at 8:58 of the 
first period and scored again at 9:30 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Vancouver's Pavel Bure, with nine, has more goals in the playoffs that 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 With Potvin making several big saves, Toronto held a 2-0 lead after two 
periods despite a 26-11 deficit in shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Osborne and Doug Gilmour finished the scoring for Toronto, countered by 
Igor Larionov and a goal scored accidentally by Toronto in the game's last 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 In defeat, the Sharks drew a tribute from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys never died," Gilmour said of the Sharks. "They kept their 
composure and kept coming back at us." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been underdogs all year," defenseman Bob Rouse added. "You've got 
to give them a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Potvin: "I'm really happy not to have to play these guys again because 
they gave me a lot of trouble all series long. They've got an outstanding 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 Potvin finished with 29 saves.

PAMPERED THOROUGHBREDS ARE BOSSES IN THE BARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They walk where they want, when they want, because on the backside at race 
tracks, horses not humans have the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comin' through! Comin' through!" 
</P>
<P>
 A rider or trainer will call out the universal backside warning and just like 
that, the mass of media, owners, and other horsemen part like the Red Sea as a 
majestic thoroughbred strolls by. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the center of attention, pampered for good reason because this is 
their show. 
</P>
<P>
 Their heads are held high and they almost strut through the Churchill Downs 
barn area, heading for the track. They are bred for speed and they seem to know 
they're special. On the first Saturday in May, they truly are. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of them made it to the starting gate for the Kentucky Derby, 
surviving the treacherous trip from foal to colt. One misstep can end that 
journey in an instant, and so they are catered to, treated with patience and 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 They are morning creatures, accustomed to working early. And so the 
thoroughbred community congregates at 7 a.m., to work them and to watch them. 
This crop had some of the heavyweights of their sport looking after them. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Barn 41, Strodes Creek was led to the track by 81-year-old Charlie 
Whittingham, who's trained more than 600 stakes winners. Sharing the barn was 
Derby favorite Holy Bull, where trainer Jimmy Croll, 74, spoke Stengelese to 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Barn 45, Blumin Affair was watched over by Jack Van Berg, who's been 
saddling winners for 41 years. His face is leathery and lined from a lifetime 
of early mornings spent in the mist of the backside. 
</P>
<P>
 Down at Barn 44, Tabasco Cat was cared for by D. Wayne Lukas, led to graze 
peacefully on the grass, away from the mob. Lukas smiled when he was asked 
whether the throng of Derby week visitors disturbed the 3-year-olds. "The 
horses handle it better than the humans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooked by nobody knows exactly what, Tabasco Cat got loose in December and 
ran down Lukas' son, Jeff, nearly killing him. Jeff Lukas is still recovering 
from his injuries and his father gently held the reins of the horse that ran 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
 The backside is a great place for lies and lines. Listen long enough and you 
come away convinced that every horse not only can win but will win. Hunches are 
as prevalent as hot walkers. At Barn 45, co-owner Ronnie Lamarque carried a 
lucky bean in his pocket, blessed by a priest, he said, to ensure an easy trip 
for Kandaly. 
</P>
<P>
 The green-roofed barns at Churchill Downs are home to the horses, some of them 
expensive 3-year-olds who went to the starting gate for the Derby, some less 
well-known thoroughbreds. All are treated equally, catered to by their trainers 
and handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the stars of the show, treated with appropriate reverence by everyone 
around them. They are worked by exercise boys, who follow workout orders 
religiously, and clocked by trainers who refer to time fractions as "change," 
confounding those not familiar with racetrack jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 They are led by hot walkers who cater to their every need, feed them, bathe 
them, wrap them, live with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are never alone," assistant trainer Gary Aimonetti said. "There is 
always somebody with them, 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Aimonetti, who works for trainer Larry Edwards and has been at this business 
for 15 years, said, "Horses are curious creatures. I'm still finding out how 
much I don't know. If the horses could talk, training would be simpler." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughbreds are cooled out by the same hot walker every day, because they 
are creatures of habit and trainers aren't about to upset their routine. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems simple enough to keep them happy -- three meals a day, the first at 4 
a.m., a hot bath after their workout, a cool wrap for their slim, fragile legs 
and a quiet stall equipped with hay and alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers often keep goats and cats around the barns, too, because, well, 
because thoroughbreds like goats and cats. Nobody knows why. Nobody asks why. 
This is their show and if they want goats and cats, that's what they get.

GOLF ROUNDUP; FOUR SHARE DALLAS LEAD, BUT WEATHER WINS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Dallas thunderstorm and tornado forced suspension of second-round play late 
Saturday afternoon in the weather-plagued GTE Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw shared the lead with David Ogrin, Mark Carnevale and Brad Bryant 
at eight-under par when play was abandoned by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six members of the 156-man field completed second-round action. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players withdrew, and the other 147 marked their positions on two 
rain-soaked courses. Duke Butler, tournament director for the PGA Tour, said 
play will not resume before noon today, leaving two possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Play may be abandoned after 36 holes and the tournament ruled complete or a 
third round might be played Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," Crenshaw said. "If you're scheduled to play 36 holes in a day, 
you want to go ahead and play 36 holes. Nobody likes to start and stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw had an opening 66 on the par-70 Las Colinas course and was four under 
on the par-71 Cottonwood Valley layout with four holes to go when play was held 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Byrum, Neal Lancaster and David Edwards were at seven under par. Lancaster 
had six holes to go and Edwards five. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After lurking in the background for two rounds of the LPGA Championship at 
Wilmington, Del., Laura Davies finally made her move, shooting a two-under-par 
69 to share the lead with Meg Mallon after 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon, who finished second behind Davies last week, also had a 69 for a 211 
total. She led Davies by three strokes with six holes to go, but bogeyed Nos. 
13 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Ritzman, bidding for her first victory in 402 events, bogeyed No. 18 for 
a 71 that put her at 212, tied with Patty Sheehan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino shot a seven-under-par 65, which included a 29 on the front nine 
and constant trouble on the back, and shared the lead with DeWitt Weaver, Jimmy 
Powell and Jerry McGee at 135 after two rounds of the PaineWebber Invitational 
at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino is even par on the back nine and nine-under on the front for his two 
rounds.

NBA PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; UTAH PICKS, ROLLS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With one of basketball's most elementary plays, the pick and roll, the Utah 
Jazz rocked the Denver Nuggets, 111-109, in overtime Saturday at Denver to move 
within one game of the NBA Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek and John Stockton made baskets off the play in overtime to give 
the Jazz a 3-0 lead in the series, with Game 4 tonight at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornacek scored 27 points, Stockton 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone added 26 points and 13 rebounds for Utah, which extended its 
playoff winning streak to a club-record six games. Utah has beaten Denver in 
seven of eight games this season, including four victories in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the Jazz to victory in Game 2 by going directly at Denver's 
shot-blocking machine, Dikembe Mutombo, Malone suddenly turned playmaker in 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden our guards took over for us," Malone said. "I tell you what, 
when Hornacek and Stockton catch fire, we're awfully tough to beat. I just try 
to do the little things like set picks, and those guys hit some huge shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton said the pick and roll -- in which a forward or center sets a screen 
near the key to free a guard to roll to an open area if the defense doesn't 
switch assignments -- "obviously is a tough play to guard. Fortunately, the 
shots fell for us on those plays. A lot of attention was being paid to Karl, 
and that left somebody open. It happened to be Jeff, and it happened to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPhonso Ellis, who fouled out in overtime, led a late Nugget surge and 
finished with 25 points. Mutombo had 20 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 After regulation ended in a 98-98 tie, the teams exchanged baskets until 
Hornacek made a three-point shot with 1:35 to play for a 105-102 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ellis countered with a jump shot, Stockton made an 18-footer with 1:02 
left. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf cut the deficit to 107-106, but Stockton countered 
again with another 18-footer with 30.2 seconds remaining. Both of Stockton's 
baskets came on wide-open shots on the pick and roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Rauf's basket with 25.9 seconds left made the score 109-108, but 
Stockton made two free throws with 9.2 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone praised the Nuggets, the NBA's youngest team. "I think they're going to 
be the team of the future -- for sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a future that might not include playing against Malone, he indicated in 
an interview on NBC-TV. Not if the Jazz can win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . The only thing to keep me motivated to play the game now is an NBA 
championship," Malone said in an interview aired at halftime of the Atlanta 
Hawk-Indiana Pacer playoff game. "And if I won a ring this year, I have no 
reason to play anymore. . . . That is the only thing to keep me motivated. . . 
. There's a lot of other things in life I'd rather do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is not to win two titles, Malone said. "Absolutely not."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SMOLTZ GETS MAD, METS GET EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Mets' Ryan Thompson had broken a two-for-36 slump by hitting a 
grand slam in the fifth inning and decided to take a grand tour around the 
bases. His pace gave Atlanta pitcher John Smoltz time to do a slow burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he was going to go to their dugout and give everyone a 
high-five before he got to first base," Smoltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then John Cangelosi stepped to the plate. He said he wasn't expecting trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to be the only surprised person in Shea Stadium, then, when Smoltz 
plunked him in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do anything to him. Why take it out on me?" Cangelosi said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise when Cangelosi charged the mound, precipitating a 
bench-clearing brawl Saturday in the Mets' 11-4 victory over the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Innocent, Smoltz said in pleading his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent was to throw inside. This one happened to hit him," Smoltz said. 
"He was on top of the plate. The circumstances looked bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz and Cangelosi were ejected  
</P>
<P>
 It was a long day for the Braves, whose four-game winning streak ended, and 
for rookie left fielder Ryan Klesko, who botched plays on three consecutive 
batters for three unearned runs in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Hundley's fly ball bounced off Klesko's glove for an error and a run, he 
overthrew O'Brien at home plate on Joe Orsulak's single and stumbled on Bobby 
Bonilla's fly that glanced off the glove of Rafael Belliard for a double. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," one Met player suggested, "Smoltz should have thrown at Klesko." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Montreal 3 -- Ozzie Smith homered for the second game in a row 
and Mark Whiten hit a two-run homer as the Cardinals won at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, batting left-handed, homered to open a three-run fifth inning against 
Ken Hill (6-2) to put St. Louis ahead, 2-0. Smith homered from the right side 
Friday, his first since May 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gregg Jefferies walked, Whiten hit a towering homer to give the 
Cardinals a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- Lenny Dykstra scored twice, knocked in two 
runs and homered in a victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra, who had reached base in nine consecutive plate appearances before 
grounding out to second in the eighth inning, knocked in two runs with his 
fourth homer of the season in the third and then scored the winning run in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Chicago 4 -- Mark Gardner (1-0) gave up three hits in 6 1/3 innings 
in his first start of the season, and Kurt Abbott broke a 1-1 tie by tripling 
in two runs in the third inning for the Marlins at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Salomon Torres broke a personal seven-game 
winless streak, pitching 6 1/3 strong innings to lead the Giants at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres (1-2) allowed one run and seven hits and got out of bases-loaded 
situations in the first and fifth innings for the Giants, who have won three in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 4, Houston 2 -- Darryl Kile walked the first three batters of the 
game and Andres Galarraga singled to drive two of them home in the Rockies' 
victory at Houston.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES RALLY FOR 9TH VICTORY IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents had rallied in the ninth inning of New York's last two games, only 
to fall short. On Saturday, the Yankees went into the rally business, but they 
did it correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs' two-run double was the key to a five-run ninth inning that carried 
the Yankees past the Brewers, 6-2, at Milwaukee. It was New York's ninth 
victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, whose 25-10 record is baseball's best, have won 19 of their last 
23 games and are off to their best start since opening the 1958 season 25-9. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Cleveland Indians rallied for three runs with two out in the 
ninth inning to tie the score before the Yankees won in 10 innings. On Friday, 
the Brewers scored three times in the ninth only to lose to New York in 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, those two games taught the Yankees something. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't say, 'quit.' We know that until the last out is made, we have a 
chance," said Danny Tartabull, who hit a two-run single in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Yankees trailing, 2-1, Bernie Williams and Darryl Boston were walked 
by Bob Scanlan (0-2). With one out, Luis Polonia singled to load the bases, and 
Boggs followed with a ground-rule double over the wall in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly was intentionally walked to re-load the bases, and Tartabull hit 
a two-run single to make it 5-2. Paul O'Neill, who has hit safely in 11 
consecutive games, singled in the inning's fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-game winning streak has put a little pressure on the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling," Tartabull said. "Every day you come out to win that 
particular day. It feels good when you do. This game is not going to allow you 
to do that every night. But we're going to keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Donn Pall (1-2), who relieved Jim Abbott in the seventh inning, picked up the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 9, Detroit 3 -- Jack Morris won for the first time since April 7, 
striking out nine in six innings at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris (2-4) stopped his personal four-game losing streak and gave up two 
runs. He was relieved by Jose Mesa and rookie Paul Shuey, who struck out four 
in the ninth inning -- Travis Fryman struck out but reached on a wild pitch. 
Indian pitchers struck out 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland rookie Manny Ramirez hit a three-run home run and Eddie Murray and 
Alvaro Espinoza drove in two runs each. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 11, Toronto 2 -- Andre Dawson hit two two-run homers in the Red Sox's 
victory at Boston, their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto has lost 14 of 19, including all five on a trip that ends tonight at 
Fenway Park, where the Red Sox are 16-4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Darwin (6-2) had a season-high eight strikeouts and allowed two runs and 
10 hits in seven innings in his fourth victory in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Baltimore 5 -- Dave Winfield homered twice and drove in five 
runs, moving past Frank Robinson into 12th place on baseball's all-time RBI 
list and carrying the Twins in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield, who has 30 two-homer games, has 1,813 RBIs -- one more than 
Robinson, now Baltimore's assistant general manager. Winfield also has 1,071 
extra-base hits, tied with Mel Ott for 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Erickson (4-4) gave up eight hits and had a career-high 10 strikeouts in 
7 2/3 innings, giving him his first two-game winning streak since September 
1992. Carl Willis got the last out for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 5, Kansas City 4 -- Stan Javier homered and the Athletics, despite 
hitting into the first triple play of the season, won at Kansas City for only 
their third victory in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third inning, Royal third baseman Gary Gaetti started a triple play on 
a grounder by Geronimo Berroa with two on base, stepping on third and throwing 
to second baseman Terry Shumpert, whose relay to first beat Berroa. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetti has participated in seven triple plays in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 5, Chicago 2 -- Jose Canseco drove in two runs and Kevin Brown pitched 
seven strong innings to lead the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (3-6) allowed one run on nine hits and two walks with five strikeouts.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; SAMPRAS, BECKER IN IMPROBABLE ITALIAN FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras and Boris Becker in a clay-court final? Improbable, but true. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras has won only one minor clay-court event in his career. Becker has 
never won a title on clay. One will erase that blemish on his career today 
because each advanced Saturday to the championship match of the Italian Open, a 
clay-court event in Rome that serves as the main tuneup for the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Sampras extended his match winning streak to 26 by routing unseeded 
Slava Dosedel, 6-1, 6-2, in barely more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-seeded Becker outplayed No. 4 Goran Ivanisevic, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), to 
reach his first clay-court final in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian Open used to be a haven for Latin American and European clay-court 
specialists, but the red clay has been speeded up to benefit serve-and-volley 
and all-court players, such as Sampras and Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions are very quick," Sampras said. "That's good for Boris and me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the world's top-ranked player and winner of the last three Grand Slam 
tournaments, has grown in confidence with each match in his first clay-court 
event of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the man to beat right now," Becker said. "He's beating everybody. It 
doesn't matter whether it's indoors, outdoors, on hard courts or clay. I have 
to expect the worse and hope for the best. But there's definitely a way to beat 
him. He's no superman." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras leads Becker, 4-3, in head-to-head meetings, but the two have never 
played each other on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said he has discovered the way to win on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played very good clay-court specialists this week," he said. "I didn't 
have to serve 20 aces each game to win. I won with smart tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 That meant steady, unspectacular play that showed patience and wore down 
Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 6-2, 3-0, he didn't have a clue what was going on," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf passed the $14-million mark in prize money and reached the final 
of the German Open at Berlin by sweeping past third-seeded Jana Novotna, 6-2, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Graf, a seven-time German Open champion, faces Brenda Schultz, 
who ousted Anke Huber, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, behind a powerful serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I was just more concentrated and felt better," Graf said, acknowledging 
erratic play that had plagued her during a quarterfinal match against Julie 
Halard in which Graf was two points from losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz, ranked 27th in the world, reached the final of a major tournament for 
the first this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing on a slow surface at Coral Springs, Fla., sixth-seeded Luiz 
Mattar of Brazil used his serving prowess to move into the final of America's 
Red Clay Tennis Championships with a 6-4, 6-4, victory over Mark Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, Woodforde had defeated Mattar, 6-1, 6-1, on clay at Pinehurst, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second final of the year, and his first on clay in a nine-year career, 
Mattar, 30, will play seventh-seeded Jamie Morgan of Australia, a 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 
(9-7) winner over Fernando Meligeni. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Maggie Simkova of USC upset third-seeded Angela Lettiere of Georgia, 6-3, 6-4, 
but Georgia defeated the Trojans, 5-2, to reach the quarterfinals of the team 
competition in the NCAA women's tennis tournament at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida defeated UCLA, 5-2.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: FASHIONING STRANGE TRUTHS ABOUT CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What does it mean when fashion designers in 1994 seriously propose to put 
American women in baby-doll dresses?  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how it pains me to say this, but probably nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 After many years of looking for unconscious motives on the part of designers, 
I realize I've been interpreting fashion all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when it seemed appropriate to place current styles in some 
sort of cultural context: miniskirts as a symbol of the sexual rebellion; 
Amazon-shouldered suits as a response to the increasing presence of women in 
male-dominated professional ranks; the rage for lingerie as a response to 
masculinization; the current crop of apron-inspired dresses as a compromise 
between the kitchen and the office. 
</P>
<P>
 But I've seen the light. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that fashion doesn't serve as a fun-house mirror, horrifying or 
thrilling us with its distorted reflection of the social trends passing through 
the carny of life. It's just that trying to analyze why is pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 If you really want to impress your friends, I suppose you could talk about the 
boom in baby-doll dresses as a reflection of society's insatiable need to 
infantilize women, especially now that they're getting too big for their 
britches in the professional realm. (Take that, Hillary!) 
</P>
<P>
 But the only meaningful reason fashion zips like a psychotic pinball from 
big-shouldered suits to baby-doll dresses is to stimulate consumer interest 
and, of course, sales. You can lather on all the socio-blather you want over 
the fact that designers are pushing women to look like overgrown Raggedy Anns. 
Or Barbarella-esque bimbos. Or little lost waifs. It doesn't matter at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the designers are in their showrooms even now, presenting their next 
collections to buyers, convinced beyond a doubt that the time just feels right 
for a revival of the longer "Queen Elizabeth" hemlines. And God save us, too. 
</P>
<P>
 I've thought about this a lot, because I used to cover fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 At a newspaper, this is a difficult job, and one that keeps you continually on 
the defensive. For many journalists, the idea that fashion is part of the 
terrain of real news -- land of brush fires, wars and interest rates -- is as 
upsetting as the idea that some readers buy the paper only for the horoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must feel very empty inside," a smug news photographer once told me after 
I had begun writing about fashion. "You've gone from covering things that 
matter to . . . this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," I replied, as my cheeks got hot. "I feel especially empty on those 
sunny Paris mornings I sit in a Left Bank cafe sipping coffee before heading 
off to the Chanel show." 
</P>
<P>
 Punk. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, covering the shows in Paris and Milan is probably the closest many 
reporters will ever come to warfare. You have to fight, beg and weep for 
tickets to get into half of them. Then you have to fight, beg and weep just to 
find a seat. I've seen photographers come to blows over their places. I've been 
reduced to tears many times. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, you give up trying to explain to your "serious" colleagues why 
fashion is important -- what a huge employer the industry is, how many billions 
of dollars it generates and why even a smug photographer changes the width of 
his tie every few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely by getting dressed every day, everyone participates in the fashion 
industry. There is no such thing as anti-fashion. Just ask Seattle grungers. 
Their plaid flannel shirts and ripped jeans were co-opted by designers a few 
seasons back, who made a killing on the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion world always comes as a shock to the neophyte. I saw my first show 
in 1986. In a ritzy Los Angeles hotel, models strolled around looking like 
players in an Edwardian drama. Their narrow shoulders and tiny waists were 
accentuated by bustles, their legs hobbled by slim skirts as they minced around 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer of these silly dresses, a French unknown, was soon hailed as the 
new king of fashion. Christian Lacroix enjoyed several seasons in the 
limelight, producing clothes that went further and further down the gangplank 
of creativity before finally going off the deep end somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was hot, though, society women were dressing like they had just 
stepped out of a commedia dell'arte , or maybe Gilbert and Sullivan. These were 
costumes, not clothes. On the street -- even at the charity balls -- Lacroix's 
women looked ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 My job, I believed, was to explain What It Meant. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course, as lovely as they were, I could only think that these clothes 
were simply a way of turning back the clock on women's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 I noted that one of Lacroix's stylistic signatures, a wide collar that enfolds 
bare shoulders like a stole, was rather restrictive. Grasping for Deeper 
Meaning, I interpreted this as a subtle attempt to keep women in their place, 
to keep them from -- oh, I don't know -- raising their hands to vote? 
</P>
<P>
 Now I see I was wrong. Now I see that particular collar as merely a lovely way 
to accentuate the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I see -- to paraphrase Freud -- that sometimes a collar is just a collar.

GUILT KEEPS A FOOT IN BYGONE REGRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Feeling Guilty Can Be Good" (May 2): I do not think instilling guilt does 
any good whatsoever, especially in the young. Occasionally I recall some piece 
of cruelty inflicted by me as a young immature person.I could wallow in guilt, 
but I don't. The past is past and I can not change it or atone for it by word 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
 I simply recognize that I was certainly doing the best I could at that 
immature stage in dealing with the host of problems that confront youth and 
dismiss it from my mind as a natural event that happens to all sometimes.  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly everyone experiences the feeling of regret. Guilt, no.

<P>
 In response to the article praising the beneficial qualities of guilt, let me 
just say that, yes, perhaps guilt can be viewed as a good thing by some people 
-- as, similarly, people are benefited by believing in demons. One's sense of 
guilt is built on the metaphysical premise that one could have acted 
differently from the way one actually acted. Such a premise can only be taken 
as true by an act of faith, for there are no means to recreate an event as to 
time, place and circumstance, to determine whether there could have been a 
different outcome. More simply stated: What's done is done, and no one can 
prove that things could have been done otherwise.

DRIVE-IN MEMORIES TOO COOL TO CURB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "When We Loved to Curb Our Appetites" (Around Town, April 29): In addition 
to the drive-ins mentioned, growing up in West Los Angeles in the 1940s, '50s 
or '60s meant being able to cruise Delores' Drive-In. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering into a speaker box those "Suzi-Qs" (stringy French fries) or a "J.J." 
(Jumbo-Jim hamburger) with extra "Z" sauce and a cherry Coke and having the 
carhop bring your order on a tray and affix it to your car window was all a 
phenomenon never again to be recreated.All gone the way of my 1960 Chevrolet 
Impala convertible, but so cool they will never be forgotten.

 "When We Loved to Curb Our Appetites" brought back wonderful memories.  
</P>
<P>
 However, I would like to set something straight: Not everything was fried. 
There was a drive-in in the area of the Sunset Strip in the early '40s where 
one could buy a juicy charcoal broiled hamburger for $1.25 with lettuce and 
tomato and choice of ketchup or mustard. I don't recall the name, but the 
hamburgers there were the best to be had in L.A. in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I recall a drive-in on the southwest corner of Rodeo and La Brea, where 
most of the USC students met after classes. The carhops were beautiful, you 
could eat with your windows rolled all the way down, the food was healthy, the 
air was clean. No smog and no crime. Those were the days.

PEDIATRICALLY ENRAGED MOMS KICK BRAZELTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to Robin Abcarian's article, "Brazelton Gives Care That's 
Pediatrically Correct" (April 24). 
</P>
<P>
 As a stay-at-home mother of a 2-year-old, I found this article 
enraging.Abcarian sang the praises of T. Berry Brazelton because of his views 
on women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had her daughter sit on his lap because " . . . pediatrically 
speaking, you just don't get closer to God than that." Her article adopts the 
tone that all women subscribe to the feminist agenda. Just so you know, this 
reader thinks moms and babies belong together if at all possible, and it may be 
possible more than we care to admit. And while it may be music to your ears 
that Dr. Brazelton's mom performed abortions, it is just death to mine.

<P>
 While I respect Dr. Brazelton's popularity and sincerity, he is absolutely not 
the definitive voice in childhood development. 
</P>

 His position that children do not suffer from a parent not at home is at odds 
with the Carnegie Corp. study that he touted in the article. I have always been 
dismayed by his need to psychoanalyze and generalize. Burton White and William 
Sears are two other Harvard-educated experts in the field of childhood 
development whose philosophies provide more coherence to many parents than 
those of Dr. Brazelton. I do not mean to say that Dr. Brazelton is undeserving 
of praise or his popularity. But as a mother, former teacher and student of 
childhood development I cannot allow Abcarian to say, "T. Berry Brazelton: 
every mother's dream date." It just isn't so.

GALLERY: UNDYING BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wildfires have been quelled. Last autumn, they scorched the canyons and 
neighborhoods of Laguna Beach, threatening the seaside community's idyllic 
beauty.But Laguna Beach survives. It is a place deeply committed to preserving 
and protecting nature, freedom and art. The spirit of the community is evoked 
in the ocean, crashing to shore around rocky tide pools and on smooth beaches. 
It's in the hikers who share trails with nature, and the families who thrive in 
hillside homes. It's in the sun that dissolves behind Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Laguna Beach is a place that can singed but not destroyed. Maybe with 
its serenity and simplicity, it is a magical place, one that exists in the 
timeless peace we knew better as children.

UP ALL NIGHT: HORSING AROUND; AT HOME ON THE TRAIL? THEN SADDLE UP FOR AN 
EVENING OF SIGHTS, FOOD AND DRINK.

 The clouds look bruised and weepy where they're not shot through with golden 
evening sun. The sky breaks blue to the south. The air is moist with the scent 
of rosemary and sage, and wildflowers dot the scrub that tumbles down the 
hillside. A line of horses picks its way along the winding trail to the crest 
of the hill. Los Angeles sprawls below, a jumble of sharp, crystalline forms 
caught at an angle by the waning light. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the scene at 6:30 p.m. on a recent Friday, half an hour after the 
moonlight trail ride set out from Sunset Ranch, a couple of cozy red barns and 
corrals nestled in the foothills at the top of Beachwood Drive. The trail takes 
riders through Griffith Park, over the hill and down into Burbank for dinner at 
Viva Mexican Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge, then back to the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty riders, mostly locals made up of couples and small groups of friends, 
stop to take photographs of the view and each other. For many, this is the 
first time on a horse. The stable hands have gone to great pains to match 
riders to horses that suit their ability and would not set out until all had 
learned their horses' names. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride to Viva in Burbank takes 1 1/2 hours. The experience of living 
without the automobile, even for a day, is heady stuff for any Angeleno, a 
feeling of power bordering on the sublime. The city below seems more intimate, 
more accessible than it did seen through the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the trail turns down into the valley, under dramatic cloud play. A hawk 
watches from a naked branch. The group sights an owl, a jack rabbit, some 
teen-agers kissing in the bushes. Eventually, three tunnels cross under the 
Ventura Freeway, and a narrow wooden bridge takes six horses at a time over the 
Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it's a short distance to Viva, where the riders tie their horses 
to the hitching post and head in for a leisurely candlelight dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Viva is a sprawling hacienda, the kind of place where you wouldn't feel 
foolish getting down on one knee to propose to your sweetheart, but also a 
place where it's OK to walk in fresh from the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime friends Sherry and Rick Miller and Nicole Rodriquez of San Pedro have 
brought Joe Gasparav on the trail ride to celebrate his 28th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was perfect that it rained beforehand, and the clouds were separating, and 
the light was coming down on L.A.," Rodriquez says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like we were miles and miles from home," Sherry Miller says, "yet 
it was a short drive. It's funny to be on the freeway, and then all of a sudden 
to be up in the hills, on horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the restaurant again, it immediately becomes clear why you had to 
learn your horse's name. The group is a little bit looped after one or two of 
Viva's excellent margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, somebody moved Elvis," one rider calls out in the dark. "Who's got 
Elvis?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Wahooo!" another cries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something tells me the ride back is going to be funner," a young woman 
remarks serenely, watching the dim figures in the moonlight grappling for 
stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 The guides recognize all the horses from the back, in the dark, which is 
fortunate and amazing. Soon the party is on the trail again, a little looser, a 
little merrier -- and a little saddle sore. The uphill trek back to the ranch 
takes a little longer than the ride down.  
</P>
<P>
 After a few rounds of "Home on the Range," everyone settles down into a quiet, 
meditative mood as the horses head for home. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a brief moment of excitement when one horse bolts on a flat stretch, 
but the guides quickly give chase and rescue horse and rider without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 When the horses finally file into the ranch at midnight, all is silent, save 
for the occasional wince and groan from the novice riders. And there's the rub: 
This journey makes for a wildly romantic evening, one surely not to be missed 
-- but it's probably best to plan on going to bed alone with a hot water 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Sunset Ranch, 3400 N. Beachwood Drive, in Griffith Park; (213) 
464-9612 or (213) 469-5450. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Fridays, 6-11 p.m. (Arrive between 5 and 5:30 to register and get your 
horse, and plan on returning as late as midnight.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost: Trail ride: $30. Tips appreciated. At Viva Mexican Restaurant, 
margaritas are $3.25-$10.95 (12 ounces to 46 ounces), dinners $5.75 to $9.95.

 Green Yellow Pages: You know that commercial for a brand of yellow pages where 
the announcer challenges people on the street to find something not in the 
book? 
</P>
<P>
 He's finally met his match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Resource Directory of Greater Los Angeles bills itself as "the 
Healthy Yellow Pages" and features such listings as "Aura & Chakra Clearing & 
Restructuring," "Brain Integration," "Psychic Healing," "Shamanism" and -- our 
personal favorite -- "Exorcism." Don't think we've seen that in any regular 
yellow pages recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The directory has its share of mundane headings, such as "Crafts, "Lighting" 
and "Janitorial Services," but everything has a natural, eco-friendly twist. A 
pet care shop offers "holistic preparations" and all-natural foods for your 
pooch or kitty. And a business consulting firm assures: "We design & spec all 
our jobs with the environment in mind."

where was the rigid plastic that makes Barbie . . . Barbie?  
</P>
<P>
 How can Barbie tool down to Malibu in her convertible when she's as flaccid as 
a wet noodle? How can she dance at the ball if her legs look atrophied?

 This Barbie is no role model, we said. Even Glitter Barbie, with her

23:

<P>
 Your report covers a lot of territory on the post-earthquake residential 
rental market. However, your passing reference to the Section 8 rental 
assistance program for low-income families requires clarification.The article 
reports that 15,000 Section 8 certificates have not been used and government 
officials cannot explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 This statement was news to us, the agency administering the Section 8 
Certificate Earthquake Emergency Housing Program. The Housing Authority of Los 
Angeles has issued about 15,700 certificates to date. Over 9,500 of these 
certificates have, in fact, been used to house families displaced by the 
earthquake. The 18-month Section 8 certificates were made available by U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros, who 
recognized that low-income households faced many impediments in seeking decent 
affordable replacement housing as a result of the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros further recognized that some low-income families would need 
additional help in locating units. Large families, people with disabilities, 
and applicants with bad credit histories are being helped by nonprofit 
organizations with experience in relocation and negotiating with landlords on 
behalf of poor families. The nonprofits are making it possible for over 80% of 
the eligible households issued emergency Section 8 certificates to obtain 
decent, affordable housing.

 In response to "Deadly Reality: Rwanda Is Dying," editorial, on May 4:  
</P>
<P>
 I was one of more than 200 Americans evacuated from Rwanda on April 10. Since 
my return to the United States, I have followed with deep anguish the tragedy 
that continues to unfold in Rwanda.I was privileged to work with many Rwandans 
who were faithful and loyal employees of the U.S. Mission in Rwanda for 
numerous years. Almost without exception among the Rwandans I met, the United 
States is revered and honored as the last real hope that is able to lead the 
struggling African countries to democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the U.N. Security Council, the United States should take the 
diplomatic and financial lead to return international peacekeeping troops to 
Rwanda. The international force should have the legal mandate and the military 
power to establish safety zones for endangered civilians and to protect 
humanitarian assistance efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of innocent civilians are being held captive, many without food and 
water, under deplorable conditions. Hundreds of thousands have already died; 
hundreds of thousands more are at risk of dying; every hour that passes brings 
reports of hundreds of more innocent people dying. Speed is of the essence.

SUMMER SNEAKS '94; YOU CAN'T HIDE HIS LION EYES; IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT 
DISNEY'S LATEST JUNGLE VILLAIN BEARS A WICKED RESEMBLANCE TO JEREMY IRONS; JUST 
ASK THE ANIMATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Those lips. Those eyes. That dry English disdain. It may be a mane instead of 
a hairline that's receding, but the ironic lion who is the standout villain in 
this summer's Disney extravaganza is still a dead ringer for Jeremy Irons, in 
voice and in subtly animated facial caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 As the scheming, murderous Scar, who'll stop at nothing in his quest to steal 
the throne of the animal kingdom, Irons is all claws . . . Claus von Bulow, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Irons' frosty turn in "The Lion King" obviously isn't the first time the 
studio has used a celebrity voice for a major role, but it's not often a 
primarily dramatic actor has stepped back to the drawing board, as it were, so 
soon after winning an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney didn't waste the opportunity. Not only was Scar's character design 
modified to appropriate some of the actor's facial characteristics in nearly 
imperceptible ways, but the very role was retooled to better incorporate the 
insinuating sarcasm Irons dripped so eloquentlyin "Reversal of Fortune," the 
picture he won the Oscar for.  
</P>
<P>
 For grown-ups paying attention, there's even an amusing allusion in "Lion 
King" to one of Irons' signature quips in the earlier film. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, his Von Bulow was a character whose vaguely sinister quality 
remained ambiguous. (How strange was he? "You have no idea," you'll remember.) 
But his Scar is a more clear-cut threat: The bad cat did indisputably kill one 
of his closest relatives, does pose a clear and present danger to the entire 
food chain, and might deter even Alan Dershowitz from rising to his defense 
after bragging in the midst of a big, predatory musical production number that 
"my teeth and ambition are bared -- be prepared!" 
</P>
<P>
 A star is born. . . . Scoot over, Cruella. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King," which opens at the El Capitan June 15 and goes wider a week 
later, is Disney's 32nd full-length animated feature. Unlike the last few, 
there's no heavy romantic element, so the bad guy's prominence in driving the 
plot becomes even more significant. And as the latest and not least in a 
six-decade-long line of classic Disney villains, Scar naturally spends a lot of 
screen time stealing the show from his moral betters; like most of the more 
recent animated baddies, this power-mad aristocat is blessed with a 
compensating sense of morbid humor to match his menace. His laconic 
lion-readings drip veritable ice across the African veldt. 
</P>
<P>
 Irons' co-conspirator in "performing" Scar is the character's supervising 
animator, Andreas Dejas, a German-born artist who, by virtue of his villains, 
has emerged as one of the studio's best-known animators. Dejas is the 
uncontested contemporary king of cartoon creeps: Scar represents his third 
successive Disney scoundrel, following Jafar in "Aladdin" and Gaston in "Beauty 
and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of us may have no idea. But by now Dejas knows badness -- having from 
behind the boards bullied assorted princes, beauties and the nation's 
collective young for three straight movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think villains work really well when they're subtle," he says. "And then 
you wait for that moment where they explode, maybe, and lose it. But to see 
them think and scheme and plot is much more interesting than showing them 
beating somebody up. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there was a lot of subtlety with Scar. In many cases he doesn't move very 
much -- where we just tried to do something with a look , the way he tilts his 
head as he's literally talking down to this kid," Dejas says, raising his 
eyebrows, lifting his chin, cocking his eyes to one sinister side. 
</P>
<P>
 A patronizing quality is key. And Scar gets ample opportunity for that, biding 
his time with corrosive asides -- most of them flying over the head of his 
unassuming little nephew, the movie's hero, Simba -- while awaiting chances to 
ambush anyone standing between him and the throne. Once again, homicidal 
tendencies notwithstanding, kids and adults alike may have a hard time rooting 
for the inevitable demise of the guy who gets most of the best lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scar does more than just condescend to his innocent young nephew, Simba. 
In a twist tailor-made for the dysfunctionally conscious modern age, he shames 
him, convincing the young cub to shoulder the blame for the tragic death of his 
father, King Mufasa, in a stampede ("If it weren't for you, your father might 
still be alive"). 
</P>
<P>
 This sets in motion a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the 
hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's 
memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 So if "The Lion King" might be read as a modern fairy tale whose allegorical 
subtext centers on the emotional damage of child abuse, does that make it the 
"Tommy" of feature 'toons? 
</P>
<P>
 "When Scar puts the guilt trip on Simba, that's an intense idea," allows one 
of the film's two directors, Rob Menkoff. "That's probably something that is 
not typical of the other Disney pictures, in terms of what the villain does." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which is working psychological damage on the hero as a child," adds the other 
director, Rob Minkoff, with a blunt, hearty laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a John Bradshaw movie!" confesses Menkoff, tongue just partly in 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 We see it now: Scar as poster villain for the recovered memories movement. It 
couldn't happen to an icier lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't say 'no' when you get offered a villain," says Dejas, speaking for 
most animators in explaining why he's taken on three successive juicy 
antagonists. "I mean, you know, to do the princes, the princesses . . . " He 
chuckles dismissively at the thought, just as Scar or Jafar would. 
</P>
<P>
 Irons nearly said "no" to taking a comic turn as a villain when the role was 
offered so soon after his good fortune doing "Reversal." Once convinced and 
signed, his wry readings at the initial voice recordings gave a lot more suave, 
demented nuance to even the straighter parts of the script. And by then the 
screenplay had been altered a bit to incorporate shades of his Von Bulow 
persona.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our actors do it, but Jeremy in particular really wanted to play 
with the words and the pacing more," recalls the film's producer, Don Hahn. As 
an example, he points out a scene in which Scar lures Simba out onto a rock and 
tells him to wait there, alone, adding that his father has prepared a surprise 
-- "you know, a father and son thing." Irons' simple touch in reading was to 
add a brief pause, rendering it "a father and son . . . thing "; the comedy in 
the inflection comes from Scar sounding so disdainful he can barely summon the 
will to finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dejas subsequently animated the scene with an additional subliminal comic 
touch by having Scar flick his paw in a distracted way just as Irons says " 
thing ." This fey little paw flip was one of the few anthropomorphic touches 
really allowed any of the movie's animals from their necks down. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, as Dejas realized in a big way shortly into the project, this was the 
first substantial villain he'd taken on who would have to practice his roguery 
without benefit of opposable thumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis was -- within limits -- on naturalism. Be they lions, hyenas, 
wart hogs or what have you, these critters generally walk on all fours and 
don't point, throw punches, put on pants or otherwise embarrass themselves by 
too blatantly emulating their biped draftsmen. "Lion King" is the first Disney 
animal cartoon feature not to have mankind as even an implied part of the story 
(though "Bambi" came close, with just the hunter standing in for humanity). 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no props or costumes or sets," says Hahn, "so it's really limiting 
for the animators. I remember at the story meetings pulling out our hair, 
because there was no 'business'! Because they couldn't get up and open a door. 
There were rocks and more rocks, and when you went over there, there was some 
grass . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there weren't a wealth of wildlife idiosyncrasies to work from. The 
key animators took field trips to the San Diego Zoo, and subsequently had 
naturalists bring lions to the studio for closer study. Dejas ended up adding a 
component to Scar that the movie's other lions don't have: The bad cat's walk 
seems to quicken for a split second between steps, with a low whoosh on the 
soundtrack mid-stride, providing that extra subliminal touch of menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by Irons' line readings, Dejas also took to studying Irons' films, 
like "Reversal" and "Damage" (or "Scar in the Nude," as the animator calls that 
one), to pick up facial traits and tics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that he looks like a lion," says Dejas, "but he's handsome and 
unusual-looking at the same time, which I thought would be an interesting 
combination.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Jeremy saw the movie, he was extremely complimentary, in terms of 
recognizing himself in it. He said, 'I think it's the baggy eyes that brought 
it out.' And all the lions do have this color separation around their eyes, 
which puts an emphasis on this eye unit. With most animals, like the fox, 
they're lighter. . . . When you go darker, that brings the white of the eye out 
even more, and makes it very contrasted and evil-looking. For a villain, it 
seemed very appropriate to go dark -- therefore the eyes looked baggy and even 
more Jeremy Irons-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Dejas also had the benefit of Irons' potentially snooty British accent to work 
with -- which couldn't help but beg comparison with the arrogance of another 
jungle cat with a seductive English voice, Shere Khan, the "Jungle Book" tiger 
of 1967, given voice by George Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some similarities to Shere Khan, and I did not want to do 'Jungle 
Book.' I don't know how far I succeeded in that," admits Dejas. "But I talked 
to the other animators early on and said, 'It would be easy to take what the 
old guys developed for large cats, put a wig on 'em and call it a lion. It 
would be a shame.' I added a lot of black around Scar's mouth, gave him a nose 
that's like an open black claw, almost -- anything that they didn't do, I 
wanted to try, just so that people wouldn't say, 'Oh, it's just like Shere 
Khan.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For once, mild-mannered Dejas betrays the barest hint of his screen villains' 
utter perturbability. "You hear this a lot when people recognize (bits of) 
other characters. It's really bothersome." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, the producer of "The Lion King" (and "Beauty and the Beast" before it), 
feels heartened that Disney is willing to take a detour here from the common 
thread that united the studio's previous three animated musical hits: "If we 
keep making a love story about people from two different worlds falling in 
love, I think we will suffer from that. And I think 'Lion King,' as a 
father-son story, is a great departure from that." 
</P>
<P>
 And so is Scar also a departure from Ursula, Gaston or Jafar, all of whom came 
off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister. Whether he'll be the breakout 
character remains to be seen. But "Scar was definitely our favorite character," 
says co-director Minkoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional challenge, he says, is that "it's so hard to come up with 
exciting goodness. Like in 'Fantasia,' the 'Night on Bald Mountain' sequence is 
really dynamic and fun, and then they do 'Ave Maria,' and it's aaaavayyyy 
boooriiing ," Minkoff croons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five or 10 years ago, people thought of Disney films as being good, right, so 
all the Disney copy films were about good characters doing good things -- so 
there was zero depth. Because it's not about the goodness of a character, it's 
about overcoming evil, which is more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Dejas agrees: "Even in design, there should be something beautiful and 
intriguing that makes you want to look at this thing. You might shudder or look 
away, but you should still be curious enough to go back to it. Maleficent in 
'Sleeping Beauty' is a gorgeous art-deco design, and has a lot of magneticism 
-- you just want to look at this even though she's evil and she's bad and she 
curses." 
</P>
<P>
 But after tackling three virtual spawns of Satan in a row for Disney, an 
overtaxed Dejas is taking a break from nefariousness for a more virtuous 
assignment later this year: going to Paris to head a unit that will animate 
Mickey Mouse in the character's first theatrical short in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the reason is, nobody knows Mickey Mouse anymore," Dejas admits. "I mean, 
the kids know the Simpsons and Ren & Stimpy, and Mickey is something from the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the animator help the Mouse get his, uh, edge back? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a bratty thing at the beginning, in the '30s. He kicked things around 
and he hurt other little animals. He became nicer and nicer -- and then in the 
end, by the time it came to the mid-'40s, '50s, he was just flat, and other 
characters took over. He's a very difficult character, such a corporate symbol, 
and you have to be so precious with him. . . . But in the end it's always 
easier if you really like your character. I love the character," Dejas assures. 
</P>
<P>
 And we promise to love him again, too, if only his animator can just find some 
credible context for Mickey to wrinkle his ears, return to his rat-like roots 
and, like Scar, announce that his teeth and ambition are bared.*

SUMMER SNEAKS '94; WAS, IS AND ALWAYS A MAVERICK; HIS SIGNATURES ARE ROCKFORD 
AND MAVERICK -- CAN ANYBODY IN HOLLYWOOD DO COOL AND CANNY BETTER THAN JAMES 
GARNER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 James Garner does not go to the movies. "Ohhh, I don't like to sit there too 
long," he explains in a perfect Jim Rockford-esque grumble of a drawl. "I don't 
like the crowds, I don't like to get out of the house if I don't have to. 
Parking. It's such a chore." Yet, here he sits in the Hotel Bel Air dining 
room, cheerfully saying you're going to want to do all those things to see his 
new movie, "Maverick."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a kick," he says. "We did have a ball making it. I asked 
(director) Dick Donner the second week, 'We're having so much fun, are we 
laughing ourselves into trouble here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 37 years since Warner Bros. officials called over to Japan where 
Marlon Brando was filming "Sayonara" and asked the producers to hurry up and 
send home a young contract actor, James Garner, to play Bret Maverick in their 
new television series. By the time Garner was finished with "Maverick," the 
tongue-in-cheek Western had supplanted most others and Garner was on his way to 
being a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we just killed Westerns," Garner says chuckling. When a character once 
declared "He went that-a-way," Maverick looked at him and deadpanned, "And you 
know a shortcut, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Maverick" established two seminal things about Garner. One was that 
he is brazen enough to stand up to a studio in a legal battle. (Long before his 
famous 1980s suit against Universal, he successfully sued Warners for laying 
him off his 52-week contract during a writers' strike.) The second was that he 
is the master of the wry, bemused everyman character. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four decades of his career, Garner has proved to be one of the most 
enduring and endearing actors in the business, accessible enough for 
television, commanding enough for movies, unpretentious enough for commercials. 
He has done things you've probably forgotten -- "The Americanization of Emily" 
and "Victor/Victoria," both with Julie Andrews -- and things he'd rather forget 
about. ("A Man Called Sledge" is what he regularly offers up when asked for his 
biggest stinker.) And along the way there were films like "Support Your Local 
Sheriff," "Grand Prix" (he loved that because he got to drive race cars), "The 
Children's Hour," "The Great Escape." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been television that let him distinguish himself from the pack, 
first with his charming gambler-adventurer, Bret Maverick, and then later with 
the witty, beleaguered private detective, Jim Rockford, of "The Rockford 
Files." In 1993, he starred in HBO's Emmy-winning version of "Barbarians at the 
Gate," but for most TV fans, Maverick and Rockford were the quintessential 
Garner roles. In many ways, Rockford was a 1970s reincarnation of Bret Maverick 
and had a similar skewering effect on TV private eyes. "We kept sticking our 
tongue in our cheek, and that ruined a lot of detective shows," says Garner. 
"People would get to thinking, 'What would Rockford have done? He wouldn't have 
gotten a gun and gone chasing him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Maverick has never been quite out of circulation, living on in fans' fond 
memories and getting resuscitated in a short-lived 1981 series that Garner says 
never made him particularly happy. But now, there's a big screen rebirth, and 
Garner is passing on the torch to Mel Gibson, who plays the glib gambler in 
Richard Donner's movie "Maverick," which also stars Jodie Foster and Garner. 
Here, the actor says, he's content to sit by at the poker table and on the 
stagecoach playing straight lawman Zane Cooper to Gibson's wisecracking 
Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner says his Maverick days are over. "That was a long time ago," he says. 
"I don't own it. It's wonderful to see Mel play it. He has such charm and wit. 
I've said before I don't know anybody who could play it like Mel could." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson plays Maverick broader than Garner did, he says. "He's much funnier 
than I was," muses Garner. "I think when we did it, we were a little more 
subtle. This can get pretty broad." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garner sees that as a necessary '90s update. And he says the antic comedy 
of the movie -- which virtually no one has seen because Donner was still racing 
to finish it two weeks before its slated Friday opening -- owes much to 
Donner's and Gibson's rapport from their collaboration on the "Lethal Weapon" 
franchise as well as the fact that a female character, Foster, has been added 
to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more played between three people rather than the humor that was in 
the series, which came from Jim's witticisms and observations," notes Donner, 
who says Garner was "extremely giving as both an actor who created the 
character and a compatriot on the set." Because of Garner's observation that he 
never drank as Maverick, Gibson doesn't either. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Donner and Garner are vague on just what Garner's lawman character, Zane 
Cooper, is doing besides keeping his eye on Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wonderful stick-in-the-mud," Donner says laughing. The director also 
insists there's a twist in the movie. "You know that movie last year where they 
said don't say what the gender of the actor is? Well, we say you can tell the 
gender but don't tell the ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner figures more moviegoers will come for Gibson than for him. "He's a hot 
property," he says. "He deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not out of character for Garner on screen or off. Much of his 
long-lived appeal owes to his unpretentious straightforwardness and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy you want to go to dinner with after you're done 
shooting," says Donner. 
</P>
<P>
 He's certainly pleasant over a late breakfast in the lush confines of the Bel 
Air. He eats a politically correct half a papaya and a bran muffin. At 66, he's 
a veteran of bypass surgery who no longer smokes (well, he sneaks one now and 
then) and drinks only wine.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had 'em working nights trying to make enough whiskey for me to drink," he 
recalls of his hard-liquor-drinking days that ended, he says, when he was 27. 
He allows himself about six ounces of beef a week -- and this from a guy once 
famous for beef commercials. "I got letters from people: 'I hope you die eating 
beef.' All these vegetarians." 
</P>
<P>
 He's aging about as well as, oh, say, Warren Beatty (Garner is older), which 
is to say quite well. Tall and broad shouldered, Garner is dressed in a black 
sweater and black slacks, a black leather jacket tossed across the banquette 
seat. The face is ruddy pink, thicker and not as chiseled as in his Rockford 
days. He wears big, black-framed, rose-tinted shades on this hazy day. He takes 
them off halfway through the interview, revealing gentle light brown eyes. It 
was only nine years ago that his performance in "Murphy's Romance" as the 
pharmacist who falls slowly in love with Sally Field won him an Oscar 
nomination for best actor. It's one of his favorite roles and he plays Murphy 
as an unapologetic eccentric, comfortable with his life and his thickening 
waist, even sexy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Careful, girl," he demures when this observation is made. He says he has 
never tried to project himself as a sexually alluring figure. "I just don't see 
myself like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner has few illusions about himself in Hollywood or the people who run the 
business. He spent eight long years fighting Universal for his 38% share of the 
profits of "The Rockford Files." The studio claimed the show had made no 
profits, but Garner sued them for $16.5 million, settling out of court in 1989. 
He still won't disclose the amount. The battle, which cost him $2.2 million in 
legal fees, left him disillusioned about the business.  
</P>
<P>
 But he went back to work, and he is preparing to embark on at least three 
two-hour Rockford television movies for Universal. "I'll just make them 
somewhere else and send them the film. I wouldn't feel good driving on the lot 
every day," he says casually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with these companies -- and I'm not just saying Universal -- is 
they've got the money," he says. "And they're doing whatever they want to keep 
as much as they can. If you want it, you're going to have to come get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner is legendary for his bluntness whether he's talking about studios or 
colleagues. He thinks movies are too violent today and laments the loss of the 
understated picture.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Murphy's Romance' was a good example," he says. "It has no violence, no sex 
-- as we've come to know it in movies. And it was a charming film. 'Driving 
Miss Daisy' is another example. But they don't make many of those. They want to 
make the ones where they kill everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he worked on "Maverick" with a director who created the mayhem of 
"Lethal Weapon." ("The 'Lethal Weapons' aren't violent," Donner insists. "It's 
comic-book violence.") Garner says he didn't care as long as "Maverick" wasn't 
violent. "I'm not a crusader," Garner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner deplores ageism in Hollywood -- particularly toward actresses over 40. 
"I think they're gorgeous after 40, but the producers want some hot T-and-A 
girl," he says. "I'd rather go with the actress." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's oblivious to the Generation X actors. He has never even heard of 
Christian Slater or Jason Patric. "Listen, I'm a caveman," he says 
matter-of-factly. "I'm out of the mainstream so far." 
</P>
<P>
 His points of reference are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. He adored Fonda, 
whom he met on his first acting job as a lowly "movable prop" in a New York 
theatrical production of "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial." "He was probably as 
professional an actor as I've ever seen," says Garner, who stayed friends with 
Fonda for years. 
</P>
<P>
 And he points to Tracy as an example of the kind of seamless acting to which 
he himself aspires. "You never caught Spencer Tracy acting, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
 He hastens to add that his ignorance is not a judgment. "Listen, I don't mean 
to knock these young guys here," he says. "I'm sure when I first started out, 
people said 'Who the hell is he?' I remember I'd been working about two years 
on 'Maverick' and I was at the Beverly Hilton one night for some big function. 
And Cary Grant came over to me and introduced himself and told me how much he 
liked my work. I didn't know what to say to the man! I said something dumb 
like, 'I sure like yours, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks with fatherly affection of Foster. "Well, I've known Jodie since she 
was 9 or 10 years old. I fell in love with her then," he says. "We did a little 
picture that shall remain nameless. I think it was called 'One Little Indian.' 
Such a good actress and a wonderful girl." He frets over reports that have 
filtered back to him of her current regimen for her film "Nell." "She dyed her 
hair black for this new picture she's working on. Someone told me she'd lost 
about 18 or 20 pounds. Poor little thing. But she's so serious about her work." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner says he rarely gets good movie scripts anymore. "There are younger 
directors, and anybody over 30 is ancient to them, because they're not that 
old," he says ruefully. Not that he counts himself out yet. "I keep working. 
There are still those around me who know me." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner is in some ways an old-fashioned Hollywood story himself. He never made 
it through 10th grade, leaving Norman, Okla., where he'd been a high school 
athlete, for Hollywood, where his father had relocated and was working as a 
carpet layer. He briefly enrolled in Hollywood High School, earned some money 
doing swimsuit modeling -- he rolls his eyes at the memory -- and then shipped 
out of San Pedro with the merchant marine. Later, he spent 21 months in the 
Korean War where he earned two Purple Hearts. When he returned to Hollywood 
after his stint in the Army, he considered himself qualified for nothing. So he 
went off to see an agent friend who had once told him he oughta be in pictures. 
The agent signed him that day, and Garner has never wanted for work since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said if there hadn't been a parking space in front of the 
building, I'd never have been an actor," he deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he lives a comfortable quiet movie-star life, playing golf at the 
Bel-Air Country Club. "I try to limit it to four times a week," he says. He has 
a house in Brentwood and occasionally drives his Ford Explorer down to 
Toscana's for Italian food. The morning of the earthquake, he ran into his 
living room to check the fate of a prized Robert Graham statue and found it 
leaning precariously against a window but still intact.  
</P>
<P>
 He's married to his first and only wife, Lois, whom he met at an Adlai 
Stevenson rally in the Valley 37 years ago. With the exception of a two-year 
separation more than a decade ago, they've been together ever since. But 
they're not long for L.A. He's building a house in the Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had it," he says. "I can't stand the violence; I can't stand the 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he still loves to work. For the upcoming "Rockford Files" projects, 
he has managed to collect much of the same creative team. He expects Stuart 
Margolin will be back as Angel and Joe Santos will return as Lt. Becker. "We'll 
probably make him a captain now," Garner says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a mellower Rockford. He won't be dashing around or tussling with 
unsavory characters. "There's not going to be much this time, I can guarantee 
it," he says. "Even my stuntman is old."*

SUMMER SNEAKS '94; UNMASKING THE MASKED MANIAC; HOW DID JIM CARREY, ZANY GUY 
THAT HE IS, BLAST OUT OF 'ACE VENTURA' INTO 'THE MASK' AND THEN RIGHT INTO 
MEGA-MILLIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The night of the Rodney G. King verdicts, Jim Carrey was onstage at the Laugh 
Factory, caroming through one of his theater-of-the-bizarre stand-up routines. 
Outside the club, an angry mob was working its way up Sunset Boulevard. "I was 
amazed that people were even out," Carrey marvels on a recent afternoon, 
lounging on a divan in the club's antiquarian green room. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was Carrey confronted with what, in the stand-up world, passes for a 
wrenching dilemma: Ignore the riots? Or court Extreme Bad Taste by making fun 
of them? For Carrey, progenitor of the scar-tissue-faced Fire Marshall Bill on 
Fox TV's "In Living Color" and other surreally repellent characters, there 
really wasn't a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda wanted to fool around and comment on it," Carrey says. "See if I 
could get away with it." So he told the nervous audience: "You're safe in 
hee-r-r-e." 
</P>
<P>
 They probably didn't feel much better, but Carrey had, as is his custom, 
walked the line of propriety -- and survived. "That's the art of it," he says, 
"trying to find a way to do it that's not going to make the audience, you know, 
hate you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems to hate Jim Carrey these days. Two years after that edgy night at 
the Laugh Factory, the 32-year-old comedian exploded into stardom with the 
improbable vehicle "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." The movie, ostensibly about a 
private eye searching for the kidnaped mascot of the Miami Dolphins, but mostly 
about Carrey's weirdly compelling comic riffing, stunned the industry by taking 
in $12 million its first weekend of release in February. The movie has since 
grossed nearly $70 million -- more than "On Deadly Ground," more than such 
supposedly sure-fire sequels as "Sister Act 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey was in Chicago for a stand-up gig the night "Ace Ventura" opened. "My 
whole management team and I were sitting around, waiting for the numbers to 
come in. It was like Election Night. Then the next morning they said it had 
gone completely past the projections. That was a great moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The now-eminently bankable Carrey, whose most notable film appearances before 
"Ace" were sideman roles in "Earth Girls Are Easy" and "Peggy Sue Got Married," 
is awash in movie offers. The inevitable sequel to "Ace Ventura" is set to 
start rolling in January. Later this afternoon, Carrey will decamp for Colorado 
to begin shooting "Dumb & Dumber," a buddy movie for which Carrey sports a 
pudding-bowl haircut and a chipped front tooth, giving his famously elastic 
face a serenely dopey Howdy Doody-meets-Detective Wojohowitz cast. (The chipped 
tooth is the real goods, courtesy of a grade-school misadventure, which Carrey 
thought made him look cool "until I turned 13 and my penis said to me: You 
might want to get that fixed.") 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is "The Mask," which opens July 29. Filmed last year immediately 
after "Ace Ventura" wrapped, the $20-million special-effects-laden movie is the 
second installment in what would have been Carrey's slow build in films but is 
now, for obvious reasons, freighted with enormous commercial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a Walter Mitty-esque doormat for women, bosses, 
even his dog, until -- did someone mention high concept? -- he blunders upon an 
ancient Viking mask that confers on its wearer explosively charismatic powers. 
While Carrey and "Mask" director Charles Russell ("Nightmare on Elm Street 3") 
both earnestly extol the movie's up-from-"Ace"-elements, such as a coherent 
plot and a somewhat more complex character for Carrey to play, "The Mask" is in 
fact an outrageous romp for its star, flattering his absurdist tendencies and 
cartoonish physical humor -- or "Fred Astaire on acid," as Carrey puts it. 
Russell estimates that Carrey's "alarming physical abilities" shaved $1 million 
off the film's special-effects budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The universal element that makes certain stars exciting is a sense of danger 
-- that anything can happen," says the director. Carrey, he adds, "is fearless 
in performance -- a lot of people don't realize comedy takes courage, to be 
that free in front of the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of "Ace Ventura" has brought Carrey big money. Make that really 
big money. New Line Cinema will pay the actor, who received $450,000 from the 
studio for "The Mask," an awesome $7 million to star in "Dumb & Dumber," and a 
reported, even more awesome, $10 million for the "Mask" sequel. The money is a 
sensitive topic within Carrey's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Says the $7-million man himself: "I don't want people to start thinking about 
me as, like, a money person. 'Cause I'm not. To me, that's a little Monopoly 
game that's being played in the other room. I deserve it as much as the next 
guy, I think, if I put the butts in the seats and I make people laugh. But I 
don't wake up thinking about money." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Carrey adds: "I don't want the money to make me soft." Could it? 
"I think it does to some people. A guy like Richard Pryor, his stuff came from 
anger, and when you take that away, when all of a sudden you have everything 
you want, it's real hard to create that anger again, 'cause it's not there. But 
my humor has always come from wanting to put out a careless vibe. I don't have 
to be angry to create." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the star-is-born blather, the fact remains that Carrey is one of the 
most original comedians to come along since Robin Williams. He can change the 
topography of his face and the planes of his lanky body so swiftly, and into 
such appalling contortions of character, that audiences are sometimes unsure 
whether to laugh or flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to shock audiences and do stuff that's outrageous," says Laugh 
Factory owner Jamie Masada. "What he does with his face and body -- some people 
are in awe. They ask me: 'Did he have a plastic face on?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like Williams, Carrey also appears to have nearly universal appeal. Men, women 
and children seem to respond instinctively to him, a handy characteristic when 
your movie is opening at 2,700 theaters. "He's got that edge," says Russell. 
"You can't take your eyes off him." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Masada, who has seen his share of comedians over the years: "When he 
first played here, before 'In Living Color,' the announcer would say, 'Jim 
Carrey' and the audience didn't react. He had to prove he was funny." Since 
"Ace," says Masada, Carrey merely has to step onstage "and the people are 
applauding, screaming, for two, three minutes. I've never seen a reaction like 
that. He's the hottest comedian right now." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been Carrey's extreme good fortune to have his defining moment -- "Ace 
Ventura" -- coincide so completely with his vision of himself. The movie was 
the culmination of 15 years of textbook starving-artist hardscrabble, during 
which -- with the glorious exception of "In Living Color" -- the comedian's 
attempts to bring his demented sangfroid to an audience broader than the 
stand-up circuit were diluted or rebuffed altogether. With "Ace Ventura," he 
finally got his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watched the dailies on 'Ace,' I literally peed myself over some of the 
things that were happening. I didn't know if it was going to go over. I didn't 
know if it was going to be too much for people." Reminded that, based on the 
movie's cumulative gross, they now number around 8 million, Carrey says: "Yeah. 
Society is a lot more twisted than I thought.' 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carrey was reared in the Toronto area, amid conditions sufficiently 
bizarre to lead one to suspect that Carrey invented them himself, were they not 
so pathetic. The youngest of four siblings, Carrey inherited his sense of humor 
from his father, Percy Carrey, a jazz sax/clarinetist and frustrated performer 
who worked as an accountant. Soon, Carrey was cutting up around the house. "It 
came from being wanting to be noticed," he says. "My father was really funny, 
and I guess it was a competitive thing with him. But a good competitive thing. 
It wasn't strange or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 At school, however, Carrey kept to himself. "I was quiet. I never had a friend 
in the world until the second or third grade, when I started hamming it up in 
the back of class. That was the turning point. I realized I could do something 
silly and make people laugh, make them want to talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life was mostly sunny, if a bit bent, around the Carrey household. 
"We were the wildest family, I swear to God," Carrey says. "If you came over 
for dinner, it was only a matter of time before somebody got half a pound of 
butter smeared across their face. Literally, every Sunday we'd have a cherry 
cheesecake fight at the table. We lived in the country, and at Christmas we'd 
run out to the ditch and wait for people to drive by and come out with axes and 
stuff, stockings on our heads. And this is, like, my father too. We were 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
 When Carrey was 15, his father lost his job. His mother, Kathleen, who 
suffered from numerous chronic ailments both real and, apparently, imagined, 
took ill again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my mother had everything under the sun," Carrey recalls. "Just 
unbelievable stuff. She was a child of alcoholics" -- although not, Carrey 
says, one herself -- "and she had a lot of problems as far as, like, the 
illnesses were her medals. That's all she talked about. It was desensitizing. I 
have a problem with that still, sometimes, with the people I'm with. When my 
wife" -- actress Melissa Womer, now separated from Carrey -- "would get sick, 
if I didn't see physical evidence, it would be really hard for me to believe. 
Because, after a while, with my mom, we'd be at the dinner table and she'd say, 
'I have cancer,' and we'd go, 'Great, pass the salt.' Because you heard it 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation inevitably skewed the dynamic of the family. With Carrey's 
father cast in the role of nurse and caretaker, Carrey coped with the problem 
tellingly. "I would make her laugh," he says quietly. "When she was sick -- 
really sick, really in pain -- I used to come into the bedroom in my underwear 
and do my praying mantis impression." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to make ends meet, the entire family went to work as janitors and 
security guards in a tire-rim factory. The family's fortunes were at such a low 
ebb that at one point they lived in tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrifying," Carrey says. "It made me mad. I used to lie in bed at 
night, or wherever we were, and plot how I was going to kill certain people in 
certain ways. Just seeing my Dad do that kind of work after being the 
controller of a company really tore me up." 
</P>
<P>
 At night, having dropped out of high school to help support the family, Carrey 
roamed the factory, furious. "I used to literally carry a baseball bat on my 
cleaning cart because I just wanted rip into somebody." Did he? "No, but I 
broke a lot of machines and a lot of furniture. The bosses would come in the 
next day: 'What the hell is this hole in the wall?' And I'd go, 'Aw, that ol' 
buffing machine got away from me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, says Carrey, "We just decided to quit. We had nothing to go to at 
that time. But we were happier in a Volkswagen camper than we were doing that. 
Immediately, we changed back to who we really were, which was basically a 
pretty loving family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'Grapes of Wrath,' for a while," Carrey continues. "I learned a lot 
from that. Whatever life does to you, you have to see that light at the end of 
the tunnel, because if you don't you're dead." On a less philosophical and 
perhaps more accurate note, Carrey adds: "It's an interesting thing, how your 
surroundings can really affect you. It makes you work real hard not to ever 
have to go back there." 
</P>
<P>
 For Carrey, the road out began at Toronto's Yuk Yuk comedy club, where he 
performed routines written with his father, who squired him to the shows. "He 
used to come down with me every night, and then I started hanging out with the 
guys, and I had to have That Conversation with him, which was painful: 'Y'know, 
Dad, sometimes it's not cool to have your Dad hang out with you.' " Carrey was 
savvy enough to realize that Percy Carrey, with the best of intentions, was 
projecting his own thwarted ambitions onto his son. "It was his dream too, you 
know. He should have been a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Carrey had molded a successful act built around killer impressions. "I 
could have stayed up in Canada and made a real good living doing stand-up, but 
I always had people going, 'You're too good to stay here, you gotta go to L.A., 
go to L.A., go to L.A.' When I finally did, it was a real hard decision, but 
the main thing was knowing my father, who was a really good musician, never 
made the move, and it dwindled and faded and he became an accountant, which is 
not his love. To me, that was the benchmark. I wasn't going to let that 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey moved to L.A. in 1981. The usual pressures of starting anew in a 
strange city with an erratically paying job were multiplied by the fact he was 
supporting his family back in Canada. "My dad had lost heart. He was kind of 
beaten down by everything that had happened. So I really had to kind of tow the 
boat there. Now it's not a problem, but a couple of times it broke me 
financially. I had to call them up and say, 'I don't know what you gotta do. 
Get on welfare or something, 'cause I have no more money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Carrey took stock of his career and admitted to himself "that I was 
doing it for my parents. I wanted to provide, do the Elvis fantasy and give 
them a big house with pillars and all that. At a certain point I literally 
started having bad dreams about my parents. Then I started to realize I was 
angry at them. And I needed to do something -- go my own way." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey took a sabbatical from stand-up and took acting lessons. When he 
returned to the stage, he pointedly ditched the impressions that had been his 
mainstay. "I could have been one of the top impressionists, but I didn't want 
that to be my legacy. Where everybody just sits around and goes (imitates 
unctuous fan): 'He's very cute.' When I went back to stand-up, it was with what 
nobody wanted me to do, which was ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Make that unscripted ideas. Carrey would prowl the stage, hurling at the 
audience whatever came into his head. "I'd seen guys like Robin Williams do 
improvisation, but he always had set things he could go to if things weren't 
going well." Carrey worked without a net. "I created some really fun stuff out 
of that, but it was horrifying. Sink or swim. It was like learning how to do a 
slap-shot with some weight on your stick so that when you do it without -- when 
you finally get up there with some (prepared) material -- you're that much 
looser. You're not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey's new direction was greeted with intense skepticism. "Everybody told me 
I was (expletive) nuts. Everybody. (Comedy Store doyenne) Mitzi Shore used to 
say, 'You're the king of impressions! What are you doing? You're throwing it 
all away!' Then comics would come up to me and say, 'Man, I used to do a thing 
that was really great and I threw it away and I've regretted it ever since.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey ignored the Cassandras, and, in 1982, picked up what seemed like an 
unbelievable plum: star of the NBC comedy series "Duck Factory." The show fold 
after 13 episodes, but movie work was dribbling in: "Once Bitten," "Peggy Sue," 
"Earth Girls." Finally, in 1989, Keenan Ivory Wayans, brother of fellow "Earth 
Girls" alumnus Damon Wayans, hired Carrey for the cast of "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a white face among the comedy show's mostly black cast, Carrey 
distinguished himself with such indelible characters as Fire Marshall Bill and 
the steroid-pumped female body builder Vera de Milo. Here, at last, was the 
chance for Carrey to revel in the weirdness he'd cultivated since dumping the 
Jimmy Stewart impressions -- a show that aggressively spoofed everything from 
P.M.S. to the disabled. Carrey the comedian and anti-authoritarian found the 
freedom liberating; Carrey, the semi-lapsed Catholic, occasionally had twinges 
of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I did Fire Marshall Bill, I went home feeling like I was going 
to go to hell. Then I sat back and looked at it and kind of went, 'You know, 
it's not that bad. Was the original impulse to do that evil, or what it coming 
from a good place?' I just wanted to make people laugh." Nevertheless, he 
snorts, "If somebody else wrote it, I'd probably think it was disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey eventually discovered a theme running through many of his characters, 
which was: "Guys who think they're in control but aren't. Just the people who 
are, you know: 'Don't worry! Count on me!' And they have no idea what they're 
doing." From there, it's hard not to make the connection to Carrey's tumultuous 
upbringing, to the nights in the tents, to the weary, broken father. "Exactly," 
Carrey says. "There is no control. Anybody who says they're in control is full 
of (expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey is hunched over a cigarette at the Laugh Factory, piecing together the 
last year, the best of his life -- the year he made "Ace," the year, ironically 
enough, his marriage collapsed. "It's so cliched," he sighs. "Another Hollywood 
cliche. But there's reasons for cliches, I guess. It's weird, because during 
'Ace,' my marriage was falling apart. Meanwhile, I'm doing what I've always 
dreamed of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living with me this last couple of years is like living with an astronaut -- 
it's not the most rewarding experience," Carrey continues. "It's like, I just 
came back from the moon, don't ask me to take the garbage out. I can relax, but 
not at the prescribed times necessarily, and when you're married you've got to 
have time for this and that and it's just . . . impossible. (Imitates bright, 
encouraging woman) 'Why don't you sit around the house and work on something?' 
(As self, manic whispering) 'You don't understand. I've just touched the face 
of God .' It's that excitement. You can't get that sitting in your living 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey now lives in the Westwood area. His 6-year-old daughter, Jane, stays 
with him three days a week. Although Carrey says he likes the everyday 
attention that fame has brought him -- "I don't know if I believe anybody who 
says they don't" -- it's made fatherly outings problematic. "I'd love to take 
my kid to Disneyland, but I can't. I tried it, and it was not good. I got the 
VIP treatment and everything, but it was, 'Hey, man! Do that face you do!' I 
try to stay away from that when I'm with my daughter, because I don't want her 
to be jealous of that attention." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Carrey is grappling with another Hollywood cliche: Will the 
suddenly successful movie star ditch the TV show that launched him? "I don't 
know yet," Carrey says. "I'm scheduled to go back. It's difficult, because I'm 
getting so many offers to do things that I'd love to do. One is kinda coming up 
in the space and time that would be for 'In Living Color.' But if I'm there, 
I'm gonna be there, be into it. I don't want to forsake that form, because 
that's what got me all this stuff. I don't want to screw those guys, either -- 
I'm not into that. It just gets, like, you just do what you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey stubs out his cigarette. By tonight, he'll be in Colorado, ridiculous 
haircut and gap tooth at the ready, a movie star putting a little more distance 
between himself and the disappointments that shaped his ambitions. Still, he 
says, "My life is a string of embarrassing moments. I've gone to premieres and 
tried to make the cool-guy exit, and the limo driver locks the keys in the car, 
and it's running, and he's trying to pick the lock while I'm standing there and 
the whole theater is emptying out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it the Eugene Syndrome," Carrey says, "because my middle name is 
Eugene. I always figured my parents named me that to keep me humble. You can 
never get too cool with a name like Eugene."*

SUMMER SNEAKS '94; LESS FAT: POPCORN OR MILK BONES?; TAKE A SEAT NEXT TO MR. 
WEGMAN'S WEIMARANERS FOR THE RETURN OF 'LASSIE' AND A PACK OF OTHER SUMMER 
CANINE FLICKS 
</P>

<P>
 It's the Year of the Dog, according to the Chinese calendar, so this summer 
filmgoers, hungry for family fare with boomer nostalgia appeal, will be treated 
to an especially large kennel-ful of Hollywood dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Canine cinema slated for release this summer includes remakes of "Lassie," and 
"The Little Rascals" as well as early fall's "The Yellow Dog," an original film 
centering on the exploits of a yellow Lab (but with decided echoes of "Old 
Yeller"). Other films feature a scene-stealing dog, including the recently 
released "Clean Slate" (whose Jack Russell terrier, Barkley, has the dubious 
distinction of playing the screen's first visually challenged dog), "Mask" due 
in July, and "The Little Rascals," due in August. And those are on top of the 
recent "Beethoven's 2nd," "Iron Will" and "White Fang 2."  
</P>
<P>
 It should be no surprise, of course; Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' "The Hidden 
Life of Dogs" has been on bestseller lists for months. Television pooches -- 
including Eddie, the scrappy terrier on "Frasier"; Murray on "Mad About You," 
and Buck, the Bundys' pet on "Married With Children" -- have graced magazine 
covers and are big audience-pleasers. And baby boomers cherish fond memories of 
"Old Yeller," "The Incredible Journey," "Rin Tin Tin" and even "101 
Dalmatians." 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary appeal for filmmakers, in fact, is at least partly because of 
the growing number of boomers who want quality entertainment for their kids. 
And animal-oriented films of the past several years have performed respectably 
to spectacularly at the box office; witness both "Beethovens," "Milo and Otis," 
"Homeward Bound" and "Free Willy." 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to make a movie that's simple and moving and full of adventure -- 
the way you might have hoped to have a movie for yourself when you were 8 or 
10," said Philip Borsos, writer-director of "The Yellow Dog" for 20th Century 
Fox. "And dog movies really easily fall into that category. A dog is always 
emotional -- and always funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Borsos said his own two young children drove him to write such a movie: "I'd 
looked around to take my kids to a movie that I could actually enjoy myself and 
that has a little more depth to it. There was really nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Boomers who grew up with Lassie and Rin Tin Tin and other screen canines feel 
particularly comfortable accompanying their own children to movies starring 
dogs, say industry observers.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for something you can take your kids to, you know if a dog 
is a prominent feature in the movie it's not going to be inordinately violent 
or emotionally disturbing, so it's a safe choice," says UCLA film professor 
Howard Suber. "When film producers are looking for a way to span the 
generations, the kind of movie that both parents and children can go to 
together and enjoy, perhaps on different levels, they think of a cute little 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
 For directors, cute might not be the first word that comes to mind.  
</P>
<P>
 "My worst moments by far were those scenes where I had all six dogs in one 
shot," said Rod Daniels, director of "Beethoven's 2nd," in which the film's 
namesake falls in love with another St. Bernard and sires four puppies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're supposed to go from point A to point B," says Daniels. "That's all 
they have to do. There would be six, seven trainers there, all with their 
buzzers and all with their little food and all with their commands. We'd roll 
camera and we'd all tense up. Then you would see six dogs scatter. There would 
just be this exodus and you'd yell 'Cut!' and you'd just do it over and over 
and over and over again."  
</P>
<P>
 Daniels became resigned to the ordeal: "It was like they were saying 'We're 
puppies and we really don't have to do this.' It was like working with little 
babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Borsos can laugh now -- barely -- as he recalls endless retakes with Dakota, 
star of "The Yellow Dog," in which a 14-year-old boy and his dog are 
shipwrecked on a remote island during a family trip and must brave the 
wilderness and find a way to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog was supposed to be slipping off the edge of a cliff and was 
completely incapable of doing that. In fact he loved leaping, and leaped as if 
all four legs were wired to springs," he recounted. "He was so proud of 
himself. We must have done 40 or 50 takes on that scene." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are bright spots.  
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs are better than I thought they were going to be," said "Little 
Rascals" director Penelope Spheeris, who also directed "Wayne's World II" and 
"The Decline of Civilization" Parts 1 and 2, about the punk and heavy metal 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs take direction much better than metalheads, and they don't talk back 
like punks," Spheeris says. "And they're easier to work with than Mike Meyers." 
 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most directors agree that when it comes down to it, working with dogs 
is not that much different from working with human actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to be a storyteller and if it's with dogs or robots, it doesn't 
really matter as long as it moves an audience," said Daniels. "Directing is 
communicating, and you have to know how to communicate with your actors. The 
trick is to look at the footage and create moments, not only when you shoot it 
but when you edit it, where you look at it and say, 'Gee, isn't that sweet? 
Look what he's thinking about her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the editing room is where much of the magic really happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was recutting a scene where Lassie jumps out of a very, very high window," 
said "Lassie" director Dan Petrie. "I wanted to make it more difficult, so we 
added a couple jumps, edited them into the scene. And it looks like the dog 
just does all this magically himself." 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniels, it helped to imagine a human version of his St. Bernard star. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do anthropomorphize the animals," Daniels said. "In this one Beethoven was 
a little like John Goodman -- big, overeating a little bit, too much time in 
front of the television set, not enough exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 With well-known dogs like Lassie, no human role model may be necessary, since 
the collie has become part of contemporary American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "You deal with the dog in the same way you do with a person," says Petrie. 
"Obviously, you can't talk to the dog and say, 'This is what's going on in your 
head.' You have to find a physical equivalent of that emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 In this "Lassie" remake -- due some 50 years after the original -- the noble 
collie is involved in a truck wreck. Lassie's master has been killed, but the 
dog has been thrown clear into the woods. Lassie -- played as in the television 
show by a male dog -- is seen looking back through the woods at the ambulances 
and the director must convey to the audience that the dog is struck with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "His head is down low, very low, watching," Petrie explains. "Then he raises 
his head up. He looks quizzical. Then he realizes, 'Oh-oh. It's bad news.' Then 
he lowers his head down, defeated, and starts to move away because he knows the 
man is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The film director's relationship with a dog's trainer is critical to a 
smooth-running production. Part actor, part director, part interpreter, a 
trainer is a filmmaker's conduit to the canine, the one who supplies the 
commands the dogs will actually obey. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while you do feel like you did direct the dog, whereas the reality of 
it is you went to (Lassie's trainer) Bob Weatherwax and you explained the scene 
to him and how you planned to shoot it," says Petrie. "Then it's up to him to 
translate that to actual movement and body language on the part of the dog that 
will convey those feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 The set of "Beethoven's 2nd" was often crawling with dog wranglers. Because 
St. Bernard puppies grow at a rate of a pound a day, the dogs would quickly 
become too big and new puppies -- all between 4 and 8 weeks old -- would have 
to be brought in. "The secret's out now: There were a total of 260 puppies," 
says a weary-sounding Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be extreme, but most animal films commonly employ several look-alike 
stars, because one dog might excel at one skill, another at something else. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Little Rascals," for example, three dogs portray Petie, the American 
bulldog with a distinctive ring around his eye (courtesy of the makeup crew). 
"The Yellow Dog" was actually five retrievers.  
</P>
<P>
 "To make use of several dogs is completely necessary to show the full range of 
the character," says Borsos. "One dog was better at standing and staring 
without flinching. Another loved to jump and swim. And Dakota, our star dog, 
was livelier and funnier than the others." 
</P>
<P>
 One burning question does occur: can you teach a dog new tricks? 
</P>
<P>
 Treats are the stock in trade on any movie set and dogs are often bribed to 
jump, sit, roll over or -- the easiest of directions -- look hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scene in the movie where the dog is supposed to stare hungrily at a 
bit of food," Borsos said of "The Yellow Dog." "It was fairly simple: The dog's 
trainer just didn't feed him and made him sit there and watch. The dog is not 
acting."  
</P>
<P>
 On some sets, praise and pats are enough motivation; on others, snacks help 
the creative process. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our two dogs had to nuzzle and kiss there would be just a little pablum 
on the collar or under the ear and you'd know where to put the camera," 
"Beethoven's" Daniels said. "It's just like if you're doing a stunt and a guy 
hits another guy. You know where to put the camera so that it looks like he 
really hit him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes tricks are invented on the spur of the moment, or inspired by 
exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one scene where Lassie is supposed to be captured in a net by two 
unscrupulous men," said Petrie. "But you can't get a dog to run into a net. So 
we had two men hold the net down, about a foot off the ground. Then we asked 
the trainer to get behind those men and call the dog. We'd let the dog jump 
over the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we rolled camera and this time they put up the net and capture him. It 
sounds mean -- but you couldn't possibly get the dog to do what you want him to 
do. Then later you apologize to him." Next week: What really goes on when 
animals work on movie sets.

DINOSAURS AT SEA; AIRCRAFT CARRIERS HAVE RULED THE OCEANS SINCE 1945. BUT NOW 
THE FLOATING GIANTS ARE THREATENED BY SHRINKING BUDGETS AND MILITARY 
OBSOLESCENCE.

magazine in Washington, writes frequently on national security matters.

 A 45-knot wind whips along the sprawling flight deck of the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, one of the Navy's state-of-the-art supercarriers. As the ship 
launches and recovers airplanes -- short, squat cargo haulers and sleek 
fighters -- a rescue helicopter chatters in place a few hundred yards away, 
just in case. It's hard to imagine a noisier place on planet Earth. Or a place 
with more stomach-knotting tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the bow of the ship, a pair of steam-driven catapults punches planes into 
the sky. At the other end, homeward-bound planes glide in, wings wobbling with 
last-second alignments and -- if all goes well -- use the sturdy hooks 
suspended from their tails to snag one of four fat arresting cables that extend 
across the deck. With a slam and a roar, they're jerked to a head-snapping stop 
within 350 feet. This action is the stuff of World War II-era "Victory at Sea" 
flag wavers, and it's been a carrier's stock in trade for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Between launchings and recoveries, as the catapults recycle and the arresting 
cable is retracted, sailors in distinctively colored shirts scurry to get ready 
for the next round. Yellow shirts are essentially traffic cops, directing 
planes toward catapults or to out-of-the way spots on the gently pitching deck 
where they'll be chained in place by blue shirts. The red shirts load and 
unload bombs and the air-to-air missiles that, once fired, home in on a 
target's glowing-hot tail pipe. The purple shirts -- the "grapes" -- top off 
the tanks with aviation fuel. Green shirts run the catapults and the arresting 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from a pit stop in a Virginia repair yard, the Eisenhower and its crew 
are cutting wide circles in the Atlantic, about 100 miles east of Norfolk, 
getting ready for another six-months-long deployment to the Mediterranean that 
begins this fall. Since the Navy picked up the keys and drove it away in 1977, 
the Eisenhower has also operated in the North Sea, the Indian Ocean and the 
Caribbean. The ship steamed into the Red Sea not long after Iraq invaded Kuwait 
in 1990. On its expeditions to foreign waters, the Eisenhower's "battle group" 
usually includes nine or so guided-missile cruisers and destroyers and a couple 
of submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier battle groups have been dispatched by American Presidents to show the 
flag in this or that trouble spot since the end of World War II. Between 1946 
and 1990, according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service, carriers 
were involved in 140 "international incidents." Planes from two carriers flew 
in the 1986 raids on Libya. Half a dozen were involved at various times during 
the Persian Gulf War. More recently, carrier-based aircraft have helped enforce 
a "no fly"zone over southern Iraq. And this spring, jets from the Saratoga -- a 
39-year-old carrier that's due to be retired late this summer after its 
Adriatic cruise -- patrolled over the rubble of the former Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in Washington, as Congress thrashes out the federal budget, attempting to 
make tight dollars stretch further, a growing armada of critics maintains that 
these carriers are money-guzzling dinosaurs, vestigial remains of an era when 
the Navy had to be ever-ready to duke it out with the Soviet fleet. But that's 
light years away from the scene in the Eisenhower's bridge, a penthouse-control 
room packed with polished brass and glowing digits and dials. Here, junior 
officers are practicing the routines of steering the ship -- not only getting 
from point A to point B but also, in the process, avoiding a collision with 
another ship or a hull-gouging sandbar that would bring a swift end to their 
(and their commanding officer's) career. And so, as Capt. Alan Mark Gemmill, 
the Eisenhower's skipper since March, 1993, looks on, young officers work with 
quiet intensity to sort out the course and speculate about the intentions of a 
fishing boat whose lights have been spotted a mile or two ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Command of a high-profile ship like the Eisenhower is a primo assignment for 
Gemmill; if he doesn't screw up, he's a good bet to make admiral in a year or 
two. Unlike many other officers who are edging their way to the top of the 
heap, Gemmill isn't a blustering, damn-the-torpedoes kind of guy. He doesn't 
sport one of those five-pound Annapolis rings or a barely disguised contempt 
for civilians who haven't been off to war once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
 A soft-spoken native of Arizona, where he grew up on a cattle ranch, Gemmill 
isn't a graduate of the Naval Academy (University of Arizona, class of 1968). 
He didn't have his ticket punched in Vietnam (by the time he finished flight 
training, the war was all but over). And he hasn't risen from dry-land staff 
jobs in Washington, polishing social skills and schmoozing with members of 
Congress and lobbyists. Instead, he has dutifully toiled as a test pilot and 
run squadrons and, before taking command of the Eisenhower, pulled a wide range 
of duties on other ships. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Navy, whose image is decidedly frayed around the edges these days 
-- thanks in large measure to lingering questions about its treatment of women 
-- Gemmill is tailor-made for the Eisenhower: accessible, media-savvy and 
willing to help shape a positive, "coping-in-the-modern-world" image of the 
carrier and its crew. Since Congress last year lifted its restrictions on women 
serving on ships that might fall into harm's way and picked the Eisenhower to 
be the first warship to which women would be assigned, reporters and 
photographers have been shuttling out to capture the sights and sounds of women 
pilots brushing up their carrier landing skills and to otherwise poke through 
the ship for signs of resentment -- or acceptance -- among the crew. Most of 
the reports include a sound bite or two from the C.O. Though not the glibbest 
of people, Gemmill, whose last command was a supply ship with a "mixed crew" 
(women have been assigned to noncombat vessels for years) -- has been holding 
his own. "We're all grown-ups here," he says, in tones so soft you sometimes 
have to strain to hear. "We'll do what we have to do." It's the new and 
adaptive voice of a carrier force that will have to evolve to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 THE EISENHOWER IS ONE OF THE NAVY'S NIMITZ-CLASS CARRIERS. SIX ARE already in 
the fleet, and two other brand-new models will report for duty in a year or 
two. They've all been modeled on the design for the Nimitz (named for Adm. 
Chester W. Nimitz, who helped revive the Pacific Fleet after Pearl Harbor and 
then directed its battering of Japan) that was completed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Nimitz-class carrier -- perhaps the last of the line -- is at the top 
of the service's shopping list this year. Designated CVN-76 (it doesn't have a 
more formal name yet), it carries a sticker price of nearly $4.5 billion and is 
included in the Clinton Administration's Pentagon budget for fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy -- and the country's ailing shipyards -- have a big stake in CVN-76. 
And it's by no means certain that Congress will vote their way. Not many years 
ago, this wasn't how the world worked. Capitol Hill was four-square behind 
supercarriers. The bigger the better, it seemed. Why? Aside from high-sounding 
patriotic or geopolitical justifications, it was the prospect of several years 
of steady work for thousands of constituents everywhere. A carrier construction 
project, which from start to finish takes at least five years, is prime pork 
wrapped in the stars and stripes. Apart from the tons of metal and vast arrays 
of electronic equipment that make up a supercarrier, each ship comes equipped 
with 2,000 telephones and 30,000 light fixtures; somebody has to make and crate 
and ship all those ingredients. In the process, money makes it way to 
subcontractors in as many as 35 states. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carter, an old Navy man with a radical idea or two, learned that 
fact of political life the hard way after he asked Congress to approve a 
smaller, less expensive carrier that would run on old-fashioned fuel oil 
instead of nuclear power. Capitol Hill was the target of a 21-gun lobbying 
campaign. The Navy and the conglomerates that own most of the shipyards 
maintained that a smaller carrier wouldn't be as cost effective: It wouldn't 
stand up to as much battle damage, would be too slow, and its necessarily 
reduced load of airplanes would have to shrink further to make room for fuel 
tanks. In the end, Congress insisted on another Nimitz-class whopper, the 
Theodore Roosevelt.  
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, during the you-want-it, you-get-it days of the Ronald 
Reagan arms buildup, the White House asked Capitol Hill for money to spend on 
replacements for two World War II-era relics that were nearing retirement age. 
Congress dutifully rubber-stamped nearly $7 billion for the supercarriers 
Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. Later in the decade came a green light 
for the John C. Stennis and the United States. Those two are still being 
assembled at Newport News Shipbuilding near Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
 The blueprints for CVN-76 first slid off the drawing boards when George Bush 
was commander in chief. Last year, after former Defense Secretary Les Aspin's 
"bottom-up" review -- an attempt to sort out how extensive an arsenal the 
United States needs now that it's the only superpower left standing -- the 
Clinton Administration decided to stay the course with CVN-76 and to maintain 
11 active carriers and another in reserve.  
</P>
<P>
 Not a drastic departure from the 15 carriers that the Navy operated during the 
twilight years of the Cold War. But a dozen was the number said to be needed 
(once allowances are made for repair time and crew vacations) to keep an 
American carrier near potential flash points in, say, the Persian Gulf, the 
Western Pacific and the Adriatic. More broadly, the carriers would be a part of 
a slimmed-down military that would still be capable of fighting the equivalent 
of two Persian Gulf Wars at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the post-Cold War world is an even riskier place, CVN-76 
advocates contend. There are the unfriendly rumbles from North Korea, armed to 
the teeth with 55 army divisions and 5,000 tanks. And what about the 
implications of a coup by the likes of Russian nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovksy?  
</P>
<P>
 "If Congress chooses to cut the carrier, the Navy isn't gonna die. But it sure 
as hell will affect our ability to respond to crises," says Vice Adm. Leighton 
W. Smith Jr., until recently a deputy chief of naval operations. He has 
presided over much of his service's planning for life in the post-Cold War 
world, a period when "nobody's going to come after us. We do believe, however, 
that there will be regional crises that have the potential to impact those 
things that are important to our economy. I can't believe we'll always have 
access to those regions from land bases." 
</P>
<P>
 A new carrier isn't that much of an extravagance, the Navy's top brass 
maintain, because they've already cut back so much else. Since the mid-1980s, 
the fleet has shrunk from 546 ships to about 400; by the end of the decade, it 
may number no more than 330 or so. "This year, the Navy will be decommissioning 
more ships than most other nations have in their entire navies," says Smith, 
who is now NATO's commander for southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty of critics on and off Capitol Hill who say that, as a 
general point, nearly four years after the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and 
two years after the former Soviet Union imploded, America's armed services, and 
the Navy in particular, are still allotted too fat a share of the steadily 
shrinking pot of available federal dollars. "The Navy is a force in search of a 
mission, struggling to hold onto the budgetary and institutional gains made 
during the 1980s," defense policy analyst Christopher A. Preble wrote recently 
in a report for the Cato Institute, a Washington think tank. "The Navy should 
de-emphasize the role of aircraft carriers, which are relics of a Cold War 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Several critics -- by no means limited to liberals -- go on to note the many 
places where carriers haven't been in recent years. Like the 1990 evacuations 
from Somalia and Liberia that the Navy orchestrated. And the 1989 raid on 
Panama. These critics would scrap the CVN-76, retire a handful of other 
carriers and keep the ones that are left close to home until they're needed on 
some faraway front. America would no longer be the cop on the beat. "Japan and 
Australia should be expected to assume a larger burden in the Western Pacific," 
Preble said. "And Great Britain, France and Germany should be expected to do 
the same" in their spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 America's carriers, proposed and already built, are tempting targets. This 
year, for the first time since 1990, defense spending accounts can be raided by 
members of Congress scrambling to find money for, say, some underfinanced 
domestic program; heretofore, "fire walls" kept budget raiders at bay. A few 
weeks ago, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the more or less objective, 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, told the House Armed Services 
Committee that forcing the Navy to get by with 10 carriers (and reducing the 
Army by three divisions) would produce nearly $23 billion in savings over five 
years. The CBO calculations included money that wouldn't be spent on, say, the 
80-odd airplanes that are usually packed by a supercarrier and on the 
accompanying "battle group."  
</P>
<P>
 The carrier fleet could also end up in the sights of lawmakers who have no 
qualms about the size of the proposed Pentagon budget -- or in fact assert that 
it should be larger -- but maintain that much less should be spent on such 
big-ticket items as the CVN-76 and much more on training troops and keeping 
their tanks and warplanes up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, many in Navy blue (and Marine Corps green) complain that carriers 
eat up money that could be more wisely invested in fast troop and cargo ships 
or on big new cargo planes. Their concerns were summed up forcefully in early 
March, in congressional testimony by Marine Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, who runs the 
Central Command. Generals and admirals almost never admit out loud that they 
have enough of anything, but Hoar, whose command extends from eastern Africa to 
the Persian Gulf and Iran, has a reputation for blistering forthrightness and 
thus greater credibility. The Senate Armed Services Committee sat up and 
listened when he declared that the American military doesn't have enough troop 
and cargo planes for one good-sized war abroad, much less two.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so privately, there are growing fears that before long, America's military 
will, as it did after the post-Vietnam cutbacks (and the sharp reductions that 
followed World War II and the Korean War) look good on paper but be unfit to 
fight. "Readiness -- the ability of forces to fight on short notice -- is an 
apple-pie issue on Capitol Hill," says Andrew F. Krepinevich, an analyst with 
the private Defense Budget Project. "There's a strong aversion on the part of 
the White House and senior civilian leadership to expose themselves to charges 
that the military isn't ready to fight." But he raises questions about whether 
the United States can afford all that readiness. "We can't buy that big a force 
and keep it ready with the money that's available. Something's got to give."  
</P>
<P>
 A DECADE AGO, THE DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. CVN-76 WOULD be a done 
deal, because Congress has already approved $832 million for its nuclear power 
plant. Once upon a time, notwithstanding the grumbles about how several 
billions could be better spent, that down payment would have all but guaranteed 
that the ship would be built. That's not the case now, given Congress' vote 
last year to kill the superconducting super collider, in which the federal 
government had already invested about $2 billion. Clearly, down payments don't 
mean what they used to. If the CVN-76 project is dropped before it's completed 
-- and under the Navy's best-case scenario, which doesn't allow for any 
shortages of skilled shipyard workers or any labor disputes that could delay 
construction, it wouldn't join the fleet until 2003 -- the CVN-76 could be 
cannibalized, its parts used as spares for other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol Hill takes its time, so the squabble over CVN-76 is likely to extend 
through much of this year. Even if Congress waves the new carrier through this 
year, the debate could be revived in the future. One of the first shots was 
fired in the House Armed Services Committee by the chairman, Ronald V. Dellums, 
a Democrat from Oakland, whose views count for a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, his first as chairman, wasn't an easy one for him. The base-closing 
commission targeted several Navy facilities in his district, one of them a 
carrier home port, the Alameda Naval Air Station. He did, however, block an 
effort by House hawks to speed up consideration of CVN-76. This year, the new 
carrier is clearly on his mind. During a recent session with Navy Secretary 
John H. Dalton, Dellums declared: "There is serious doubt whether the muscular 
battle group bought for the Cold War -- centered around nuclear aircraft 
carriers -- is necessary or even appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dellums' comments are still reverberating around the nation's mostly empty 
dry-docks; without CVN-76, the financial conditions of many of the nation's 
failing shipyards will drastically worsen. Some may die. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1960s, it was standing-room-only in the yards. Metal was being bent 
around the clock in shipyards on both sea coasts, along the Gulf of Mexico and 
all around the Great Lakes. America's shipbuilders ruled the waves. The 
domestic industry's decline began after Japan Inc. opened for business. During 
the Nixon Administration, Washington began propping up U.S. shipbuilders with 
financial grants. That helped. So did the oil shocks of the 1970s, when barrels 
of crude worth their weight in gold sparked a demand for big new tankers. But 
what one Republican gave, another took away. The Reagan Administration killed 
the grants, and the industry's plunge accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors have staggered along on military contracts; the Navy's 1985 
budget included money for 29 new ships. Now, that business is drying up; this 
year's budget would underwrite, at most, six new vessels. The federal subsidies 
are gone, but Washington has been helping keep some of the survivors in 
business by spreading around what are essentially make-work projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has two yards left with the specialized know-how and 
equipment to assemble nuclear-powered warships -- Newport News Shipbuilding, a 
unit of Tenneco Inc., and the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp., 
in Connecticut. Newport News can build carriers and submarines; Electric Boat 
is a subs-only yard. After intense lobbying by General Dynamics, the Clinton 
Administration's "bottom-up" reviewers decided to keep two 
"nuclear-construction-capable" shipyards in business. Accordingly, the White 
House's 1995 budget includes money for a $2-billion nuclear submarine that, 
most specialists say, the Navy doesn't need. But it will help keep the lights 
burning at Electric Boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, CVN-76 is considered a capability saver. Says a congressional aide 
who is a national security specialist: "During the Cold War, these carriers 
were justified for military reasons. In the case of CVN-76, it's said to be 
more a matter of 'industrial policy.' We have to build it, and right away, or 
we'll lose the capacity to build supercarriers. If we delay it even for a year, 
laid-off shipyard workers with hard-to-replace skills might be lost for good."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, barring a flood of orders for commercial projects, a green light for 
CVN-76 could merely postpone an inevitable collapse, according to shipbuilding 
industry spokesmen, who reflexively see bad omens everywhere. "Currently, we 
have about 100,000 people in the industry," says John J. Stocker, president of 
the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade association that's based in 
Washington's Virginia suburbs. "By 1998, we'll be down to 28,000 even if the 
new carrier is approved. If we lose the carrier, the industry will be wiped off 
the map." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be a stretch, but Newport News Shipbuilding, Virginia's largest 
employer, would be the biggest corporate loser if plans for the new carrier are 
scuttled. In 1987, at the peak of the Reagan Administration's arms binge, the 
yard had 31,000 workers; now its payroll is nearer 22,000. Without CVN-76? 
Maybe no more than 5,000 after the yard wraps up other Navy projects it's 
working on. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wouldn't be good news for San Diego's National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. 
The shipyard's business was once roughly 50% Navy, 50% civilian. It is famous 
as the place where the Exxon Valdez oil tanker was built and later repaired. 
The yard's work is now "virtually 100% military," says Fred N. Hallett, 
NASSCO's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 NASSCO, which has a payroll of nearly 3,500, is the last yard on the West 
Coast that builds ships for the Navy (Long Beach just repairs them). After 
stumbling through the 1980s, NASSCO landed contracts for four high-speed supply 
ships whose gas-turbine engines and exotic transmission gears would make them 
fast enough to keep up with supercarriers (which can bat along at nearly 40 
miles an hour). Plagued by an array of problems -- some caused by ever-changing 
Navy specifications, some by shipyard mismanagement -- the first ship was 
delivered to the Navy in February, three years late and way over budget. The 
yard says it's losing money on the supply ships. If CVN-76 is shelved, or if 
the Navy is forced to reduce its carrier fleet further, the yard's future could 
be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 AROUND THE NAVY, SOME carrier boosters say it's easy to pinpoint when the 
CVN-76 and the rest of the carrier fleet, along with the Navy in general, began 
to lose their luster. Not when Commander in Chief Reagan gave up the Oval 
Office. Not when Bill Clinton (who, during the 1992 presidential campaign, 
maintained that 10 carriers would be plenty) took charge. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the troubles started with the Persian Gulf War. In the view of many 
analysts, the war provided proof positive that the carriers -- which might have 
performed admirably in an open-ocean, no-holds-barred war with the Soviet Union 
-- aren't very well suited for "regional" conflicts. Those analysts claim that 
supercarriers just aren't that super in an era when any Third World nation with 
a few bucks can get a good deal on ship-crippling cruise missiles or simple but 
deadly waterborne mines. 
</P>
<P>
 An especially pointed post-mortem -- the handiwork of Navy Capt. Charles R. 
Girvin, a 30-year veteran who had a front-row seat during the war -- appeared 
in a mid-1993 issue of the authoritative Proceedings of the U.S. Naval 
Institute. "Despite the use of six aircraft carriers -- with crews totaling 
more than 30,000 men -- accompanied by extensive cruiser, destroyer and frigate 
escorts, postwar analysis . . . confirmed that the carrier aviation 
contribution to the air campaign was minor compared to the land-based air 
forces," he wrote. "The carriers simply were not needed." All in all, Girvin 
asserted, the war showcased the effectiveness of relatively inexpensive mines, 
which forced much of the American Navy to keep its distance, and the "huge 
success" of Tomahawk cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Navy officials shrug off Girvin and other critics as 
"shortsighted." They insist that the Navy and its carriers did just fine; the 
problem is that the service lost the public relations war. "The Air Force got 
the glory," a senior Navy spin master grumps. "They had better gun-sight 
cameras (that provided those extra sharp, video-game-quality shots of targets 
being destroyed by 'smart' bombs), they provided better access to the news 
media. The Navy did an awful job. From one half to a third of our ships over 
there banned reporters; the ships' captains didn't want to bother." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he continues, ships' captains everywhere have been ordered to bother. 
This year, the Navy went out of its way to accommodate reporters who wanted to 
ride the carrier Saratoga around the Adriatic; television crews found smiling 
sailors ready and willing to transmit their footage back to their home offices. 
Same with the Eisenhower and its history-making rendezvous with women in 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 As a part of what could be called Operation Bounce Back, the Navy is also 
experimenting with innovative ways of using its carriers, to show that even 
dinosaurs can learn new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't always succeed. Last year, the Navy dabbled with making the carrier 
Ranger a troop transport. More than 500 Marines -- complete with 
ground-fighting gear and helicopters -- were loaded up for a cruise to the 
Mediterranean. When the Marines strapped on their backpacks and other 
equipment, they could barely maneuver through the carrier's narrow passageways 
and steep ladders. "We might not do that again," a senior Navy commander says 
dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 During its coming deployment, the Eisenhower may be involved in watch-us-adapt 
experiments. At various times, the ship may take on Army special forces troops 
or Air Force units. Or the carrier and its accompanying cruisers and 
destroyers, some of them equipped with the most sophisticated radars anywhere, 
might engage in a little make-believe SCUD busting. Operating 20 miles or so 
offshore, they'd go through the motions of detecting hypothetical enemy 
missiles fired at a hypothetical Marine landing. Because the ships don't carry 
anti-missile missiles, they would practice relaying radar data to hypothetical 
batteries of Army Patriot missiles. That's all according to Gemmill's immediate 
boss, Rear Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., who commands the Eisenhower's battle 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Gehman is an intense, wiry man who commanded patrol boats during the Vietnam 
War and has held high-level staff jobs in Washington. A high-tech command 
center is being installed next to his office, where coffee cups rattle whenever 
a snagged plane crashes to a stop on the flight deck, to help ships more 
quickly pass along what they've learned about an enemy's missile firings. 
Gehman isn't an aviator; his tours at sea have mostly been on cruisers and 
destroyers. But he talks the talk. "Carriers were bought at the height of the 
Cold War for open-ocean conflicts. Now the world has changed. We have to adapt 
to new international arrangements and to new threats." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds, of course, that "we have to have carriers to meet those threats." But 
in the increasingly hostile climate facing the carrier fleet, that conclusion, 
like his exercises, may only be hypothetical.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: IN THE FIELD; IT'S 
AUTHENTIC (BETTER NOT SAY REAL DEAL) 'LITTLE BIG LEAGUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his University of Virginia days, long before he and his friends started up 
the super-successful Castle Rock Entertainment, Andrew Scheinman played on the 
varsity tennis team and hung out with jocks. Sports is a world he knows -- and 
movies purporting to reflect it often don't, he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't look like athletes, strategy is often faulty, expressions are 
tossed out that aren't really used," Scheinman observes. "Ron Shelton's 'Bull 
Durham' was one of the few that felt real -- except for a scene in which 
(pitcher) Tim Robbins hit the mascot with a pitch. That would never really 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Little Big League," Scheinman's directorial debut scheduled for release 
June 29, a 12-year-old (Luke Edwards) inherits the Minnesota Twins from his 
grandfather (Jason Robards) and names himself manager. The premise may be 
fanciful, Scheinman says, but the details are not. 
</P>
<P>
 The director recruited more than a dozen major league players to make cameo 
appearances. Among them: pitcher Randy Johnson and outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. 
of the Seattle Mariners, second baseman Carlos Baerga and catcher Sandy Alomar 
of the Cleveland Indians, outfielder Paul O'Neill of the New York Yankees and 
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to casting actors, Scheinman opted for athletic prowess over star 
power. "Thirtysomething's" Timothy Busfield, who once set his sights on a 
baseball career, still pitches in a semipro league in Sacramento. Jonathan 
Silverman ("Weekend at Bernie's") was suggested by Billy Crystal, with whom he 
plays in the annual celebrity game at Dodger Stadium. Two actors with major 
league experience -- ex-Met shortstop Kevin Elster and former Reds pitcher Brad 
Lesley -- joined former Cub all-star Leon (Bull) Durham as cast members and 
full-time technical advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great luxury being able to ask an actor to hit a line drive down 
third and have him actually be able to do it," says Scheinman.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources report that the $20 million "Little Big League" has tested as well as 
any other Castle Rock hit, including "A Few Good Men" and "City Slickers" -- 
good news in light of the fact that the movie was regarded by some as a "vanity 
project" -- awarded to Scheinman because of his Castle Rock position. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say I was between a rock and a hard place," Scheinman concedes. 
"But my partners -- and they're the only ones whose opinions I care about -- 
know this isn't new territory for me. I'm doing the same things I've been 
doing: cutting pictures, working on scripts. Now that it's my film, of course, 
it ups the ante. It's a lot more fun . . . but the choices -- and the 
responsibility -- are mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheinman dismisses any suggestion of competition between him and Castle Rock 
partner/director Rob Reiner, whose family film "North" opens less than a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more concern, he says, is Caravan Pictures' rival baseball movie "Angels in 
the Outfield," scheduled for release July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Caravan chief Joe Roth, however, believes there's room for them both. "People 
like to go back to subjects that are familiar . . . as long as there's a 
twist," he says. "Baseball films were once considered box-office poison, but, 
as a producer and (former) studio chief, I've been involved with four -- all of 
them hits. "*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: RAIN (MAN) FORREST; RIVAL 
STUDIOS LOVE 'GUMP,' GLAD THEY'RE NOT SELLING IT

 "Forrest Gump" may be tough to peg. But director Robert Zemeckis' fable about 
the meaning of life through the eyes of a mentally impaired Southern bumpkin 
has had no trouble capturing the biggest industry buzz of just about any 
upcoming summer film. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 6 Paramount Pictures release, starring Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin 
Wright and a few cameos of dead Presidents, has been heaped with praise by the 
nation's exhibitors and executives from competing studios. Even those who have 
only seen the "Gump" trailer are doling out kudos -- a relatively uncommon 
phenomenon from Hollywood rivals. And some haven't even seen the trailer but 
are riding on word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing an oft-heard prediction, a 20th Century Fox executive believes that 
the movie will likely be an Oscar contender. Another Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer vice 
president expects it to be one of the top 10 box-office films of the year. And 
a Warner Bros. distribution executive said that the consensus from exhibitors 
is "universally great." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite all the plaudits, Paramount sources reveal that the studio has 
had a tough time trying to figure out how to sell this picture in the summer's 
crowded marketplace, especially since it is not "high concept," or easily 
described. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, officials from the studio refuse to talk about how they plan to 
position "Gump" against the competitive summer product. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a comedy, not a drama and not comparable to movies like 1988's Tom 
Hanks fantasy-comedy "Big"; 1979's "Being There," starring Peter Sellers as a 
simpleton gardener, or 1988's Oscar-winning drama "Rain Man," with Dustin 
Hoffman as an idiot savant as some would like to pigeonhole it, says Paramount 
spokeswoman Cheryl Boone Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a fantasy, but not really." she explained. "Around here, we've 
called it a docu-fable. But it's just unique and it will be handled that way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gump" producer Wendy Finerman, who tracked down Winston Groom's book nine 
years ago and has been trying to make the movie ever since, has been assured 
Paramount will handle the picture in a "special way." She said, "This is one of 
those movies where you laugh and cry, (it's) just a very magical story" about a 
guy with an IQ of 75. That's why I was so determined to see it made someday." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors and studio competitors expect "special" to mean Paramount will 
sneak the picture, possibly twice, and let it build momentum on strong word of 
mouth advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was them that's the way I would handle it," says Warner Bros. 
distribution president Barry Reardon. "We had a picture like this, 'Dave,' that 
didn't fit comfortably into any niche. So we did double sneak previews, first 
in 230 (theaters), then in 500. And it worked like a charm. The word of mouth 
spread." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the film and I know there's only one real way to sell this 
picture," concurs John Krier of Exhibitor Relations, "word of mouth." He 
suggests that the reason there's a lot of buzz on this film is that "it is so 
unusual, not the same old twist on all the other movies you've ever seen. It's 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added, "Some exhibitors thought it was a bit of a downer because 
of allusions to Vietnam and what happens with the girl he loves. But most loved 
it."*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: STUNT MAN; HARRELSON 
REMOVES HAT, REVEALS MORE THAN SCALP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Anyone who knows actor Woody Harrelson knows this is someone who isn't exactly 
shy or afraid to reveal himself -- literally. Friends and associates say he's 
playful, flirtatious, loves to show off his body and enjoys playing practical 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the not-so-modest guy who appeared in just a cowboy hat and 
skin-tight Calvin Klein briefs in a 60-foot billboard above Times Square for a 
few days in December, parodying rapper Marky Mark's pouty Calvin ads. The 
billboard, featuring a Herb Ritts photo of a well-endowed Harrelson, was shot 
for a scene to appear in the actor's summer movie "The Cowboy Way." 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle generated much buzz on the streets of Manhattan and around 
Hollywood, but didn't cause nearly as much jaw-dropping as the even more 
provocative stunt Harrelson pulled months earlier on the set of the Imagine 
Films-produced movie, which Universal Pictures will release June 3. It co-stars 
Kiefer Sutherland, and features the two as real cowboys off to New York to 
rescue a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, about two weeks into the location shoot in Santa Fe, some 50 
or so cast, crew and friends were watching Harrelson film a scene in which he 
runs out of his house wearing only cowboy boots and a cowboy hat covering his 
privates (one of the film's biggest laughs stems from the scene). On the third 
take, the actor shocked the onlookers by intentionally dropping his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally shocked," recalls actress Kristin Baer, who stars in the scene 
as a rodeo queen and Harrelson's part-time girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone was really startled -- and I was pleasantly surprised," 
added the actress on a phone interview, joking, "Now we really know that Woody 
is a really big star." 
</P>
<P>
 Baer, a New York stage and television actress, said that even though the 
incident was unexpected and shocking, it didn't surprise her coming from 
Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woody loves to joke and play around," says Baer. By dropping his hat, Baer 
said, "Woody wanted to make a point and he made it. When the billboard went up 
in Times Square, let's just say it was a fitting tribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Brian Grazer, who co-heads Imagine Entertainment with director Ron 
Howard, said that David Geffen suggested they put Harrelson on the Times Square 
billboard, a feat the entertainment mogul had no problem accomplishing with a 
simple phone call to his good buddy Calvin Klein.*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: DRILL MEN; YOU'RE IN THE 
ARMY NOW, PVT. MARKY MARK. YIKES! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Everyone knows what an Army drill sergeant is like. He snorts and snarls and 
the veins stick out of his neck as he curses any recruit whose shirt isn't 
tucked in, shoe isn't tied or bed isn't creased as flat as a board. They shout 
more four-letter words than a Joe Pesci character. It isn't a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, they aren't really like that. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that isn't the basic training instructor depicted in "Renaissance 
Man," a Penny Marshall-directed film from Disney's Touchstone banner that 
debuts June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors may think it's Disney trying to sanitize the Army, but the 
filmmakers insist they discovered what today's Army really is like when they 
filmed basic training scenes at Ft. Jackson in Columbia, S.C. The Army 
cooperated in the filming. 
</P>
<P>
 The original script of "Renaissance Man" called for drill sergeants to do lots 
of cursing, recalled producer Sara Colleton, who helped develop the project 
with screenwriter Jim Burnstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colleton quickly found that their ideas of shrill sergeants stemmed more 
from old movie cliches than the current volunteer Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very different nowadays," Colleton said. "It used to be that you 
sort of destroyed them and rebuilt them. Now, the new philosophy is to try to 
find something in each kid and build them up from there."  
</P>
<P>
 The producer said that the Army gave them free access to Ft. Jackson. "And not 
just a group of drill sergeants on their best behavior. . . . We were free to 
go around and soak up reality and were there for about a week on a research 
trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The film stars Danny DeVito as Bill Rago, an advertising executive who writes 
clever ad copy to sell Roach Motels and discovers he's not qualified for 
anything else. After being dumped, then humbled at the unemployment office, he 
finds one job that he may vaguely be suited for -- a short-term assignment 
teaching borderline washouts at a nearby Army post. Gregory Hines plays a drill 
sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army believes that the enlistees -- who include Kadeem Hardison and Mark 
Wahlberg (a.k.a. rapper Marky Mark) -- are so dimwitted that they can't even 
make it through basic training. Enter DeVito's character, who gets them to 
believe in themselves by reading Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleton said the actors actually had to go through 10 days of basic training 
and, as part of the agreement with the Army, the actors came under fort 
regulations whenever they were in uniform. As a result, Marky Mark got 
reprimanded one day from an officer who drove by and noticed a recruit -- whom 
he didn't know was an actor -- walking past with his hat on backward.

THE ARTFUL EXILE FROM DUSHANBE; FIRST DAVLAT KHUDONAZAROV LOST THE PRESIDENCY 
OF HIS BELOVED TAJIKISTAN, THEN HE LOST EVERYTHING ELSE. FORCED INTO EXILE, THE 
CHARISMATIC FILMMAKER AND POLITICIAN MAY BE HIS COUNTRY'S GREAT HOPE FOR UNITY

<P>
 On a crisp winter morning last February, many of Washington's ranking gurus in 
the ways and wiles of the old Soviet Union slipped out of offices at government 
agencies, think tanks and universities to gather at Georgetown's arty Biograph 
movie theater. The occasion was a screening of "First Morning of Youth," a 
14-year-old film in Russian shot in the remote Pamir Mountains of the Himalayas 
about the human impact of the 1917 communist revolution -- a revolution now 
distinctly over. 
</P>
<P>
 The film might have seemed passe, except that it was made by Davlat 
Khudonazarov, the charismatic chairman of the Filmmakers' Union in Moscow who 
has emerged from the Soviet ashes as one of the region's new political stars. 
Indeed, his record in mixing politics and art over the past five years would 
shame any of Hollywood's activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his kind of artistic and political activism, the stakes are much higher," 
said Blair Ruble, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute 
for Advanced Russian Studies. "At every point of his life, he's been pushing 
the envelope further and further, first in terms of artistic expression and 
then in politics. And he's never wavered, despite the odds." 
</P>
<P>
 Artistically, Khudonazarov's haunting movies are best described as a cross 
between Steven Spielberg's portrayal of history's obscenities in "Schindler's 
List" and Robert Altman's portrait of human foibles in "Short Cuts." Because of 
their searing morality and simple human settings, the New Republic described 
his films as "touchingly poetic in the manner of Satyajit Ray," the great 
Indian director. 
</P>
<P>
 For "First Morning," Khudonazarov won two of the 15 major film prizes he's 
accumulated from both the Soviet Union and his native Tajikistan over a 28-year 
career. French critic Jean Radvanyi cited the film as an example of a new 
genre: "The poetic metaphor, particular to the Tajik national mind, gave birth 
to classic grand works, as poetic as they are epic." 
</P>
<P>
 "First Morning" also won wide praise from Washington's experts on the region. 
"In lyrical feeling and cinematographic technique, it ranks with any of the 
films that have received Academy Award nominations for best foreign film in 
recent years," said Harley Balzer, director of Russian Area Studies at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, Khudonazarov has been widely compared by the Western press to 
Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's foremost playwright who became his country's 
first freely elected president. Khudonazarov first emerged in the late 1980s as 
a reformist in the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet 
as both went through the pangs of change and eventual self-dissolution. After 
the union broke up in 1991, he was then drafted by the new Democratic Party to 
run for president of Tajikistan, the poorest and southernmost of the 15 former 
Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 He had widespread support, ranging from the labor movement to the Islamic 
Renaissance Party, and it was easy to see why. A man of immense energy with an 
endearing smile and talkative hands, Khudonazarov looks like an artist but can 
talk like a learned politician. His black hair is slightly long and shaggy, his 
dark beard tipped with white. When he smiles, as he does often, the still 
strong youthfulness in his face makes him look almost impish; when he's 
serious, his deep brown eyes turn soulful. Either way, he's accessible, candid 
and generally simpatico. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Havel, however, he lost the 1991 presidential election. Of seven 
candidates, he finished second in a contest that experts both in and outside 
the region believe was rigged against him. The election was won by the 
Communist Party -- the only one in any of the former Soviet republics defiantly 
still ruling under its original name. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, the tensions that played out before and during the election 
disintegrated into what still ranks as the most violent war in any of the 
former Soviet republics. Up to 50,000 Tajiks have been killed and half a 
million -- or 10% of the 5 million population -- forced to flee into the 
countryside, to neighboring Afghanistan or to Moscow. Among the new refugees 
were Khudonazarov and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the war waned as the government consolidated its hold with the 
help of Russian troops and, according to the international human rights group 
Helsinki Watch, "gross violations of human rights," including summary 
executions, disappearances and actions by paramilitary groups that "openly 
terrorize" suspected Tajik dissidents. Tajikistan now has a reputation as the 
most ruthless regime spawned by the union's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Khudonazarov hasn't given up. He is still campaigning for democratic 
change even though he has to do it on the run -- exiled from his country and 
robbed of his home, belongings, resources and even his precious films. For the 
Biograph showing, he had to borrow a copy from a Moscow museum. 
</P>
<P>
 I FIRST MET KHUDONAZAROV IN DUSHANBE, THE TAJIK CAPITAL, IN 1991. I was on a 
tour of the five republics in Central Asia shortly after the abortive August 
coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev that was the death knell for the Soviet 
Union. The five little "stans" with tongue-twisting names -- which included 
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan -- had just declared 
independence from Moscow, ending more than 150 years of Russian imperial and 
then Soviet communist rule. Open to visitors for the first time, they were 
exotic new places waiting to be discovered by the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajikistan was my last stop. Despite the sterile Stalinesque architecture and 
the imposed Russian language and culture in each capital, Central Asia had 
managed to defy Russian absorption. The look and feel of the region -- 
waist-high gladioli in city parks, vast cotton fields or rugged mountains still 
populated by nomadic herdsmen in the countryside, bright ethnic dress and a 
sunny, temperate climate -- are quite distinct. So are the people. Unlike the 
residents of their European sister republics, the Tajiks and their ethnic 
brethren are truly Asian. Their features reflect the widely varying mixture of 
Indo-European, Turkic and Mongol tribes and traders that for centuries roamed 
the steppes and the ancient Silk Route from China through Central Asia and the 
Mideast to Europe. They are also predominantly Muslim, and many are now in the 
process of rediscovering their Sunni faith. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Soviets as well as the earlier Russian monarchy, keeping Tajikistan 
and its Central Asian sisters in line was always an issue. In the 1920s, after 
a series of uprisings, Stalin arbitrarily divided legendary Turkestan into five 
separate republics to prevent a lasting pan-Turkic or pan-Islamic bloc from 
emerging inside the southern Soviet frontier. Then he forcibly moved millions 
of Russians to "settle," administer and effectively Russify Central Asia. Yet 
throughout its existence, the Soviet Union's sharpest internal split remained 
between the European provinces and the Asian republics. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived in the Tajik capital, Khudonazarov, who was in the throes of 
campaigning for the presidency, most personified the excitement and 
expectations then in the air. On the back stairs outside an old house used by 
the local labor movement -- where the biggest poster was of Arnold 
Schwarzenegger -- we began a conversation that would resume again and again 
over the next three years. During that first meeting, Khudonazarov reflected 
briefly on the ironies in an erratic career that led him to become the premier 
democrat in Tajikistan and one of the first in all the old union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I ran for the presidency, the most dramatic moment in my life was in 
1956, during the 12th Congress of the Communist Party, when Stalin was 
disgraced," he recalled. "I was a teen-ager and it was a very hard moment for 
me. I believed in Stalin. I was brought up in the Tajik mountains, the son of 
peasants, living the life of a shepherd. Up in those mountains, Stalin was a 
god. All of a sudden, he turned out to be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about his platform, of his hopes to reconcile European and Islamic 
cultures as the basis for coexistence both internally and regionally. He 
explained the need to devolve power from Dushanbe's clannish elite to 
Tajikistan's diverse and often rival provinces. And he outlined economic 
reforms to attract European as well as nearby Asian interest and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was realistic, however, about the depth of independent Tajikistan's 
problems. "We don't have proper sovereignty yet. We'll need something like the 
Marshall Plan to revive this republic and to eventually achieve real 
independence. If we gain economic freedom, political freedom will follow," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to democracy was indeed Tajikistan's pervasive poverty. 
An average Tajik earned less than half of a Russian's income in 1988. By 1991, 
Tajikistan accounted for less than 1% of the Soviet economic output. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajikistan, which is 90% mountains, was always the least developed region of 
the Soviet Union. During my visit, Dushanbe had a worn feeling about it, from 
crumbling roads to low-wattage bulbs in public buildings that made rooms dim 
even during daylight hours. Although the other Central Asian capitals were 
flowing with local agricultural produce, Dushanbe's open-air market had 
pitifully little. Bread lines were starting to be a problem. And if its 
department stores were any guide, Dushanbe, the most distant capital from 
Moscow, seemed to be a dumping ground. Rural areas of Tajikistan were less 
polluted, congested and crumbling, but visiting them was like going back in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources were so scarce that candidate Khudonazarov had little more than 
pocket money to pay for a presidential race in a country almost four times the 
size of Switzerland. He had no paid support staff. But the problem wasn't just 
finances. Publicity videotapes made at state-owned television turned out -- 
always "accidentally" -- to be blank or to have other technical problems when 
they were supposed to be broadcast. Khudonazarov also had trouble just getting 
campaign posters, which local companies refused to print. "They had all worked 
for the Communist Party. So for me, they were otherwise engaged," he explained, 
with a wry grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Khudonazarov was also realistic about the enduring hold of the old communists. 
"Decolonialization will take 10 or 15 years. We know for sure that the way will 
be difficult," he predicted. "On the one hand, we have the forces of renewal, 
and on the other the hanging on of a feudal regime and the nomenklatura. The 
battle won't end with the election." 
</P>
<P>
 His local fame and his winsome character probably made Khudonazarov the only 
person who had any hope of succeeding. "Davlat played a heroic role in standing 
up and running as an opposition candidate," remarked the Smithsonian 
Institution's Blair Ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government had never faced opposition. And had he not run, there probably 
wouldn't have been a serious candidate. But in so doing, he put his life on the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 KHUDONAZAROV'S FORAY INTO POLITICS PARALLELS HIS FILM CAREER. Indeed, the two 
often intersect. The obstructions in both would have exhausted lesser men, 
although getting him to talk about the ordeals isn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
 "My first film in 1966 was a 10-minute short called 'Lullaby' about life in 
the Pamir Mountains. I thought it was lyrical and warm. The critics said it 
marked the beginning of poetry in film in Tajikistan. It showed village life -- 
people dressed as they really were, dirty and working in the fields," he told 
the audience at the Biograph theater. "I didn't think it was negative. But it 
was banned as anti-Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, all documentaries showed the sunny side of life. There were 
parades, people were well-dressed and well-shaven. And every film that had been 
done before on the Pamirs was about people in colorful clothing happily 
collecting the harvest -- like it was a festival. That was the kind of image 
that the government wanted to present." 
</P>
<P>
 Khudonazarov's "Lullaby," with its subliminal focus on Tajikistan's ancient 
Pamiri mountain culture, was also exactly what Moscow and its surrogates in 
Dushanbe most feared. The government burned all copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 22 at the time, Khudonazarov had already proven to be an exception. He 
was admitted to the All Union Institute of Film in Moscow at age 16. But 
because of "Lullaby," the government didn't even let his next film get off the 
ground. It was to be a documentary about the millions who perished in Stalin's 
massive purges in the 1930s. Khudonazarov had spent a year buried in state 
archives personally researching several cases, including one about Tajikistan's 
first leader, who was also the first Tajik to be purged. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the unmade movie clearly preoccupied him. But it wasn't until 
one of our final talks that he mentioned another morsel from his research. In 
the archives, he also uncovered information about his own family -- 
grandparents who had been shot and parents who, as children, had been separated 
and dispatched to camps for "children of the enemies of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been intrigued with history and its lessons," he said, in 
explaining why he'd chosen this subject for his first full-length film. "I 
wanted people to know the truth and to tell them about the people who had been 
forgotten. The lack of knowledge separates generations from each other. 
Knowledge connects people." 
</P>
<P>
 With his first film destroyed and his second banned, Khudonazarov spent the 
next 13 years restricted to lower-level jobs as director of photography on nine 
films and 15 documentary shorts. He finally got a break in 1978, when Moscow 
television gave permission to shoot "First Morning." It won rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Khudonazarov had resisted the Communist Party throughout the 
1960s and '70s. "They asked me to join many times, but each time I said no. I 
thought I was so rebellious that I'd be fired," he said, chuckling. But in 
1982, after a friend advised him that prospects of making his own films would 
probably end if he turned down another "invitation," he finally signed up. "I 
also thought I could make a difference inside the party. I decided I was ready 
to fight the conservatives in the party. So I became the opposition inside it." 
</P>
<P>
 This didn't end his professional problems. In 1984, he directed a documentary 
on the history of Tajikistan. It, too, was promptly banned. Tajik Communist 
Party boss Rakhman Nabiyev said the film, which ran 90 minutes, was too long. 
</P>
<P>
 But as reform swept the Kremlin in the late '80s, Khudonazarov's star rose. 
For a change, he had the right credentials. In 1989, he was elected to the 
Soviet Parliament. In 1990, he was named to the Supreme Soviet's Committee on 
Science, Public Education and Culture. Forced to put his films on hold, he told 
a Western journalist at the time that he felt "as if I'm neglecting one of my 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 But he lasted less than two years. After the August, 1991, putsch against 
Gorbachev, he quit the party in frustration and anger. "Democratizing the party 
turned out to be too hard a task. The party's reactionary essence led to its 
inevitable demise," he told me two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Khudonazarov was ready to go back to making movies full time, and he had 
plenty to do with the Soviet Filmmakers' Union, which had elected him chairman 
in 1990. Then the Soviet Union fell into 15 independent pieces, and he instead 
found himself running for the presidency against Communist Party candidate 
Nabiyev -- the old party boss who'd banned his films. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he lost and, for the time being, so did democracy in Tajikistan. 
By official count, Khudonazarov won 30.5% of the vote, Nabiyev 57%. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he urged reconciliation. "I gave speeches and said, whether we like 
the new president or not, he is elected. And while he is the first, he will not 
be the last. We have to find legal paths to build a civil society and a 
legitimate government," he explained. Khudonazarov returned to Moscow, where he 
was asked to stay on as chairman of the new Confederation of Filmmakers' 
Unions. 
</P>
<P>
 But as trouble, including secessionist demands, spiraled in the first half of 
1992, Tajik politicians and friends appealed to him to return and help mediate. 
"He had been in the hospital with a heart problem, but they said they needed 
his help, so he went anyway," said his wife, Gavhar Djuraeva, who has 
collaborated on some of her husband's films. 
</P>
<P>
 "For almost a month, he went to the places where there was trouble or fighting 
to speak to both sides. It was terribly dangerous because not everyone wanted 
peace. Four times they tried to kill him. I remember how he'd call me at 3 a.m. 
or 6 a.m. and say, 'See, I'm still alive.' But eventually he got them around a 
peace table. After that, many prisoners were freed." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nancy Lubin, a Central Asian specialist at the Center for 
Post-Soviet Studies, "Davlat has that rare combination of impressive, creative 
intellect and enormous political skill. As confrontation among the former 
communists and opposition democratic and Islamic factions intensified, he 
became the only mediator with whom all of the warring parties were willing to 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ceasefire lasted only a month, as the Tajik president undermined his 
efforts. Tensions there disintegrated into full-scale war. Then, shortly after 
his last trip in December, 1992, Khudonazarov was indicted in absentia for 
inciting rebellion -- despite an earlier parliamentary commendation for his 
peace efforts. The charges carry a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a symbol of the opposition against the government," Lubin said. 
"The debate centered around him. So he became a target." 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent government raids on his home, his films were seized and 
destroyed -- and much of his life's work disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN THE RUSSIAN PRESS REPORTED LAST YEAR THAT HIT MEN WERE pursuing 
Khudonazarov as far as Moscow, the director-politician was at the San Francisco 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 He later reflected that attending the festival probably saved him and his 
family, including his son and daughter. "There are many members of the Tajik 
parliament, including the former speaker, the one who ordered Lenin's statue 
taken down after independence, who have since disappeared," he said. "Nobody 
knows what happened to them. The speaker is believed to be dead, although no 
one has found his body." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of friends, Khudonazarov stayed in the United States. He's now a 
guest scholar at the Kennan Institute, and will be a Peace Fellow at the U.S. 
Institute of Peace this fall. Some experts believe he may not be safe even in 
the United States. But he refuses to seek asylum, so he can maintain Tajik 
citizenship and return home. 
</P>
<P>
 He misses the sources of inspiration the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially for an artist, living in the spirituality of one's homeland is 
everything," he said one afternoon in Washington. "It's my father, my mother, 
the air, the trees. It's the songs and dances. And the fact that I've been torn 
away from them is the most difficult thing." Yet he spoke more with frustration 
than anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a special quality about Davlat that combines sophistication and 
simplicity in a way you can't forget," Ruble said. "He is clearly someone who 
has strong principles and beliefs by which he lives. There are a few remarkable 
human beings like that, and you feel it when you're in his presence." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, he's still working on Tajikistan's political crisis. He's met 
with leading U.S. policy-makers. He speaks to foreign affairs groups or anyone 
else who'll listen. And he's studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often think about my presidential campaign platform. We knew what we wanted 
to do, but we didn't know how to do it. I want to understand how the democratic 
system works -- the mechanisms from the ground level to the top," he explained. 
But Khudonazarov claims he has no further personal political ambitions and that 
he's quit running for office, adding: "Once I have this knowledge, of how 
practically to produce change, I'd like to work with whoever is interested. 
Then I'd be happy to make my movies again." 
</P>
<P>
 I once asked Khudonazarov about his favorite film. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the absurdities and injustice?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he replied. "Because of the freedom."

BACK TO BOINGO; DANNY ELFMAN MAY HAVE EXHAUSTED HIMSELF COMPOSING MOVIE SCORES 
AND TV THEMES, BUT HE'S GETTING RENEWED PLEASURE FROM THE ODDBALL ROCK BAND HE 
FOUNDED AND TWICE THOUGHT HE'D RETIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, Chris Willman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Elfman's longtime home in Topanga Canyon is a veritable museum of small 
sculptures and objects he's collected from all over the world, a good portion 
of them exotic skulls and skeletons and assorted Day of the Dead art pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not feeling so alive himself right now. Picking Elfman out from his 
crowded house of death figures is almost like a live-action game of Where's 
Waldo? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to being intensely overworked," explains the always-pale singer and 
composer between sips of tea laced with the no-lactose milk his doctors have 
put him on. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've never felt as tired physically as I have this last month. It's 
convenient in a way, because you don't have to answer many questions: People 
say, 'Man, how are you feeling?' And I say, 'How do I look?' And they go, ' Oh 
, OK.' I've got the coffin maker calling every now and then about measurements, 
wanting to give me a proper fit. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Elfman is unduly morbid -- though the kid who grew up reading 
Famous Monsters of Filmland and "worshiping that magazine and everything that 
it represented" certainly has demonstrated a taste for the macabre. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sheer exhaustion, thanks to the fact that he's one of the rare people 
allowed by the fates to live two lifetimes in one, concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incarnation he's the founder, singer and songwriter of Boingo (formerly 
Oingo Boingo), the big-band new-wave combo that rose to L.A. cult stardom in 
the early '80s. Though Elfman all but broke up the band on a couple of 
occasions, he now professes to be as excited as ever about rock 'n' roll. The 
act's first album in four years and most eclectic offering ever, "Boingo" (see 
review, Page 62), arrives in stores Tuesday, to be followed by a tour in June. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incarnation, he's one of the most well-known and sought-after 
orchestral composers in the film industry, with both "Batman" movies, 
"Beetlejuice," "Edward Scissorhands," the "Nightmare Before Christmas" song 
score and the "Simpsons" theme among the dozens of credits he's accrued since 
making his scoring debut with "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" nine years ago. He's on 
the verge of leaving for England to score the summer theatrical release "Black 
Beauty" and, he sighs, "the very last energy in my life force is going into 
finishing this big, lush, romantic score." 
</P>
<P>
 Most musically inclined aspirants would kill to have either one of his 
careers. But some left-brainers don't know when to quit. If rehearsing a rock 
band and writing an orchestral score weren't hyperactive schism enough, Elfman 
has lately been busily rewriting several original scripts with a bloodshot eye 
toward embarking on what would amount to a third distinct career, as a 
screenwriter and, he hopes, director. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorced father of two teen-age daughters, Elfman and his girlfriend of 
several years, Caroline Thompson -- the "Scissorhands" screenwriter who's 
making her directing debut with "Black Beauty" -- hope to start a small, 
independent film company that might focus on classy Gothic or horror films. 
He's written two live-action musicals that are in development and has yet a 
third screenplay, an old-fashioned ghost story, that he hopes to be directing 
this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Boingo" is only his group's second studio album since their most 
popular effort, "Dead Man's Party," came out in 1986. With four years 
transpiring between new releases of late, the cynic might wonder whether Elfman 
really has much of a taste left for rock 'n' roll. He's been defensive when 
accused of leaving pop music behind before, but now admits he went through 
periods where the tedium of continuing Oingo Boingo got to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reached a point in the '80s and the beginning of the '90s where I started 
drifting," he allows. "And I probably was more into film scoring than the band 
at that point. I think I kept the band together more for the sake of the band 
than for myself. I get bored really easily, and I don't always find what it is 
it takes to get un-bored. . . . I really retired the band twice already." 
</P>
<P>
 Elfman had decided to "let it go" a full 10 years ago, but after writing the 
song "Dead Man's Party" he felt that he had hit upon a new style worth 
pursuing, a shift from the original "energy and fun and aggression" to 
something a tad more toned-down and complex. The resulting album alienated some 
fans but was the first gold one (sales of 500,000) for Oingo Boingo, which had 
long been legitimately huge in Southern California but only moderately popular 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was bored again after the follow-up album "Dark at the End of the 
Tunnel" was released in 1990. Thence came the 20-odd film scores, the 
screenwriting efforts, the yet-to-be produced musicals, all of which provided 
more than enough outlet for his purely aesthetic drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Boingo fans, Elfman was and is a first-class, A-level crank. 
And there's still no medium quite so conducive to crankiness as rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started out, the intention was just to have fun and rankle people, 
throw some little jabs and barbs out at things that annoy me. It's kind of 
become more a therapy for me over the years. A lot of the stuff is just letting 
off steam about something, and keeps me from becoming a serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 political campaigns, Elfman felt sufficiently disgusted by 
what struck him as hypocrisy in the "family values" rhetoric of Dan Quayle and 
the religious right to pen a diatribe in reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 This new song, "Insanity," represented as interesting a stylistic break from 
Boingo's standard M.O. as "Dead Man's Party" had earlier, and he took it to 
longtime lead guitarist Steve Bartek for a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartek encouraged Elfman to write more along those lines, and soon he'd come 
up with more tunes that, like "Insanity," went on for six or seven minutes or 
more, eschewing the standard pop song limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the studio, things got even more expansive, as Elfman threw out most of 
what he'd come in with and started working on songs with the reconstituted band 
for the first time -- instead of directing the players to replicate his demos. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics range from Elfman's most overtly political statement, "War Again," 
an angry response to Gulf War patriotism, to his most unusually personal song 
ever, the affecting "Can't See (Useless)." 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the songs on the album were improvised in the studio, which is a 
completely new thing for me and really fun," Elfman says. "I started to feel 
really excited for the first time since '80, when we first started out, and '85 
or '86, when we did 'Dead Man's Party.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This album caught us in transition. It's almost like catching something at 
the point where you're shedding out of one skin and you don't know what the new 
skin looks like yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now it's like I've swung back to the other side, at least for this moment, 
in my enthusiasm. I'd rather be back in the studio -- doing the next Boingo 
album -- than on another big film score." 
</P>
<P>
 Boingo fans without a taste for orchestral music might feel jealous of the 
time Elfman devotes to the movies. But Bartek, who is also Elfman's 
orchestrator on the movie work, doubts the band would have lasted nearly as 
long as it has if the two of them hadn't ventured beyond pop into film music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had Danny and I not been doing projects in between, I think the whole process 
would've been sped up a bit," says Bartek, surmising they would have burned out 
on Boingo without other outlets to retreat to. "The time in between has helped 
keep it going, actually, so each time we got together, it seems fresh. There's 
always been enthusiasm when we reconnoiter." 
</P>
<P>
 Time and maturity have pared Boingo down in several ways. Though the new album 
is the band's first to use strings, the old trademark horns make only a token 
appearance, and the coming tour will be Boingo's first without a brass section. 
</P>
<P>
 The name has been streamlined too: The group that started out as the Mystic 
Knights of the Oingo Boingo is, with this album, just Boingo (though Elfman 
says it was a spur-of-the-moment decision to go by the band's de facto moniker, 
and anyone's welcome to continue using the discarded Oingo ). 
</P>
<P>
 "There was originally a desire to continually have the name shrink, so that by 
now it should be Ngo -- or just O , O being the smallest molecular matter that 
cannot be halved." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock's critical community was never too kind to Boingo. But fan or not, you do 
have to credit Elfman with what would pass, by most criteria, for a certain 
level of inherent musical genius, especially considering that he never had an 
overwhelming interest in music or even played an instrument until he was out of 
high school. In 1972, he picked up the violin on a whim while traveling in 
Africa, and three months later was playing with an avant-garde musical theater 
troupe throughout France and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in L.A., his theatrically inclined brother appointed him musical director 
of an absurdist American troupe, the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. There, 
Elfman began to learn a host of other instruments, as well as how to render 
notations of, for example, Duke Ellington and Stephane Grappelli solos (a skill 
he had to relearn in a big way once he took on orchestral scoring). 
</P>
<P>
 Out of this finally Oingo Boingo emerged, an oversized, smart-alecky, insanely 
quick-tempoed group of guys who looked like nerds, Elfman says, to distance 
themselves as much as possible from the concurrent punk movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never really identified with any segment of youth culture, particularly 
-- not even when I was a kid," says Elfman, at 42 a grudging member of the 
Woodstock Generation. "I never felt any alliance toward anybody, unless my 
generation consisted of maybe four people." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting a finger on the pulse of Elfman's political alliances has been equally 
difficult. Early on Oingo Boingo got a peg as a "reactionary" band, pretty much 
on the basis of two songs on its debut album: "Capitalism" (pro-free market) 
and "Only a Lad" (seemingly pro-capital punishment, anti-criminal coddling). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the new album's anti-Republican "Insanity" and anti-sortie "War Again" 
would indicate a far different orientation, one more aligned with the 
liberalism usually expected of rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hard-core left-wing growing up; I was a radical. And when I left that, 
I left it in a big way," Elfman explains. "And of course I went and embraced 
anything that was against what I then saw as the hypocrisy of the left-wing 
movement. Since then I've become a radical reactionary, I suppose, and my views 
are really mixed. I don't embrace either side at all, because there's just as 
much bull on the left as on the right. But it is amazing how that follows you. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem with being around a long time, you get all these labels 
stuck all over you. It's like I'm a walking suitcase." 
</P>
<P>
 Do any others particularly bother Elfman? 
</P>
<P>
 "The one that I hated the most was quirky . But the fact was, we were quirky, 
and I can't undo that," he adds with a laugh. "Actually now, I've begun to like 
it again, so it's OK. Now, as of this new album, I suddenly find myself going, 
'Yeah, OK, I'm quirky, all right.' I guess I'm coming full circle."*

 MELTDOWN: Although the 1993 snowpack was thick, this year's snowfall in the 
eastern Sierra Nevada was thin. . . . The Los Angeles Aqueduct, which carries 
the snow melt to Los Angeles, is usually the city's principal source of water. 
But in years like this, more water is pumped in from the Sacramento Delta or 
Colorado River. For a look at how the Valley gets its water, see Valley 
Briefing, B2. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLOCAUST: In recent years, some people have come forward to claim that the 
Holocaust was a hoax. Survivors, of course, are outraged. Well, the governing 
coalition of Germany says it should be more than an outrage -- it should be a 
crime. . . . Zev Garber, who teaches a Holocaust class at Valley College, 
applauds the government's move, saying it "sends a signal that the German 
people are responsible" for what happened under Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ERA: Comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, who played a deranged cop in some of the 
"Police Academy" movies, has gotten a lot of heat for setting his chair on fire 
during a May 6 taping of "The Tonight Show" in Burbank. Jay Leno wasn't too 
thrilled with the stunt, and neither were fire officials. . . . Well, according 
to Joe Bleeden, who handled the show's publicity from 1972 to 1986, things on 
the set have certainly changed. "I never saw anything that extreme," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TEST CASE: The debate over the so-called "recovered memory" syndrome has moved 
to the courtroom in the case of a Santa Clarita man accused of sexually 
molesting four young girls more than 20 years ago. . . . The man's attorneys 
say they will challenge a new state law that allows victims who suddenly 
remember abuse incidents to file charges years later (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE AFTERMATH: Almost four months after the Northridge earthquake, life is 
far from back to normal for its victims. Most continue to struggle with 
bureaucracy, doubts and fear (B1). Sierra Snowpack 
</P>
<P>
 Recent snowfalls in the Sierra Nevada have been uneven and disappointing.

 Former Yankee Phil Linz finally got to finish his memorable harmonica 
rendition of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" last Thursday, nearly 30 years after 
then-manager Yogi Berra had angrily stopped him in mid-song. 
</P>
<P>
 Linz, 54, played the ditty at Berra's 69th birthday party, celebrated at a 
charity golf and tennis event in West Orange, N.J. He also played a spirited 
rendition of "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 Berra had first heard Linz play on Aug. 23, 1964, on the team bus but was in 
no mood to appreciate music. The Yankees had just lost four games to the 
Chicago Whited Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yogi called back, saying to quit," Linz said. "But I didn't hear him and 
Mickey Mantle told me that he said to play it louder, so I did." 
</P>
<P>
 And infuriated Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Linz: The shortstop and utility infielder was fined $250 by Berra but came 
out ahead in the long run. The Hohner Harmonica Co. later paid him $5,000 to 
endorse its product. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the major league record for most consecutive victories? 
Free balls, too: Golf Digest reports that David Leadbetter charges $3,500 a 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're a touring pro, don't expect a one-on-one audience with his 
David-ness; $3,500 gets you a two-day retreat with the guru of gurus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better yet, just buy one of his books for $25. It lasts longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-collar team: Anthony Mason of the New York Knicks on the work ethic of 
Coach Pat Riley:

<P>
 "I threw three straight strikes and (umpire) Nestor Chylak called three 
straight balls. I started hollering and screaming at him. He said, 'Mr. 
Williams will tell you when you throw a strike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute: From the book, "Tall Tales" by Terry Pluto: Tom Carey, a Boston 
sportswriter, once wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (Bill) Russell worth $17,000? No, because I can name four rebounders that 
Russell fears. In plain basketball sense, he is a vastly overrated competitor."

 Gerhard Berger had the best news Saturday at Monte Carlo as drivers finished 
practicing and qualifying for today's Grand Prix of Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing happened today," said Berger, who spoke openly of retiring after the 
deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix 
weekend two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to overshadow Michael Schumacher's record-breaking qualifying run. 
Schumacher, in a Benetton-Ford, won his first pole, driving the 2.06-mile 
street course in 1 minute 18.56 seconds to set a record that might never be 
broken because new safety regulations, which take effect after today's race, 
are expected to slow the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations were thrust upon the Formula One circuit when Austrian Karl 
Wendlinger received head injuries in a crash during practice Thursday. He 
remains in critical condition in Nice, France.

 Mike Powell overcame three fouls to win the long jump with a wind-aided leap

SOUTHERN SECTION GYMNASTICS; POWELL, DALEY ARE SECOND, THIRD FOR CAPISTRANO 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Orange County gymnasts finished among the top five in the all-around 
competition Saturday at the Southern Section gymnastics finals at Brea-Olinda 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley senior Erin Powell was second, and her teammate, senior 
Trisha Daley, was a surprise third in the all-around, behind Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's Amy Ezell and ahead of Elissa Palmer of Los Angeles Marlborough and 
Michelle Tschirky of Long Beach Wilson, who tied for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, third in the competition in 1993, finished first in the beam, with a 
score of 9.55; second on the parallel bars (9.20); sixth in floor exercise 
(9.20), and tied for ninth on the vault (8.55) for a total of 36.5, .775 behind 
Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
 Daley, who didn't place among the top three in the South Coast League 
all-around, was dumbfounded by her performance. "I don't even know how . . . I 
just don't know," she said. "I've had a lot of injuries this year. It made my 
senior year good." 
</P>
<P>
 Daley was fourth in the vault, with an 8.9; fourth on the beam (9.125); fifth 
on the bars (8.65), and seventh on the floor (9.05) for a 35.725 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, the top performer of the day, did not compete as a high school freshman 
because Palos Verdes High did not have a gymnastics team. When her school 
combined with Rolling Hills to form Peninsula, she joined the team and placed 
fourth in the section as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she fell off the beam -- her favorite event -- and finished second 
in the finals. But this year, Ezell said, "it saved me." After finishing first 
in the vault and the bars, Ezell's 9.5 on the beam was only .05 off Powell's 
top score and kept her in the top spot going into the floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell sat calmly, waiting for 40 other girls to compete. Only two gymnasts 
were left by the time she stood up for her routine, but it didn't faze her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell gave a relaxed, light-footed performance and finished fourth with a 
score of 9.325, .025 behind third-place Krista Dalton of Capistrano Valley.

SOUTHERN SECTION SWIMMING / DIVISION II CHAMPIONSHIPS; O'BRIEN-LED IRVINE FALLS 
JUST SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Scott Hinman jokingly said before the Southern Section Division 
II swimming championships Saturday night at the Belmont Plaza Pool that his 
girls might have to rough up the Walnut team before the competition started. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so strong," Hinman said of Walnut. "We're going to have to have some 
luck in if we're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Hinman, luck didn't run with the Vaqueros, and there were no 
fisticuffs. And while Irvine could have won the meet if it finished first -- 
and Walnut was disqualified -- in the concluding 400 freestyle relay, it was 
not to be. Walnut won with 100 points to 88 for Irvine. Woodbridge finished 
sixth with 53 points. 
</P>
<P>
 As Irvine battled for the team title, Wendy O'Brien was in her own fight, 
winning two individual events with lifetime bests. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, girls' swimmer of the meet, started the show in the first event, the 
200 medley relay. Swimming after Amy Aldinger, Molly Zak and Erin Rollins, she 
came from behind with a blistering 22.80 seconds on the freestyle anchor to win 
it in 1:50.84. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast relay leg was no fluke. O'Brien, a 15-year-old sophomore, then proved 
she was the fastest freestyle sprinter in Division II, winning the 50 free in 
an All-American time of 23.66. She had been seeded third behind Judy Thomas of 
Walnut and Lonna Stacey of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad said to just go out get it," O'Brien said. "When I did my flip turn 
and saw I was a little behind, I just went as hard as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 100 freestyle, only one hundredth of a second separated O'Brien from 
top-seeded Stacey of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the 75-yard mark, there was no question O'Brien was in control. She won 
in 51.06, seventh-fastest in the nation this year and an All-American standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Giana Johnson of Laguna Hills was also a double winner. In the 200 
freestyle, Johnson dropped nearly three seconds off her preliminary time to 
out-touch Woodbridge's Dana Nakaya in a personal-best 1:51.58. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goggles filled up with water in the third fifty," Johnson said. "I didn't 
even see anybody. I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 100 backstroke, Johnson, 16, upset two Walnut girls to win in 57.36, 
more than two seconds faster than her preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' 200 individual medley, Woodbridge's Jaimee Lindstrom repeated 
her championship in 2:07.38. Nakaya came back from the 200 defeat to win the 
500 freestyle in 4:56.65. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' competition, won by Los Angeles Loyola with 217 points, Los 
Alamitos' Tim Haney was the only Orange County winner with two easy victories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 IM, his 1:50.76, an All-American standard, was more than four 
seconds ahead of Joey Dykstra of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 500 freestyle, Burbank's Jon Won had the fastest preliminary time, but 
it soon became apparent he had been holding back. He dominated the final in 
4:29.34, nine seconds ahead of Won.

SOUTHERN SECTION SWIMMING / DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIPS; LAGUNA HILLS FALTERS AT 
END, FINISHES SECOND 
</P>

<P>
 It was after the 100 backstroke that defending Southern Section Division III 
champion Laguna Hills fell behind Ridgecrest Burroughs in the boys' team 
competition Saturday at Belmont Plaza Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to qualify swimmers in the last two individual finals, Laguna Hills 
then had to watch Burroughs rack up points going into the last event of the 
day, the 400 freestyle relay, to clinch the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The relay result -- Burroughs first and Laguna Hills second -- was 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was kind of hard not to get any points in those events and win," 
said first-year Laguna Hills Coach Chris Duncan. "But I'm still very proud of 
how well we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs finished with 170 points, followed by Laguna Hills (134) and Trabuco 
Hills (104). 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills' victory in the 200 freestyle relay (1 minute 26.58 seconds) 
helped clinch third. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Burroughs won, Laguna Hills swimmer Mark Kwok was the meet's top 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwok, the only double winner from the county, was named swimmer of the meet. 
Victories in the 200 individual medley and the 100 butterfly made it one of the 
16-year-old junior's best meets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 IM, Kwok just missed a Division III section record, finishing in 
1:51.49. Last year, he was second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get a better time than I had in prelims," said Kwok, whose 
winning time was his personal best. "I was really excited going into this race. 
So I wanted to make sure that I swam every stroke strong." 
</P>
<P>
 And strong he was, keeping the lead throughout the entire race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fly, Kwok swam another personal best, 50.41, which was an All-American 
qualifying time and his first senior national qualifying time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy sophomore Tim Martin finished first in the 500 freestyle in 4:32.24. 
Laguna Hills' Preston Hammontree was second (4:43.15). Martin also finished 
third in the 200 freestyle (1:42.44). 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County had only one swimmer in the girls' finals. But Kennedy's Wendy 
Martin, older sister of 500-yard freestyle winner Tim, left her mark, finishing 
second twice in strong fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 freestyle, her county-leading 1:52.25 was behind only the 1:50.79 
of Ashley Haendings of Whittier California, one of the state's best. In the 
500, Martin trailed nationally ranked Alexis Larson of North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake, whose 4:48.85 was one-hundredth of a second off the Division 
III record. Martin finished in 4:53.03, also best in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two swims were enough to give Kennedy 16th in the team competition. 
Harvard-Westlake won with 122 points; Cerritos was second (106.5).

 Gary Young more than showed doubters he is Orange County's fastest high school 
runner. In fact, he showed he is one of the nation's finest. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a Woodbridge senior, sprinted to victory in his 100-meter heat at the 
Southern Section Division II track and field preliminaries Saturday afternoon 
at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, the Sea View League and county champion in the 100 and 200, ran 10.52 
seconds with a slight tail wind of 2.49 meters per second. The maximum 
allowable is 2.00. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was probably the best start I have had all year," he said. "Like I said 
last week, my times are going to go down as we get closer to State." 
</P>
<P>
 Young also won his heat in the 200 in 21.83, into a head wind of 2.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley Canyon Springs junior Bryan Howard posted the day's fastest 
times in both sprints, notching legal marks of 10.43 in the 100 and 21.12 in 
the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 The Esperanza girls qualified a number of athletes into next Saturday's 
section finals at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Aztec junior Kristy Kierulff broke a 16-year-old Division II record while 
leading all qualifiers in the high jump. Kierulff jumped 5-10 1/2, a quarter 
inch under her best, to break the mark of 5-10 1/4 set by Upland's Kari 
Gosswiller in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Kierulff also ran the fastest leg on the Aztec 1,600 relay team, 58.0. The 
Aztecs ran 4:01.45, fastest in the county this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Distance aces Courtney Pugmire (800 and 1,600) and Carrie Caulkins (1,600 and 
3,200) qualified for the finals, loading up the Aztecs for more possible team 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foothill's Tara Oettinger won the long jump in a personal-best and 
county-leading 19-1 3/4. The junior also qualified second in the 400 (57.83) 
and sixth in the 200 (25.84).  
</P>
<P>
 -- Saddleback seniors Mel and Matt Lete helped the Roadrunners into the 
1,600-relay final after a long day's work. Mel had the leading qualifying mark 
in the 300 intermediate hurdles (38.46) and Matt advance to the 400 final in 
48.78. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Woodbridge girls 400 relay team, anchored by Meisha Wilson-Duval, 
posted the year's fastest time in the county, 48.56. Warrior freshman Erin 
Stovall posted lifetime bests in the 100 (12.46) and long jump (18-0) to 
qualify for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange standout Jaime Martinez easily advanced in the 1,600 (4:20.02) and 
3,200 (9:24.82). 
</P>
<P>
 -- State leader Wade Tift continued to impress in the shot put, winning by 
over three feet with a toss of 60-5 3/4. Teammate Gina Heads was the leading 
qualifier in the girls' shot put (44-8) and second in the discus (140-7). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foothill's Ethan Taub managed a rough double, qualifying in the 400 and 
800. He ran a season-best 48.96 in the 400, then won his 800 heat in 1:57.77. 
Taub joined El Modena's Chris Clark (1:56.84) in the 800 finale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six county athletes are part of the nine-girl 300 intermediate hurdle 
final: Newport Harbor's Lindsey Curtis (47.78), Foothill's Katie Mook (47.62), 
El Dorado's Tasha Walker (45.91), Kristen Reyes of Los Alamitos (47.43), Heaven 
Yosino of Woodbridge (47.16) and Delphia Moore of Orange (46.69). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cypress senior Jimmy Hutsell improved his season best in the 400, winning 
his heat by almost a second in 48.88 and qualifying with the fourth-fastest 
time of the day.

 After dancing the night away the previous night, San Clemente's Nancy Dollar 
ran away from the field Saturday, qualifying for the finals in the 1,600- and 
3,200-meter races at the Division I track and field preliminaries at Long Beach 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar, who returned home from her prom at 1:30 a.m., came to the 
preliminaries just wanting to get it over. After winning her heat in the 1,600 
(5:11.33) with the fourth-fastest time overall, Dollar wanted to "get out of 
here, lay down, get something to eat and rest. I just need to rest my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours later, rested and recovered, she won the 3,200 in 11:06.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The top nine finishers in each event advance to the finals Saturday at Long 
Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Also qualifying in both distance events was Capistrano Valley's Megan Mayes, 
who finished the 1,600 in 5:13.99 and the 3,200 in 11:15.79. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 800, Edison's Julie Koudelka sprinted to an early lead and posted the 
fastest time of the day in the event (2:17.23). 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept looking behind me to see if anyone was there," said Koudelka, a senior 
who will attend UCLA and concentrate on soccer, not track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley girls' relay team posted a county best and the 
third-fastest 1,600 time in (4:00.05). They also advanced in the 400 relay, 
finishing in 49.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach Poly, the nation's leading 400 relay team, dropped the baton on 
the first pass and Mission Viejo went on to victory (50.67) and a berth in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fountain Valley's Marlene Lange qualified in both hurdle events, finishing 
the 100 in 15.26 and posting the second-fastest time in the 300 (44.82). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three athletes qualified in the girls' triple jump. Kerry O'Bric of Edison 
jumped 36 feet 9 1/2 inches, a season personal best, giving her a second-place 
finish. Mission Viejo's Erica Dickson finished third at 36-5 and El Toro's 
Diedra Segura leaped 35-1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison's Marie Philman advanced in the discus with her third-place finish 
(123-6) and also made the finals in the shotput (38-8 1/4).

SOUTHERN SECTION BADMINTON; NEW APPROACH COSTLY TO POYYAK IN BOYS' SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The main difference for Corona del Mar's Jerome Poyyak between the 
quarterfinals and semifinals in the Southern Section boys' badminton singles 
championships Saturday was his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating Sandy Tirtadjaja of Keppel in the quarters, 15-11, 15-9, the 
third-seeded Poyyak lost to No. 2 Jerry Wong of Rosemead, 15-9, 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why I played so well (in the quarterfinals) was because at the 
Alta Loma tournament, (Tirtadjaja) beat me, so I had a reason to play to win," 
said Poyyak, a junior. "Against (Wong), I had beaten him at the Alhambra 
tournament, so I was playing not to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong jumped to a quick 13-2 lead in the first game before Poyyak, using a 
variety of smashes and drop shots that moved Wong around he court, rallied to 
win the next seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get on a streak, you keep going," Poyyak said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wong won the next two and the set. In the second game, Poyyak rallied from 
a 12-7 deficit to take the game into a five-point tiebreaker. Poyyak mixed hard 
smashes with deep drives to Wong's backhand side to close to 3-2, but Poyyak 
then couldn't seem to get a handle at the net, and Wong used a drop shot to win 
the tiebreaker, 5-3, and the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong went on to win the boys' title when the other finalist, Peter Shieh of 
Etiwanda, retired because of an injury. Badminton Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Ed Quan lost to Spencer Liang of Alhambra, 15-8, 11-15, 15-8, in 
the boys' singles quarterfinals. . . . In the girls' doubles semifinals, Vo 
Nguyet and Hoang Nguyet of Bolsa Grande lost to eventual champions Nhi Phung 
and Annie Tran of Keppel, 15-1, 15-2. Earlier, Nguyet and Nguyet defeated 
Etiwanda's Joi Stewart and Kathy McCarchen, 15-6, 9-15, 15-11. . . . In boys' 
doubles, Marina's Jeremy Sandy and Alan Huang defeated Estancia's Mike Truong 
and Allan Tran, 15-5, 15-13, in the quarterfinals before falling to Arroyo's 
Gorden Chu and Thanh Chan, 15-5, 15-7.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYOFF; IRVINE RALLIES TO DEFEAT CORONA DEL MAR, 6-5

 Ethan Gragnano came up with the two biggest hits of his varsity baseball 
career, sparking Irvine to a 6-5 come-from-behind victory in eight innings over 
Corona del Mar in a Sea View League playoff game Saturday at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano, the Vaqueros' No. 9 batter, hit a two-out single in the top of the 
eighth inning to score Eric Sonnenberg.Two innings earlier, Gragnano capped a 
four-run Vaquero rally with a two-out bloop single that scored Geoff Noisy and 
tied the score, 5-5, forcing extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which reached the Southern Section Division III finals the last two 
years, looked as though it would miss the playoffs this year after Corona del 
Mar took a 5-1 lead after three innings. Sea King shortstop Jeff Bowman had two 
hits and three runs batted in, and left-fielder Myles Davis had three hits and 
two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine reliever Matt Ward, who replaced starter Eric Sobek in the third 
inning, shut out the Sea Kings for four innings, giving up three hits. GABE

THE SUNDAY PEOFILE; WORDS OF HOPR FROM A HOMEBOY; AN EX-GANGBANGER REACHES OUT, 
IN PERSON AND IN PRINT, TO TEENS IN BARRIOS FROM SANTA ANA TO LA HABRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Leon can tell stories that make the homeboys cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts in a voice so soft you are forced to inch closer. Then his dark 
brown eyes lock in like a surface-to-air missile. As he whips his arms to 
stress a point, you get a glimpse of a gang tattoo -- a WC intertwined, for 
Watts Caballeros -- etched on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories spill out. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the one about the time he was 16 and his best friend, Mike, who worked 
with him on the assembly line in a fiberglass company, decided to experiment 
with heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened during a lunch break. Leon went to the corner liquor store for his 
daily quart of beer and a burrito. Mike went to the restroom to shoot up for 
the first time, after trying to persuade Leon to join him. After lunch, Leon 
found his buddy, no longer breathing, in the bathroom, crouched over the toilet 
with the needle still stuck in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was what I had to look forward to and decided to get out of 
the gang lifestyle," Leon tells teen-agers in a slow-paced, hushed monotone in 
the neighborhoods he visits. "I thought it was just a matter of time before I 
ended up like my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 This 51-year-old former gang member and high school dropout wants today's 
gangs to hear his words and their underlying message: There is hope and a way 
out. He knows firsthand what a waste gangbanging is and doesn't want others to 
experience the hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, who lives in Garden Grove, has been active in gang- and crime-prevention 
projects all over the county. Four years ago, he shut down his printing 
business, and with his wife's financial support, he now works full time as a 
kind of free-lance social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends most of his days in the barrios, counseling gang members from Santa 
Ana to La Habra. He also follows up on their job applications and helps them 
through the legal system when they get arrested. He meets with community groups 
and police departments, trying to improve communications and offer insights 
about life on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped found Standing Together Now, a Stanton group of neighborhood leaders 
who try to keep kids out of gangs and involved in other activities, such as 
sports. STN helped gang members get the city to fund the construction of a 
handball court in a small city park. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he produced La Calle (Spanish for "The Street"), a 54-page magazine 
mostly written and illustrated by gang members. It provided a forum for young 
people to voice their rage while promoting ethnic pride and highlighting grief 
from gang involvement in an effort to turn youths away from the gang lifestyle. 
A second issue will be published next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Leon's force of personality that is his most potent weapon. It's hard 
to pinpoint, but men and women alike seem captivated by Leon's charm. 
</P>
<P>
 His money problems, broken marriages and experiences as a gang member, ex-con, 
weed smoker, pill popper and alcoholic may not make Leon an expert in gang 
mentality, but, he says, "I can relate and warn the youngsters about the 
responsibilities they will face for everything they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Many community leaders and activists believe Leon has eked out some success 
where community anti-gang programs, residents' complaints and politicians' 
promises have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando has basically been on the front lines for a number of years, facing 
very serious conditions in our society," says Steve Delgadillo, the city of 
Anaheim's gang and drug program assistant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's completely lived and walked in (gang members') shoes, and he's accepted 
because he's proved he is a genuine friend," Orange City Councilman Fred L. 
Barrera says. "He can go into dangerous neighborhoods that a lot of people, 
including myself, would not even think about stepping into." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon grew up in Watts with his parents and three sisters, who all tried to 
push him away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers the beatings he got when he was a scared little boy, and how he 
was forced to take it and fight back "like a man." Faint scars still mark his 
forehead where he was hit with metal pipes back in the early 1950s. He wears an 
inch-long scar on his left wrist from a knife headed for his face that was 
thrown by a childhood enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 15, an 18-year-old friend, whom Leon admired, was shot and killed 
in a late-night gang fight after being cornered and outnumbered while walking 
home from a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon was shot at several times and, at 16, almost killed when a rival gang 
member pinned a can opener to his neck, and blood started dribbling down. The 
youth stopped only after realizing he had the wrong guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the Marines when he was 17 took Leon away from that lifestyle for two 
years, but when he returned, the streets called him back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Leon was convicted on assault charges stemming from a fight with 
police. Leon had been driving home from a party, where, he says, he had guzzled 
so much alcohol he could hear it swishing in his belly. 
</P>
<P>
 The police pulled him over for making an illegal right turn. An officer told 
Leon to stand on the curb while the first officer filled out a citation. Leon 
mouthed off to the second officer and swung at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The story has gone into his arsenal to illustrate how stupid shows of 
toughness are. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, whose rib-length, graying black hair wraps his shoulders as he speaks, 
acknowledges that his personal life has also been chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Geraldine, have been married 15 years. But he is twice 
divorced and has seven children. Many times, he says, he misses making the 
monthly $173 child support payment for his youngest daughter, 16-year-old 
Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends helped him foot his overdue payments last year, after he served a 
month in jail for failing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine, 32, has stood by Leon because she believes his is a worthy cause. 
She works as a travel agent and supports herself and her husband, who has no 
paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without her, I would be on the streets and probably not able to do what I'm 
doing now," Leon says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his decision to quit his paying job and devote himself full time was 
"a calling from God." But it also involved a long family meeting with his 
children and Geraldine, who would become the sole breadwinner. They eventually 
relented and now support him. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came in mid-1990 when 16-year-old Johnny Casillas Jr. was gunned 
down as he walked along a dark street to his grandmother's house in Stanton. 
The boy's aunt pleaded with Leon to help ward off retaliatory gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon persuaded the dead youth's gang not to retaliate by calling a truce 
between the gangs soon after Casillas was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon's children have watched their father and have begun to believe in his 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter Vivian Gomez, 22, says at first her siblings and step-siblings 
were disappointed with their father's devotion. They tried to change his 
priorities so he would focus on them, but they finally gave up and now lend him 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hated what he was doing, but he's always been able to make everything OK. 
He's so patient and sincere that you just can't hate Dad," Gomez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon "is just doing what everyone thinks about doing," says his youngest 
daughter, Nicole. "He doesn't make you do what you don't want to do. He just 
brings out goodness in you, and when you get a taste of that, it's a part of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole wasn't always so fond of her father's work. For years, she couldn't 
understand why Leon had to spend so much time with gang members instead of with 
her. But last year, when she was 15, Nicole inadvertently read a letter 
addressed to her father and realized what he was doing was not a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, handwritten by a mother whose son was killed in a gang fight, 
thanked Leon for his efforts at keeping kids from joining gangs and urged him 
to continue his crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "That mother talked about how precious her son was and was asking my dad to 
try to unite all gangs to stop all this crazy violence," says Nicole, who lives 
with her mother in Downey. "I finally realized that people are listening to my 
dad and that he's an incredible man. People want to unite but don't know how, 
and that's where my dad fits in." 
</P>
<P>
 When Leon's La Calle made its debut last year, he personally delivered the 
3,100 copies to high school campuses and in neighborhoods where gang members 
congregate. He targeted teen-age Latinos, hoping they would read the journal 
and get its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stressing unity," he says. "We're all brothers and sisters, so why are we 
hurting each other? The bottom line is, it makes no difference where you are 
right now. Even if you're hard-core, you can still do something positive, and 
here we are to help you and show you how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 His advertising-free journal, written in English and some Spanish, is 
sprinkled with success stories of teen-agers and community leaders who were 
raised in gang-infested barrios but overcame temptations. Also included are job 
listings, recreational activities and gang-prevention programs. But the stories 
that exemplify the grief from senseless gang tragedies make the strongest 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 A poem, "Is It Worth It?," depicts a boy, stomach full of alcohol, shot, 
beaten and stabbed to death in a gang clash, speaking from the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This morning I didn't know I'd die today  
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't supposed to end up this way  
</P>
<P>
 Being a homie was supposed to be fun  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another poem, written by a woman whose son was stabbed to death in a gang 
fight, pleads: "Stop this insane violence with brother killing brother before 
we lose everything dear to us." 
</P>
<P>
 And an editorial concludes with this warning: "You were given one body, and 
when that one is gone, there is no second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, says he does not accept stories that put down rival gangs and could 
incite vicious retaliations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing negative," he says. "We want to show that it takes (courage) to walk 
away from a life of retaliation and drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a year since La Calle was distributed, and gangs are wondering what 
happened. "Right now the attitude is, 'Where the . . . is the vato Fernando's 
magazine?' " Leon says. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon said the second issue will be on the streets in June, with the help of 
printing companies that have pledged to donate paper and ink. After that, he 
says, it will be produced monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 People who work with gangs say an impact was felt in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of gang members like La Calle because it's (promoting) unity," says 
Herbert Alamo, a Fullerton College student who grew up around gangs in La 
Habra. "They're seeing their work published, and it gives them feelings of 
self-worth and pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Medina, 19, of Santa Ana, once known among police as a notorious 
graffiti tagger, credits Leon with getting him to kick his scribbling habit 
last year. Then, Leon helped Medina get a job as a youth counselor for the city 
of Santa Ana and persuaded him to channel his artistic abilities into drawings 
and cartoons for La Calle. Some of those artworks will appear in the second 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon's work with gangs doesn't stop with La Calle and his community activism. 
He dreams of a building where he can store printing presses and convert it into 
a nonprofit school, where gang members could be taught the printing trade. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has asked community organizations and individuals to help him get a 
large mobile unit, which he plans to haul to neighborhood streets and parks to 
spin oldies records and provide outreach services for youths every weekend. 
Leon says organizations and agencies would be invited to provide literature and 
counseling services on issues ranging from parenting and social 
responsibilities to health education. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is, the estimated cost of the dream is nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando says everything can be done," Medina says. "Sometimes what he says 
sounds so impossible. But, he's a very patient man who can do it. I'm with him, 
and I know this is going to kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon also has the morale to go with some financial support of Latino 
organizations, including Los Amigos of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could give Fernando the wherewithal so he can accomplish what he 
wants to do, because he's allowing youngsters to let off steam in a beautiful 
manner through La Calle," says Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos. "Fernando . 
. . would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. We certainly 
applaud him." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon believes he is lucky to be alive and just wants gang violence to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are listening because I'm telling the truth and I'll keep my 
word," Leon says. "If it kills me, I'll keep my word."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE MOTHER OF REINVENTION; EVE MADIGAN KNOWS ALL ABOUT 
STARTING OVER. SO SHE COUNSELS WOMEN AND MEN ON CHOOSING THERIGHT PATH WHEN 
THEY MEET LIFE'S CROSSROADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a soft word and a steady hand, Eve Madigan ministers to a parade of 
fallenspirits: Women and men at life's crossroads -- suspended -- confronting 
that moment before all comes crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
 She performs her quiet miracle work in an unassuming collection of busy 
offices on the Los Angeles Trade Technical College campus Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 14 years as the founding director of its Career Counseling/Equity 
Center, she has helped to dramatically rebuild and redirect lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Nelly, an eighth-grade dropout who, after raising 12 children, wanted 
to recast her "stunted" image. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned a certificate in community counseling and is now director of a 
local women's center and a graduate student at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Denise, whose husband left her for a woman a dozen years younger. In 
hopes of someday finding a job to support her two teen-age kids, one of them 
hearing impaired, she decided to go back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan happened upon her in a hallway, the center's brochure in hand, and 
suggested that she enroll in the VIP class for women entering the job arena. 
Denise now runs a catering business, with an eye toward opening a home to feed 
and house the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's David, a former homeless man whom Madigan literally pulled off the 
streets. He's studying journalism at Humbolt State University. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 on a recent Wednesday morning, the Equity Center's foyer is quaking 
awake. Case managers trudge in and out, taking turns at the computer, answering 
questions on the fly. Student workers answer the bleating telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 A few people wander in to sign up for this morning's assessment of their 
Myers-Briggs personality-type indicator, the first of many measurements Madigan 
uses to find out where a person's strengths and interests lie. Sitting on the 
hardback chairs flush with the wall, the participants range in age and 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Four students with backpacks and note pads have come to decide their 
direction. Nearby, a middle-aged woman, curious about her untapped potential, 
bubbles with questions. A man in his 50s, sent to the center as part of CUPS 
(Civil Unrest Program), appears quietly detached, even though he's perched 
dangerously close to the edge of his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan, wearing a pressed linen suit, her silver hair swept into an elegant 
up-do, tucks a notebook under her arm and escorts the group of six down the 
dimly lit halls, past young men in chef jackets and plaid pants, and giggling 
women in the crisp white smocks particular to cosmetology students. 
</P>
<P>
 Erasing the chalkboard in an empty classroom, she reveals her purpose: "I've 
seated you next to your personality type. You're going to meet your new best 
friend," she says. They study the yellow form with a jutting graph that, in 
shorthand, somehow explains their past and predicts their future. 
</P>
<P>
 This "instrument," Madigan explains, eschewing test because she believes it 
carries too much baggage, ultimately aligns participants with a major -- and 
perhaps a commensurate career. It can help a late-blooming adult make a 
life-altering shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of this generation must realize that they're going to have more than 
one career. Most likely six or seven, adds Madigan, who proudly speaks of her 
own "short cycle" of three or four years per job. "I swam upstream like you 
did," Madigan tells a woman who is on the bridge to a new station in life. The 
woman nods slowly, as if she is reading her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look at those occupations, but please don't marry any of them yet. 
Please don't close anything out or down. We have a long way to go yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan's mission has long been to build the Equity Center into the assessment 
center of Los Angeles, offering a smart-minded grab-bag of programs, including 
culture-specific parenting classes, services for displaced homemakers and 
support groups for women pursuing jobs traditionally held by men. "I think we 
can do that," she says, hands on her orderly desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Women -- especially those with children -- who are struggling out of divorce, 
or suddenly widowed or are barely getting by, need to find jobs that will pay 
upward of $9 an hour. "And," Madigan explains, "you certainly can't do that 
typing." 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan is known across the state for her ingenuity in keeping her programs 
funded and for making unflagging strides in the territory of gender equity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call her a rainmaker, because she can get all those grants, the grant 
moneys that they tell us just don't exist for those services," says Mary 
Thorpe, an educational consultant for Thorpe, Hendrix and Associates in 
Fiddletown, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of those long-distance runners . . . a great role model for those 
of us who try to serve the people who fall through the cracks. She really 
understands the life they have . . . she looks at them as people with a 
texture. That's her greatest asset, and she's managed to share it with all of 
us. A lot of people have given up. I see her as one of the veterans in the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Life's interferences might slow her pace somewhat, but few things stop her. 
While walking across campus last fall, Madigan, 65, suffered a mild stroke -- a 
sobering warning sign. An MRI confirmed the worst -- a brain tumor. The surgery 
was successful, the tumor was benign, and four months later, she returned to 
work. Her prognosis: Excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 For single women surviving what might seem larger-than-life obstacles, such as 
trying to stay off welfare, she's an especially good role model. "I've been 
every place they've been," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed at 42, with four children to raise and support, Madigan had never 
worked outside the home. "I grew up being taught that women aren't supposed to 
enjoy working. It took me along time to realize just how wrong that was."  
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in the Napa Valley among the lushly tangled vineyards in a 
rambling Victorian-style home. But within the idyllic environs, her life was 
far from an uplifting bedtime story. Her mother's stormy marriages to more than 
one abusive man further eroded her already slim self-esteem. That, coupled with 
the brand "learning disabled" in school, did a number on her. "I perceived 
myself as retarded. And it wasn't until my 30s (that) I found out I was 
dyslexic. But by that time I realized I had too many successes to be retarded." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, she moved to Southern California to marry Donald T. Madigan, a high 
school classmate. The ghosts of her childhood made the transition to marriage a 
challenge. She had "a very hostile view of men," says Madigan, her voice tinged 
with a hint of pain. "I had to re-educate myself. . . . I realized if I was 
going to be successful in this life, I had to come to grips with the way I felt 
about men and the hostility that I really had." 
</P>
<P>
 She made certain not to follow her mother's lead. "I had to start from 
scratch," she says. "The thing I feel saddest about where that's concerned (is) 
that there is no real spontaneity in my life. I run everything through this 
screen and always have. And that's what I feel I was robbed of -- spontaneity. 
I am very cautious in making decisions . . . and they're good qualities for an 
administrator, but they are not good life qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 She channeled her energy toward her loved ones: husband Donald, owner of the 
prosperous Morris' Steakhouse in Alhambra, and children John, Donald Jr., Terry 
and Kathleen. 
</P>
<P>
 Then her husband was killed in an automobile accident, the victim of a drunk 
driver. Madigan was unsure how to find the ends, let alone make them meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought education was the way out," she recalls. "My education was in art, 
I had a studio in Alhambra, Norman Rockwell's old space. I painted by 
commission. But I realized I would never support four children with art." 
</P>
<P>
 Denied financial aid to pay for school ("I was told that I was too old"), she 
designed an emotionally and physically challenging schedule that would allow 
her to spend time with her fragile family. 
</P>
<P>
 From 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., she attended sociology classes at Cal State L.A., and 
in her "spare" time made a tour of the local small businesses to offer 
bookkeeping services. "I hired a CPA with my last hundred dollars to show me 
how," she says. After dinner, she and the children worked on their homework 
together. When they went to bed, she went to work on the ledgers. "I learned," 
Madigan says, "to get along with less sleep than most people." 
</P>
<P>
 For six challenging years, she navigated through a series of jobs and classes 
in sociology, psychology and women's issues. The sometimes grueling setup 
allowed her the flexibility she needed. And Madigan learned something she's 
tried to pass on: "What I did was sell myself," she says. "We tend to bend our 
needs to other people, women tend to do it more." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning her sociology degree and a certificate in counseling, she set 
out to guide women like herself through the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Blythe, her eyes obscured by a springy crop of blondish-rust curls, her 
muscular body squeezed into a bright floral cropped top, black cigarette jeans 
and high-tops, bobs on the balls of her feet. She's jittery with energy, a blur 
of challenges and wisecracks. Her male classmates, with difficult-to-read 
expressions, stand in silence in a cavernous work space where automobile shells 
crouch, guts strewn out on the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe, a 32-year-old automotive major, has been at Trade Tech for 18 months. 
In her first semester, she learned a lot about how to negotiate this world, and 
as part of Madigan's Women in the Trades' Brown-Bag Lunch discussion group, she 
has found her safety net. Her goal is to become a computer technician for a 
large company such as Nissan. "Pullin' in about a hundred thou' a year. Can't 
beat that as a secretary," she cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe says she grew up around cars. "I was raised around mostly men. 'Pass me 
that wrench. Hand me my three-quarter wrench.' No questions . . . 'Just do it!' 
" she mimics with a toss of the curls. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the classroom is "not exactly what you'd call open," she says. 
"Some of the men are angry, uptight -- 'What is she doing here?' What we need 
is 15 women running around here in technician suits. Put our foot down. It's 
one of the reasons that I stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan brightens at the sight of the Sherry Blythes, those who cast off the 
notion of limitations, tear stereotypes to shreds.  
</P>
<P>
 But for all of Madigan's feminist leanings, the Equity Center aims to serve 
both genders. "We give equal attention," Madigan says. "We're taking peoples' 
positive attributes and juxtaposing those to the 22,000 careers out there. 
Instead of putting a square peg in a round hole, we're finding the round peg 
for the round hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Royal, who has served as the center's assistant director for eight 
years, knows the value and scope of the programs. She enrolled in the center's 
VIP program, at 50, to avoid completely wilting in the shadow of her doctor 
husband. She had never worked. Didn't need to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just your typical stay-at-home mom," says Royal, who is working on her 
master's in career counseling at Antioch College in L.A. "People get validated 
and supported here," she says, looking around the room, her eyes wide as if to 
survey her rise from part-time student to Madigan's potential successor. "I've 
learned a lot about how to bring out the best in women . . . and how to help 
them spread their wings." 
</P>
<P>
 When Madigan arrived at Trade Tech more than a dozen years ago, the design for 
this little nest of offices was modest. She had already shown great promise as 
an innovator on other campuses. At East Los Angeles College, she co-created an 
audio-education program for housebound women and others with a desire but no 
means to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 And during an internship at Rio Hondo College, she crafted HELP (Homemaker 
Employment Learning Program) to direct middle-aged women into the mainstream 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired to be the architect of Trade Tech's women's center, Madigan arrived to 
find her supervisor off on sabbatical. Worse, she says, "I was told was that 
this grant was going to run out in June and here it was April. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Left to her own devices, Madigan did a "needs analysis" and decided against 
creating a traditional women's center. Instead, she proposed the Equity Center. 
And, she says proudly, "I have worked with 47% men ever since the first day we 
opened the doors." 
</P>
<P>
 The services are free, and supporting the enterprise is as exhaustive as it is 
expensive. The center, Madigan points out, has never had categorical funding. 
No school funds. No state money. She has become a pro, she admits, at writing 
grant proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We operate 100% on soft money," says Lance A. Williams, program coordinator. 
He's responsible, he says, for the "schmoozing and massaging" -- better known 
as the magic act of pulling money out of air. The Civil Unrest Program has 
become critical in raising the center's profile, he says: "It's been the 
showcase to show people just what Eve can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The center won a bid with the city and county of Los Angeles to assess people 
affected by 1992's civil unrest. "The Feds just kind of picked up 2,500 people 
and put them on (what) . . . amounted to about a six-month job," Madigan 
explains. "As they began to reach completion, (we) set up assessment areas, 
facilities . . . to identify ways for getting them additional training or jobs, 
before they even came out of that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan has built her curriculum to nurture self-esteem. Her emphatic promise 
is to raise an individual's self-esteem by 50%. "And believe me, you can take 
that to the bank," she says. "In California we take a lot of flak for our 
emphasis on self-esteem, but I will always think that it is the most important 
variable in readjustment." 
</P>
<P>
 She has encountered women standing stock-still in the hallway, frozen in fear. 
She has calmed nerves, made soothing cups of tea and stared into the eyes of 
women who relate their nightmares come to life: Mothers with a dozen kids and 
barely a junior high school education. Women relieved of their safety nets, of 
what they believe is their sole purpose on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Madigan's job to sift carefully through that emotional wreckage. She 
doesn't make assumptions or quick assessments; she knows the full range of 
options as well as the sobering dearth of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a product of WWII. . . . No women during the war were in the home. They 
all worked . . . and then we saw them all recalled after the war, put back in 
the homes," Madigan says. "They made the adjustment just fine. When women did 
get into non-traditional work, they were paid a really good wage." 
</P>
<P>
 But Madigan knows that not every woman is equipped to take that road. And even 
those who are should not walk alone. "I don't say just based on personality 
alone that she'll make it . . to throw them out there when they don't have the 
temperament for it. . . . It's worse than no help at all." 
</P>
<P>
 On this unseasonably chilly May afternoon, the heavy clouds look like steel 
wool. Madigan has lit a fire in her South Pasadena home, taking a rare moment 
to relax on the overstuffed sofa in a living room elegantly arranged with 
antiques and freshly cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her youngest son, Terry, 29, sits close by. A USC graduate, he has tried 
everything from loading UPS trucks to journalism and now heads his own public 
relations and marketing firm in South Pasadena. His mother's example has been 
inspiring: "We've learned you can take risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking back on her broad swatch of careers, Madigan says with an easy 
chuckle that builds from the back of her throat: "Sometimes I don't know how I 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her days have evolved into a steady stream of time-consuming administrative 
tasks, attending meetings, doing paperwork. "I'm looking at retirement. . . . 
at the end of 2 1/2 years," she says. "I'm trying to make a determination now 
about what I want to do. And I don't know yet . . . that's my next challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, she says with a sort of mysterious smile, "I want to consult . . 
. or paint Rockport Harbor in the winter."  
</P>
<P>
 During her recovery after surgery, Madigan witnessed the legacy of her 
mentoring. "It's funny, it's only been the last few years that I've looked at 
the end of my career -- that was so open before. . . . It took a lot of 
building for this service to exist, and I want it to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 She needn't worry, case manager Theresa Banks says during a pause in her busy 
afternoon, incessant phones crowding the backspace. "Eve is very dynamic. She's 
shown us that regardless of where you are now, what age, you can do. It's just 
hard work."  
</P>
<P>
 Banks says she has learned not only by modeling herself on Madigan, but by 
taking in the environment. "I've really turned my whole outlook around. You 
have to be flexible and adaptable in that world we live in. Eve's kept going. 
Pushing, pushing. Especially (with) the type of program that she runs. 'Cause 
you know somewhere along the line it will pay. Just keep going. Regardless."

BOLSA CHICA PLAN MUST STRIVE FOR BALANCE; * ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND 
DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS SHOULD BE WEIGHED IN NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One way to look at it was as a wishful way out of the jobs versus the 
environment dilemma posed by the huge housing development proposed for the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands area in Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it would like to swap parts of the 
Tustin or El Toro Marine Corps air stations for 1,700 environmentally sensitive 
but privately owned acres. And for its part, a local environmental 
organization, the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, said it was working with the federal 
agency to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounded too good to be true, it was. The developer, Koll Real Estate 
Group, said it had not been contacted either by the trust nor the wildlife 
service about the disposition of its property. The company is proceeding with 
plans to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres of the wetlands and to restore about 
1,100 acres.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even in the unlikely event that the developer was willing to allow a 
local environmental group to broker a deal on its behalf, it is hard to imagine 
that it would consider just such a swap attractive. Rare coastal property for 
other rare coastal property might be conceivable, but what group would trade 
for the opportunity of developing housing on ex-military sites where there 
might be additional problems and delays posed by hazardous waste? If there is 
anything that unites the partisans in the Bolsa Chica debate it is their 
understanding of the value of the land over which they are squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the federal government had little time for the proposal. And Tustin city 
officials said that the opportunity to acquire a portion of the Tustin Marine 
base had passed.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there is probably no painless way out of the old dilemma of 
development rights on the one hand versus the preservation and restoration of 
important wetlands. It has to be done the old-fashioned way, through pragmatic 
negotiation and careful land-use planning that strives to balance competing 
interests.

SCHOOL BUS TRAGEDY CAN LEAD TO REFORM; * BOY'S DEATH SHOWS NEED TO REQUIRE 
FLASHING RED LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Thomas Lanni of Laguna Niguel was struck and killed by a pickup 
truck while crossing a street after a school bus had dropped him off. A simple 
change, requiring buses to flash their red lights whenever stopping to 
discharge passengers, can reduce the likelihood of similar tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 The school bus is a fixture of suburbia, an essential part of the machinery 
that keeps households running. In most families, both parents work and the bus 
is needed to get children to and from school -- the institution that is often 
the major reason families moved to their particular communities. A few extra 
minutes commuting to and from the job means nothing to parents convinced their 
children's school is better than those elsewhere. As for transportation, well, 
whoever thinks much about the school bus? There are no icy roads with which to 
contend, no tornadoes. Put the boys and girls on the bus and send them off to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But precisely because there is so much at stake in the use of buses, it is 
essential that the public have confidence in basic traffic safety procedures. 
Lanni and his family moved to Orange County from New York -- a state which, by 
the way, does require public school buses to flash red lights when stopped 
regardless of the situation -- only a week before the accident. The boy rode 
the bus for the first time on the day of the accident. His mother said the bus 
driver promised to take care of him after she explained he was a newcomer and 
unfamiliar with the area. For whatever reason, that afternoon he got off the 
bus at a stop down the hill from where his mother was waiting. Investigators 
said the pickup truck driver was within the speed limit when he struck the 
youngster as he passed the stopped school bus, which was not operating its 
flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department said that criminal charges were not warranted, but 
referred the matter to the district attorney for investigation of possible 
violations of the motor vehicle code. But more should come of this tragedy by 
way of reform than whatever the conclusions of the investigation of a traffic 
accident.  
</P>
<P>
 One obvious lesson for all motorists is that caution is needed when coming 
upon a stopped school bus. Children are unpredictable; they appear unexpectedly 
in the road. One question for investigators is why the red lights on the bus 
were not in fact flashing. That would have been an even more powerful deterrent 
to other drivers; state law requires that cars halt when they see a school bus 
with flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District, which operated the bus, said neither 
it nor the driver knew that students crossed the street there. But parents said 
other children had been exiting the bus and crossing that street for months. 
Even if they crossed behind the bus, it seems likely a driver would have at 
some time looked in his rear view mirror and seen them crossing. Under the 
circumstances, it is not too much to suggest that this was an accident waiting 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 If state law required flashing lights -- whether or not students were crossing 
-- one variable would be removed. The state Department of Education 
acknowledges that most other states require the use of flashing lights whenever 
the bus stops to let children on or off, even if they are not crossing a 
street.  
</P>
<P>
 California should change the motor vehicle code to adopt that procedure. It 
seems unacceptable that it actually bars use of flashing lights unless children 
must cross the street to get on or off. Drivers behind the school bus will be 
delayed, but there is no comparison between an extra minute or two and the life 
of a child.

PAINTING PROJECT IS WELL WORTH IMITATING; * SPRUCING UP HOMES OF THE ELDERLY IN 
ANAHEIM HELPS THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive year, Anaheim has benefited from a worthwhile 
project known as "Paint Your Heart Out." It is a good example of a partnership 
of government money, corporate donations and public service by volunteers 
helping those who needed a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the city's Community Development Department rounded up 1,000 
temporary painters to put a new coat on 47 homes owned by elderly residents who 
either are disabled or have a small income. For many homeowners, the painting 
probably was a chore they did themselves in past years. But it is not as easy 
climbing the ladder to the eaves when you are 70 as it was at 30. And even a 
little inflation keeps driving up the cost of gallons of primer and paint, and 
the scrapers and brushes needed to overhaul an exterior. That can put materials 
out of reach when you are living on a fixed income. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who saw her house spruced up called it a "real lifesaver." She is 60 
years old, living with two adopted daughters aged 11 and 13, and said she 
worked with disabled people about 20 hours a week, earning $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches, schools and businesses have helped publicize the event each year and 
turned out parishioners, students and workers to take part. A co-chairman of 
the event, Keith Olesen, pointed out the value not just to one house but to a 
whole neighborhood. Taking what might be the worst-looking house on a block and 
turning it into the best-looking one can cause neighbors to fix up their own 
residences, he said. That fosters pride in a community, a needed ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
 The other co-chairman, Carolyn Griebe, said the group received $25,000 in 
federal grant funds and at least twice that much in donated labor and paint, 
tools, lumber and other supplies. Griebe estimated that "Paint Your Heart Out" 
has put in more than $500,000 in neighborhood improvements to 156 homes in the 
city since it started in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of volunteers over the years have said they wanted to "give something 
back to the community." It is an admirable sentiment and one that should become 
more widespread. Just about all the workers held 40-hour jobs during the week 
and had families they would love to spend more time with on weekends. But for 
this one day, they set aside their own desires and helped others with houses 
needing painting, or windows needing glazing, or driveways needing repairs. It 
helped the homeowners and the whole city. It deserves to be imitated elsewhere.

A GLIMPSE INTO FERGUSON'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There he goes again. Gil Ferguson, in the guise of complaining about 
Democrats in charge of the Legislature, once again gives us a glimpse into The 
World According to Gil (Letters, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
 In Gil's world, all Republican conservatives are ineffective because they're 
put upon by Big Bad Willie. 
</P>
<P>
 The almighty Speaker foils them at every turn, delights in controlling their 
meager budgets, and renders them mere speed bumps on the legislative highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Gil and his cohorts! 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Why is it that some conservatives (many of whom Willie doesn't like 
either) actually get things done in Sacramento? 
</P>
<P>
 Some pass bills. Others work on budgets. Still more actually get involved in 
policy-making. And some even dare to offer constructive debate filled with 
insights, not sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they just flukes who happen to dare to perform the job they were elected 
to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. Couldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil's World is a lot easier for us simpletons out here in voter-land to 
digest.

THEY'RE HAVING FUN IN THE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As an employee of the United States Postal Service, I welcome the 
opportunity to respond to Mr. Bill Smith's letter ("Don't Cater to Last-Minute 
Tax Filers," April 24) and clarify some common misconceptions about the Postal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 We work 24 hours per day, six days per week (and Sundays at limited hours) at 
the Postal Service whether it's tax night or any other night. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people don't realize that the majority of our work is done while the rest 
of the country is at home with their families or asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 It just so happens that on tax night we move much of our mail-processing 
operations outdoors because it aids our operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we would have the huge volume of tax returns whether we were 
outside collecting it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 But collecting the returns at a central location and keeping the tax returns 
separate from the rest of the mail stream saves the Post Office processing time 
and costs. An added benefit is that it is a convenience to our customers that 
we are outside, greeting them pleasantly despite the nature of their business, 
and taking their mail without them having to step out of their vehicles. In 
addition, we do make tax forms and some window services available. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, we have fun on tax night because it takes us out of the 
routine, and it allows the behind-the-scenes people -- the mail-processing 
people -- the opportunity to say hello to the people they process millions of 
pieces of mail for each night. 
</P>
<P>
 The postal people you see greeting, collecting and canceling mail, or 
directing traffic are either on their regular work schedule or are volunteers 
who have either put in an eight-hour day already or have altered their 
schedules to accommodate the inordinate amount of mail we receive during the 
late hours of April 15. Overtime is used very rarely because of tax night. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, although we play a role in the collection of tax 
dollars, we do not receive any tax dollars to run the organization. The Postal 
Service is self-supporting, and has not relied on tax dollars since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Because we are large, and a government agency, people find it easy to 
criticize us. We have a dedicated work force that in some way touches every 
household (all 121 million of them) six days per week. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time you see an open house at a Post Office or processing and 
distribution center being promoted, take advantage of the opportunity to come 
in to see what your postage pays for. It's a lot more than you think.

MECHA DESERVES A PLACE ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been reading and hearing much lately about all the reasons why high 
schools should not be allowed to have MEChA clubs on campus ("School to 
Continue Restrictions on Clubs," April 18). There seems to be a pervading 
feeling or fear that by having clubs of this kind our schools are creating an 
atmosphere for potential racism and discrimination. This can happen, but it 
doesn't need to. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna High School in Anaheim has had a successful MEChA club on its campus 
for five years. Success didn't come easy, and in the beginning the attitude was 
that the adviser was merely organizing a group of Mexicans who would rise up 
and cause all sorts of problems. What possible good could come of it was the 
general feeling on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what does this club do for the benefit of its campus community? It 
provides money to needy students who cannot afford to take the Advanced 
Placement exams. It provides anti-gang and anti-drug speakers to students of 
all ethnic backgrounds. It provides self-esteem programs. The MEChA club takes 
students to a local college every year to make them aware that college can be 
an option for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the past have attended the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, the 
Afro-American Museum in Los Angeles, and the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of 
Tolerance. The students have collected canned foods for the needy on the 
holidays. MEChA also sponsors a yearly art contest that is open to all students 
on campus. The prize money amounts to $275, and the theme is always 
multicultural-based and stresses positive relations in our changing society. 
The annual Cinco de Mayo week teaches our student leaders organization and work 
ethics. The Savanna MEChA club earns all of its own money through the hard work 
of the students. And the students? They are the typical example of all people. 
Some are leaders; some are followers. Some are radical; most are not. They are 
proud of their heritage, and members include not just Mexicans, but students 
whose backgrounds stem from other Latino countries. They are young people like 
all young people. Give them direction, expose them to positive role models, 
teach them to make the right choices, and they can and will be productive 
members of our society.

DON ROTH FINDS HIMSELF AMONG SOME WHO DON'T SYMPATHIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Just as bad pennies turn up from time to time, I almost gagged on my morning 
coffee when I saw the front-page article, "Ex-Supervisor Roth Aims to Start 
Over" (May 9). 
</P>
<P>
 I am surprised that Roth is surprised that he cannot find a job. It appears he 
is finally discovering the real-world hardships all non-governmental workers 
who have been unable to feed at some government payroll trough have known all 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth first fed off the U.S. Navy, then goes into "professional" politics, then 
leaves his O.C. supervisor's position under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 No more pig-out lunches paid for by pork belly county lobbyists and predatory 
developers, no more luxury Lincoln cars paid for by O.C. taxpayers, and no more 
fast-lane wheeling and dealing with "the boys" in the back room now. 
</P>
<P>
 Let him try to get a job (any job) where he has to p-r-o-d-u-c-e something, 
instead of getting almost anything for nothing.  
</P>

 * Poor ex-Supervisor Don Roth can't find a job after 14 months. I would think 
Mr. Roth would work in one of those private industry jobs that he claimed were 
so readily available when he and the rest of the supervisors raised their 
annual salary to more than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The other overpaid public officials should take note as to what the real world 
is like. High-paying jobs in private industry are few and far between. I would 
be willing to bet that these public officials that use private industry as an 
excuse to raise their salaries would be just like Don Roth in the real world, 
begging for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE STOCKI 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * What gives with The Times' front-page tea-and-sympathy coverage of Don Roth 
along with a picture of his poster girl? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we supposed to feel sorry for a supervisor who took payoffs? Who blames 
his ex-wife for his political demise? Who now needs a job? 
</P>
<P>
 It's appropriate Roth carries in his (presumably empty) wallet Nixon's quote 
that a man's not finished when he's defeated, he's finished when he quits. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a new note for his wallet. A man's finished when he forsakes his 
conscience. Conscience is that little area where a man must rule himself. 
Elected or appointed keepers of the public trust who display integrity are 
becoming harder to find than a unicorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck finding yourself, Mr. Roth. Your community service would be 
admirable if it hadn't been ordered by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't even think about 1997 when your probation ends. You've had your last 
hurrah in Orange County. We're not taking abuse of privilege anymore here. 
</P>
<P>
 As for job suggestions, ever think of auditioning for that popular TV show, 
"Home Improvement"?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON PRIVATIZATION; GOVERNMENTS SHOULD USE 
OUTSOURCING AS A TOOL, NOT A PANACEA; THE COUNTY AND CITIES SHOULD USE IT AS A 
BENCHMARK AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS AIGNER, Dennis Aigner is dean of the Graduate School of Management at 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Currently in the public sector the dominant buzzwords are "restructuring" and 
"privatization." In many areas of business today, intensified competitive 
pressures have necessitated a variety of organizational changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leading ideas are re-engineering, total quality management (TQM) and 
outsourcing. As government at all levels is squeezed financially, pressures 
similar to those experienced in the private sector occur. And among the tools 
available to respond to those pressures is the outsourcing to private 
contractors of certain governmental services, or privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the University of California has become enamored by the idea in its 
recent initiative to privatize the professional schools of law, medicine, 
business, dentistry and veterinary medicine on UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in this context the word is misused, since what is really meant 
is increased reliance on non-state funds to pay for operations and the salaries 
of faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, though usually referred to as a public university, the 
University of California has, for many years, been funded in the majority by 
non-state money for its annual operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, before the impact of the state's budget crisis on UC began to be 
felt, only 37% of the UC system's annual operating budget (excluding the 
national laboratories) was state money. By now, that percentage has dropped to 
28% and UC is moving rapidly along the same path followed several years earlier 
by the University of Michigan: We are fast becoming a public-assisted 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC business schools have had a higher reliance on state funds than the 
university overall. Interestingly, our Graduate School of Management at UCI is 
more "private" than any of the other four UC schools of business and 
management. This year the proportion of state funding in our budget is 38%, 
down from 52% just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of our revenue comes primarily from three sources: tuitions from two 
MBA programs for working professionals that are not state-subsidized, fees from 
non-degree executive education, and corporate financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, as part of the privatization initiative for UC's professional 
schools, we will begin charging our full-time MBAs a differential fee of $2,000 
per academic year. In 1995, the various UC professional schools will be free to 
charge fee differentials according to the market conditions they face. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, we will begin to operate exactly like a private university does. 
This is not altogether a bad thing, since the "discipline of the market," as 
it's often referred to, can have some very beneficial effects; in particular, a 
focus on customers and constituencies, and pressures to keep organizational 
structures from becoming bloated bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremendous financial pressure on our county and municipal governments in 
recent years has encouraged them as well to look critically at the efficiency 
of their delivery systems and processes, and to explore the possibilities for 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, for example, the county of Orange initiated a comprehensive 
study of opportunities to extend what was already a fairly aggressive program 
of outsourcing, with annual contracting of $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, 56 additional privatization opportunities were identified, of 
which 12 have been implemented with additional cost savings of $450,000 
annually. Twenty-five others are still under review. A significant barrier to 
further implementation is a state law that prohibits contracting for certain 
labor services like institutional food, maintenance and custodial services. 
</P>
<P>
 A pending bill, SB 84, would amend that law and could result in additional 
savings of $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Irvine and Anaheim, among others, have also moved aggressively 
in this direction. Today, 20% of Irvine's General Fund expenditures are 
contracts. The internal staff has been reduced by 25% over the past three years 
and several other heretofore in-house functions are under review for possible 
outsourcing, including facilities maintenance, information services and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, like the county, embarked on a privatization study in 1991 that 
identified 34 services with potential for privatization in addition to the $126 
million annually in contracted services already in place. Their evaluation and 
subsequent implementation is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization is a tool, not a panacea. In the spirit of total quality 
management, the county and the cities should use the opportunity to privatize 
as a benchmark against which to measure their effectiveness and efficiency in 
delivering government services in an ever-increasingly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial test of privatization is whether an adequate contract can be drawn 
to accomplish all the salient aspects of the previous in-house function. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, as of fall, 1992, Anaheim had actually brought back in-house 
seven functions that were contracted out at one time but for various reasons 
were not being handled adequately. Given the latitude to compete and with a 
benchmark to shoot for, many times the existing governmental unit can rise to 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this era of corporate downsizing and organizational restructuring, some 
of the adjustments are unavoidable and very painful. Like it or not, the 
capacity of our tax base to support government and higher education at the 
levels we were used to throughout most of the '80s has fundamentally changed. 
</P>
<P>
 To be a bit philosophical, it's important that everyone do some serious spring 
cleaning once in awhile. The tool of privatization can be helpful in 
identifying and discarding things that no longer serve us and improving those 
that do. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process we might even find that special something we seem to have lost 
long ago in government and public higher education: accountability.

EVALUATING THE CLAS EXAM CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As an English teacher who gave 147 California Learning Assessment System 
reading and writing tests to 10th-graders two weeks ago, I was outraged to read 
the action of the Newport-Mesa School District trustees. According to "School 
Trustees Vote to Postpone State CLAS Tests" (May 7), these trustees agreed that 
they would not reveal the literary contents of these sealed tests and then 
proceeded to do so "for the public's right to know." 
</P>
<P>
 My students and I cry "foul" and unfair advantage! In pandering to the 
religious right, the board is exhibiting behavior of lying and cheating. None 
of my students were offended while taking the test and many of my English as a 
Second Language students were able to make connections during the Group Work 
between their personal lives and the literary piece. In doing so, they 
demonstrated a higher order of thinking skills and writing fluency. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the CLAS test is not to snoop into family life or to evaluate 
individual student scores, but to see if educators are reaching the myriad 
ethnic and language groups in our public schools. Now that the Newport-Mesa 
trustees have sabotaged the security of the sealed, state-mandated exams, they 
may consider refusing to accept state financing of their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 KAREN R. SPEROS 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * California school districts, as well as those across the nation, are facing 
enormous problems. Most of us are aware of that fact. Parent participation is 
at an all-time high. Even business people, concerned about their future 
employees, are willing to spend time and money to help. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were ever a time of urgent need for all of us to get involved with 
education, it's now, and that's what makes the backers of this new CLAS testing 
system so offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it just a little frightening to have a school principal refuse to 
discuss a test in terms of what type of questions and general content? C'mon, 
get real. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fact of what is currently taught in school, I believe we can look 
forward to a generation that may not read too well, but they will be able to 
quote chapter and verse on how to use a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS people and teachers are not all to blame though. It's parents who 
give up too easy, feeling that the school knows best. Forget that, Mom and Dad 
, no one knows what's better for your kid than you and don't forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL HENRIETTA 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Milton Rouse (Letters, May 8) defends CLAS, saying testing that asks 
students to express their feelings is a step toward a meaningful education. He 
said that the number of facts students know are meaningless, but how they feel 
about these facts and use them is more important. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some truth in this, but this is inserting into our public schools a 
definite concept of moral values. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, normally, I would say this is good, but since our Supreme Court does not 
allow Judeo-Christian values (like God and prayer) in our public schools, it 
certainly is not fair to allow the humanistic "religion of feelings" to be 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
 This tears down the values of absolute right and wrong, which are not subject 
to how students "feel," and assaults parents' authority. 
</P>
<P>
 My definition of a meaningful education includes family and religious values, 
but they are illegal in public schools. Therefore, tests should be only on the 
three Rs and all those other meaningless facts. Students should be asked what 2 
plus 2 equals -- not how they feel about 2 plus 2. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL A. FEEGER 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 * I am greatly concerned by the CLAS controversy. I admit that I certainly 
have not seen the test. My only knowledge comes from excerpts printed in The 
Times, but what I read not only seems acceptable but an absolutely marvelous 
example of how students' minds should be stretched by critical judgment and 
launched into the joy of speaking and writing with conviction and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former high school English teacher who was often disillusioned by some of 
my colleagues almost exclusive use of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and 
matching questions, I wanted to stand up and cheer when I read the questions 
posed after the section from Wright's "Black Boy." What a wonderful example of 
how to make reading a meaningful, challenging and transforming experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I am deeply concerned when we seem afraid to develop critical thinking in our 
children. Unfortunately, our society suffers in the long run when we have 
voters who can't sort out facts from hype, who follow the demagoguery of the 
moment's hot issues, who can't separate their own feelings and prejudices from 
their responsibility to the greater good.  
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that challenging students to think about their own values and life 
experiences invades their privacy is like the argument of the school districts 
that refuse funding for breakfast for hungry children because that would usurp 
the family role. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS tests are only a year old. As with all testing instruments, it 
undoubtedly needs to be refined and improved. It shouldn't be derailed by those 
who fear any challenge to their own corner on the truth.

TRUST'S WETLANDS SWAP PLAN IS UNREAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With regard to "Wetlands Swap for U.S. Land Sought" (May 5) concerning the 
wetlands swap for U.S. land: I'm trying to figure out what the environmental 
news is here and maybe how the Bolsa Chica Land Trust gets air time for one 
hare-brained scheme after another. 
</P>
<P>
 If a non-ownership group can claim an interest in another person's property 
and then start shopping it around to third persons without the owner's 
knowledge or consent, it seems to me that they ought to be liable for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose the Koll Group doesn't want to antagonize anyone. In any case, I 
think the next news flash you get from the Bolsa Chica Land Trust you should 
consider running it in the comics section. Next to The Far Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Please do not get me wrong. I belong to no groups involved with Bolsa Chica, 
but I am a 28-year resident of Huntington Beach and am very familiar with the 
wetlands. The wetlands need to be restored, hopefully while there are still 
people on this planet. 
</P>
<P>
 If it requires developing the surrounding area to pay for the restoration, 
then so be it. In my opinion, the Amigos are on the right track.

BATTLING THE BIAS AGAINST WOMEN AT UC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After reading Prof. Morris Hirsch's commentary ("There Are Solutions for 
Women's Lack of Advancement at UC," May 1) on gender bias at UC Irvine and 
throughout the UC system, I want my state legislators to know this: As a 
taxpayer and mother of a UC graduate, I've had enough! 
</P>
<P>
 For years I've defended the University of California against right-wing 
attacks, and I always supported more generous funding.Now I've changed my mind. 
I figure it this way: If the University of California has money to burn on 
lawsuits defending the administration's discrimination against women faculty, 
then -- as far as I'm concerned -- the university has too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 I say let's cut the UC budget. Let's cut it deeply, until the administration 
shapes up and ends its disgusting discrimination against women. 
</P>
<P>
 BEVERLY KASPAR 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 * Morris Hirsch has suggested a very reasonable and long-overdue approach 
toward settling complaints of gender bias in personnel actions of UC faculty 
before they evolve into expensive litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a faculty member of more than 30 years' experience in the University of 
California, I recognize that such gender bias can and does exist in some 
departments. Supposed safeguards established through administrative policy 
statements and appeals processes created by the Academic Senate are not enough 
to ensure that equity will be reached in every case. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-ribbon panel proposed by Hirsch would provide the chancellor with a 
review by distinguished scholars. This may expedite early administrative action 
to restore equity and avoid the pain, suffering and expense that usually result 
from protracted appeals and long litigation.

NORTHRIDGE'S PROBLEM IS ONLY THE BIG INNING; COLLEGE BASEBALL: IN KEEPING WITH 
A SEASON-LONG TREND, MATADORS STAY CLOSE UNTIL THE SEVENTH, THEN GIVE UP FIVE 
RUNS IN A 9-1 LOSS TO FRESNO STATE.

 Near the end of a year punctuated by debilitating injury, dissension and freak 
plays, Cal State Northridge's postseason hopes were wiped away Saturday night 
in a decisive 9-1 Western Athletic Conference loss to Fresno State before a 
season-high 3,219 at Beiden Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were no tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been the strangest year ever," Northridge pitcher Aaron D'Aoust said. 
"Some have been hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by the Bulldogs (35-23, 14-9 in conference play) moved them within 
one-half game of first-place San Diego State (34-22, 14-8) and marked their 
14th win in 15 games. Fresno State could move into a first-place tie with a 
victory over the Matadors in today's regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet pennant fever at Fresno State came to a screeching halt with some sobering 
news from San Diego: Vince Beall of Cal State Sacramento, a 21-year-old 
outfielder, was found dead in his hotel room Saturday morning after losing a 
year-long battle with lung and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a team vote, Sacramento decided to return home and not to play the final 
two games of a three-game series with the Aztecs. A decision on whether the 
games will be played is expected from WAC officials Sunday evening, depending 
on the outcome of the Northridge-Fresno State series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about everything's happened this year," said Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernen, who learned of Beall's death before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was ever a year of the full moon, this was it. There's been so much 
stuff. . . . This is just more tragic (than the rest)." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aoust (7-4) pitched his best game of the season, but was done in by a 
five-run seventh. It merely continued a disconcerting tradition wherein 
Northridge was finally put away by a season-long bugaboo -- the disastrous big 
inning where nothing goes right. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 3-1, the Matadors were very much alive entering the seventh. 
However, the door was opened by a throwing error by second baseman Joey Arnold 
-- usually the team's center fielder -- and things blew up in short order. In 
fact, Fresno State loaded the bases without hitting the ball out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Vigil dumped a sacrifice bunt in front of the plate and D'Aoust threw 
late to second. Ryan Wood dropped another bunt down the third base line and 
D'Aoust, attempting to fire to third, bobbled the ball. Wood was given a 
charitable hit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing cheap about the next four hacks by Fresno State: Singles by 
Noel Roberts, Javier Renteria and Kyle Fjelstad and a ground-rule double by 
James Borges accounted for five runs as the Bulldogs blew the game open, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like playing golf," Kernen said of D'Aoust. "He parred every hole, 
then he hit three in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts was Fresno State's bogeyman. He had four hits and is seven for eight 
in the series with six runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Jared Fernandez (11-4) held Northridge to nine hits. The only run 
came on a solo homer by Keyaan Cook in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, injury-wracked Northridge (25-29, 12-11) will not advance to the 
NCAA playoffs for the first time in four seasons at the Division I level. It 
marked the first time in Kernen's baseball career that he has been associated 
with a losing team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in light of the day's larger perspective, Kernen was somewhat upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just try to come out with a smile on our face and play some Sunday 
ball," Kernen said.

JENKINS SLOWS DOWN FROM LAST YEAR BUT IS FAST ENOUGH TO WIN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crescenta Valley High's John Jenkins may have been the most disappointed 
winner at the Southern Section Division II swimming finals Saturday at Belmont 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the sprinter set a Division II record in the 50-yard freestyle with 
a 20.53 clocking and said earlier this season his goal was to break the 
national high school record set by Joe Hudepohl (20.01). 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Jenkins overwhelmed the field, winning by .55 seconds, but his 
time of 20.62 was below his standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed," Jenkins said. "I guess I had a little bit of 
senior mentality, not working as hard as I should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, who will attend Arizona next year, was upset with his own 
performance, but what made not breaking the record tougher to swallow was the 
performance of Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs won the first two events en route to winning the boys' team title 
with 217 points, taking away the title won by the Falcons last year. Crescenta 
Valley finished second with 158 points. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly boisterous group of Loyola supporters was seated directly 
behind the 6-foot-8 Jenkins for both his individual races. 
</P>
<P>
 After the final race, the 400 freestyle relay in which Jenkins came from 
behind on the anchor leg to win the race, Jenkins got into a verbal 
confrontation with those Loyola spectators and had to be separated by meet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough right now because we're losing to (Loyola)," Jenkins said. "We're 
a public school doing with what we can. Maybe I should have gone to a private 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the evening, the Falcons got a measure of satisfaction by setting a 
Division II record in the 200 freestyle relay in 1:26.75, breaking the record 
of 1:27.36 set by Peninsula in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins swam an anchor leg of 20.45, which would have broken his record in the 
50 had it come in the individual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins shook off his emotions from the 50 to win the 100 in 45.88, 1.36 
seconds faster than his qualifying time, but he had to hold off David Brende of 
Harvard-Westlake in the final 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who else was in the race; the only guy I knew was Jenkins," 
Brende said. "I really wanted to be in front as we got near the finish but I 
wasn't and my finish was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Brende also finished second in the 200 freestyle to lead the Wolverines to a 
third-place finish with 149 points. 
</P>
<P>
 For the girls, Hart freshman Monica Oleksyn set a Division II record with a 
time of 1:05.72 in the 100 breaststroke. Becky Skyler, another Hart freshman, 
finished second in the 100 butterfly and fourth in the 50 freestyle to help the 
Indians to sixth place.

A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY FOR HARVARD-WESTLAKE; HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING: FIVE GIRLS 
TAKE WOLVERINES TO DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't the quantity as much as the quality for Harvard-Westlake High in the 
Southern Section Division III finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard had only five swimmers competing in the finals, but came from behind 
to take the girls' team title in the final event at Belmont Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines finished with 122 points, 15 1/2 points ahead of second-place 
Cerritos and 17 ahead of Chadwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard did not lead in the team standings until after the final event. In 
fact, the Wolverines were stuck in eighth place halfway through the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But heading into the 400-yard freestyle relay, the Wolverines rallied to 
within 15 points behind Chadwick. The team of Kristin Olson, Emily Dashiell, 
Helicia Paz and Alexis Larsen won the final event with a time of 3:43.86, .91 
ahead of Cerritos, to claim the team title. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first section title for the Wolverines, after three second-place 
finishes, including last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines were helped when Chadwick failed to qualify for the relay 
final, meaning Harvard had only to beat Cerritos to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told them they had to win," Wolverine Coach Darlene Bible said. "I 
wasn't sure how much we needed but we wanted to get enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three Mission League swimmers made the finals in individual events, but 
Larsen and Michele Hall of Notre Dame made the most of their appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen won the 200-yard individual medley (2:16.00) and the 500 freestyle 
(4:48.85). 
</P>
<P>
 In the 500, Larsen took the lead for good in the first 75 yards and finished 
1/100th of a second off the Division III record set by Stacy Shupe of Gahr in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm annoyed I didn't get the record but I'm happy with a personal best and I 
did my best," Larsen said. "I felt good with 100 to go; I just had to finish it 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, who will attend USC next year, was named the outstanding swimmer of 
the meet but her highlight was the team victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a great day for our team and what made it special," Larsen 
said. "It's so much more a team sport at this level. We were hoping we'd get 
the title but didn't know for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of frustration in the 50 freestyle, Hall finally won a 
section title with a personal best of 23.95 -- a staggering .85 ahead of 
Delaina Formway of Jurupa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get pumped up beforehand and I was ready to go," Hall said. "This 
race is so hard because you have to be perfect, one mistake and you're done." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, headed for Clemson, won the 100 breaststroke (1:05.52) in similar 
fashion, beating Mari Nagasawa of Cerritos by 1.24 seconds. Notre Dame finished 
13th with 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one male swimmer from the region got as far as the consolation finals. 
Eric Chun of Calabasas finished 10th in the 100 butterfly.

MATADORS LET IT FLOW, WIN TITLE AGAIN; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: CSUN SENIORS GET 
TEARFUL SENDOFF BEFORE 3-1, 10-0 SWEEP OF CAL STATE SACRAMENTO IN 
REGULAR-SEASON FINALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a strange way to begin such an important doubleheader, but the eight 
starting seniors on the Cal State Northridge softball team simply couldn't help 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears of sadness flowed among the seniors, who were introduced individually 
over the public-address system and given a rose and a hug by Coach Gary 
Torgeson before the start of Northridge's key Western Athletic Conference 
doubleheader against Cal State Sacramento on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sadness of watching their college careers wind down -- and knowing that it 
could be the last time they play at Matador Diamond -- was too much for the 
teary-eyed seniors, who helped build Northridge into a NCAA Division I power. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Scia Maumausolo, who wiped away tears after hugging each of the 
honored seniors in pregame ceremonies, paid homage to the group by swatting two 
three-run home runs to help the Matadors sweep Sacramento, 3-1 and 10-0 in five 
innings, as Northridge (46-7, 21-3 in WAC play) ended the regular season by 
winning its second consecutive WAC title. The Matadors finished percentage 
points ahead of Utah (22-4) and one game ahead of Fresno State (21-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you write a better script?" Torgeson said shortly after Tamara Ivie 
dumped the contents of the team water cooler on him. "I'm excited for these 
guys. They've gone through a lot and they've been able to focus under all 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 For Maumausolo, who has hit home runs in three consecutive games, her 
viewfinder is focused on the new bat she received Thursday from a bat company 
representative. All 26 ounces of it. "It's two ounces lighter (than the bat 
I've been using)," Maumausolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo hit her first home run down the left-field line in the first inning 
of the opener with Jen Fleming and Tamara Ivie on base via walks. It was the 
second homer in as many at-bats for Maumausolo, who hit a solo homer against 
sixth-ranked Fresno State on Friday in her final plate appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Friday's home run) felt good," she said. "Today they were kinda pop flies. 
You could say they were cheap. I want to be able to earn it on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors sat on the 3-0 lead, getting only four hits -- including two by 
Vicky Rios -- over the next five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento's Kim Meyer hit a solo homer off ace Amy Windmiller in the fourth 
inning. Windmiller (22-2), who entered the game with the lowest earned-run 
average (0.26) in the country, pitched a four-hitter and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Matadors, who will find out today if they will play host to 
one of eight regional tournaments, picked up the pace against Sacramento 
(25-30-1, 11-15-1) in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors pounded 14 hits and put an early end to the game when Terri 
Pearson scored their 10th run with one out in the fifth. There is a 10-run 
mercy rule in the WAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Calcante, who went three for four in the second game, drove in Pearson 
for the Matadors' first run with a double.. Northridge scored two more in the 
inning on Maumausolo's fielder's choice and a single by Shannon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo, who finished with seven runs batted in, hit her sixth home run of 
the season in the third with Calcante and Ivie aboard to give Northridge a 6-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors added three runs in the fourth on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pregame tears were replaced with smiles by day's end. But with only the 
postseason left to play, there are sure to be more wet eyes in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last four nights I've been going to bed just bawling," Calcante said. "I 
didn't think I had any tears left."

MCKEOWN, BLACKBURN WIN TITLES; COLLEGE TRACK AND FIELD: THEY STRIKE A BLOW FOR 
CROSS-TRAINING IN THIS DAY OF SPECIALIZATION.

<P>
 Bucking the trend that sees most athletes competing in a single sport, Sean 
McKeown of Moorpark College and Amy Blackburn of Ventura won individual titles 
in the Southern California junior college track and field championships 
Saturday at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeown, a guard on the Raider football team for the past two seasons, won the 
men's shotput with a personal best of 51 feet 8 3/4 inches and placed fifth in 
the discus (159-0) and eighth in the hammer (155-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn, a forward on Ventura's basketball team, threw a personal-best of 
148-5 to win the women's discus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like football and track equally," McKeown said. "I would really like to 
continue to compete in both next year. (An NCAA Division I) school is going to 
have to make me a pretty good offer in one sport or the other to keep me from 
doing both." 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by McKeown and fellow sophomore Isaiah Mustafa, Moorpark finished 
fifth in the team standings with 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City College totaled 179 points to win its ninth consecutive title. 
Riverside was second with 127 points, followed by Mt. San Antonio (79) and San 
Diego Mesa (50). 
</P>
<P>
 Although McKeown has been among the best shotputters in the state all season, 
he felt he had something to prove after a near-disastrous performance in the 
preliminaries May 7 when he fouled on his first two attempts before putting a 
paltry 45-9 on his final effort to advance to the championships as the seventh 
of 12 qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a very good day last week so I felt like I needed to come in 
here today and show that I could compete in this event," McKeown said. "That 
was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeown never trailed in the shotput as he opened the competition with a 48-8 
3/4 effort, improved to 51-8 3/4 in round two and finished with three puts 
better than the 49-1 1/2 best of runner-up Frank Hoffman of San Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa, second in the Southern California decathlon championships last month, 
spanned 23-6 1/4 in the long jump to finish third and cleared 6-6 in the high 
jump to place fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Esparza accounted for Moorpark's other points by finishing second in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase with a personal best of 9 minutes 28.18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza is running competitively this year for the first time since 1990, when 
back surgery curtailed a promising freshman season at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn entered the meet with a personal best of 139-2, but topped that mark 
on four of her six throws. 
</P>
<P>
 After throwing 139-0 in the first round, she had throws of 146-6, 148-3, 
148-5, 121-4 and 142-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of her six throws were better than the 135-7 best of second-place Misako 
Hampton of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a great series of throws," Ventura Coach Tuck Mason said. "We figured 
she was in for a good day because she was kicking up the chalk at the 140-foot 
mark in warm-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Turner of Glendale fell 15 meters behind leader Daniel Das Neves of 
Cuyamaca after getting boxed in with 350 meters left in the 800 meters -- but 
finished strongly to place second in a personal best of 1:51.77. Das Neves ran 
1:50.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Landtiser of Canyons couldn't maintain a two-meter lead in the final 
straightaway of the 400 intermediate hurdles, but hung on to finish fourth in 
53.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Auria Roberto of Glendale was fourth in the 1,500 (4:47.28) and 3,000 
(10:21.41). 
</P>
<P>
 The top four finishers in races 800 meters or shorter qualified for the state 
championships at Cerritos College on May 20-21, with the fastest fifth-place 
finisher from either the Northern or Southern California championship also 
advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 In longer races and in the field events, the top six finishers advanced.

CHAMINADE SHOWS UP, DOWNS CRESPI TO REACH PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a wild Mission League finish, Chaminade High put together its best inning 
of the season, then held off a seventh-inning rally by Crespi to claim a 10-6 
victory Saturday and its first berth in the Southern Section Division I 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams entered the game at Valley College tied for third place with 
identical 16-9, 8-6 records, and had split their season series. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade won at home on Wednesday, 5-2, and Crespi pulled out an 8-7 victory 
on Friday at Valley to force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's game, Chaminade Coach Dave Desmond said that all his team 
needed to do to win would be to show up, and the Celts helped turn Desmond's 
prophecy into reality by leaving 11 runners on base, hitting into two 
inning-ending double plays and having two runners thrown out at home to kill a 
second-inning rally, practically gift-wrapping the victory for Eagles' starter 
Joel Orme (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles sent 13 batters to the plate in their eight-run third inning, 
touching sophomore starter Chris Hebert (1-2) for six runs and tagging senior 
ace Sam Clemons for two more before he departed after 10 pitches to four 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles by Brandon Gray, Joel Orme, Gabe Crecion, and John Gunn contributed to 
the rally along with a bases-loaded triple by Casey Cote, two singles by Scot 
Dey and an error by Celts' shortstop Rich Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Matthews struck out Kevin Lohman and Gray to end the carnage, and shut 
Chaminade down over the next four innings. He added four more strikeouts while 
allowing just two hits, but the damage had been done. Crespi trailed, 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we made the wrong decision on who to pitch," Crespi Coach Scott 
Muckey said. "I didn't know Matthews was going to be able to go five innings 
and shut them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to be good for two or three." 
</P>
<P>
 Orme went three innings, allowing one run on seven hits and striking out two, 
and Adam Crecion stopped Crespi for another three before the bottom dropped 
out, starting when he hit Rich Gonzalez to open the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Five runs and two outs later, Cote struck out Mike Glendenning with the bases 
loaded to earn his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gonzalez was hit, Glendenning singled and Brad Wright hit a three-run, 
inside-the-park home run to center field past a diving Cote. Brad Farlow hit a 
ground-rule double and Matthews walked. Cote replaced Crecion and struck out 
Chris Crawley. John Campanella singled, Tony Gonzalez singled and Rich Gonzalez 
reached first on Gabe Crecion's error before Cote got the final out.

<P>
 Chaminade scored in the first inning on Gray's run-scoring grounder. Adam 
Crecion tripled to open the second and scored on Cote's groundout for a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi's Gus Jordt doubled home a run in the second, but Campanella was thrown 
out at home on the play after Matthews was nailed at the plate by Cote on 
Crawley's double earlier in the inning.

MISSION STUMBLES ON OBSTACLE COURSE

<P>
 What the Mission College baseball team figured would be a difficult playoff 
series now has become a major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit ran into right-hander Brian Martineau and a finely tuned 
Rancho Santiago squad and dropped an 8-4 decision Saturday at Mission in the 
opener of a Southern California regional best-of-three set. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss puts the Free Spirit (26-16) in the position of having to defeat 
Rancho Santiago (33-11) twice today at Mission. The first game starts at 11 
a.m., followed by a rubber game, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission, the Southern California Athletic Conference champion, could not get 
to Martineau (4-3), who used a sharp-breaking split-finger fastball to limit 
the Free Spirit to six hits and three runs in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sent a message to the Mission baserunners early with a quick pickoff 
move to first that caught Jesus Perez napping in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know they like to run and (Martineau) has a lot of pride in his pickoff 
move," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game turned into a pitchers' duel through the first six innings, with 
Martineau holding to a 3-1 lead against Free Spirit ace right-hander Ray Rivera 
(12-3). The Dons pulled away when Rivera tired in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rivera) wasn't sharp," Mission Coach John Klitsner said. "He didn't have 
very good command or very good location with his pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, the defending state champion, took a 3-0 lead after 4 1/2 
innings. The Dons exploited most of their opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, they turned a leadoff walk to David Mallas into a 1-0 lead when 
Darren Troilo singled to left field with two out. They increased the lead to 
2-0 in the fourth when Toby Sanchez was hit by a pitch, took second on Troilo's 
sacrifice and scored with two out on a squeeze by Jason Minici. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, Keith Cowley opened with a single to right and Joe Fraser bunted 
safely. The runners advanced on Mallas' bunt, and Matt Kastelic hit a sacrifice 
fly to score Cowley and put the Dons ahead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question those are the types of things you have to do to win these 
games from this point on," Sneddon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission broke through in the fifth. Leadoff batter Erick Lazerus was hit by a 
pitch and scored two outs later on a single to left by Dave Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago got two more against Rivera in the seventh, including a 
bases-empty home run by Cowley, and three in the eighth on three hits and two 
errors. One of the hits, however, was a two-run home run to right field by 
Daryle Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission chased Martineau, who struck out seven and walked none, after a 
two-run homer in the eighth by Derrick Ornelas (three for four). The Free 
Spirit added a run in the ninth off reliever Steve Rewald. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Martineau) shut us down pretty good," Klitsner said. "I thought we would be 
better and make an adjustment, but we didn't."

PIERCE GETS OUTRUN BY HARBOR, 9-7; COLLEGE BASEBALL: BRAHMAS MUST TAKE TWO 
GAMES FROM SEAHAWKS TODAY TO ADVANCE IN REGIONAL TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 One thing is almost certain when the Pierce College baseball team meets Harbor 
-- plenty of runs will be scored. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Saturday's first-round regional playoff game between the 
teams was a conservative one compared to previous years' scoring marathons. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Harbor (30-12) downed the 15th-seeded Brahmas, 9-7. The 
best-of-three series resumes today at 11 a.m. at Harbor with a second game 
following if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both these teams always play an emotional series," Pierce Coach Bob Lofrano 
said. "And no one ever lets up." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 4-3, in the fifth inning, Harbor scored four runs to take an 8-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Greg Holmes drove in the first run with a double to left field 
and right fielder Josh Bendik, who had singled, made it home from third base on 
a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Mike Stembridge drove in the third run with a double to right 
field before stealing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce (25-16) got back into the game in the top of the fifth when center 
fielder Brian Basowski ripped a grand slam over the 330-foot left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore went three for five with an additional run batted in and a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Lou Tapia, first baseman Kevin Milligan and catcher Brian 
Sturges scored on the homer. Tapia, who went four for five, singled to left 
before Milligan and Sturges walked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas had a great chance to win the game in the seventh but left the 
bases loaded. They also left a man on in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hit that wall for some reason," Lofrano said. "But you also have to 
look at the other side -- their pitching did the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Mark Chavez (9-2) earned the victory. The Brahmas got nine hits and 
seven runs off him in five innings. Reliever Tim Newville gave up four hits.  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's Adam West (10-5) went seven innings and gave up 10 hits, struck out 
four and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West kid showed a lot," Harbor Coach Tony Bloomfield said. "I thought he 
was done and he came back and battled. He's a Division I pitcher if I ever saw 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor scored in the eighth inning when shortstop Jay Uhlman smacked a 
curveball over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce right fielder Robert Vazquez was ejected in the fifth inning for 
shoving Uhlman after getting picked off second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is real competitive," Bloomfield said. "Both teams respect each other 
but at the same time neither team likes each other."

LADD GOES WIRE TO WIRE FOR FIRST SAUGUS VICTORY

 Lee Ladd won his first Sportsman main event in four seasons of racing Saturday 
night at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks resident started on the pole after setting the fastest 
qualifying time and led all 40 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels terrific," said the 55-year-old driver. "Once you get the lead, it's 
awfully tough to pass at Saugus." 
</P>
<P>
 After shaking off an early challenge from Craig Rayburn of Santa Clarita, Ladd 
pulled away and held a comfortable lead throughout most of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sigman of Carson was second, followed by Sean Woodside of Saugus and Pat 
Mintey Jr. of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pro Stock oval main event, the lead changed hands twice during a 
two-lap stretch late in the race before Richard Smith of Reseda moved ahead to 
get his first Pro Stock feature race victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith moved past Brian Kelley of Arleta following a restart on lap 20 and 
survived several challenges from Kelley and Rich Ocheltree of Sherman Oaks over 
the final five laps to register the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one lap earlier, Kelley slid into the lead, moving past polesitter Kenny 
Kranzler of Simi Valley, who lost control of his car on lap 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocheltree edged Kelley for second, while Rick Hopkins of Simi Valley was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Dorman of Saugus won the Pro Stock figure-eight main event, outdueling 
North Hollywood's Rusty Stewart, who was second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-lap Mini Stock main event, caution flags played an important part in 
Bellflower resident Terry Limberopoulos' third feature victory of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Limberopoulos moved into the lead when leader John Petsco of Newbury Park was 
slowed by North Hollywood's Jim Click, who spun out with just six laps 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After a yellow flag wiped away a large lead by John Petsco of Newbury Park, 
Limberopoulos received another break when Christy Croasmun spun out, forcing a 
yellow flag 11 laps into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Petsco was second, followed by Carl Edginton of Glendora and Gardena's Jeff 
McCall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ebeling of Monrovia won the 15-lap Pro Four Modified main event, his 
second victory in three starts this season.

ROUNDUP; CANYONS LOSES LEAD, GAME, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Coast College put together a pair of two-out rallies, scoring three 
runs in the fourth inning and four in the fifth, to defeat Canyons, 8-5, and 
oust the Cougars from the Southern California junior college softball regionals 
at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons led, 5-4, entering the fifth, but April Crosby's two-run double broke 
a 5-5 tie and gave Orange Coast (31-14) the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Bragdon had two hits and a run batted in, and Christina Schlender 
added an RBI double for Canyons (23-17), which defeated Orange Coast, 4-3, in a 
regional opener Friday. Freshman Marianne Winchester (12-5) took the loss, 
allowing 11 hits and six runs while striking out two. HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL

 STREISAND MATH: If you bought tickets for Barbra Streisand at the Pond in 
Anaheim (first of six nights is May 25), are you happy with what you spent? 
Streisand's own defense of the $50-$350 price range may reassure you. . . . She 
told Time magazine that the price of seeing her on this tour -- her first in 28 
years -- might be a bargain: "If you amortize the money, it's $12.50 a year. So 
is it worth $12.50 a year to see me sing? I'm not going to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 KEEPSAKES: The Angels begin a seven-game home stand at the Big A Monday, and 
freebie night is Saturday: whiffle bat & ball night. Similar promotions have 
been known to cause havoc when frustrated fans throw their prizes back onto the 
field. But these go only to the first 10,000 kids , not the adults, who usually 
cause the problem. "Adults might not care if they go home with a baseball or 
whatever," says Angels marketing assistant Tony Reagins. "But kids tend to hold 
onto them." 
</P>
<P>
 BOJANGLES BASH: You think tap dancing is a forgotten art? They're tapping 
their hearts away at 5:30 tonight at the Dance Etc. Creative Arts Center on 
Prospect Avenue in Yorba Linda. The occasion: May is when tap dancers annually 
honor the late Bill (Mr. Bojangles) Robinson. . . . "He was wonderful," says 
the center's Mary Haller, "the granddaddy of all those great hoofers." 
Tonight's fare will include clog-dancing, group tap and the new "electric" 
tap-dancers who heel and toe on an instrumental keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 FESS UP: A few things you know about Davy Crockett: He was a hero at the 
Alamo, he wore a coonskin cap, and he made millions for the Disney people. But 
maybe you don't know that Fess Parker, the Davy Crockett of the TV movies, gave 
up acting for the hotel business and his own vineyards near Santa Barbara. . . 
. He's in Anaheim Monday night, where Granville's Steak House at the Disneyland 
Hotel is holding a $60, four-course, five-wine Fess Parker Wine Dinner. There's 
a reception first, located, where else, in the wine cellar.

'THE MIRACLE AT CARVILLE': CURING LEPROSY AND ENDING ITS STIGMA; MEDICINE: 
FAMED LOUISIANA HOSPITAL TURNS 100 AMID PREDICTIONS THE ONCE-DREADED DISEASE 
MAY BE RARE WORLDWIDE BY 2000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Four men hobbled on board the coal barge that carried the first seven leprosy 
patients to a new hospital upriver from New Orleans. Two women and a man 
couldn't walk. They were carried. 
</P>
<P>
 They went by coal barge because no carriage driver or conventional boat 
captain in New Orleans would take them. No landlord would let them stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lepers were made as comfortable as possible," wrote a reporter who made 
the all-night trip in greater comfort, aboard the tug Ella Andrews. "Many 
mattresses were placed on the deck, and pillows and bed clothing given the 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Nov. 30, 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, just about every belief held about the disease when the leprosarium at 
Carville was founded 100 years ago has been proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that left untreated, leprosy, or Hansen's disease, is 
terrible. It can destroy sight, collapse the nose, and lead to ulcers, 
infection and the loss of fingers and toes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is only if the disease is untreated. It can be cured in a relatively 
short time with multi-drug therapy, although people who have lost feeling in 
their hands or feet must keep alert to avoid infection. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is far from the rapidly spreading scourge implied by the biblical 
prescriptions. It is one of the least-contagious diseases known. None of the 
doctors or employees at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center in Carville 
has ever caught it. None. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1894, the seven patients had been rescued from what was called Dr. Beard's 
pest-house -- a filthy place with cracked walls, no heat, a stinking kitchen, 
rubbish heaped around the yard. It was a "house of disease, lost hope and 
death," wrote a reporter for the Daily Picayune. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new refuge was a slave cabin on an abandoned plantation bought under the 
pretext of starting an ostrich farm. The reporter spent two long paragraphs 
describing the uninhabitable plantation house, closing with, "The cabins are 
comfortable and need no other description." 
</P>
<P>
 Boards had been bought to repair the cabins, he said, and the committee that 
had set up the hospital expected to hire two nurses soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blame the Bible -- rather, its translators -- for stigmatizing victims of 
leprosy. From Leviticus: 
</P>
<P>
 "The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean . . . And the leper in whom 
the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a 
covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, unclean, unclean." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the men who translated the Bible into English used 
"leprosy" to translate "tsara'ath" -- a word used to describe a multitude of 
symptoms, none of which are those of Hansen's disease. "Tsara'ath" is used to 
describe even rot in clothing and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern translations use "malignant skin disease" or "virulent skin disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization estimates that in 1983 there were 12 million 
cases of Hansen's disease worldwide, with 600,000 new cases diagnosed each 
year. In the last 10 years more than 4 million have been cured. But only a 
third of those needing treatment get it. 
</P>
<P>
 India, Indonesia and Burma account for 70% of all cases. Africa is the 
second-most affected area. Brazil and Colombia account for 80% of all cases in 
Latin America. Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, the Sudan, the Philippines, and Vietnam 
are among other countries where the World Health Organization describes leprosy 
as highly endemic. 
</P>
<P>
 With $420 million, WHO figures that it could reduce the number of cases to 1 
per 10,000 people worldwide by the year 2000. That would eliminate it as a 
threat to public health, the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees with WHO's predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prophesy is a dangerous game in biology," Dr. Paul Brand, whose specialty is 
repairing damage from Hansen's disease, said in his keynote address to the 14th 
International Leprosy Congress last August in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, he noted, the success of sulfone drugs in suppressing 
symptoms prompted predictions that the disease would be eliminated in a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1983, the best-known treatment was a lifelong course of the 
sulfone called dapsone, introduced in 1941 at Carville. However, doctors 
learned that Mycobacterium leprae often become resistant to dapsone if it is 
used alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of drugs turned out to be much more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 At today's Carville, the white, columned manor house holds administrative 
offices for the world's foremost hospital and research center for Hansen's 
disease, now the preferred term for leprosy. The center has been part of the 
Public Health Service since 1921, and celebrates its centennial this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is now largely a nursing home. As a visitor passes through, two 
old women in wheelchairs are in the lobby. One has sock-like bandages on both 
hands. The other woman has one bandaged hand. Repeated infections have reduced 
the fingers on her other hand to stubs. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among 28 patients in the infirmary. An additional 20 people live in 
10 tidy cottages on this 300-acre estate, shaded by oaks that were old even 
when the first patients arrived. The rest live in dormitory apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Those, whose feet cannot handle much walking, ride bicycles and adult 
tricycles through the long corridors between buildings, honking horns or 
ringing bells at intersections in case one of the blind residents is coming the 
other way. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where in 1941 the first effective drug was found, the sulfones, the 
"Miracle at Carville" celebrated in a book and movie. 
</P>
<P>
 It's where doctors experimented 30 years later with the multi-drug therapy 
that the World Health Organization says could eliminate Hansen's disease as a 
public health threat by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where scientists learned that armadillos can carry Mycobacterium 
lepra, a rod-shaped germ that grows extremely slowly in the body and refuses to 
grow at all in test tubes or petri dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors here worked out tests to measure how much feeling has been lost in 
hands or feet. They molded sandals to protect numb feet from damage, and they 
found ways to speed the healing of ulcers that develop, techniques also used 
for diabetic patients with nerve damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nerve-testing kits are manufactured and packaged here. The workshop where that 
is done is down the hall from rooms where residents applique sweat shirts and 
make beads to string into necklaces and earrings for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The research lab has moved to Baton Rouge, and nobody knows how long the 
hospital will remain at Carville. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds are really too large, said Dr. Robert Jacobson, who came to 
Carville in 1967 and is now its director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients here have been promised lifetime care," said Jacobson, 61. "But 
whether we'll wait until the last patient dies before we move to Baton Rouge, I 
don't know. It will probably be long after I retire." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of the patients are temporary, in for surgery or complications from 
the disease. The rest are permanent residents. The average age is near 70; the 
youngest patient is in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson estimates that half of the residents have lived at Carville since 
their first admission. Some, like Betty and Harry Martin and Jack and Rachael 
Pendleton, after years of living and working on the outside, have returned to 
the hospital where the two couples met and married. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Martin was 19 when she arrived here Jan. 15, 1937. "You don't forget 
that date," said Martin, whose fine silver-and-diamond wedding band now is 
loose on her delicate finger. 
</P>
<P>
 She had asked an uncle who was a doctor to look at some rosy spots on her 
thigh. An allergy, he said. She wasn't satisfied -- "I was very fastidious" -- 
and went to another doctor, who referred her to a dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
 That doctor asked about her ear. Did it itch? Yes, she said, and sometimes she 
scratched until it bled. The doctor cut into the ear, and commented on her lack 
of response. 
</P>
<P>
 With hindsight, she knows that the bacterial culture only confirmed the 
diagnosis he made then. The doctor told her uncle, who told her father on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor was a humane man. He gave the family a choice: "Get her out of New 
Orleans at once or I'll report her to the Board of Health. . . . Get her away 
before she infects the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin told her story in "Miracle at Carville," after she and her husband were 
released, their disease arrested by the sulfone drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulfones kept the bacteria from spreading, but the bacteria became resistant 
after a decade or two. Betty Martin told more of their story in "No One Must 
Ever Know," after a second stay in Carville. 
</P>
<P>
 "My longing to know my neighbors is great, but far greater is the fear that 
devastated our lives and undermined our health, for what would they think of us 
if they knew? What would they do?" she wrote at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exposure . . . would probably mean a hasty selling of our home at a loss, as 
such things always work out that way. We have known so many cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Pendleton was 33 when he came to Carville in 1959. Rachael Pendleton had 
been there 10 years -- a sheriff's deputy and a public health nurse had brought 
her and two older patients to the hospital when she was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton was cured after a year, and they left together. Pendleton returned 
to work for the railroad. Then he went to college and became a computer 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 They returned in 1978, when Rachael needed more treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, president of the Patients' Federation, says that if the hospital 
must close, patients should get a $22,000-a-year stipend to help them live on 
the outside. It costs about $44,000 a year to house each patient in the 
hospital, he said, so it would still save money overall.

GRAND PLANS STILL LIVE AT ROCKEFELLER CENTER; URBAN DESIGN: RUMORS OF FINANCIAL 
TROUBLES BOUNCE HARMLESSLY OFF THE FACADES OF THE CATHEDRAL-LIKE COMPLEX, WHERE 
RENOVATION AND EXPANSION ARE SCHEDULED. 
</P>

<P>
 The man who dreamed it; the men who designed it; the men who knitted together 
the bricks and the steel beams, are all dead, and their monument, Rockefeller 
Center, a symbol of the human spirit, was reported to be critically ill earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still here, alive and well, rising cathedral-like in the heart of 
Manhattan. A tribute to one man's gamble and courage some 60 years ago, 
Rockefeller Center still offers premier office space with even braver plans on 
the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, it is the embodiment of Manhattan, perhaps even more than the 
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, a tourist draw that is truly 
accessible, a man-made park where people work and play, where dreams are born, 
careers made and lost, a symbol of a city that is itself a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blizzard its snows disappear as if by magic before it can turn to 
slush. It is a spring garden at Eastertide, a walkway of angels at Christmas, a 
panoply of roof plantings and restaurants, a dance of umbrellas in the summer 
breeze, an ice theater for the thrusting hearts of skaters, a trysting place 
for lovers, a haven for daydreamers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the year ends, it is a grand communal Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 It was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s gamble, stuck with a hefty land lease in the 
middle of the Great Depression. Partly to express his faith in the U.S. 
economy, partly to make that lease pay in rent, he built Rockefeller Center 
with his own money, an architectural triumph and the epitome of urban planning, 
even down to underground loading docks to get the trucks off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 When a model of Rockefeller Center was unveiled in the depths of the 
Depression, the New York Times called it an aberrational monstrosity, 
architectural critic Lewis Mumford saw it as "a clot of congestion," and the 
New York Herald Tribune simply said, "Ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which opened in 1932 and was finished in 1941, has become "a city 
within a city" on land that almost two centuries ago was a physician's garden 
to grow medicinal herbs. Up until John D. Jr. got his hands on it, it had 
decayed to the dust of brothels, rooming houses and speak-easies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today its buildings are both a federal and a city landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the financial journal Barrons came out with an article early this year 
saying it was in trouble, burdened with a $1.3-billion mortgage, lower rentals 
and a flood of leases coming up for renewal, rumors flew: It was going into 
Chapter 7, Chapter 11, the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Vincent E. Silvestri, vice president of The Rockefeller Group, "We are 
not in Chapter 7 nor any other chapter in that book." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorian Marlantes, president and CEO of Rockefeller Center Management Corp., 
says: "We are meeting our financial obligations and we have every reason to 
think we will continue to meet our financial obligations. End of story." 
</P>
<P>
 The center has just substantially completed a $260-million improvement program 
that was begun in the late 1980s to bring this limestone and steel child of the 
1930s into the computer-heavy world of the year 2000. Much of the interior 
artwork and the outdoor statuary and the decorative exterior panels have been 
polished and rebuilt for the first time since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 million square feet of rentable area, 2.9 million come up for 
renewal by September. By aggressively making deals, and the improvements, 1.9 
million have been re-signed and Rockefeller Center officials say they will 
lease the rest before the year is out, keeping its occupancy rate at 96%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockefeller Group, the ultimate investment entity, is private and need 
not divulge its finances to anyone, so its operations are open to speculation. 
Further complicating the picture was the sale to Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan 
of 80% of the Rockefeller Group in 1989 for $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But an informal survey of Manhattan realtors confirms that it is still prime 
office space in a sea of prestigious buildings and new leases are going at a 
hot pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's size is daunting. Cleaning the offices alone is the equivalent of 
10,000 six-room houses. That job falls to just under 900 workers who come in 
when the offices close. Window washers who tend 48,758 office windows start 
work at dark, finish before noon. Every window is cleaned every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Room temperature, elevators with doors open, elevators with doors closed, 
virtually every variable in the office environment is monitored on the 
computers of the Global Control Center in the subbasement. 
</P>
<P>
 Any thief with the audacity to snatch a purse within the center is chased and 
brought to ground by the guard force and doormen who have pursued miscreants as 
far as Times Square, aided and abetted by New York's Finest. The guards have no 
authority beyond citizen's arrest. Many are former policemen. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 100,000 telephones in the center and 97,500 locks, and 
round-the-clock locksmiths. The Center's tenants use 476 million gallons of 
water a year, not counting those years when the limestone faces of the 
buildings are washed down by cascades of ordinary tap water, which restores 
their original color. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 388 elevators and 67 escalators. The elevators travel nearly 2 
million miles a year and make a million stops. The fastest is the express to 
the 65th floor of the General Electric Building. It makes the trip in 37 
seconds at 1,400 feet a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from John D. Jr.'s original dream. He intended at first to build a 
new home for the Metropolitan Opera, but when his co-backers backed out, he was 
left with an expensive tract and a hefty rent. 
</P>
<P>
 So he changed direction. He would build modern office buildings and a pair of 
theaters. He hired a consortium of architects to put the plans together. The 
centerpiece would be the broadcast center that would house the fledgling, but 
growing, Radio Corporation of America and the National Broadcasting Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan in a barn-like building at 39th and Broadway would have to 
wait for its new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief architects emerged from the consortium to be Raymond Hood and 
Wallace Harrison who devised an open spaces plan of setbacks and lower 
buildings like pawns and kings on a chessboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was commissioned to decorate the lobby of 
the RCA Building -- now the GE Building -- with a mural celebrating the 
progress of man, but he painted in the face of Lenin on one of the individuals. 
John D. Rockefeller Jr. would not tolerate it. When Rivera refused to replace 
it the mural was scrapped and replaced by the towering figures by Jose Maria 
Sert. 
</P>
<P>
 The recriminations were so loud that humorist Will Rogers entered the fray 
because "there are two things that a dumb guy knows as much about as a smart 
one, and that's art and inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 He was forced, he said, to side with Rockefeller because flat-out the artist 
had failed to give him what he had ordered. Rogers concluded, "Now the above is 
said in no disparagement of the Mexican artist, for he is the best in the 
world, but you should never try to fool a Rockefeller with oils." 
</P>
<P>
 The outside panel of the then-RCA building, by Lee Lawrie, represents wisdom. 
Lawrie also did the 14,000-pound statue of Atlas which stands before the main 
entrance of the International Building, and a dozen other sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Manship created the soaring figure of Prometheus which dominates the 
skating rink and plaza, crafted in bronze and covered with gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-ton, stainless-steel panel above the main entrance to the Associated 
Press Building by Isamu Noguchi is called "News" and represents five men with 
notebook and pencil, camera, telephone, teletype and wires radiating out to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else attracts the eyes of visitors, the annual Christmas tree 
lighting has become an American tradition. The tree has been lit on national 
television by everyone from Kate Smith and Howdy Doody to Liza Minnelli and 
Glenn Close. 
</P>
<P>
 When, during the oil crisis of 1973, President Nixon asked Americans to forgo 
outdoor ornamental lighting, the tree suddenly became a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Reed, now a vice president of the center's management, was then in charge 
of erecting the tree, a ritual since workers put up the first one in 1931 on 
the site of the British Empire Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was swamped with calls, "people saying you have to light the tree. Some 
had suggestions, like a windmill on the roof to generate electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone else said why not put a treadmill out there hooked to a generator. 
I'll come by and walk it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even CBS called and offered to help, although the tree stood out in front of 
rival NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The center solved the problem by decorating the tree with reflective disks 
that were lit by many fewer miniature lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees have come from as far away as Ottawa, Canada. The tallest tree ever was 
a 90-foot Norway spruce from Mount Kisco, N.Y., in 1948. There is a limit, 
however. The trailer that brings the tree into the city can only telescope to 
100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When World War II came to Rockefeller Center, so did the FBI. On Dec. 7, 1941, 
they broke into the German, Japanese and Italian consulates and offices to find 
diplomats burning papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wild Bill" Donovan, the American lawyer who headed the OSS, the forerunner of 
the Central Intelligence Agency, had offices in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, guarded 
by military police. Guy Eyssell, former president of Radio City Music Hall, 
remembers one night when military police rushed into his offices above the 
theater with drawn guns. They said there were spies on the roof, looking down 
on Donovan's offices. It turned out they were sandbags, shrouded by blackout 
shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The British had an espionage facility camouflaged as a trade office in the 
British Empire Building. One former intelligence officer says he was being 
pursued by enemy agents and owed his life to an escape through the subbasement 
labyrinths of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia placed a curfew over the center as a wartime security 
measure. Eyssell says that when LaGuardia told restaurateur Toots Shor, whose 
establishment was across 51st Street from the center, that he would have to 
close early, Shor shrugged his massive shoulders and said, "I guess if a guy 
ain't drunk by midnight, he's not going to get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 While the center plans were still being drawn, two leaseholders on 6th Avenue 
held out and the architects had to build around them. One of those sites is now 
Hurley's Bar, known as a hangout for NBC people. The other, formerly a 
drugstore, will be transformed into a theme restaurant like Planet Hollywood 
and the Hard Rock Cafe. It will open in 1995 as Television City.

SPURNED WINSTON CHURCHILL'S LOVE LETTERS FETCH RECORD PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven love letters from Winston Churchill to a woman who turned down his 
marriage proposal were sold Friday for $115,136. 
</P>
<P>
 An American collector purchased the turn-of-the-century letters in which 
Churchill professed his love for Muriel Wilson, daughter of a shipping magnate, 
according to the auctioneer Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't slam the door," wrote the man who went on to become Britain's prime 
minister during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can wait -- perhaps I shall improve with waiting," he wrote. "Why shouldn't 
you care about me some day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Churchill's son, Randolph, said in a biography that his father proposed to the 
woman but she spurned him. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchill eventually married Clementine Hozier in 1908, although he remained 
lifelong friends with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie's said one of the letters fetched $31,350, or 20,900 pounds, breaking 
a record 18,000 pounds for a Churchill letter sold in 1985.

U.S. TO REQUEST INTERNATIONAL FUNDING TO DEFUSE LAND MINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration will lead a worldwide fund-raising effort to get 
rid of land mines that kill or maim an estimated an 1,200 civilians each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mines built to injure or kill humans cost as little as $3 to make and as much 
as $1,000 to find and defuse, and tens of millions of them are hidden around 
the world, witnesses told a Senate panel Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Land mines pose a significant impediment to achieving our foreign policy 
objectives in many regions of the world," said Thomas E. McNamara, deputy 
assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, at a hearing 
billed as the first congressional inquiry into the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara said land mines prolong the bloodshed of conflicts, hinder refugee 
repatriation efforts and pollute land that might otherwise be productive.

MOUNTAINOUS ROAD OPENS 'SHANGRI-LA'; TOURISTS GET GLIMPSE OF HUNZA REGION WHERE 
PEOPLE LIVE TO 120 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McCARRY, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High on the narrow, mountainous road known as the Karakoram Highway, or KKH, 
in northern Pakistan, rocks clang off the hood of my jeep, thump onto the back 
seat, ricochet from the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 As my driver, Javed, swerves, a rock he has been watching that's half the size 
of the jeep bounces onto the pavement inches from my knee. 
</P>
<P>
 We speedily round the mountainside onto a clear stretch of road. I look down 
over the edge of the highway, into the gray, churning waters of the Hunza 
River. A telephone wire runs parallel to the road, which runs parallel to the 
river -- three lifelines moving in the same direction: toward Hunza. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the size of Massachusetts, with a population of 35,000, Hunza has 
long been one of the most remote regions of the Subcontinent, a realm jagged 
with glaciers and 20,000-foot-high peaks, connected to the outside world only 
by footpaths and a few barely serviceable tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the mid-1960s the ruling mir, or chief, persuaded the Pakistani 
government to route the KKH through central Hunza. It took more than a decade 
to finish and cost 476 workers' lives and uncalculated millions of dollars. In 
1974 the mir stepped down, and Hunza came under the direct control of Pakistan; 
in 1978 the highway was completed. The combination of events transformed Hunza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunzakuts remain subsistence farmers, as they have been for more than a 
millennium. Every family owns at least one small plot of land, and the food 
they grow on their painfully cultivated plots is the food they eat; rarely has 
there been a surplus to sell or trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single tree, not a single plant has grown here by itself. Only it has 
been grown by man -- all of these big trees, all of these small plants," says 
Deedar Aly, a member of the Buroong clan of the Burusho, the dominant ethnic 
group of Hunza. 
</P>
<P>
 Aly shows me his family's modest but flourishing orchard of apricot trees. 
Apricots have traditionally been an important crop. They are eaten fresh and 
dried, and the kernel is crushed to produce cooking oil. Every farmer has at 
least one tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "And no man in Hunza can sell his land to an outsider," Aly says firmly. "For 
if a man were to sell his land, it would be like selling his children; it would 
be a shameful thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the highway brought year-round supplies, by the end of one winter Aly's 
family had only dandelion leaves, turnip tops and other weeds to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 When the British first explored this area at the end of the 19th Century, they 
were astonished to meet people who claimed to be more than 120 years old. These 
encounters inspired, some believe, the Shangri-La of James Hilton's 
best-selling 1933 novel, "Lost Horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunzakuts don't mind feeding the myth that they live longer than anybody else 
in the world, attributing it to their "pure" diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Pakistan assumed direct control of Hunza, the people of the region lived 
under the rule of the mirs, a single family of rulers who claimed to have 
reigned uninterrupted for more than 900 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mirs contributed to the rise of Hunza because they promoted contacts with 
the outside world," explained Stephen Rasmussen, an American who is general 
manager of the regional Aga Khan Health Service. "And the Karakoram Highway is 
a perfect example of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghazanfar Ali Khan would be the ruling mir if his family had not surrendered 
its power. "When my father, Mir Mohammed Jamal Khan, had the chance to bring 
the road through here, he did so because he saw that it would bring the people 
many good things," he says. "Now, thanks to investments made by the Pakistani 
government, 80% of the people of Hunza have electricity, and almost all the 
households have water pipes with clean water coming through them. There are 
roads connecting almost all the villages with the KKH. There are five high 
schools in Hunza and two intermediate colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Hunzakuts agree that they have been more successful than other 
communities along the KKH because they are better educated. More than 90% of 
Hunzakut children today attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Islam came to the area along the trade routes, and by the 1800s most of Hunza 
had converted. Today the overwhelming majority of Hunzakuts are members of a 
small sect of the Shiite community; its spiritual leader, the Aga Khan, is 
considered by his followers to be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed through 
his cousin and son-in-law Hazrat Ali, and therefore an imam. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Westerners the Aga Khan's name evokes the image of the present imam's 
father, the playboy Prince Aly Khan, who married movie star Rita Hayworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the changes the highway has wrought, the biggest, everyone agrees, is 
the widespread use of money. Before the KKH, the price of an ox was calculated 
in wheat. But now trading is on a big commercial scale and for money. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest sources of cash income in Hunza today is tourism. Since the 
Khunjerab Pass opened, travelers have been coming to Hunza in increasing 
numbers; in 1991 nearly 40,000 foreign tourists passed through. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, most Hunzakuts would probably agree with 80-year-old Subedar Mir 
Hazar, whom I find harvesting potatoes in his fields. As he works his hands in 
the soil, I ask him if the people of his generation regret the changes that the 
KKH has brought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regret them?" he says. "Are you being funny? The road is the best thing that 
ever happened to us."

BAHAI PERSECUTION AS GLOBAL AS FAITH'S REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOY ASCHENBACH, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They've been branded as infidels and executed. Even their graves have been 
desecrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all world religions, the Bahai faith is one of the most geographically 
widespread and most persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahai communities are found in more than 200 countries and island territories. 
The 5.5 million Bahais believe in the equality and unity of the human family's 
5.5 billion people and their religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest Bahai community, about 1.2 million, is in predominantly Hindu 
India. The second-largest group, 300,000 to 350,000, forms the biggest 
non-Islamic religious minority in Shiite Muslim Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are the Bahai more oppressed than in this Persian land, where their 
religion was born in the mid-19th Century. Followers of the prophet-founder 
Baha' Allah, Arabic for the "Glory of God," were persecuted from the beginning. 
Baha' Allah, born in Tehran, is revered as the latest of a series of divine 
messengers that includes Jesus, Mohammed, Zoroaster and Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bahai are targets of religious persecution to this day, in the judgment of 
the U.N. human rights commission and the U.S. State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their leaders have been killed or forced to leave the country," says Andrew 
Whitley, director of the New York-based Middle East Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahais are barred from jobs in government and state-owned industries, Iran's 
largest employers. It is illegal for infidels to receive money from an Islamic 
government. Pensions are confiscated and revoked. Higher education is 
forbidden. Travel and passports are restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these conditions continue for a century, it would turn the people into 
paupers. The Bahais would become the Iranian untouchables," says Firuz 
Kazemzadeh, professor emeritus of Russian history at Yale University. 
Kazemzadeh was born into a Bahai family and has been an elected member of the 
Bahai's U.S. governing body for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bahai faith is under pressure in much of the Muslim world," Kazemzadeh 
says. "The religion was completely destroyed in Iraq over the last 25 to 30 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 In Iran, organized Bahai activities are prohibited. No Bahai structure is 
left. Since 1979, when the Islamic fundamentalist regime seized power, 216 
Bahais have been killed in Iran. Most of them were religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "These weren't random killings," Kazemzadeh says. "It was a deliberate attempt 
to behead the community, like shooting all the Roman Catholic bishops of a 
country. The persecution is the worst since the mid-19th Century, when 20,000 
Bahais died for their faith. This steady, determined campaign to destroy the 
Bahai community I have called genocide by attrition." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of pressure and publicity from the United Nations and international 
human rights organizations, large-scale executions and street killings have 
stopped, Whitley says. The last confirmed execution was in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been persecuted in every conceivable way," says Robert Henderson, 
secretary general of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahai of the United 
States, whose only North American temple is in Wilmette, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, religious persecution is most severe in Iran and other Islamic 
fundamentalist nations, says the State Department's 1993 human rights report on 
193 countries. In Iran, the penalty for converting to Christianity is death. 
Christians also suffer major obstacles to freedom of worship in Iraq, Sudan and 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven Bahai houses of worship span the globe. They are in such diverse 
places as Panama, Germany, Uganda, Australia and Western Samoa. The Bahai 
international center sits in Haifa, Israel, which was part of Palestine when 
the exiled prophet Baha' Allah spent the last 24 years of his life there, dying 
in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although our numbers are still small, our spread throughout the world is 
intentional. The principles of our religion are universalist," Kazemzadeh says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bahai have no organized hierarchy of clergy, no sects or divisions. 
Everyone follows the written, unchanged teachings of the divine messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The most vital challenge facing the 120,000 U.S. Bahais, Henderson says, is 
eliminating racism in this country. Bahais set up communities without cultural 
barriers. They work hard at achieving integration that is more than just 
acceptance. Twenty years ago there was a deliberate campaign to reach rural 
black communities in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the largest U.S. Bahai communities are in California and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether at the United Nations or on a Pacific island, says Kit Bigelow Cosby, 
deputy director of the Bahai external affairs office in Washington, D.C., 
"every Bahai is dedicated to establishing peace on the planet."

THEIR 'WATERLOO' AT DIEN BIEN PHU STILL RANKLES FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's synonymous with overwhelming defeat, an utter rout that four decades 
later is the modern Frenchman's Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
 France's defeat at Dien Bien Phu by a Vietnamese peasant army still causes 
shudders and shrugs among French today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves the image on one hand of defeat, on the other of relief, because it 
meant the end of the war in Vietnam," said Henri Tabah, a 73-year-old art 
photographer. "But it was at much too high a price." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40th anniversary of Dien Bien Phu is being overshadowed in France by the 
50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy in June, the 80th 
anniversary of the declaration of World War I in August and the 40th 
anniversary of the start of the Algerian war in November, according to the 
Ministry of Veterans' Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it's not something we French commemorate much," Tabah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young French people have little awareness of this corner of France's 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something over in China, was that it?" frowned Patrice Chesnaie, a butcher's 
apprentice in his 20s. "Sorry, I only know the name." 
</P>
<P>
 Dien Bien Phu was "a particularly searing symbol of French military defeat," 
according to the authoritative Perrin's Historical Encyclopedia of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Americans the French have resisted confronting their Vietnam 
experience, and only in 1992 did the first feature film about Dien Bien Phu 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Pierre Schoendorffer, himself taken prisoner of war during the 
battle, felt moved to make the film "Dien Bien Phu" because "it's a European 
tradition to let the wounds heal without talking about them." 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a sacred place," Schoendorffer said when he revisited the 
battlefield. "This was a country we loved, this was our last battle. . . . But 
we can come back with our heads high, with respect for the Vietnamese."

'CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE' WINS HOSTILE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia may be the City of Brotherly Love but it is also the most hostile 
of 10 big U.S. cities surveyed, according to figures released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Gallup Organization found that Philadelphia had the highest 
"hostility index" ranking, with New York second and Cleveland third. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom was Honolulu, found to be the most relaxed of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anger kills," said Dr. Redford Williams of the Duke University Medical School 
in Durham, N.C., which commissioned the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong correlation between hostility and death rates. The angrier 
people are and the more cynical they are, the shorter their life span," he said 
in a release announcing the results.

RETIREE HELPS TURN DRILL INSTRUCTORS INTO TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Jack Hexter had an idea and, at age 81, wandered into the 
political process. Now Hexter's idea is a law that might make a difference to 
some former soldiers and some kids in need of a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was born as Hexter watched with admiration the demeanor of American 
forces during the Persian Gulf War -- "those poor bastards were out in the 
desert with nothing to drink but water, no girls, nothing to do for months." 
What, he wondered, was going to happen to all those noncommissioned officers 
when the services reduced their ranks? 
</P>
<P>
 The Army is cutting down from 762,000 people three years ago to under 400,000 
in a few years. A lot of people will be looking for work in midlife. 
</P>
<P>
 What many sergeants mostly do -- and do well -- Hexter reasoned, is to train 
young people, taking often aimless 18-year-olds and giving them discipline and 
self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can do it for teen-agers in uniform, he told himself, they could do it 
just as well for their brothers and sisters in poor schools in inner cities, in 
the hills of Appalachia, in impoverished communities in every state. Those 
schools often have trouble finding male teachers who can set an example for 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hexter, a retired history professor, took his idea to his old boss, William 
Danforth, chancellor of Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'That's a wonderful idea; carry it as far as you can,' " Hexter 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hexter presented his idea in a paper to the American Philosophical Society. 
He researched it. He wrote opinion pieces for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He 
traveled to Washington to call on William Danforth's brother, John, a 
Republican senator from Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw him speak of his persistence. They even may have come to dread 
his phone calls. Hexter's idea became Hexter's obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Often in Washington, a senator deals with a situation like this by having a 
bill drafted. The bill goes nowhere, but the legislator tells the constituent 
he tried. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hexter's idea caught Danforth's imagination. The senator turned the 
professor over to a young legislative aide, Jeff Ballabon. Make it happen, he 
instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballabon found that a "Troops to Teachers" law had passed in 1992 to help 
mustered-out service people win teaching certification. But the law had never 
been funded. And, he found, it would have locked out 96% of noncommissioned 
officers because they lack college degrees, as the program required. 
</P>
<P>
 So Ballabon drafted an amendment. If ex-soldiers earn a college degree (the GI 
Bill helps here), they would be eligible for stipends of up to $5,000 to allow 
them to become certified as teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make sure there would be jobs for them, the amendment provided that 
schools with high enrollments of poor youngsters would get an inducement -- 
$50,000 in subsidies for the first five years of the teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress was on its August recess. Ballabon lobbied committee staffs in the 
Senate and the House. He placed a strategic phone call to a friend who worked 
in the office of Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He networked; it worked. When Congress returned, Danforth introduced the 
amendment. It passed the Senate in less than 20 minutes and survived the rest 
of the congressional process. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress appropriated $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final acknowledgment for this amendment," Danforth told the Senate just 
before the vote, "must go to a distinguished and learned constituent of mine, 
Dr. J. H. Hexter. . . . He has argued his case elegantly and compellingly to me 
and to many policy-makers across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 John Gantz is chief of the teacher placement program in an outfit called 
Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support in Florida. He'll help 
administer the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's gotten about 1,500 applications. Forty percent are coming from 
noncommissioned officers -- Hexter's sergeants, with no skills to offer except 
the ability to mold kids.

W. VA. THROWS BOOK AT PARENTS IN TRUANCY LESSON; EDUCATION: MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
CAN BE FINED, JAILED OR SENT TO CLASS IF CHILDREN ARE REPEATEDLY ABSENT. IN 
EXTREME CASES, PUPILS HAVE BEEN PUT IN FOSTER HOMES.

<P>
 After 13-year-old Shawn Stacy missed more than 40% of the previous school 
year, Wayne County Circuit Judge Robert Chafin got tough: He ordered Shawn's 
unemployed parents to attend classes with their son to ensure that the boy 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on the principle that students who skip school now are most likely 
to drop out later, states are getting tough on truants -- and in West Virginia, 
their parents have to toe the mark as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With one of the sternest truancy laws in the nation to back them up, West 
Virginia's attendance officers are going after parents whose children don't go 
to class, threatening them with fines of up to $100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't work, parents can be sentenced to as much as 20 days in jail 
for each day their child misses school without a legitimate excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In extreme cases, chronically truant children have been placed in foster 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that kids who don't come to school are the ones who drop 
out as soon as they're old enough," said Therese Wilson, director of student 
services and assessment for the West Virginia Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's system has some unexpected bonuses. By the end of their first 
semester at Wayne Middle School, county officials say, each of Shawn Stacy's 
parents were well on their way to earning a General Equivalency Diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states have taken a sterner approach to truants in recent years, said 
Chris Pipho, spokesman for the Education Commission of the States, a 
Denver-based information clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A flood of similar laws appeared after West Virginia decreed in 1988 that 
students who quit school before 18 would lose their driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas decided that students could not participate in high school athletics if 
they missed too much school or failed to pass, and in Maine, the carrot is a 
hunting license: Children under 18 who fail or drop out of school are not 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Different places handle this in different ways, but most states are taking 
truancy more seriously than they have in the past," Pipho said. 
</P>
<P>
 "West Virginia laws do seem a bit more rigorous than those in most other 
states. They're really trying to crack down because they see the connection 
between truancy and dropouts." 
</P>
<P>
 The national dropout rate was 11.2% in 1990, the latest year for which figures 
are available, said the Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac, which estimated 
West Virginia's rate at 10.9% that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said her calculations, however, put the state's rate at 17.7% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 However you figure it, the number of West Virginia students who drop out is 
declining, Wilson said. The rate was 19.43% in 1984-85, by state calculations, 
but down to 15.2% in 1992-93, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson credited the decline to the state's decision 10 years ago to adopt a 
"performance-based" method of accrediting school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We evaluate county school districts based on dropout rates, attendance rates, 
test scores, a little of everything," she said. "If the county's absenteeism or 
dropout rates are higher than state averages, we work with those counties to 
improve them." 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to improve can mean a state takeover of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 That severe accountability has helped, said Bennie Thomas, director of 
attendance and social services for the Cabell County system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to maintain 90% attendance to stay off probation," Thomas said. "This 
year, so far, has been our best year. Through the first semester, we were 
running a 93% attendance rate countywide, and that's the best I can ever 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
 In calculating attendance rates, schools do not distinguish between students 
who simply decide not to attend and those who are absent because of illness or 
some other legitimate reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said those stringent standards have led school officials to intervene 
early to keep absenteeism down. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cabell County, a truancy petition is filed with Circuit Court if a student 
has more than five unexcused absences, Thomas said. Before the state began 
accrediting systems, attendance officers rarely took a case to court, or waited 
until a student had missed 80 or 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an impossible situation," said county juvenile probation officer 
Doug White, who works with Thomas on the cases. "Any student who missed that 
many days was going to fail anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia's compulsory attendance laws were first enacted in 1897, and the 
provision holding parents responsible for their children's attendance has been 
on the books almost that long. 
</P>
<P>
 But most state officials agree that the most stringent part of the law, which 
allows parents to be jailed for their children's absences, was not really 
enforced until 1989, the year after the state overhauled its statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, in what officials label the first such instance, Jeanetta Norvell 
of Huntington was jailed for a day, then sentenced to attend school with her 
15-year-old daughter, Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norvell case was the only time Thomas has resorted to the courts and, he 
said, "It wasn't real successful." Two weeks after her mother was sentenced, 
Diana Norvell turned 16 and legally dropped out of school -- with her mother's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thomas said, just getting students to school often can win the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some kids now who have finally gotten into the habit of going to 
school, and they have discovered that they can learn something and they are 
actually passing classes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a little bit of success can perpetuate itself, and they find school 
isn't such a bad place to be after all."

MARRIED LIFE, ACADEMIC CAREER TOUGH MIXTURE; TEACHERS: TIGHT JOB MARKET MEANS 
THAT FEW COUPLES FIND WORK IN THE SAME PLACE. SEPARATION, COMMUTES PUT STRAINS 
ON MANY FAMILIES.

 Maria Minich Brewer and Daniel Brewer took the best job offers they got -- 
straight to different cities. It was 14 years before they shared the same roof 
again for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd known how long it would take, I wouldn't have done it," said Maria 
Brewer, who, like her husband, teaches college French. "But I didn't know. And 
that's probably a good thing. Because it kept me in the profession." 
</P>
<P>
 And there lies the curse of love in the Ivory Tower, which the influx of 
female professors and a tight job market have made an unlikely crucible of 
modern marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women teaching in colleges and universities rose from 12% of 
total faculty in 1969 to 30% in 1991, according to the American Council on 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 With more women looking for positions in a tight job market, academics who 
marry each other today risk having to live apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's endemic in the academe right now," said Sarah Webster Goodwin, an 
associate English professor at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Her 
husband quit his job teaching Sanskrit at Brown University to reunite their 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know many commuting couples," she said. "If you have two faculty members, 
chances are they will not get a good job in the same place." 
</P>
<P>
 That was true for the Brewers, who began their tale of two cities in 1978 when 
she got her job in Minneapolis. He worked five years at Cornell University in 
Ithaca, N.Y., before moving to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple spent summers together, took sabbaticals, unpaid leaves -- anything 
to bring them and their two boys, now 5 and 13, together. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they got lucky. In 1992, the University of Minnesota came through with a 
gem -- tenured spots in the same field. "We just kind of thought we'd died and 
gone to heaven," Daniel Brewer laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Things weren't so divine for their Minnesota colleague Tom Conley and his 
wife, Verena Conley. The two professors of French have been married 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been commuting for 23 of them and we don't like it," Tom Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage nearly fell apart at one point before Verena Conley landed a 
tenured job at Miami University of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Producing a life of value is centered on little things, like having breakfast 
and coffee together," Tom Conley said. "Everything turns into a tremendously 
difficult event that has to be factored into this baroque schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then the money -- we've just been bled dry. We're $60,000 in debt. Delta 
and Northwest Airlines own the rights to our bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Verena Conley went on the job market when nepotism rules limited career 
options for professors' "wives." When Tom got his job at the University of 
Minnesota in 1973, "he was told flat out there would be nothing for his wife," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple chose not to make career sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could've been together under circumstances that would not have made one of 
the people very happy," Verena Conley said. "It's very hard when you want equal 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 It was easier for schools in the 1950s, when men had regular positions and 
nepotism rules forced women into research posts or part-time teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances -- more women working, a job market that's been shrinking 
since 1988 and more people getting Ph.D.s -- have helped turn academia into a 
nuptial nightmare, said Bettina Huber, research director for the Modern 
Language Assn., which represents 30,000 teachers of English and foreign 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't caught up in terms of our policies with the consequences of 
two people being in the workplace," said Goodwin, whose husband watches the 
children and is considering a career outside academia. 
</P>
<P>
 Most colleges and universities have abandoned nepotism rules. Some are 
adopting spousal-hiring policies in which they give special consideration to 
faculty spouses when jobs open up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It arises in virtually every conversation I have with a candidate," said Reed 
Browning, the provost at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. "And I'm not the one 
that brings it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenyon, Denison University and The College of Wooster, rural Ohio schools 
within an hour's drive from one another, have taken out a joint ad in the 
Chronicle of Higher Education seeking academic couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all face situations now that almost every position we want to fill -- the 
person has a spouse with professional ambitions," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators say their commitment to hiring the best person for the job 
makes it hard to guarantee jobs for spouses. Most faculty members would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there should be universal pressure to hire spouses," Goodwin 
said. "That would be death." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are ways to make life easier for commuter couples, such as 
scheduling classes and easing time-consuming committee assignments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin is writing a handbook on family policy to help administrators and 
faculty deal with new issues sprung from academe's changed work force. 
</P>
<P>
 For commuting partners, it's about time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academic institutions eat people. Even the best of them, in terms of teaching 
load, build up demands that can be amazing," Goodwin said.

<P>
 The family of a Mississippi man who died of lung cancer a week ago is suing 
the tobacco industry for $650 million, claiming secondhand smoke caused his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Burl Butler, a nonsmoker, contracted lung cancer after 
inhaling tobacco smoke at the barber shop he ran for 35 years in Laurel, Miss., 
a rural community located about 100 miles southeast of Jackson.

 President Clinton, in his first commencement address this year, made the hand 
sign for "congratulations" Friday to students at Gallaudet University for the 
deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivering an upbeat message of triumph over adversity and equal opportunity 
for the disabled, Clinton drew cheers from the crowd of 384 graduates and 
thousands of well-wishers at a field house at the Gallaudet campus in northeast 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students of Gallaudet University, who have struggled so mightily, first 
for simple dignity and then for equal opportunity . . . have built yourselves 
and in the process you have built for the rest of us, your fellow citizens of 
this country and the world, a much better world," Clinton said. "You have 
re-given to all of us our hope."

BAD YEAR FOR ROADS ADDS UP TO GOOD YEAR FOR SALT MINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN DOBBIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With their tarpaulin tops flapping madly, tractor-trailer trucks laden with 
road salt thunder across the Genesee River valley, bound for icy points from 
Maine to the Mason-Dixon line. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-mile beneath the snowy farmland, miners ladle up the precious winter 
commodity in 17-ton scoops, the headlights of the front-end loaders dancing 
over great crystal pillars in a honeycomb the size of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have so many cried out so loudly for so much de-icer salt. And though 
his shoulders ache from pulling levers, and his face is florid from 80-hour 
workweeks, Larry Dunn Jr. looks equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been rough, but the paycheck's been good," growls Dunn, a bearlike 
presence in the locker room during the afternoon shift change. Two packs of 
cigarettes are jammed in his shirt pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see it go like this than in 1982, when I was laid off. That was a 
lot harder on me -- not having no paycheck for 11 months -- than working like 
this for two months. When the snow don't fly, the business don't go." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn is grossing up to $2,500 a week at Retsof, the largest rock-salt mine in 
the Americas. It hasn't been this busy since he first joined his father down 
the 1,100-foot-deep elevator shaft 17 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northeast bore the brunt of one of the nation's worst winters in a 
century, sending municipalities scrambling to replenish their salt supplies. 
And though the fierce winter of 1993-94 looks to be about over, the strenuous 
pace here isn't likely to let up for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Akzo Salt Inc. had built up a record stockpile of more than half 
a million tons, enough to fill four football stadiums to a height of 75 feet. 
By March it had been carted away by as many as 150 rail cars and 1,000 trucks a 
day backed up for miles between Genesee and Retsof. The mountain of salt will 
have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 This hamlet in Upstate New York, 30 miles south of Rochester, got its 
back-to-front name from salt baron William Foster. Its residents have lived 
with a taste of salt on their lips since 1885, when a man drilling for gas 
bored into a salt bed estimated to cover 25 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter of 1978-79, the nation's rock-salt suppliers sold 11.3 million 
tons, an all-time high likely to be surpassed this year. Retsof has been 
churning out 35,000 tons a day for weeks, says Bob Steele, vice president of 
production at Akzo Salt, based in Clarks Summit, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakneck pace prompted the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration 
to issue an alert advising miners to be careful not to overdo it and ensure 
that mechanical equipment is properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can refuse to work this overtime if I want," says Dunn, president of the 
local chapter of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union. "We 
want to take a break, we just pull over and take a break. If the machinery 
ain't safe, we won't run it." 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-March, production was halted at Retsof by a huge cave-in that sent 
5,500 gallons of water a minute cascading into the deepest section of the mine. 
The deluge, possibly from an aquifer, will need to be pumped out. 
</P>
<P>
 The miners were initially kept busy carting out previously dynamited salt and 
hauling sandbags below ground, but the mine had to evacuated in midweek because 
of a rise in methane gas. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 people work salt mines in Kansas, Texas, Louisiana, Ohio and New 
York. Fatal accidents are few. The last occurred here in 1990, when a slab of 
salt buried two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Toiling through most weekends since Christmas, many of Akzo's 275 employees at 
Retsof are beginning to drag. Between the banter are occasional displays of 
irritation, the occasional burst of anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain supervisors ought to back off a little bit," grouses Mark Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just now, they were being nit-picky on some of the guys for trying to get to 
the 'cage' (elevator) two or three minutes early. After working seven days a 
week! It gets to you." 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the sound of it, home life is wearing at the edges, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even those who don't want to admit it, it's tough on the families," says 
Hamilton, who has three young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My social life hasn't been good this winter," says Derek Rawleigh, a 
load-haul-and-dump operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, who often works through midnight, drags himself out of bed at 6 a.m. to 
spend an hour with his 11-year-old son, John, before school. It's all the time 
they have together. "He's been missing me," says Dunn, a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 One good thing about the underground is the constant temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it down there," says Brian Austen, a maintenance worker waiting for 
his shift to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're 63 degrees year-round. No rain, no snow. I couldn't think of a nicer 
spot to work in, weather-wise."

RUSSIAN PILOTS VOW STRIKE ON SAFETY FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian airline pilots are threatening to strike because of a growing number 
of crashes and are demanding the government enforce air safety in the country's 
chaotic skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots, who earn as little as $21 a month, also want better pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Soviet Union in December, 1991, led to the breakup of 
Aeroflot, once the world's largest airline, into hundreds of tiny carriers that 
have often failed to maintain their aging fleets of jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline passengers are far more likely to be killed in crashes in Russia than 
elsewhere in the world. Last month, an international organization strongly 
recommended that travelers avoid flying over any part of the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of fatalities per 1 million passengers, used internationally as a 
safety indicator, has been rising steadily in Russia since the Soviet breakup, 
from one in 1990 to 5.5 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With two major crashes this year that killed almost 200 people, the rate 
jumped to 32 in the first quarter of 1994, a level described as "unprecedented 
and intolerable" in the newspaper Segodnya. 
</P>
<P>
 The international average has been less than one fatality per 1 million 
passengers.

PALLID STURGEON ENDANGERED BY CHANGES TO RIVERS; JURASSIC AGE FISH MAY NOT SEE 
YEAR 2000 AS FLOOD CONTROL DAMS DESTROY NORMAL CYCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT ANDERSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A remnant of the dinosaur age, the ungainly pallid sturgeon has inhabited the 
murky depths of rivers for millions of years. Now, because of the way the 
Missouri and Mississippi rivers have been manipulated since the 1940s, the fish 
is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been around since the Jurassic period, but they may not make it to 
the year 2000," said Kent Keenlyne, Missouri River coordinator for the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service in Pierre, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 The pale white sturgeon, prized for its eggs that are eaten as caviar, could 
be saved from extinction but at the cost of less navigation on the rivers, more 
damaging floods and lower generation of hydroelectric power. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always costs associated with this," said Roy McAllister, who is 
overseeing a review of the Army Corps of Engineers' master manual for operation 
of the Missouri River. "It depends on how much people are willing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, tens of thousands of sturgeon roamed the rivers. They adapted to the 
seasonal cycles, spawning during times of increased water flow, like the April 
and June rises caused by melting snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Research shows that the fish, which can grow to 80 pounds, was perfectly 
suited to the murky Missouri. The river was nicknamed "Big Muddy" because of 
the sediment and woodland debris that came from erosion and the natural flood 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed after World War II, when a series of six flood-control dams 
were built along the upper Missouri. The normal cycles of the river were 
interrupted and migration routes blocked. The sturgeon began an inevitable 
decline that led to its place on the endangered species list in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Keenlyne estimates there could be a few thousand sturgeon remaining 
along their entire range, which stretches 3,500 miles from the Yellowstone 
River in Montana to the mouth of the Mississippi in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Wildlife Service has just released a long-term recovery plan that 
could affect inland shipping, electric power and flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Midwestern members of Congress are worried about the impact on jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The human factor, the job element, should be considered when these kinds of 
issues are on the table," said Rep. Bill Emerson (R-Mo.). "The pallid sturgeon 
issue should not become another snail darter and or spotted owl." 
</P>
<P>
 The sturgeon recovery plan encompasses a wide range of recommendations, 
including moratoriums on all commercial sturgeon fishing, stocking rivers with 
captive-bred fish and dumping old trees into channels to form habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic impact, however, will most likely be felt in a series of 
proposals to restore the rivers' natural flow patterns, figure out how to 
restore the habitat of sandbars and braided channels and remove obstacles to 
sturgeon migration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to focus initial recovery efforts in six 
key areas along the Missouri, Yellowstone, Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. 
Officials said these areas would require the least amount of modification. 
</P>
<P>
 McAllister said some computer models indicate that making such changes could 
interrupt navigation along the Missouri, possibly for two months out of the 
year from Sioux City, Iowa, to St. Louis, and increase the magnitude of floods. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a draft economic study by the corps, reductions in river flows 
could increase costs for shippers of commodities such as farm products, 
chemicals and oil. Use of barges now can save shippers as much as $9 a ton over 
alternatives such as railroads and trucks, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups contend that the potential for the corps changing its 
operation of the Missouri is the only chance in the next 20 years to save the 
sturgeon and other species, including an endangered plover and tern whose 
sandbar nests have been wiped out by flow changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest decision that will be made on the Missouri River since they 
built the dams," said Scott Faber of Washington-based American Rivers. "The 
sturgeons are really the canaries in the coal mine. These alterations in the 
river are causing harm to all the species." 
</P>
<P>
 The economic impact won't be as great on navigation as some may claim, Faber 
said. He cited a 1992 General Accounting Office report indicating that shipping 
tonnage on the Missouri has never lived up to the 1944 estimates of 12 million 
tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That GAO report showed that commercial navigation peaked at 3.3 million tons 
in 1977 and has declined every year since. Nonetheless, such economic interests 
have powerful protectors in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this will be a political decision, not a scientific decision," Faber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No final decisions have been made on any changes in river operations. 
McAllister said the corps will produce a draft environmental impact statement 
this summer and conduct a series of public meetings around the region to 
determine which alternatives to choose.

HEIST FAILS; JAILED ROBBER SUES FOR LOOT

 A man who tried to rob a bank sued it from jail for $15 million, saying the 
bank had inflated its estimate of the amount of money it didn't lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Amil Dinsio, 58, who along with relatives tried to break into United Carolina 
Bank two years ago by hacking a hole in the roof, sued the bank in federal 
court, according to Friday's edition of The Charlotte Observer. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from jail in Loretto, Pa., Dinsio called the $15 million "just a 
figure," the paper said. "It's what you do in lawsuits. I'd be happy with a 
couple of million."

DANGER SEEN IN INMATES' COMPUTER ACTIVITY; GOVERNMENT: KANSAS PROSECUTOR KNOWS 
FIRSTHAND DANGERS INHERENT IN ALLOWING PRISONERS TO WORK ON COMPUTERIZED 
RECORDS. HE SEES PERIL TO WITNESSES AND VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA S. FISHER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter startled Nick Tomasic. It was from a prison inmate; other fellow 
prisoners, assigned to computerize records, had taken a Social Security number 
from an accident report and tried to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasic is the district attorney for Wyandotte County. It was his number. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Tomasic knows, his Social Security number hasn't been used to try to 
gain access to confidential information; corrections officials deny that 
inmates ever had access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if convicts tried to use their access to information to harm 
witnesses or victims? 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine states, including California, and the federal government save 
money by having prisoners "key in" data for computers; Tomasic wonders whether 
a tragedy lurks there, waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities dismiss his concerns. Leonard Black, immediate past president of 
the National Correctional Industries Assn. in Belle Mead, N.J., said Tomasic's 
experience was "an isolated instance." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 10 to 12 years we've had these programs, we haven't had any problems 
with the information being abused," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the data entry programs vary from state to state, the information the 
inmates process ranges from accident reports to higher education records. 
</P>
<P>
 In Missouri, inmates at the Central Missouri Correctional Center near 
Jefferson City enter information for the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas, medium-security inmates at the Lansing Correctional Facility type 
in information on traffic accidents from around the state. The accident reports 
contain names, addresses and license plate numbers of people involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kansan's Social Security number also will be on the report if that person 
chooses it to be used as a driver's license number. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasic said there's a possibility prisoners could, for example, learn where a 
witness lived from the reports or find out the phone number of a victim. 
Witnesses and victims could be harassed -- or worse -- once a convict has such 
information in hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a detective for the Johnson City, Kan., sheriff's office, Kent P. 
Willnauer, is investigating reports that an ex-con used Social Security numbers 
and other information to open fraudulent bank accounts. The data, Willnauer 
said, allegedly came from an inmate at Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said the state saves a lot of money having the prisoners (do the data 
entry)," Tomasic said. "But I told them that money should not be a concern when 
people's safety is at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeri Costa, assistant director of education and training for the National 
Victims Center in Arlington, Va., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be protecting individuals' personal information and not just 
handing it to people who we know are prone to committing crimes," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we give them personal information -- names, addresses and telephone 
numbers -- (the inmates) would have access to a variety of things. They could 
stalk someone or determine this is someone they would like to meet or maybe 
break into their home." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kansas officials said Tomasic's is the first complaint about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if there was a problem, then it would be best to identify the problem 
rather than say the whole program is no good," said Mike Rees, chief counsel 
for the Kansas Department of Transportation in Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees estimated that before the prison program started, the KDOT spent about 
$150,000 to do the work. The annual contract for the Lansing program amounts to 
about $68,400. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to a state senator, Gary Stotts, secretary of the Department of 
Corrections, insisted that "inmates did not have access to Mr. Tomasic's Social 
Security number or credit card numbers as a result of making data entry from 
the accident report." 
</P>
<P>
 Stotts also said the program is being "closely reviewed" and will likely be 
discontinued if officials find "any significant impropriety."

EX-PUBLIC DEFENDER NOW CRUSADES AGAINST EARLY RELEASE OF CONVICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MARTINEZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Finnegan, a former public defender who later became a prosecutor, 
gave up her legal career to lead a crusade against the early release of prison 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was forced into it at the point of a gun," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnegan still has long, thin bullet scars on her arms from her abduction and 
robbery in a Punta Gorda field, about 75 miles south of Tampa, six years ago 
when a career criminal on early release from prison fired on her and a fellow 
prosecutor, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 And her voice still quivers when she recounts the horror of being covered in 
blood as she ran into the night for help, hiding in ditches along the way, 
fearing the killer was closing in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt I survived for a reason," says Finnegan, who credits slain 
prosecutor Norman Langston with taking two bullets in the head for her after 
the gunman began shooting at them in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He covered me, he leaned over me -- he actually made a decision at some point 
to save my life. That can't be in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever pay back Norm for saving my life, but maybe if we can stop it 
from happening to someone else, then it may somehow justify his death." 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Port Charlotte woman last year volunteered to run STOP -- Stop 
Turning Out Prisoners -- a grass-roots movement devoted to fixing the 
"revolving door of injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Finnegan and Langston were assistant state attorneys. They were 
celebrating with other prosecutors at a Howard Johnson's motel bar. Finnegan 
had just presented her first murder case to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably the best day of my career -- I was on top of the world -- 
everything was going really well," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 When Finnegan and Langston walked out of the bar together about 10 p.m. they 
were confronted by released convict Samuel Pettit in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to talk and tried to reason with him -- we said you can have our 
stuff, here. It's amazing, we had law enforcement training, but when he sticks 
that gun in your side, it's real hard not to do what he says to do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston was forced to drive his Ford Probe, with Finnegan and Pettit next to 
him in the front seat. In a remote field, Pettit robbed them of jewelry and 
cash, and then opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting stopped, Finnegan didn't move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dark and all I could do was listen," she says. "He kept trying to fire 
the gun and it misfired. He kept clicking it faster. It turned out he was out 
of bullets. I played dead, absolutely dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman left on foot and after a while Finnegan ran for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out running," she says. "It turned out I was actually chasing the 
guy. I didn't know it at the time. At first I tried to flag down cars but 
nobody stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 She finally called police from a tavern about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a day later in Naples, 60 miles south of Punta Gorda, two patrolling 
officers found Pettit asleep in bushes near a beach. He was armed with a 
.22-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston died from head wounds two days after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida inmates serve only about 40% of their sentences because of prison 
overcrowding. More than half of those released early commit crimes and are put 
back behind bars again, according to the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated at years of inaction by lawmakers on the issue, STOP is leading a 
drive to force the state to stop releasing prisoners early. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 Floridians have already signed a petition for a November 
ballot initiative that would amend the state Constitution to require all 
prisoners to serve at least 85% of their sentence. STOP must have 430,000 
validated signatures by August to get the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 At county fairs, shopping malls and grocery stores across the state, Finnegan 
tells her story to anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to call Kathleen our poster child," says Manatee County Sheriff 
Charlie Wells, STOP's founder. "Every movement has to have somebody who has 
been there, suffered through it and is the human face of the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wells who first approached Finnegan about speaking at STOP's 
organizational meeting three years ago. She balked. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Finnegan wallowed in anger and depression over her ordeal. She 
had quit the prosecutor's office because it was "getting too personal." And 
private practice left her unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't stop replaying that awful night in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And couldn't forget the fact that the suspect, Samuel Pettit, had 17 prior 
convictions, served two years of a 3 1/2-year sentence for car theft and 
resisting arrest, and was out of prison two months before the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 After finally seeing Pettit sentenced to Death Row, where he still is, 
dredging up the tragedy again was not something she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wells was persistent about getting Finnegan to tell her story. Finally, 
she agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried through the whole thing," she says, recalling her first speech. "But 
afterwards, so many people came up who were crying too and said, 'I know how 
you feel, I've been through it too.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly it went from me and my own problem to everyone's problem. I saw how 
many other people were victims of early releases. I'm just one of thousands." 
</P>
<P>
 Finnegan quit the prosecutor's office shortly after the shooting and went into 
private practice. She became executive director of STOP in January, 1992, and 
closed her private practice in December, 1992. She has been running STOP full 
time ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a hearty distaste for politics. Now she helps run her family's marina 
and mobile home park in Charlotte County, besides her role in STOP. She says 
she doesn't know if she will ever return to law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the latest early prison releases gone bad have only served to fan the 
flames of the STOP movement. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two men who admitted to February's murder of a Florida State 
University student and the rape of his sister had 14 arrests on his record and 
was last freed from prison after serving only a year of a five-year sentence 
for grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 And last month in Lakeland, an angry Polk County Sheriff Lawrence Crow called 
on the state to apologize to the family of 11-year-old Kimberly Ann Waters, who 
was snatched from her bedroom, raped, strangled and dumped in a garbage bin. 
The man accused in the attack had a rap sheet six feet long and was released 
from prison after serving only five years of a 15-year burglary and grand theft 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mother of a 17-year-old Hollywood girl strangled by a convict 
released early offered her help to STOP, Finnegan gave her the same advice she 
gives all survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring pictures of your daughter and show them to your legislators," she said. 
"Let them see what this is costing us by not having enough prisons." 
</P>
<P>
 The intended effect of the STOP amendment is to force the Legislature to pay 
for the additional prison beds needed to protect Florida's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials say it would cost $2.3 billion over the next five years 
to add 47,000 prison beds to the existing 55,000 to reach the level where 
inmates serve at least 85% of their time. STOP maintains it is up to lawmakers 
to find a way to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what infuriates us," Finnegan says. "It's still happening while up in 
Tallahassee they're arguing and they're playing politics. Don't they realize 
there are lives at stake?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit has repeatedly said he wants to die in Florida's electric chair and 
offered no mitigating circumstances at his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview a year after the shooting, Pettit said: "I think I should have 
done better because she lived. . . . I would've killed her too."

BREYER SURVIVOR FREE OF PARTISAN ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER WILSON, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Breyer, nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Clinton 
Friday, is a respected jurist who seems to have survived the rough-and-tumble 
of Washington politics without making partisan enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Watergate assistant prosecutor and chief counsel to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee which will consider his appointment, Breyer is currently 
the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also the chief architect of airline deregulation -- one of the most 
contentious legislative issues of the 1970s -- and helped hammer out federal 
sentencing guidelines as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission from 1985 
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last federal judges appointed by former President Jimmy Carter, 
Breyer was touted for possible appointment to the Supreme Court last year but 
passed over when Clinton instead appointed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer has many backers in the House and Senate Judiciary Committee from 
Republican conservatives like Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Orrin G. 
Hatch of Utah to liberal Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Breyer would bring to that court an ability to . . . form coalitions," 
Kennedy said of Breyer earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Breyer was born Aug. 15, 1938, in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated with highest honors from Stanford University in 1959 and two 
years later earned a B.A. degree from Magdalen College at Oxford, where he 
studied philosophy, politics and economics as a Marshall Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating magna cum laude in 1964 from Harvard Law School, where he is 
still a lecturer on administrative law and economic regulation, Breyer clerked 
for Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year stint in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, 
Breyer was enlisted by then-Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, his 
former law professor, as an assistant special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 His first appointment to the judicial bench came in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and associates say Breyer is no ideologue. He has concentrated on 
cases involving copyright, anti-trust and government regulation. But his views 
on controversial social issues like abortion and the death penalty are not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal scholar whose writing style tends to be straightforward and concise, 
Breyer has co-authored a leading case book on administrative law and regulatory 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a professor of antitrust, administrative law and economic regulation at 
Harvard Law School for 10 years and also taught for much of the same time at 
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is reportedly a millionaire. According to a Boston Herald review of 
1991 financial disclosure forms, the Breyers are worth between $3.44 million 
and $5.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge is married to the former Joanna Hare, British-born daughter of Lord 
John Blakenham, a former Cabinet minister. She is a prominent Boston 
psychologist on the staff of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has three children: Chloe, 25, Nell, 22, and Michael, 19.

POLL FINDS ISRAELIS WOULD OBEY PALESTINIAN POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An opinion poll published Friday as Israeli troops turned over control of 
Jericho showed that a majority of Israelis would obey a Palestinian policeman's 
order to stop in self-rule areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dahaf Institute poll of 535 Israeli Jews, published in the Yedioth 
Ahronoth newspaper, showed 59% would obey an order to stop their cars in 
Palestinian self-rule areas, 30% said they would not and 11% did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, many of whom oppose 
the Israel-PLO peace deal, more were ready to comply with Palestinian police 
commands than to disobey. Of 302 Jewish settlers polled, 45% said they would 
obey, 40% said they would not and 15% did not respond.

MILWAUKEE STILL WARY OVER WATER SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delilah Bates' face tightens into a grimace. Every time she looks at the tap 
of her sink, she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, she and more than 403,000 other Milwaukee-area residents were 
sickened when they drank water contaminated with a parasite. And now, she says, 
she refuses to drink water straight from the tap. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I buy bottled water, sometimes I boil the water and then freeze 
it," said the 29-year-old nurse. "I just don't want to take any more chances of 
getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, an inadequate treatment process allowed cryptosporidium to pass 
through one of Milwaukee's two water purification plants and into water mains. 
For a week in April, the 800,000 people relying on the municipal water supply 
were told to boil their drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, and still is, the nation's largest waterborne disease outbreak, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy people who developed cryptosporidiosis got diarrhea and stomach 
cramps, but the parasite's effects were lethal for some with such conditions as 
AIDS or advanced cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak contributed -- at least indirectly -- to the deaths of more than 
100 people, city epidemiologist Kathleen Fessler estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost more than $54 million, much of it in lost productivity and money spent 
on hospitalization. At least 1,419 lawsuits are pending against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Little-known before the Milwaukee outbreak, cryptosporidium has surfaced 
elsewhere since. Boil orders were issued in Washington, D.C., last December and 
twice in Racine, Wis., this year after health officials detected possible 
contamination in those cities' water supplies. No one got ill in either city. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Wisconsin, cryptosporidium's effects are still felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of shatters your faith a little," said Richard Morris, 44, an 
Internal Revenue Service employee in Milwaukee who said he tries to drink 
bottled water, but sometimes still uses the tap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, isn't our water supposed to be safe?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the outbreak) pushed a lot of people over the edge," said Joel 
Burbach, general manager of the Artesian Water Co., a local bottled water 
distributorship. "The water supply's been a joke for years and now they're 
finally telling us about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottled water deliveries from his distributorship increased tenfold during the 
outbreak, he said, and are still about four times higher than they were last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to say . . . we have the best water right outside our doorstep," 
Burbach said. "They don't say that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 15% of Milwaukee residents regularly boil their drinking water, 
according to a recent survey by the Milwaukee Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-fourth of Milwaukee County residents still think the tap water in 
their homes is unsafe, according to survey. Thirty-eight percent said they buy 
bottled water for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak left more than just memories of upset stomachs and empty 
containers of bottled water. For Christopher Fons and dozens of others, 
cryptosporidium's effects were permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because AIDS had weakened his immune system, Fons was unable to fight off 
cryptosporidiosis. He has been left permanently debilitated by the infection. 
</P>
<P>
 If he makes it through the night without a bowel movement -- a rare event -- 
he is stricken with repeated bouts of cramps, vomiting and diarrhea throughout 
most of the day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends most days on a couch, unable to muster the energy to even leave the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a constant in my life," he said. "I've done everything I can, but 
I'm not ever going to be active again." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 82 AIDS patients died as a result of complications arising from 
cryptosporidiosis, said Tim Kennedy of the Milwaukee AIDS project. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 38 still suffer some effects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials estimate that at least 22 people other than AIDS patients may 
have died because of the parasite, said Dr. Charles Brummitt, an infectious 
disease specialist at St. Luke's Hospital in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS patients, the elderly and people who had other serious health problems 
made up most of the fatal or debilitating cases, Brummitt said.

W. GRAHAM CLAYTOR JR.; FORMER AMTRAK CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 W. Graham Claytor Jr., former chief executive of Amtrak and secretary of the 
Navy under President Jimmy Carter, died Saturday after a long illness. He was 
82. 
</P>
<P>
 Claytor, who suffered from cancer, died near his home at a hospital in 
Bradenton, Fla., according to Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Claytor was Amtrak's president and chairman from 1982 until his retirement in 
December. A lifelong railroad buff, he was widely acknowledged for saving the 
National Railroad Passenger Corp. -- Amtrak's formal name -- from losing all 
federal funding. He operated the government-owned railroad like a private 
business, paying strict attention to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Claytor handed over the leadership of Amtrak to Thomas Downs, who 
called it "kind of a miracle" that Claytor kept Amtrak alive during a decade of 
hostile administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Amtrak, Claytor was chairman and chief executive officer of 
Southern Railway. At a time when many railroads were in financial straits, 
Claytor made the railroad's New York-New Orleans "Southern Crescent" passenger 
train a showpiece, and continued to run it after most other railroads had 
turned their passenger operations over to Amtrak in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Claytor joined Southern as vice president of law in 1963, and rose to 
president in 1967 and chairman in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 After he retired from Southern in 1977, Claytor became secretary of the Navy 
and served in that post until 1979, when he was selected to be acting secretary 
of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was deputy secretary of defense from 1979 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Claytor was born in 1912 in Roanoke, Va. He attended the University of 
Virginia and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law 
Review.

ROY J. PLUNKETT; DUPONT CO. CHEMIST DISCOVERED TEFLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy J. Plunkett, a DuPont Co. chemist who discovered Teflon, which became a 
wide-ranging part of American life from frying pans to artificial blood 
vessels, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A DuPont Co. spokesman said Friday from company headquarters that Plunkett had 
died Thursday at his home in Corpus Christi, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The DuPont spokesman said Plunkett was 83 and died after a brief illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett was working as a research chemist for DuPont in 1938 when he 
discovered the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett, a native of New Carlisle, Ohio, was investigating the results of a 
failed experiment involving refrigeration gases at a DuPont laboratory in 
Deepwater, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The white, waxy substance, formally called polytetrafluoroethane, reacted with 
virtually no other chemical and proved to be one of the most slippery 
substances known. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-stick nature of Teflon also earned a place in popular language. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan was known in his presidency as "the Teflon President" for his 
ability to evade criticism, and Mafia boss John Gotti was dubbed "the Teflon 
don" for escaping the law numerous times before he was finally convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Manchester College, 
and a master's degree and doctorate from Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Teflon, Plunkett was inventor or co-inventor of a dozen other 
DuPont products patented in the United States, DuPont said. He retired as 
production manager for DuPont's organic chemicals department in 1975, after a 
39-year career.

DANA PARSONS: GETTING BEHIND THE PADDLING IDEA, IF APPLIED EQUALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's late Friday afternoon and the sun hasn't been out all week. I'm feeling 
poopy. Could that be why Mickey Conroy's idea about paddling graffiti vandals 
doesn't sound like a bad one to me? 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, the esteemed assemblyman from Orange, is on to something, but even he 
shrinks in the face of a good idea. I'll do him the unsolicited favor of 
arguing his case for him and, even more graciously, attaching an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolved, that the state sanction the paddling of convicted spray-painters. 
Uncivilized? Let's not kid ourselves. My fellow Americans, we're a country that 
went kicking and screaming just to ban assault weapons for private use. We're a 
country overwhelmingly in favor of killing people for capital crimes, even if 
it takes 15 years to get it done. We go to sleep at night as the state sends 
thousands of volts through people in the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, we can incorporate into that mind-set a few whacks on the fanny. The 
only proviso should be that the person is physically sound enough to handle the 
paddling. If they're able, they can be caned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us of a certain age can remember when public school administrators 
were allowed to paddle our behinds. Catholic school kids remember getting their 
knuckles rapped with Sister Elizabeth's ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 If corporal punishment in schools was leading us down the path to barbarism, 
then abolishing it should have played some role in making us less violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 However, let me hasten to say I oppose corporal punishment in the schools. For 
one thing, it would put too many school principals in peril from avenging 
students who now pack guns. I doubt you'd find too many principals who'd want 
to risk getting shot over a paddling. Giving out suspensions is risk free; most 
of the violators probably welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 So, forget the schools. But what about the criminal justice system? And for a 
crime as demoralizing to the larger society as graffiti vandalism? Why blanch 
at that? 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals never expect to get caught in the first place, and many spray-painters 
are driven by their twisted sense of turf wars to mark their territory. Add to 
that their near-certainty they won't pay a penalty for getting caught, and the 
rest of us are pretty much at their mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 A city attorney in Orange County told me that most youngsters brought up on 
graffiti violations today probably get probation. That sounds to me like they 
get one free crime. I'll give them a free crime if it's shoplifting bubble gum 
from a candy store. But defacing entire buildings or highway signs? Sorry, 
Charlie; bend over. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we must inject some punishment into the equation. Vandals shouldn't be 
taking up jail space. This isn't a crime that deserves incarceration; however, 
because defacing property is particularly obnoxious and arrogant, we should 
fashion a punishment designed to cut the perpetrators down to size. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely where a public spanking fits in. Graffiti, more than most, is a 
crime against all of us, because we're all forced to see the results of it. 
Just as the sunset soothes us, junk graffiti riles us. This is not a victimless 
crime. We're all victims, and we should all have the chance to smirk at the 
little twerp who uglied up our town. 
</P>
<P>
 The public - humiliation aspect is critical. The psyche of the vandals is that 
they're putting something over on the rest of us. A few quick pfft-pfft-pffts 
from the paint can and they've defaced another bridge abutment. The cruelest 
punishment for someone like that is to be embarrassed in public. What better 
way to embarrass them than to de-pant them and redden their cheeks with a few 
whacks? They like color; we'll give them some color. 
</P>
<P>
 Public paddling may not stop graffiti wars, but it would sure make the rest of 
us feel better when we did catch one of them. It would send a loud signal that 
the public isn't helpless and that, every so often, we'll get the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the much-needed amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 If paddling is such a good idea, Mr. Conroy -- and it is -- why limit it to 
juvenile graffiti sprayers? If your goal is to punish, to deter and to 
embarrass wrongdoers, why not do it to adults too? 
</P>
<P>
 If a spanking would deter a 14-year-old, imagine what it might have done to 
some of your colleagues in the Legislature who have moved on to houses of 
detention for various affronts against the public? 
</P>
<P>
 Off the top of my head, I can think of a few people in Orange County who have 
ripped off citizens in ways that spray-painters couldn't dream of. Yes, the 
violators have gone off to prison, but why not a few sturdy lashes in the town 
square before they hit the road to Lompoc? 
</P>
<P>
 Believe me, Mr. Conroy, the public would love my amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, proceed with the paddling proposal, but don't limit yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we're sick and tired of graffiti masters. But we're sick and tired of 
lots of other people, too.

SCOTT HARRIS: MORE NOTES FROM THE CLAS STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Got a call from Debbie Greenfield the other day. She wanted to thank me for 
"not making us look like idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 She said this with a friendly laugh. I appreciated the call, for although I 
don't agree with everything Debbie has to say, I didn't mean to portray her as, 
well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Greenfield is a West Hills parent who sued the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, alleging that the California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) 
test is an invasion of privacy. My idea was to let Debbie state her case and 
let the chips fall where they may. "A Sneak Attack on the American Family," the 
headline that appeared over my column Thursday, summarizes Debbie's opinion 
about the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not my opinion, though. I am more inclined to believe Superior Court 
Judge Ronald H. O'Brien, who rejected the claim that CLAS violates state 
privacy laws. When it comes to CLAS, fears of Big Brother don't bother me as 
much as the state's insistence that the test contents be confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming to his opinion, Judge O'Brien has an advantage over both Debbie 
Greenfield and myself. He's read the test. The rest of us haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Confidentiality -- "secrecy," the critics say -- is the great sticking point 
in the CLAS struggle. People fear the unknown; it's only natural. 
Confidentiality has served to benefit CLAS critics, fostering distrust, fear -- 
even hysteria. Opponents have all but portrayed CLAS as a mysterious ticking 
package that, upon its opening, releases a kind of nerve gas that will cause 
children to rebel against their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how Judge O'Brien framed the dilemma: "The very nature of a 'test' 
requires that they be kept confidential, at least before it is given to the 
students. Otherwise the test would lose its purpose. On the other hand, if the 
test is kept confidential, parents of students have no way, short of a lawsuit, 
to . . . insure that no question asks the prohibited subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Judge O'Brien doesn't help much in explaining the need for 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, when parents had more faith in the schools, the need for 
confidentiality would be easy for the public to grasp. In these faithless days, 
the quick rationale offers little satisfaction. Worse, it inspires resentment. 
The implication is that the schools are afraid that parents who preview the 
test will coach and drill their children -- that, in effect, cheating will 
result. If you won't trust me that much, parents say, why should I trust you? 
</P>
<P>
 Trust is a two-way street. Educators have to do a better job of explaining the 
need for keeping the test questions out of public view. For two days I asked a 
series of state Department of Education officials to explain the need for 
confidentiality. To them the reason is so obvious they seem puzzled to receive 
an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the tests are confidential! Tests are always confidential!" 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, I say. If I walked into a teacher's classroom and saw the next day's 
test on the desk, would the teacher freak out? If a parent saw a geography 
quiz, is that such a big deal? 
</P>
<P>
 "The SATs are confidential! If the SATs weren't confidential, they'd be 
useless!" 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. But CLAS isn't the SAT, is it? We're not talking about a test 
that may decide whether junior goes to Princeton or Cal State Northridge. Or 
are we?  
</P>
<P>
 "But the business leaders and the governor endorsed CLAS! It had broad support 
until all this happened! The parents are being exploited by right-wingers who 
want to undermine public education!" 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want analogies or endorsements or tit-for-tat attacks on opponents. 
Nor do I want reminders of how politicians who backed CLAS are now cutting and 
running. All I want is someone to walk me through a detailed, point-by-point 
explanation of why, say, a copy of the CLAS test can't be kept in each 
principal's office for parents to review. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Susie Lange, a Department of Education spokeswoman, was able to help. 
The key in understanding CLAS, she explained, is in understanding its aim -- to 
analyze the ability of students to think and reason, not merely to memorize. 
The idea is to assess education reforms that have emphasized more reading and 
writing. CLAS shuns multiple-choice questions in favor of "open-ended" 
questions that require students to think for themselves -- to come up with 
their own answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidentiality ensures that test accomplishes its aim. It ensures that the 
students are giving a spontaneous answer, rather than parroting something a 
teacher or parent has told them. It ensures that teachers and parents alike 
won't "teach to the test." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism is frustrating. "We went through 40 years of the CAP test where 
nobody ever asked to see the stupid thing," Lange muttered. ". . . We're not 
trying to get kids to know how to memorize. We're trying to get kids to think 
on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There may be no convincing Debbie Greenfield, but educators are hoping that 
CLAS will have the chance to prove itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Lange says, officials are wrestling with the question of how much 
more needs to be revealed to reassure parents that CLAS is no bogyman. The 
problem, Lange says, is that the state simply doesn't have enough money to 
reveal the whole test after the fact. To do so would require the creation of 
new test questions -- an expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Debbie Greenfield tells me that parents tell her they're 
having their kids take the test, if only to find out what the questions are. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, they aren't yet convinced that CLAS is a threat to the American 
family.

KUDOS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some nonprofit organizations, a potential fivefold increase in clients and 
a one-third decrease in funding would be daunting. Fortunately, that is not the 
attitude of Clara J. Stroup and the Assn. to Aid Victims of Domestic 
Violence.Which is important, given that Stroup's group is the only one of its 
kind in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This organization has dealt with a quintupling of reports of battered spouses 
in the last three years, and is coming off a year in which its budget shrank 
from $150,000 to $100,000. Its excellent work made it one of the 10 local 
nonprofit groups that received $5,000 contributions from The Times this past 
week. But that amount of money will hardly suffice, and Stroup's group is in 
need of considerable help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita agency provides a 24-hour hot line, emergency intervention 
and transportation and safe housing. Part of the increase in her group's 
clientele, Stroup says, is a greater awareness among women of options for help. 
Changes in state law have also increased the number of abusers referred to the 
agency for such services as counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence in our region is a monumental problem, accounting for some 
40% of all calls for police service. The Los Angeles Police Department, for 
example, reports that there were 42,700 such cases last year that resulted in 
arrests or paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands on Stroup's group won't abate soon. It deserves the Santa Clarita 
Valley community's thanks for saving battered spouses, and for persuading 
abusers to avoid violence.

ANOTHER VITAL FREEWAY RESTORED; HERE'S HOPING THE METROLINK UPGRADES WILL KEEP 
MORE AUTOS OFF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake that last January severed two 80-foot high bridges on the 
Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon created more than a commuter nightmare. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Frederico Pena said that it also damaged the 
"commercial backbone of the state's economy," along which agricultural and 
manufactured products are moved between the California heartland and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope and Santa Clarita valley commuters, however, could be forgiven for 
not looking at so large a picture. For them, an already arduous drive turned 
into a nightmare. The story of one such person, who wound up spending eight 
hours, round-trip, behind the wheel gained international attention. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with considerable pleasure that we note the work of those who helped 
rebuild the bridges a month ahead of schedule. It will mean an anticipated 
reopening of the southbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway by as early as 
Wednesday, and the hoped for reopening of the north-bound lanes a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly early finish to the repair work does not quite rival the 
significance of the rapid completion of work on the Santa Monica Freeway, the 
nation's most heavily traveled, but it comes close. The contractor, E.L. Yeager 
Construction Co. of Riverside, has earned its bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, however, we must also note matters of related importance, 
and express a caveat of concern for those who are most anxious to return to 
their old commuting routine. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, Southern Californians must do their share to support a more 
diverse transportation system that is not so vulnerable to disaster and not so 
damaging environmentally. 
</P>
<P>
 We refer to those who were forced into the mass transit options provided by 
expanded Metrolink commuter train service. Many have gone back to their cars at 
a time when they still should be leaving the driving to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials are doing their share to keep current riders and woo new 
ones by making track improvements that will allow the trains to shorten travel 
times by midsummer. That will trim a nearly 2 1/2-hour ride from the Antelope 
Valley to Los Angeles to just one hour and 48 minutes. Such progress is every 
bit as important as bringing the freeways back to life.

DISTRICT 936'S RAPE EPIDEMIC IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM; SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THE 
ONE CRIME IN WHICH VALLEY RIVALS REST OF THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, you've certainly heard a lot about the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Reporting District 936. This bleak area of the San Fernando Valley is bordered 
by Sherman Way to the south and by railroad tracks to the north. It is roughly 
centered between Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards and it was the scene of more 
rapes than any other part of Los Angeles in 1993. It has become a heinous 
feeding ground for rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of us might dismiss this news as something that affects someone else, 
particularly if our travels don't bring us near that area very often. And since 
the area is so rife with drugs and prostitution, we might easily conclude that 
District 936's rape epidemic isn't really our problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be wrong on both counts, even though most of that area's rape 
victims are prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the problem here is symptomatic of the Valley's most serious violent 
crime problem: rape. It is the one crime in which the Valley rivals the rest of 
the city. That section of Van Nuys is merely its most visible example. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there that don't like women, period, and use prostitutes 
as a real upfront, easy-to-identify example of their hatred," LAPD Detective 
Craig Rhudy says of District 936. And, as far as the Valley is concerned, who 
says it stops at that statistical boundary? The numbers clearly say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for an area in all of Los Angeles that is tied for second in reported 
rape? Look again in the Valley, this time at a district in nearby Panorama 
City. In fact, we worry that the prevalence of so-called easy target rape in 
such areas may be serving as a sort of magnet for sexual attacks against women 
throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's rape numbers are clearly out of line -- in a way that statistics 
on other crimes are not. In even the worst cases last year, none of the LAPD's 
Valley districts came close to the most dangerous parts of Los Angeles in terms 
of the other three types of serious violent crime: murder, aggravated assault 
and robbery. Take robbery, for instance. The worst Valley area for that crime 
was a section of North Hills, with 119. That was fewer than half of the number 
recorded in one part of the LAPD's South Bureau in 1993. In the same vein, the 
most violent section of the city, also in the Central Bureau, recorded more 
than twice as many murders as the worst spot for homicides in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rape was the one form of serious violent crime in which Valley neighborhoods 
had the awful distinction of being the city's worst areas. And the San Fernando 
Valley was just eight incidents away from recording more rapes than any other 
bureau in the city in 1993. There were 403 in the West Bureau, 408 in Central, 
495 in the Valley, and 502 in South Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently we talked about the strains the LAPD faces each time it tries to send 
out an adequate patrol force. This effort is severely hampered by manpower and 
equipment shortages. But there is something else to consider here: geography. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start talking about the effects on patrol vehicles alone, for 
example, you see that it's a horrendous problem for us because we have so much 
ground to cover," said LAPD Cmdr. John Moran, the assistant commanding officer 
for operations in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In geographically dense New York City, for example, where there are nearly 90 
sworn officers per square mile, it is easier to assign more officers to foot 
patrols to thwart such crime. In Los Angeles, where there are less than 15 
sworn officers per square mile, such options are few. 
</P>
<P>
 We have also noted the distinction between sworn officers and the uniformed 
and traffic officers who are actually on patrol. There are just 1,047 of those 
patrol officers for the Valley's 2,812 street miles, divided into three shifts 
and further reduced by routine injuries, illness, vacations and court 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashioning a solution under such circumstances will require a strong community 
response. It will first, however, require a widespread recognition of the fact 
that the Valley's most serious violent crime problem appears to be that of 
rape, and that the problem extends far beyond that bleak section of Van Nuys 
where prostitutes are the most common victims.

HOSPITAL CLOSING WILL HURT MANY; THE PLAN TO CEASE INPATIENT ACTIVITIES AT THE 
VA MEDICAL CENTER IN SEPULVEDA WILL HARM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VETERANS WHO RELY 
ON THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE C. CAIRD, Lawrence C. Caird has been employed by the Veterans 
Administration since 1972, including seven years in the Western Regional Office 
of Public Affairs, serving as director from 1989 to 1992. He is now 
administrative officer for psychiatry for the VA Medical Center in Sepulveda. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By its treatment of veterans, America has always supported those who stepped 
forward to defeat our enemies and allow us to have a country. A disturbing 
reversal of this tradition is taking place in the decision by the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs to cease inpatient activities at the VA Medical 
Center in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing will harm tens of thousands of veterans who rely on the hospital. 
And up to 1,000 employees and salaries will be lost to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The VA has a history of closing Valley facilities. In 1948, it moved the 
Birmingham Hospital in Van Nuys to Long Beach. In 1971, it moved the San 
Fernando hospital to Loma Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Those actions, however, were justified by circumstances. In 1948, the Valley 
did not boast a population of more than 1 million. In 1971, the San Fernando 
facility had outlived its mission as a sanitorium for tuberculosis patients. 
</P>
<P>
 When VA Secretary Jesse Brown announced the Sepulveda closure March 14, he 
cited the cost of restoring or replacing the earthquake-damaged main medical 
building, estimated at $60 million to $119 million, and said there were 200 
empty beds at West Los Angeles, 16 miles from the Sepulveda facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced a plan to build a 126,000-square-foot outpatient facility at 
the Sepulveda site. And he promised every employee a job. 
</P>
<P>
 However, except for Building 3, the main medical building, the center's 24 
major structures are in fairly good shape. Three psychiatry wards and a 
chemical-dependency ward in Buildings 4 and 5 are relatively intact. Four wards 
survived in the secondary medical facility, Building 2. The ambulatory-care 
center in Building 10 and the outpatient mental health clinics in Building 25 
were operating the day after the quake. Most inpatient services could be 
restored for a fraction of the supposed cost.  
</P>

 T Imagine having to drive 16 miles south on Interstate 405 at rush hour in 
search of inpatient medical care. Picture the added tens of thousands of trips 
each year, which will worsen the congestion and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra distance will probably prevent many loved ones from visiting 
hospitalized veterans. And the veteran who falls ill after the outpatient 
closes for the day had better hope he can make it to West L.A., instead of 
being admitted to a non-VA hospital. Unless the condition is service-related 
(and most veterans' illnesses aren't), the VA won't help pay for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wrong to assume that the 200 empty beds at West L.A. will match 
Sepulveda's patients. The sub-specialties and other features do not necessarily 
line up. And logistical problems exist. One doctor in West L.A. told me that 
his hot, stuffy ward had one functioning toilet for 20 patients and no fire 
sprinklers. Sepulveda already is having difficulties transferring patients to 
West L.A. because it's short of space. So much for excess capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us felt a new outpatient clinic would be a nice addition to 
Sepulveda's existing outpatient facilities. We recently learned that the VA 
plans to destroy these facilities if they are not claimed by homeless advocates 
under the McKinney Act. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the guarantee of 1,000 jobs at Sepulveda, we hear that the number may be 
as low as 829, about half the pre-quake work force. The VA recently 
acknowledged a secret plan to reduce VA employment nationwide by 33,000. It was 
being formulated when the closure decision was made. To suggest the plan and 
the closing are unrelated is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In my 20-plus years with the VA, I have never seen such a lack of regard for 
those we are sworn to serve. I have read recently that the Clinton 
Administration employs the fewest veterans in memory in key jobs. It shows. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for employees, veterans and members of Congress to make the VA live 
up to its credo and put veterans first.

A 7-0 LEAD IS BLOWN BY ANGELS; BASEBALL: FAST START, FUELED BY SALMON'S HOME 
RUN IN THE SECOND, IS WASTED AS THE BULLPEN LETS THE MARINERS ESCAPE, 10-7. 
</P>

<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers picked at his postgame buffet, wondering how and 
why it could have all gone wrong late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Grahe sat alone in the trainer's room, an enormous ice pack wrapped around 
his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis sat at a table, feeling the ache of six stitches needed to close a 
wound below his left kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had just blown a seven-run lead in a 10-7 loss to the Seattle 
Mariners before 33,579 in the Kingdome. Even Tim Salmon couldn't save them from 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, poor relief pitching doomed the Angels. Grahe simply couldn't get 
the third out in the pivotal eighth inning, giving up a game-tying single by 
Jay Buhner and a three-run homer by Jerry Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Willard's first hit this season, a blast into the fifth row in the 
right-center-field stands. It was his third at-bat this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two outs and we can't get the last out," Rodgers said after the Mariners 
completed the biggest nine-inning comeback in club history. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina got to Buhner's grounder into the hole between shortstop and 
third base, but the ball kicked off his glove and into no-man's land. Rich 
Amaral raced home from second and the score was tied, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Manager Lou Piniella sent Willard to bat for Mike Blowers. Blowers had 
pinch-hit in the seventh for Reggie Jefferson, whose two-run homer in the third 
brought the Mariners to within 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard slammed a 2-and-2 changeup from Grahe into the seats, wrecking the 
Angels' night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was down," said Grahe (0-3). "Maybe he was sitting on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blame for this loss did not rest solely on Grahe's shoulders. But he wasn't 
shirking his role in Saturday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to hit the panic button," Grahe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll re-evaluate a few things, but there's nothing wrong with my stuff. 
It's just gut-check time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to have to be above letting it get to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe's shaky outing was one of many problems facing the Angels after 
Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable were the first-inning injury to Davis and another disappointing 
start from Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was spiked by catcher Dan Wilson during a home-plate collision during 
the Angels' five-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The catcher was trying to block the plate and he slid right into his spikes," 
Rodgers said. "It's not a good spot right there. That's where the knee bends." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if things would have been different had Davis not been injured, Rodgers 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know; he's the best hitter we have and he's out of the lineup after 
the first inning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Leiter, he could be headed to the bullpen after lasting only 2 2/3 
innings and giving up four runs and six hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting concerned about some people," Rodgers said. "Leiter's one of 
them. We'll see how things go. We could be talking about some things when we 
get home." 
</P>
<P>
 One option is putting Leiter in the bullpen and recalling John Farrell from 
triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' late-inning troubles overshadowed another home run by Salmon, who 
extended his hitting streak against Seattle to eight games, dating to last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Angels leading, 5-0, in the second inning, Salmon slammed a 2-and-1 
pitch from starter Greg Hibbard over the right-center-field fence for a two-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Salmon's 14th hit in his last 16 at-bats, his fourth homer and 12th RBI 
in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mariners kept crawling back, finally landing a haymaker on Grahe in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, a win (today) will help team-wise," said Grahe, who has given up 
six earned runs in his last two innings. "But I can't feel good about myself 
after this trip, though."

DIGEST: AFTER RECONSTRUCTIVE ELBOW SURGERY, KEMPTON GETS MEDICAL REDSHIRT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge right-hander Keven Kempton has been granted a medical 
redshirt year and might give his senior season another shot in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, who was 10-4 with an earned-run average of 3.99 as a junior in 1993, 
was sidelined with an elbow injury after only four games this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling to an 0-3 start with an ERA of 7.71, Kempton had major 
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow. He was expected to lead the Matador 
pitching staff, which has been decimated by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the surgery, however, doesn't guarantee that Kempton will be 
ready in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, 24, is expected to take at least 12 months to recover.

 Agoura High outfielder Kevin Sass will play at Fresno State next season as an 
invited walk-on, his mother, Ursula, said Saturday.

 Sass, who played shortstop as a junior, finished the season with five home 
runs, a .354 average, 23 RBIs and seven stolen bases. Basketball

 Ryle Lynch-Cole, who compiled a 160-69 record as coach of the Channel Islands 
High girls' basketball team from 1985-1993, has been named the head coach of 
the girls' team at Oxnard.

 Lynch-Cole, who is not an Oxnard faculty member, guided Channel Islands to 
three Marmonte League titles, but did not coach last season.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE: PHILLIPS STILL FOCUSED DESPITE SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eye is not the window to the soul, at least not in the case of Canyon High 
senior volleyball player Brentt Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Phillips covered his left eye with his hand while rubbing it and 
realized that vision out of the other eye was blurry and clouded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknowingly, he had suffered a detached retina that summer because of a 
genetic condition known as Stickler Syndrome, which afflicted his mother and 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition went undiagnosed for four months, after which Phillips' life 
abounded with questions and fears.  
</P>
<P>
 He worried that he might not be able to see anymore -- and that he might never 
again play the sport he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think I'd be playing volleyball anymore, and I kind of gave 
up on everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phillips' inner strength and resolve have been strong and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent corrective surgery in November, one day after his 18th birthday, 
but even after the surgery, Phillips' vision remained extremely limited.  
</P>
<P>
 Though he wears a powerful corrective contact lens, his right eye's vision is 
only 20/60, and he focuses on an object only after staring at it for a short 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first glance, I can't see anything," he said. "I can maybe see my hand in 
front of my face." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't deter him. After much thought, he decided he wanted to continue 
playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has. The 6-foot-4, All-Foothill League player learned to use his left 
eye, and has been the Cowboys' top hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Phillips continued his excellent play with a team-high 19 kills 
to lead Canyon (14-3) to a five-game upset of San Marino in the first round of 
the Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon will play La Serna in a second-round match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such success seemed unlikely in December when Phillips decided not to give up 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, known for his powerful spike, walked into a gym and tried to jump up 
and simply hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure it was going to get better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His vision didn't, but his ability to cope did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just learned how to compensate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With reduced peripheral vision and depth perception, he plays only at the net 
now instead of in the back row, his usual previous station.  
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Coach Ardyce Master said Phillips' approach to hitting has been 
altered. He usually goes up early and has to wait and find the ball while it is 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And because his right eye can't focus on objects quickly enough to be useful 
during athletics, he relies on his left eye to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that were ever to go on me, I don't know what I'd do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He checks his left eye for the telltale signs of retinal detachment every day, 
giving himself the straight-line test. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks at a vertical line, usually on his bedroom wallpaper. If the line 
were to appear wavy or be missing segments, that would signal retinal 
detachment. If caught in the first 24 hours, the damage is reversible. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, his left eye is fine, and Phillips said retinal detachment usually 
only occurs in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 His brothers, Rick (a Canyon assistant and former player) and Matt (a 
sophomore and member of the Cowboys' junior varsity), have been tested and 
their vision is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Phillips keeps plugging away, doing his best to keep an even keel, not 
letting his bad eyesight affect his overall vision of life and his goal to play 
college volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Though hardship seems to follow him around this year -- his paternal 
grandmother died suddenly May 5 of an aneurysm -- Phillips does his best to 
remain upbeat and philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a lot to deal with this season," Canyon Coach Ardyce Masters said. 
"He's handling it real well, and he seems to have matured quite a bit. I really 
admire and respect him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Phillips: "When I first found out (about my eye), I really pitied myself. 
And I still get frustrated because I don't feel like I can ever play my best. 
But I grew to learn that everybody has their setbacks. I just had to learn to 
deal with mine." 
</P>
<P>

 Heat vs. smoke -- When Palmdale and Quartz Hill met Tuesday, the pitching 
matchup featured perhaps the two best professional prospects in the area, 
Falcon left-hander David Glick and Rebel right-hander Roger Worley. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has been touted as a possible first-round selection, and Glick could be 
taken in the top two or three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley (5-3) is probably the hardest thrower in the area, and he said he was 
clocked between 90 and 93 miles per hour against Palmdale, the co-league 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My velocity has stayed up there," Worley said. "My coach has a pitch count on 
me (between 80 and 90) every game and he will not overpitch anyone the whole 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley finished the season with only two complete games in 12 appearances. 
Glick (9-2) has eight in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's contest, Glick pitched a seven-hitter in the 6-2 Falcon victory, 
while Worley was lifted in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glick's a real good pitcher, but I think his coach overpitches him," Worley 
said. "I could tell the difference between the first time I saw him (earlier in 
the season) and this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale and Glick have the postseason to look forward to, but Worley's high 
school career is over because Quartz Hill did not make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is still foremost in his mind, however, as he prepares for the June 2 
amateur draft. He planned to meet Saturday night with Arn Tellem, who is Bo 
Jackson's agent and the agent of last year's top area draftees, Hoover's Nate 
Dishington and Montclair Prep's Brad Fullmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real excited," Worley said. "This has been a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Clutch performance of the week: Channel Islands needed a victory over Royal on 
Wednesday to break a third-place Marmonte League baseball tie with the 
Highlanders and secure the league's last playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders faced Royal pitcher Maki Kramer, who limited them to two hits and 
one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure? You bet, but Channel Islands pitcher Rene Sanchez responded, 
throwing a one-hit shutout and striking out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Head shot: A strange turning point in Granada Hills' loss to University in the 
City Section 4-A Division final came in the tense first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders trailed, 12-11, but were playing well, when middle blocker 
Earnest Yun took a quick set from Victor Chang and spiked a rocket into the 
head of 5-foot-3 Warrior Min Yoo.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Yoo was playing in the back row 15 feet away, he didn't even have time 
to get his hands up. 
</P>
<P>
 Such hits are devastating, the volleyball equivalent of an in-your-face dunk 
in basketball, and several Granada Hills players turned their backs to the 
play, threw their hands in the air and immediately started celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ball hit Yoo so hard it bounced directly into the net and was kept 
alive by University and sent back over. The stunned Highlanders had to scramble 
back to their positions and eventually lost the point to go down, 13-11. Yoo's 
teammates picked him up and hugged him in appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two quick points later the game was over, and University had an insurmountable 
two-games-to-none lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could have won if that had been a kill," Yun said. "But we tried 
our best."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: A STATISTICAL FEAST TO TURN ON THE SPIT

 Are you a Rotisserie geek? 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase XTRA sports talk show host Jim Rome: If you have to ask yourself 
that, then you are.If you have absolutely no idea, assume that you are. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing popularity among sports fans of statistic-based fantasy leagues 
-- with Rotisserie baseball at the top of the list -- feeds the ever-growing 
hunger for statistical information, and nowhere are stats quite as interesting 
or meaningful as in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 And while numbers can't quantify the graceful arc of a sweet swing or the 
pleasing pop of a hard fastball, they do tell a story. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of the area's more eye-catching high school baseball 
statistics: 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about ratio! Crescenta Valley pitcher Jim Parque has 140 strikeouts and 
only 20 walks in 70 2/3 innings pitched. That's seven strikeouts per walk and 
1.98 strikeouts per inning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale pitcher David Glick has 114 strikeouts and 20 walks in 69 innings, 
an average of 1.65 strikeouts per inning and 5.7 per walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glick's teammate, Jerome Payton, has 31 stolen bases in 32 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Camino Real's Randy Wolf has finished all 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crespi pitcher John Cuccias appeared in 18 of the Celts' first 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Littlerock pitcher Robert Reed has given up 48 runs -- but only 19 are 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buckley's Mitch Brim is a one-man stat gang: Brim is batting .590, with 10 
doubles, seven triples and 41 runs batted in in 61 at-bats. He also has 28 
stolen bases. KENNEDY COSGROVE

JAMES FLANIGAN: LOOK WHO'S MAKING THE MOST OF A U.S. INVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does it matter if it's made in America? The question has been debated for 
years, and now it is being asked again following the Defense Department's 
recent announcement that it will spend $580 million in the next five years to 
support U.S. development of flat-panel display screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Flat-panel displays are the computer screens on electronic weapons, which are 
the wave of the future in warfare. They are also the screens on commercial 
computers and a key component of digital interactive television and personal 
communications devices -- the future offspring of the TV and telephone that are 
expected to become everyday products within this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon says it is spending the money because it will need flat-panel 
displays for weapons. But the $580 million is really an attempt to recover from 
costly myopia -- and to retain in the United States the ability to develop and 
produce the screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter irony is that these wonder products -- on which liquid crystals 
control light and millions of transistors retain and manipulate information -- 
were invented in America. They were neglected by shortsighted corporate 
executives but were taken up by companies in -- you guessed it -- Japan, which 
now dominate a $5-billion global industry that is destined to become a 
$15-billion industry in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That $5 billion is only the value of the screens," says David Mentley, head 
of display research for Stanford Resources, a San Jose consulting firm. "The 
displays are key components of systems worth five times that amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that displays are key products of the Information Age. And 
the story of why taxpayer money is being spent to retain them illustrates the 
complexity of world industry and what this country must do to provide 
opportunity for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The principles of liquid crystal displays were first discovered in the 1960s 
at Sarnoff Research Center, then part of RCA, and at a Westinghouse lab in 
Pittsburgh -- and in Switzerland, at Hoffmann-LaRoche, the drug firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But where Americans and Europeans didn't follow up with investment and 
development, Japanese companies did. Sharp, Seiko and Casio used liquid crystal 
displays in calculators and digital watches. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave them knowledge of the technology so that later, when personal 
computers developed needs for sophisticated graphics and color pictures, 
Japanese manufacturers could deliver increasingly capable screens. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. Like everything in electronics, prices of screens came down 
but cost of development rose. It costs more than $400 million to build a 
manufacturing plant for flat-panel displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Such numbers made big U.S. firms balk. IBM, AT&T, General Electric -- which 
acquired RCA in 1986 and jettisoned the Sarnoff Center -- cut R&D on displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Japan in the 1980s was still in its era of cheap money and industry 
poured billions into displays. The result is that Sharp, Seiko, Hitachi, 
Toshiba, Hoshiden and others have 95% of the world market; Korean and U.S. 
firms may have 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 But here the story takes a twist. Japanese companies are still investing in 
displays -- but finding it harder to do so in lean times. And Korean firms, 
Samsung and Goldstar, are preparing to increase production of complex screens. 
The upshot could be price competition on world markets and opportunities for 
U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the technology could be moving on. The type of display being made 
today, called thin-film transistor active matrix, is difficult and costly to 
produce. Some U.S. firms are working on simpler alternatives. Motorola is 
backing a venture called Motif that hopes to bring out a less expensive but 
high-quality display; SI Diamond, a Houston company, is working with help from 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory on a screen employing millions of microscopic TV 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Big companies -- Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in a venture with AT&T, IBM 
in a venture with Toshiba -- are getting back into displays. So "the wheel's 
still in spin," as Bob Dylan put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back in will be difficult. But it must be done, because the flat-panel 
display is emerging as a product combining hardware and software that will be 
key to future interactive, video computers -- key to the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans saw that coming. Company engineers told U.S. executives in the 
mid-'80s of the technological importance of displays. But the corporate brass 
decided that funding such product development would reduce current earnings. So 
they cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Such decisions were shortsighted in two ways. One, they relied on competitors 
for essential components. Now many U.S. firms lamely accuse Japanese companies 
of being slow to sell them the latest and best screens. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, they passed up opportunities for job-creating product 
development. By contrast, consider Sharp Corp., the world leader in displays. 
Its camcorder product was doing poorly. So Sharp reached into its display 
know-how and came up with a viewfinder for its camcorder. The product took off, 
and now Sony and other competitors are adding viewfinders as well. When you've 
invested in the know-how, you make your own opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet sometimes lessons are learned. Pentagon support for flat panels will have 
a larger dimension if it marks a turning point for funding research, says Paul 
Saffo of the institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. As research budgets 
have declined in government and business, we have been living off technologies 
paid for in past defense budgets and the space program -- such as lasers and 
microprocessors, the foundation of U.S. leadership in information industry.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, there has been government rhetoric but no money for the information 
highway. That contrasts sharply with the decision 40 years ago to float bonds 
and levy a tax on gasoline to build the interstate highway system -- origin of 
the information highway metaphor. Then, we sacrificed present gratification to 
provide for future generations.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe with flat-panel displays we are saying again that we must mount 
collective efforts to see that technology is made in America -- that, yes, it 
matters a great deal.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN; CABLE AND TELEPHONE COMPANIES RESUME INFO HIGHWAY RIVALRY 
</P>

<P>
 The feud has resumed between the nation's cable TV operators and regional 
telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The industries -- the Hatfields and McCoys of the telecommunications world -- 
briefly laid down their arms last fall in the interest of building the 
information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic Corp. led the way, agreeing to pay $33 billion for 
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable firm. Then Bell Canada 
struck a deal to buy into Jones Intercable Inc., and Southwestern Bell Corp. 
proposed a $4.9-billion venture with Cox Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street cheered the new alliances, which promised to fuse the cable 
industry's entrepreneurial spirit with the financial resources and experience 
of the phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truce was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 In late February, cable stocks plummeted, reflecting anticipation that the 
firms' cash flow would dip after the Federal Communications Commission decided 
to cut cable rates for the second time in six months. Bell Atlantic and TCI 
scrapped their deal, blaming a clash in corporate cultures as well as the FCC. 
Southwestern walked away from Cox and Jones reopened its talks with Bell 
Canada. Only Time Warner Inc. -- which had sold a 25.5% stake in its 
entertainment unit to U.S. West Inc. in 1993 -- emerged with a telephone 
company's money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, cable TV operators and regional telephone companies find 
themselves squared off again in the costly race to build high-capacity systems 
to the home. Experts estimate that the two industries could spend $80 billion 
to $180 billion over the next decade constructing networks that will enable 
them to compete in each other's traditional businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such staggering costs, it is likely that the two industries may 
once more look for ways to combine their efforts down the road. But for now, 
consumers and investors can only guess when the new services will reach their 
homes, and how much they'll cost. The outcome of the horse race can be 
handicapped by looking at publicly disclosed plans of the top cable operators 
and regional phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 On a market-by-market basis, the winner is expected to be the first company in 
the neighborhood to offer the broadest service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who gets there second is at a disadvantage because the penetration 
rates go down," says Geoffrey W. Holmes, the Time Warner senior vice president 
overseeing the company's ambitious Full Service Network under construction in 
Orlando, Fla. "From our perspective, you've got to build now." 
</P>
<P>
 The feisty cable business claims an inherent advantage, because it has already 
completed the most labor-intensive part of its installation: stretching coaxial 
cable to each subscriber's home. Although cable operators may spend $1,000 per 
home to upgrade their networks with fiber and two-way technology, telephone 
companies will have to spend hundreds of dollars more per home to replace 
copper wires with coaxial cable or upgrade their networks with compression 
technology that allows video signals to go over existing phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do it faster," Holmes says, "and we can do it cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But the phone companies are in a strong position to take on cable. They see 
their rivals as vulnerable in financing, technology and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not completely satisfied with cable providers," says Jay Bennett, 
director of broad-band infrastructure policy at Pacific Telesis, comparing 
cable's poor public reputation to the highly reliable telephone companies'. 
</P>
<P>
 In the financial arena, the phone companies tower over the cable operators. 
Collectively, the seven regional Baby Bells will spend $17 billion on capital 
expenditures this year, compared to the $2.3 billion budgeted by 10 leading 
cable companies. Only two cable companies -- TCI and Time Warner -- have the 
resources to spend $500 million or more in a single year for construction of 
their networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller cable operators recognize their vulnerability at a time when cash flow 
is depressed and banks are unlikely to lend more money. The telephone companies 
are "just going to swoop into our markets," moans one beleaguered cable 
executive who asked not to be named. Highly leveraged companies "could be 
bludgeoned in just six to nine months," he says -- a message that could 
persuade some cable operators to sell out rather than fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies "could pick up a slew of the smaller guys," he concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cable companies are dead meat and they know it," says Bill Davidson, a 
USC professor who has consulted for the Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 For cable operators, salvation lies in tapping the lucrative $90-billion 
telephone market and providing pay-per-view and other services that fall 
outside FCC price controls. Some are wagering that within eight years, 
telephone service could account for 50% of cable operators' revenue, with 25% 
coming from unregulated services. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone companies, meanwhile, want to protect their core business by 
using new technology to slash operating costs. And they want to barrel into the 
$21-billion cable TV business. 
</P>
<P>
 Both industries, of course, expect to profit from the emerging information and 
retailing services made possible by high-speed, two-way networks. They intend 
to vie for the $11-billion video rental business, take pieces of the $7-billion 
video game industry and grab a chunk of the $50-billion to $70-billion 
catalogue sales business. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the phone companies are on the march. In a series of filings with the 
FCC, they have asked for approval to install equipment over a three-year period 
that will give them the capability to offer interactive TV services to about 5 
million customers in 20 metropolitan areas -- including Los Angeles, Orange 
County and San Diego -- at an estimated cost of $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But how fast -- and indeed, whether -- the phone companies go through with 
these plans depends on a host of technological, economic and political factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The rollout will depend on the reception given to prototype systems, such as 
Time Warner's Full Service Network in Orlando; Viacom's test in Castro Valley, 
Calif., and a U.S. West experiment under way in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to make huge, multibillion-dollar investments too far 
ahead of the market," says Richard Holzopfel, a Bell South strategist, who 
suggested consumer demand for interactive TV may be years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such reservations, the phone companies have little choice but to 
upgrade their systems and begin offering new services. "If they just sit still, 
they will be sitting ducks," says Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's 
Institute for Tele-Information. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is weighing three bills intended to foster cable and phone company 
competition. In the House, one measure would allow the Baby Bells to compete 
with long distance companies; another would permit competition between cable TV 
and telephone companies. A Senate bill would allow Baby Bells into cable TV but 
deny them entry to the long-distance business until they passed a "threshold" 
of substantial local competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage has looked uncertain in the face of Baby Bell opposition. U.S. West 
Chairman Richard McCormick, for one, vowed early this month that his company 
would "stop building the information highway within our service territory" if 
the Senate bill passed unchanged. But Vice President Al Gore -- a leading 
proponent of the infobahn -- is working behind the scenes, urging the Bells and 
long-distance companies to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, cable and telephone companies are skirmishing in court and 
regulatory agencies. Bell Atlantic, for example, won a federal judge's 
permission last year to enter the cable business, and other phone companies are 
trying for similar rulings in their own regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cable industry has retaliated with a spate of petitions asking 
regulators to impose tough rules to assure that the Baby Bells don't finance 
their cable TV onslaught with income from telephone customers. Last week, for 
example, the California Cable Television Assn. asked the FCC to closely 
scrutinize Pacific Bell's application to offer video services in parts of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 And cable operators are pushing ahead in the phone business. Teleport 
Communications Group -- owned by four cable firms -- on Friday asked the 
California Public Utilities Commission for permission to compete with local 
phone companies in offering access to computer-based information resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Both industries have found state regulators receptive to their construction of 
superhighway prototypes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Omaha, U.S. West will soon begin a market test in an area with 60,000 
residents. It expects to attract only about 9,000 subscribers initially, though 
the service will offer standard cable as well as interactive shopping and 
movies-on-demand. Its set-top boxes will double as game machines by using 
technology from Silicon Valley game maker 3DO Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orlando, Time Warner says it will offer its Full Service Network to 4,000 
homes by year's end. FSN, as it's called, will allow subscribers to use 
hand-held remote-control devices to call up movies on demand or order stamps 
from the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 But such high-tech wizardry will not come without a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner predicts it will cost $250 per subscriber to upgrade the lines 
that carry its cable systems into homes. The company then will install 
expensive computer systems and switching devices in its facilities, as well as 
powerful set-top boxes and Hewlett-Packard printers in every home. Once 
perfected, the package is expected cost an additional $750 per household.  
</P>
<P>
 To recoup that investment in four years, the company says, it will need an 
additional $14 per month in cash flow per subscriber, to be obtained from 
customers using new services and the retailers providing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Orlando experiment begins, Time Warner staunchly vows to 
upgrade 85% of its service nationwide by the end of 1998 to be "FSN-capable," 
at an estimated cost of $5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 This month, Time Warner said it would cut its capital spending budget by $100 
million -- to an estimated $650 million -- by imposing a hiring freeze and 
reducing maintenance. But the company is not delaying construction of FSN. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say Time Warner is wise to move quickly, because its cable 
systems are clustered in large population areas such as New York, Houston, San 
Diego and Tampa, Fla., that are likely to attract competition first from 
telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver-based TCI has far more subscribers, but they are scattered across the 
country in smaller systems and may escape the first wave of stiff phone 
competition. So TCI may feel more comfortable with its threat to suspend $500 
million of its $1-billion allocation for capital expenditures this year in the 
wake of the rate rollback.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Falcon Cable Systems Co. -- the 12th-largest cable company 
-- said it will slash its capital budget to as little as $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
 All told, the cable industry's cash flow could plunge to $7 billion or $8 
billion this year, down from $10 billion in 1993, according to Paul Kagan 
Associates, a cable TV research firm. Based on what cable companies can usually 
borrow from banks or raise in public debt markets, the cable industry could be 
out $12 billion in capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some investors remain doggedly committed to cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Crawford, senior vice president of Los Angeles-based Capital Research 
Group, says, "The potential of capturing 20% of the $90-billion telephone 
business more than offsets the possible loss of some of its video business to 
the telephone companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Jessica Reif recently declared that 
investors had overreacted in selling cable stocks. "Time Warner will still be 
spending double what they did in 1993," she said. Reif remains hopeful that TCI 
will spend the $1 billion it initially allocated for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 So the construction continues. At a minimum, both the cable and telephone 
industries say they are determined to benefit by slashing the costs of their 
traditional businesses with fiber-optic upgrades.- 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not counting on an instant shift to a video revolutionary age," says 
Steve Harris, vice president for external affairs at Pacific Bell. "The real 
driver is building a more efficient telephony network." When the new lines are 
laid, the phone company won't have to send out a technician to add a second 
phone line or start service. Pacific Bell says 60% to 70% of the return on its 
$1,000 investment per household will come in the form of lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are staggering costs projected into the next century if phone 
companies and cable operators build competing networks in a market-by-market 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically, one wire would be cheaper, and we would get it done faster and 
save billions of dollars," Harris says. "But public policy is pushing for two 
wires." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics insist that the head-to-head battle is unlikely to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game of liar's poker," says Ron Altman, an analyst at Furman Selz, a 
New York brokerage. "Telephone and cable companies will compete in multimedia 
programming, but they will call a truce in their core businesses." Building the 
Superhighway 
</P>
<P>
 Pending Federal Communications Commission approval, five of the regional Bell 
telephone companies plan to rewire portions of their territories with upgraded 
networks able to carry the video, audio and data streams dubbed "the 
information superhighway." Company: Ameritech Service areas: Chicago; Detroit; 
Indianapolis; Milwaukee; Troy, Mich.; Cleveland Approximate completion date: 
1996 Planned investment (billions): $2.4 Households potentially served: 1.26 
million

<P>
 Cable television companies are also pouring money into upgrading systems, 
though it is harder to segregate their superhighway expenditures from general 
capital spending. Chart shows projected capital expenditures for some major

BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN; CONSUMER MOOD SWINGS WITH POLITICAL PENDULUM, 
POLLS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, JOHN BRENNAN is director of The Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer spending, say the experts, drives much of the nation's economy. So 
it's not surprising that economists, journalists and politicians hang on those 
periodic measures of consumer sentiment handed down from a number of sources. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing magical about consumer confidence scores. They're taken from 
public opinion surveys that regularly ask Americans about the economy and 
measure changes from poll to poll. Like the economic index periodically 
published by The Times, most polls ask about personal finances. They try to 
gauge the general business climate and the public's expectations, as well as 
feelings about current conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 What motivates changes in confidence is still somewhat of a mystery, however. 
Over the years, surveys have done pretty well at predicting recessions and 
recoveries, but the psychology they track doesn't always conform to "hard" 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, for example, the 1982 downturn was worse than the one in 1980, but 
the average American seemed to feel otherwise. The experts -- and President 
George Bush -- declared the 1990 recession to be over in mid-1991. The public 
begged to differ, and its persistent gloom helped deliver the White House to 
Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton's election, confidence jumped. It soured somewhat in mid-1993 but 
lately has been on the rise. Many surveys, including those by The Times, are 
now showing a mood more sanguine than that of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One would expect to see some aspect of the economy -- interest rates, 
unemployment or disposable income, for example -- as the basis for these 
changes, but a comparison of Times economic polls over the last few years shows 
another, more surprising factor in the recent mood swing: politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, the post-election rise in optimism seemed to have been tied to 
political party loyalties as much as to affairs of the pocketbook. Irrespective 
of income or financial status, Democrats were gloomier when George Bush was in 
office; they feel much better now. Today it's the Republicans' turn to have the 
furrowed brows, for all their relative affluence and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The partisan character of consumer confidence is quite pronounced. In July, 
1992, a Times Poll found that 49% of Democrats but only 30% of Republicans felt 
the nation was in a serious recession. Asked if the economy would be better or 
worse in three months, the Democrats said "worse" over "better" by 26% to 13%. 
The result among Republicans in the survey: 31% saw improvement; just 12% 
expected to see rougher times. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in that poll reported lower incomes and less secure finances than 
the Republicans, so one might expect that would explain the difference in their 
answers. Not so. In fact, high-income and lower-income people were equally 
likely to call the recession serious. Party identity, regardless of income, 
seemed to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months into Clinton's term, the pattern looks quite different from 
that of 1992. As of April, the proportion of Democrats who feel we are in a 
serious recession is down 38 points from two years ago, to 11% from 49%. The 
number has dropped for Republicans too, but by just 18 points, to 12% from 30%. 
And now when Americans are asked if the economy will improve or get worse in 
the upcoming quarter, 29% of Democrats are optimistic and 9% are pessimistic. 
Among GOP adherents, negative responses outnumber positive ones 20% to 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost equal shares of Democrats (52%) and Republicans (53%) now call this a 
good time to buy big-ticket items. Just before Clinton's inauguration, the 
Democratic number was 16 points lower than the Republican number on the same 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Democrats actually better off under Clinton while Republicans take it on 
their high-bracket chins? Stalwarts of both parties might make such claims. 
After all, 44% of Republicans think they paid higher federal taxes last year, 
compared to 25% of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans are no poorer than they were before Clinton and no less 
financially secure, either, according to the polls. Nor are Democrats more 
prosperous. Seven out of 10 Republicans say they have secure personal finances, 
compared to 57% of Democrats. These numbers are virtually identical to those 
measured during the Bush Administration two years ago, as are the household 
incomes reported. 
</P>
<P>
 With their man in office, Democrats simply seem to feel better about things 
economic, irrespective of their own financial lots. Whether that is stimulating 
real economic activity is hard to verify, because things such as retail sales 
and durable-goods orders aren't tagged by political party. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive aura among Democrats is definitely a part of the current rise in 
consumer sentiment. It remains to be seen if it can sustain itself should the 
challenges Bill Clinton's presidency faces begin to take a toll.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA OR JOBS IN CALIFORNIA? CLINTON'S MFN DECISION POSES A 
QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not many people were thinking economics on June 3, 1989, the day Chinese 
troops mounted their brutal assault on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in 
Tian An Men Square. But five years later, business and trade are the watchwords 
for the anniversary of an event that horrified the world. 
</P>
<P>
 China's economy is going gangbusters now, expanding 13% a year and emerging as 
a major engine for global trade. The Tian An Men blood bath is fading in 
memory, and persistent human rights abuses don't seem to rouse the public or 
spook the American business community anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, California companies are on the front lines of a nationwide movement 
urging President Clinton to put aside human rights concerns this June 3, which 
is, coincidentally, the deadline for his decision on whether to renew China's 
most-favored-nation status in trade. (MFN permits nearly all U.S. trading 
partners to export goods to the United States at preferential, low-tariff 
rates.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Clinton late last month, a group of more than 400 California 
companies calling itself the Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade warned 
that rescinding China's trade privileges would have a disastrous effect on the 
California economy. Assuming China would retaliate and impose punitive tariffs 
on U.S. goods if its MFN status were revoked, the coalition estimated that more 
than $1.7 billion worth of California exports to China, representing some 
35,000 jobs, would be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 A study released last week by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) estimated that 
revoking MFN would cost American consumers $10 billion a year and hurt U.S. 
companies competing for some $400 billion in public works projects and capital 
goods orders that China is expected to put to bid over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's aerospace industry is especially vulnerable, said Mark 
Schlansky, manager of commercial aircraft for McDonnell Douglas' Long Beach 
subsidiary, Douglas Aircraft, which manufactures and exports MD-80 aircraft 
kits for assembly in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look into our crystal ball and we see China. That's where the market is 
for us," Schlansky said. "And this is what President Clinton is talking about 
when he says he wants to protect high-skilled, high-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, under pressure from congressional critics of the Beijing regime, 
Clinton approved a one-year extension of the MFN status on the condition that 
China improve its human rights record. But a defiant Chinese government has 
continued to jail political dissenters, while denouncing U.S. interference in 
its domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking trade to respect for human rights has entangled the Administration in 
a diplomatic Gordian knot: Backing down would be an embarrassing display of 
weakness, while charging forward could endanger some $9 billion in annual U.S. 
exports to China -- and strain political ties in the face of an emerging 
nuclear menace from Chinese ally North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, the White House is considering compromise proposals 
intended to avert an all-out trade war.  
</P>
<P>
 One plan would involve selective sanctions against Chinese state-run 
enterprises; another would impose codes of conduct on U.S. companies operating 
in China, perhaps by executive order. The recently reinstated "Super 301" 
provision in U.S. trade law -- which allows the President to impose sanctions 
on specific commodities -- is yet another possibility for a limited approach to 
pressuring Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in the business community dismiss even these ideas, however. They say 
it is impossible to distinguish between state-owned and private enterprises in 
chaotic China economy and that a code of business conduct would be onerous 
because it would label companies "agents" of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Targeted sanctions would be as bad or worse than MFN withdrawal," said 
Richard Brecher, director of advisory services at the Washington-based 
U.S.-China Business Council. "Going beyond whether it could be practically 
implemented, it would still leave us in the same box and invite retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 State enterprises, Brecher noted -- not the private, export-oriented companies 
in China -- purchase the most American goods and services in the critical 
aerospace, telecommunications and power industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Administration has got to step down and admit that its policy has 
been wrongheaded," he said. "We can't keep hammering on (the Chinese), 
threatening trade retaliation, without following through." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many human rights advocates and some members of Congress still demand 
that MFN be revoked, other activists are beginning to shift their strategy -- 
perhaps sensing a loss of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dicker, associate counsel for the group Human Rights Watch/Asia, said 
one alternative -- short of withdrawing MFN -- would be to quietly persuade 
U.S. corporations to adopt a uniform code of conduct for China voluntarily, 
before one is mandated.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the group's code, which resembles one proposed by Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.), U.S. companies would certify that prison labor was not used by their 
Chinese suppliers. Companies would agree to bar political indoctrination from 
their premises, to protect employees from losing their jobs for political 
reasons and to "convey concerns about human rights violations" to Chinese 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the same for California businesses as for New York businesses: 
They're important players in Chinese economic transformation and development," 
Dicker said. "They're making real contributions, and they're well placed to 
influence the Chinese on raising human rights standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a code would have the potential to emulate the government-mandated 
"Sullivan Principles," which guided U.S. corporate engagement in South Africa 
during the apartheid years, Dicker said. But he acknowledged that the American 
public is far less concerned about Beijing's policies than it was about 
business ties to Pretoria's white regime, which sparked widespread campus 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Brecher, of the U.S.-China Business Council, recoils from the idea of a 
conduct code. "We're not part of the problem, we're part of the solution," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlansky, the McDonnell Douglas executive, said U.S. companies are already 
carrying out a human rights mission on the ground in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us are there already with our own principles of conduct, our own way 
of doing business," he said. "By letting us compete in the market, we're 
bringing a lot of change -- not necessarily revolutionary change, but certainly 
evolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
 In its April 26 letter to Clinton, the California business group said U.S. 
trade and investment provide "crucial support for the entrepreneurial forces in 
Chinese society that advocate further economic and political reform and pose a 
fundamental long-term challenge to the hard-liners" in Beijing.  
</P>
<P>
 "All of us deplore human rights abuses in China and elsewhere around the world 
but believe that revoking MFN would undermine important steps toward greater 
respect for human rights and political freedom for the Chinese people," said 
the letter, which was endorsed by firms such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel, 
Atlantic Richfield and Pacific Telesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all U.S. companies share this outlook. Levi Strauss pulled out of China in 
1992. Timberland, the Hampton, N.H.-based sports shoe maker, this year dropped 
Chinese suppliers out of distaste for the authoritarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with China seemed inconsistent with a broader sense of morality," 
said Jeffrey B. Swartz, Timberland's chief operating officer.  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the debate over China's MFN status may fade from the headlines not 
because the sticky human rights conflict is resolved, but because of a new 
interpretation of U.S. trade law. 
</P>
<P>
 China was accorded MFN status in a bilateral agreement, but only on the 
condition that the President each year waive the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 
Trade Act of 1974, which denies the trade privileges to countries with 
state-planned, non-market economies. Jackson-Vanik was a Cold War restriction 
meant for the Soviet Union and other communist nations, but it remains on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyson Bryan, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in international commerce, 
said the China problem could be resolved simply by redefining the Chinese 
economy as market-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a serious question as to whether China has already evolved 
out of a non-market economy," Bryan said. "If so, then Jackson-Vanik doesn't 
apply and China's MFN status shouldn't come up for review every year." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, revoking MFN in June would be a devastating blow to California's 
economic recovery, Brecher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "California, more than any other state," he said, "would be hard hit by the 
withdrawal of MFN."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: MARKET DROP SPARKS RUN ON ARBITRATION 
CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent stock market slide that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average 
down roughly 300 points is beginning to spur a number of securities arbitration 
cases in which investors claim that their brokers lied, cheated, stole or 
otherwise misled them into taking bigger risks than they otherwise would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Some securities arbitration firms say they have been deluged with phone 
inquiries. The National Assn. of Securities Dealers -- which handles roughly 
80% of all securities arbitration cases -- has also detected an uptick in the 
number of individuals requesting arbitration information packets.  
</P>
<P>
 Previous market slides have caused dramatic increases in the number of broker 
disputes brought to arbitration. The October, 1987, market crash, for example, 
helped boost NASD arbitration filings that year by 82%. The following year, 
arbitration cases rose another 38.2%. (Filings often lag a market correction by 
as long as nine months.) The number of cases received in 1989 and 1990 fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always see an increase in a down market, but it usually takes several 
months before a severe market drop will filter into lawyers' hands and 
arbitration filings," says Ted Eppenstein of Eppenstein & Eppenstein, a New 
York-based securities law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 New complaints are mainly falling into a handful of categories that appear to 
reflect securities industry trends, adds Michael Paule, president of Investors 
Arbitration Services in Woodland Hills. For example, woes from financial 
derivatives -- which have been blamed for rocky earnings reports at several 
companies and mutual funds -- have also hit individuals, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, an Eastern Airlines pilot hired IAS to represent him in a case 
against a Florida stockbroker who sold the pilot the interest-only piece of a 
collateralized mortgage obligation, Paule notes. The CMOs were supposed to meet 
the pilot's conservative investment objectives, but the security lost a 
substantial portion of its value when interest rates rose in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous investors call him after investing in bank-sold mutual funds, says 
IAS Chief Executive William Levine. Many of them say they were misled into 
believing they were buying the equivalent of a certificate of deposit when they 
invested in bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to note that broker wrongdoing -- the basis of a securities 
arbitration case -- does not increase when the market dives. People are just 
more likely to notice and object to it when they are losing money than when 
their accounts are profitable, says Deborah Masucci, vice president and 
director of arbitration at the NASD in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "People start taking greater risks as the market goes up, but they don't 
recognize the risks until the market comes down and they start to lose money," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts stress that a market loss does not necessarily translate into an 
arbitration case. Indeed, arbitration firms generally reject anywhere from 10 
to 50 cases for every case they take. 
</P>
<P>
 That's sometimes because the cases are too small for an attorney to litigate. 
Sometimes it's because the statute of limitations has expired. But often it is 
because there was no sign of illegal or improper activity, regardless of the 
loss, says Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably one out of every 12 or 15 people who come to us have a bona fide 
case, not a frivolous action," he says. "There are some people who suffer 
market losses because of risks they knew they were taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who lost money on "appropriate" investments and who were not misled 
about the risks have no cause to litigate unless the broker stole from them or 
participated in illegal or unauthorized trading, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who were misled or pushed into inappropriate investments -- and who 
have been unable to persuade the broker or brokerage firm to unwind the 
transaction -- should take their case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals win their arbitration hearings more than half the time, according 
to NASD statistics. And roughly 55% of the cases filed are settled out of 
court, often in the investor's favor, Masucci says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critical issue is to fight back," says Paul N. Young, chief executive of 
Securities Arbitration Group in Los Angeles. "If you don't fight back, you are 
guaranteed to lose twice." 
</P>
<P>
 When do you arbitrate? When you have a loss due to wrongdoing on the part of a 
broker or brokerage firm and the firm refuses to reimburse you. Broker wrongs 
generally fall into one of five categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Unsuitable recommendations. A broker urges you to buy an investment that 
doesn't suit your objectives, level of experience or is otherwise inappropriate 
for you. The nature of an inappropriate investment depends on who you are. 
Commodities would be inappropriate for an unsophisticated investor or for 
someone who couldn't handle a loss. However, it would be a suitable investment 
for a well-heeled speculator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unauthorized trading. The broker buys or sells securities without your 
permission and without authorization to trade in your account on a 
discretionary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Misrepresentation. The broker lies or purposefully misleads you about what 
the investment is, what it does, what the risks are or what it costs in 
commissions and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Omission. You're not told something pivotal about the investment, such as 
that the company you're investing in is in bankruptcy, or that while the 
investment appears to be a bank deposit, it is not FDIC-insured. 
</P>
<P>
 * Theft. The broker steals money from your account.

COLUMN ONE; CORRUPTING POWER OF LIFE ON THE STREETS; TONY BOGARD WAS HAILED FOR 
LEADING A GANG TRUCE, BUT HIS TRANSFORMATION FROM EX-CON TO HERO MAY HAVE BEEN 
A MYTH. HIS LEGACY IS CLOUDED BY WHETHER HE WAS MORE TROUBLEMAKER THAN 
PEACEMAKER.

<P>
 Tony Bogard was the King of Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was killed Jan. 13 in a shootout at the Watts housing project, the 
gangbanger-turned-peacemaker was mourned as a martyr akin to Malcolm X. 
Nationally renowned for championing the 1992 truce between Crips and Bloods, he 
had become a symbol of redemption in South-Central Los Angeles, luring 
celebrities and government dollars to a community that rarely reaps such 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bogard's heroic transformation was a myth -- and a cautionary tale about 
the corrupting pull of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he condemned the violence that he had wreaked for more than half his 
life, Bogard allegedly siphoned thousands of dollars from his gang's drug 
sales, dice games and robberies, authorities say. The FBI had been 
investigating him for months, and a federal prosecutor took the unusual step of 
attending his autopsy just to confirm that the star suspect had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether cruising in his '64 low-rider Impala or appearing on "The Oprah 
Winfrey Show," the 30-year-old ex-con preached the gospel of self-empowerment, 
urging economic development to ease the ills of riot-torn Los Angeles. Yet it 
was the treacherous economy of the underworld -- long the source of his 
livelihood -- that ultimately sank Bogard's dreams of tapping the American 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 As he made his rounds that windy night in Imperial Courts, Bogard confronted a 
fellow member of the PJ Watts Crips in a parking lot on 114th Street. When the 
shooting stopped, 25 casings lay scattered on the ground, along with Bogard, 
caught without his customary bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters say that Bogard was standing up to a dope dealer, demanding 
that he donate a share of his illicit profits to compensate for poisoning their 
community. Critics argue it was little more than a shakedown, a common practice 
whenever Bogard's homeboys failed to "pay tribute" with a cut of their spoils. 
The alleged assailant, awaiting trial for murder in Compton Superior Court, 
claims he fired in self-defense -- a contention supported by gunshot residue on 
Bogard's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony's a perfect example of the shades of gray -- the good and bad -- that's 
combined in a lot of guys struggling to make it out there," said former NFL 
star Jim Brown, founder of a recovery program for ex-gang members. "He was 
instrumental in the peace, that's true. But when it comes to the reality of 
survival, people go back to what they knew best. The 'hood always tries to 
reclaim you." 
</P>
<P>
 Peacemaker and warlord, defender and enforcer, victim and victimizer -- Bogard 
seemed to be continuously crossing that line. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be because he operated in a Darwinian world where the line frequently 
shifts, where the distinction between right and wrong is blurred by the battle 
to stay afloat. Or it may be because the source of his power -- the very thing 
that gave him the credibility to take control of the Watts truce -- always was 
rooted in his fearsome reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 To his benefactors, such as rapper Ice-T, former Laker star Byron Scott and 
county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Bogard's conversion was what made 
him such a commanding figure -- a spokesman for the regenerative potential of 
urban youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Others viewed Bogard as a fraud who embraced the truce only to camouflage his 
criminal schemes -- "a black Al Capone," charged the mother of one of his 
homeboys. But in Watts, a community hungry for role models, many residents 
still were willing to take a chance. To some, it mattered less that Bogard may 
have ruled by nefarious means than that he had the strength to rule at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that world, any male who can control his environment is seen as a hero," 
said Constance L. Rice, a top NAACP lawyer. "I'm not excusing behavior that 
hurts other people, but deprivation creates a very different context. It's not 
hard to understand why Tony had a hell of a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after Bloods and Crips emerged from the ashes with their red and 
blue bandannas tied in unity, the truce continues to hold in the Watts projects 
where it was born. Gang killings remain virtually nonexistent in the 
community's three largest housing developments, a remarkable accomplishment 
after two decades of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even after burying their rivalries, not all those gang members laid down 
their arms. Alienated and defiant, some redirected their energy into more 
profitable ventures, exchanging the risks of a drive-by for the financial 
rewards of a stickup. 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles struggles to heal after America's worst civil unrest this 
century, those who have been a part of the problem insist they must have a 
stake in the solution. Some believe the city's future depends on creating 
economic bonds to connect the interests of the law-abiding majority with those 
of the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard, packing a pistol as he called for peace, was a testament to the 
difficulty of bridging that gap. Badges of a Warrior 
</P>
<P>
 When coroner's officials examined Bogard's 5-foot-10, 167-pound frame, they 
found him riddled with six gunshot wounds -- in the chest, stomach, back, arm, 
knee and hand. All but one of the bullets -- a 9-millimeter slug lodged in the 
triceps of his right arm -- had pierced the flesh and disappeared out the other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Scar tissue and skin grafts covered his limbs, the result of a near-fatal 
attack four years earlier in which he was shot eight times with an AK-47 
assault rifle. The coroner also found evidence of several other shootings, 
recovering bullet fragments from Bogard's arm, leg and thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 His body was marked by at least a dozen tattoos, some in memory of fallen 
comrades and others of a hatted man smoking what looked to be Bogard's 
trademark vice, a joint. On the back of his neck was the designation "O/G," for 
Original Gangster, and below that "PJ Watts." 
</P>
<P>
 They were the badges of a warrior. "You just seen strength in him," said 
Rebecca Hammonds, 28, Bogard's girlfriend of 14 years. "It was like, damn, you 
just seen something different." 
</P>
<P>
 By most middle-class standards, Bogard would not have rated so favorable an 
impression. A 10th-grade dropout from Jordan High, he was functionally 
illiterate, often signing his name in awkward block letters. He had no job 
prospects. He never obtained a driver's license. His first arrest -- for grand 
theft auto -- came at 13. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually assembled a hefty rap sheet with nearly three dozen arrests, 
according to court records that show he was busted almost once a year beginning 
in the late 1970s. Bogard, whose legal name was Tyrone Tony Thomas, relied on 
more than a dozen aliases. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 16, he spent two years behind bars for armed robbery. When he was 
20, he did a year in jail for dealing PCP. When he was 26, he was convicted on 
drug charges after an informant told police he had seen several pounds of 
marijuana stashed at Bogard's house. The informant, court records show, also 
reported that gang rivals were plotting to kill Bogard, who was "loaded for 
bear" with a cache of more than a dozen AK-47s, MAC 10s and Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard was "a live wire" who had been "seriously shaped to a large degree by 
the lifestyle and activities of gangs," a Los Angeles County probation officer 
told the court a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the housing projects of Watts, as in most of the city's impoverished 
communities, such credentials can command respect as readily as they draw 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Justly or not, many of the young men who struggle for recognition in that 
world see a gang as their only avenue to power, even if it means terrorizing 
the neighborhood they purport to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a perspective that holds special allure in a place such as Imperial 
Courts, where Bogard spent his childhood before inheriting a house on 64th 
Street from his mother, who raised him and his six siblings on her own. 
According to the 1990 census, more than half of the project's households are 
headed by single women, 64% of adults never finished high school and the per 
capita income of $3,931 is less than one-fourth of the county average. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, you know, I mean, I seen my big homies selling dope or 
robbing somebody. I mean, it was, that was the thing to do," Bogard said on 
national TV last year. "I mean, if you wasn't strong or you wasn't doing 
something like that, you ain't going to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, 1990, as Bogard told it, his concept of survival changed. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stood in the doorway of his stucco bungalow, framed by a striped awning 
and a neatly trimmed cylindrical hedge, someone with a high-powered 
military-style rifle pumped him full of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to life-support machines, Bogard felt an unfamiliar tinge of 
repentance tug at his heart. For the first time, he later explained, he 
fathomed the terrible price of being a Crip, of ravaging a community he claimed 
to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made a deal with God: If he lived, he would do right by the people of 
Watts as surely as he had done them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of like a deathbed epiphany," said Barbara Cottman Becnel, a 
writer who is featuring Bogard in an upcoming history of the Crips and Bloods. 
"He didn't want to spend the rest of his life being hurt or hurting others." 
</P>
<P>
 But after nearly a dozen operations and skin grafts, followed by months of 
physical therapy, Bogard again crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 One May afternoon in 1991, he walked to the turf of the Grape Street Crips, 
which had been engaged in a long and bloody feud with the PJs. Taking aim at a 
rival's sister, he opened fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, barely missing her 
and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the witnesses were called to testify, three had disappeared and a 
fourth had changed her story. It may have had something to do with the nightly 
barrage of gunfire that had forced their families to sleep on the floor. "The 
victims' . . . reluctance and relocation suggest a high level of fear generated 
by this defendant," court documents alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to salvage their unraveling case, prosecutors agreed to make a 
deal, reducing four counts of attempted murder to one charge of assault with a 
deadly weapon. Instead of going to prison for the shooting, Bogard received a 
suspended sentence. He walked free in May, 1992 -- just in time to grab the 
truce's reins. Truce in the Projects 
</P>
<P>
 The truce, which was hammered out months earlier during a series of meetings 
at a Watts mosque, was formally declared on April 26, three days before Los 
Angeles erupted in fiery rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Bloods and Crips held rollicking, beer-soaked parties at the Watts 
projects -- Imperial Courts, Jordan Downs and Nickerson Gardens -- tearfully 
toasting an end to their savage rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the projects are sometimes troubled places, they were also fertile 
ground for the truce. The complexes, seemingly worlds unto themselves, offer a 
sense of history and cohesiveness rarely found in the sprawl of neighborhoods 
claimed by the county's 300 other Crip and Blood factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watts is showing all the other communities that we can get together, that 
we're all one," Bogard told The Times, sporting his trademark Georgetown cap 
and toting a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the oldest gangsters in the neighborhood, Bogard had the 
credibility, or "juice," to call the shots. He saw the truce not just as a 
party, but also as an opportunity to take a step closer to the resources of the 
legitimate world. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Fourth of July weekend that year, he unveiled an imaginative new 
venture -- Hands Across Watts, a nonprofit corporation designed to create 
lawful business deals for reformed Crips and Bloods. Its logo featured two 
clasped hands, one red and the other blue. Its board of directors included pro 
athletes, the Grammy-winning engineer of Natalie Cole's "Unforgettable" album 
and Bogard's defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tony just saw that a lot of things he had been involved in as a 
younger man weren't worth anything," said the lawyer, Stanley Granville. "He 
was somebody who really transcended his background." 
</P>
<P>
 Lean, with a shorn scalp and narrow mustache, Bogard was not physically 
imposing, still hobbled by a limp from the 1990 ambush. But he was forceful and 
charismatic, speaking in a raw, visceral voice that captured the attention of a 
national media focused on post-riot Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make the AK, we don't bring kilos of cocaine over here, we don't go 
for none of that," he said on "Oprah" last year. "They drop it off in our 
community for us to grab it like rats. And they see how we act and they make 
money off it till they lock us up." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the exposure seemed to be a substitute for the sense of identity 
that gangbanging had once provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ornate commendation, the County Board of Supervisors applauded Bogard 
for his "deep commitment to the community." The Wall Street Journal featured 
his entrepreneurial plans on its sober front page. A production manager for 
Castle Rock Entertainment had him over for dinner -- the first time Bogard had 
eaten at a white person's house. Last year, he was invited to a Pan-African 
conference in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met him, he thought he would be lucky to be 30," said Pat 
Mulligan, an international golf course designer, whom Bogard picked as the 
first Hands Across Watts executive director. "By last year, he thought he was 
going to make it to 40." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention translated into money for a community that was long ago 
abandoned by investment. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Hands Across Watts reports taking in about $125,000 in contributions, 
including $5,000 from Mayor Richard Riordan's private foundation and the 
proceeds from an Ice-T video filmed outside the Imperial Courts gym. Last fall, 
the group also received a $200,000 federal job-training grant, steered its way 
by Supervisor Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Bogard was able to dole out paychecks to 150 young adults for 
maintenance work in the projects. The rest of the money paid for community 
barbecues and dances, as well as a youth program that took hundreds of 
youngsters to Dodger games, Knott's Berry Farm and the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it all amounted to more legitimate funds than Bogard ever could have 
hoped to control, he was disappointed that the donations came to less than half 
of what had been budgeted. Many corporations that routinely give to charity 
seemed reluctant to invest in someone with such a recent criminal past. Bogard, 
who was to receive a $40,000 salary, had to settle for small stipends whenever 
there was available cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tried to convince him that if we could make as much money doing 
right as we did doing wrong, we'd be rich," said Hammonds, Bogard's girlfriend. 
Instead, she said, "we took a cut in pay. It was a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, however, others viewed Bogard as an opportunist, including 
some of his own homeboys. One of them, Dewayne (Sniper) Holmes, who was the 
first Imperial Courts gang member to reach out to the rival projects, recalls 
that Bogard spent months objecting to such overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tony I knew was out for himself," said Holmes, 26, who is serving a 
seven-year prison sentence for a robbery he insists he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in starched denims at a state prison near Bakersfield, Holmes 
described how an uneasy cease-fire in early 1992 evolved into a string of 
Sunday meetings -- only one of which, he said, Bogard attended. It was only 
after Holmes ended up in custody, a week after peace was announced, that he 
learned Bogard was suddenly taking credit for the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what led me to believe that maybe his motives were somewhat unpure," 
Holmes said. "He just took the opportunity to exploit this for his own gain . . 
. to get what he could out of it while it was on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mujahid Abdul-Karim, whose mosque, Masjid Al-Rasul, served as the neutral site 
for the negotiations, also was skeptical. On several occasions, Abdul-Karim 
confronted Bogard, urging him not to jeopardize their fragile accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say he just wanted to make money, that's all he was concerned 
about," said the minister, a quiet man who wears a simple white robe. "There 
wasn't anything spiritual; it was just material." 
</P>
<P>
 Other proponents of the truce, such as Daude Sherrills, a former rival from 
Jordan Downs, had no objections to making money. But Sherrills, who co-founded 
Hands Across Watts and says he coined the name, worried that Bogard was more 
interested in constructing his own empire than rebuilding their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after forming Hands Across Watts, Sherrills decided he 
could not work with Bogard and quit as president. Bogard took his spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying his best, but that brother was just conditioned from birth to 
think with negativity," Sherrills said. "Tony believed in controlling -- he 
wanted the power and the money. But (the truce) wasn't about us. It was about 
the development of our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, unfortunately, is no safer today than it was before the 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police concede that the cycle of gang killings appears to have 
halted, they say the Watts gangs continue to be just as criminally active, even 
if their mayhem is no longer based on traditional Crip and Blood rivalries. In 
1991, within the 1 1/2-square-mile area that houses the three projects, there 
were 2,152 serious crimes reported, including 18 murders, 293 robberies and 845 
assaults. Last year, there were 2,150 serious crimes, including 17 murders, 424 
robberies and 768 assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police are convinced that Bogard remained part of that crime wave. 
Neither they nor the FBI would disclose details of their investigations, but 
law enforcement sources say they have been investigating reports that Bogard 
was a gang kingpin, enriching himself by taxing the illegal rackets of his 
underlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, the truce is a good thing and, to the extent that Tony Bogard 
facilitated the truce, I put one in the plus column for Tony," said LAPD Lt. 
Dennis Shirey, commander of the South Bureau's anti-gang CRASH unit. "But I 
don't think the truce made Tony a new man. I don't think he woke up one day and 
said: 'I'm now on the side of law and order.' And I don't think that, in net, 
he had a positive effect on that community." The Final Shootout 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after Bogard was gunned down, he was hailed as a visionary in a 
world not ready to open its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping tears from behind their sunglasses, dozens of former gang rivals and 
community activists gathered at the Kedren Community Center in Watts, where 
they exchanged hugs and vowed to make Bogard's dream real. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most grief-stricken colleagues, 30-year-old Malik Spellman, said 
Bogard had been in Imperial Courts the previous night only because he needed to 
raise money for a Hands Across Watts phone bill. If the city's business and 
political Establishment had been more supportive of the group's efforts, he 
contended, Bogard would not have been forced to look for funds on the 
neighborhood's mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all guilty of a crime," Spellman charged, sobbing into a sea of TV 
cameras. "You all killed Tony. Not us." 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks after Bogard's death, the Rev. Carl Washington, a deputy to 
Supervisor Burke, acknowledged having heard rumors that Bogard was still 
trafficking in drugs. But Washington said he dismissed such talk as jealous 
backbiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Having known Bogard since his own childhood in Imperial Courts, Washington is 
convinced that the truce leader died trying to keep a pusher's profits from 
being sucked out of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked a lot about recycling black dollars," said Washington, who serves, 
with Burke, on the Hands Across Watts board. "It was like, if you're not 
putting any money back into the community, you can't work here, you can't deal 
here, you can't come around here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court last month, Bogard's method of 
soliciting contributions was described in less-than-neighborly terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, word had circulated that Bogard was irate with the 
defendant, Rodney Compton. Some said it was because Compton, 21, had failed to 
share his earnings from a major cocaine rip-off. Others said it was because the 
victims of the rip-off had taken their beef to Bogard, who felt Compton's scam 
had jeopardized the Imperial Courts gang. 
</P>
<P>
 When they finally met, according to Compton's testimony, Bogard demanded he 
hand over "$25,000 and some dope." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have it," Compton said he told Bogard. "I don't know what you talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard accused Compton of being a "mark" and a "buster," meaning he was weak 
and unwilling to defend the gang's interests. "He told me . . . I got to break 
bread with the projects," said Compton, who is being held on $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene worthy of an Old West gun duel, the men then squared off. Bogard, 
according to Compton, drew a large-caliber handgun and fired two rounds. 
Compton, wounded in the right arm, said he pulled out his pistol and took 12 
shots at Bogard. At least one other shooter, whom police have yet to identify, 
also opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Rodney Compton had not acted, he would be dead today," said his attorney, 
Edi M. O. Faal, whose defense work in the Reginald O. Denny beating trial 
earned him the accolades of many South-Central Los Angeles residents. "With due 
respect to Tony Bogard . . . his actions were inconsistent with the role of a 
peacemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Even prosecutors have conceded this probably is not a case of first-degree 
murder. What it boils down to, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott G. Carbaugh, "is 
who pulled the gun first, who was first or quickest on the draw." 
</P>
<P>
 That point may be difficult to prove. Homicide investigators have found only 
one witness -- and not a particularly reliable one -- who saw Compton kill 
Bogard. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else, not even the homeboys who rushed their dying chieftain to the 
hospital, has come forward. A Meager Kingdom 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was a sad and meager kingdom that Tony Bogard ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 He owned a two-bedroom 1920s-era house that contained only one concession to 
opulence, a giant color TV set by the living room window. But its four-foot 
screen was punctured by a gunshot, accidentally fired by a friend showing off 
his new Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard was buried in a humble, city-operated cemetery in San Bernardino, his 
body placed above that of his sister, Yvonne. She was killed last year at age 
33, when assailants fired through her kitchen window in what police believe was 
a drug-related attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A eulogy, etched into Bogard's headstone, asks his loved ones to remember the 
good times they shared and disregard those who would speak ill: 
</P>
<P>
 Let the rumors be  
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about what's said about me  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody had something to say about TB

SLIDE SCARE HAS LAGUNA WONDERING: WHAT NEXT?; DISASTER: AFTER FACING FIRE AND 
MUD, RESIDENTS HAVE NEW WORRIES ABOUT FALLING HOME VALUES, COST OF SHORING UP 
LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been just over a year since Colleen and Steve Dunn scraped together 
enough money to buy a fixer-upper on a quiet cul-de-sac in the Temple Hills 
neighborhood, finally realizing their dream of living in this scenic artists' 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has been anything but peaceful ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, an ember from the wildfire that devastated parts of this community 
landed in the back yard of the Dunns' Griffith Way home, bursting into flames 
and destroying their garden before firefighters extinguished it as it closed in 
on their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, a brief, pre-dawn rainstorm sent a torrent of water and mud 
from the newly scorched hillsides coursing through the Dunns' neighborhood, two 
doors from their home. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tuesday, the couple attended a City Council meeting at which they learned 
their house may sit atop a previously unknown ancient landslide, news that 
prompted the city to hire geologists to investigate the stability of the 65-lot 
area where the Dunns live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been disheartening," said Colleen Dunn, 35. "It's just been one 
thing after another ever since we moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Laguna may not have seen the last of the financial and 
practical problems posed by hidden, prehistoric landslides beneath their homes, 
according to experts and maps maintained by the city and the state Division of 
Mines and Geology. 
</P>
<P>
 Landslides, ancient and otherwise, exist throughout Laguna, as they do across 
much of Southern California, especially its coastal communities, said Martin 
Short, professor emeritus of geology at Cal State Los Angeles and a top local 
authority on ancient landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Short, who has dated several Orange County landslides at 15,000 to 20,000 
years old, said problems often occur because much of the construction in Laguna 
and other slide-prone communities occurred 30 or more years ago, before most 
cities required geological evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We create our own fate in a sense," he said. "If we don't have knowledge of 
the larger ancient slides and grade the land unknowingly, we can create a much 
worse situation where the slides are reactivated." 
</P>
<P>
 In almost every case where an ancient slide begins to slip again, Short and 
other experts said, the culprit is water -- often heavy rainfall, a broken 
water line or even over-watering of landscaping. The water reduces shear 
resistance along what geologists call the "slide plane," an area typically made 
up of a soft, very plastic clay, allowing the mass of the old slide to break 
off and shift downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas where development is minimal, geologists said they often can spot 
landslides from the surface. But the two slides now at issue in Laguna had 
escaped detection until recently, possibly because erosion and construction in 
the areas had masked their characteristic features: a bowl shape at the top, a 
gently sloping mid-section and a bulbous toe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're beginning to realize that these ancient landslides can be 
extremely subtle," said Allen Bell, president of Petra Geotechnical of Costa 
Mesa, who has surveyed properties in both new slide areas. "We're beginning to 
find out more about them and realizing that we need to do some deeper 
exploration in areas where we think they might exist." 
</P>
<P>
 While the experts said almost any landslide theoretically can be stabilized, 
the costs of shoring up a very deep slide may be prohibitive. Various methods 
include supporting the slide with buttresses, using caissons and tie-backs to 
try to pin it in place or strengthening it with chemical injections. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Dunn said she and her husband, a graphic artist, are worried that if 
the Temple Hills slide is confirmed and includes their property, they and other 
individual homeowners might be required to bear the entire cost of stabilizing 
their sections of the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have the money to do that," she said. "The things that concern 
us are the things that cost us." 
</P>
<P>
 Of even greater concern, she said, is whether the talk of landslides may drive 
down their property's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought a house that needed a lot of repairs and we've been doing all this 
work in hopes of increasing its value," said Dunn, who works as an actress. 
"That way, we figured if we had to sell, we would be able to make some money to 
live on for a while. But if it's true that this is a landslide area, who's 
going to pay top dollar for our house?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fears about property values are real for many residents, said Louise Turner, a 
longtime Laguna real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certainly lots of concerns out there about property values going 
down," Turner said. "It would be very, very strange if there were not. The 
really sad thing is that people here, especially the ones in the fire areas, 
are so strung out already by everything that's happened to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Toohey, another broker with a long history in Laguna, said he has seen 
little so far to indicate real concern among his clients. Besides, he said, "I 
think once this thing has cleared and everything is properly investigated and 
all the reports are made public, the marketplace will move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna property values may well prove as resilient as those in Malibu and San 
Francisco, two other desirable California communities hard hit by natural 
disasters in recent years, Toohey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a lot like Malibu," he said. "You know, rocks roll down onto 
the highway, then the whole place almost burns down and you still don't see any 
shortage of people willing to pay anything to move in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Word that geologists last week identified the suspected slide area in Temple 
Hills and confirmed that a second, previously unknown ancient landslide exists 
under part of nearby Mystic Hills sent a wave of concern across this community. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and residents alike fretted about the cost, with some voicing 
concerns that the landslides, discovered during geological surveys in the 
aftermath of the fire, may ultimately prove more expensive than the fire 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For disaster-weary Laguna officials, last week's decision to pay geologists 
$46,000 to study the Temple Hills area means the city has now set aside nearly 
$100,000 for geological investigations of the two neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said the city might well end up spending more money to 
study and shore up its unstable hillsides than the $500,000 the city is now 
expected to pay as its share of the fire costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dismal," Christoph said. "The whole thing is not what you want to be 
hearing at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Some said that merely including their properties in the Temple Hills study 
area, whatever the results, unfairly stigmatizes their neighborhoods, until now 
among the most desirable and valuable in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's City Council meeting, which resulted in a decision to inspect the 
Temple Hills area for an ancient slide, one Temple Hills resident complained 
bitterly that city officials had done enormous damage to numerous property 
owners in her neighborhood simply by releasing a map that shows the suspected 
slide area. 
</P>
<P>
 Others spoke privately of putting together a citizens' group to sue the city 
in an attempt to force it to drop the Temple Hills investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others tried to find humor in the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Patterson, whose burned-out lot lies on the edge of the Temple Hills 
slide study area, said she and her neighbors have joked that even if they can 
rebuild, they may be forced to spend the rest of their lives living 
side-by-side, unable to sell their properties and unable to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before long, we'll all be naming our children after each other," Patterson 
joked. "We'll be neighbors joined at the hip."

LEARNING P'S AND Q'S OF AMERICAN ENGLISH; ASSIMILATION: O.C. IMMIGRANTS ARE 
TURNING TO SPEECH CLASSES TO HELP RID THEIR NATIVE ACCENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sharp staccato lingers in Teresa Amper's voice eight years after she left 
her native Philippines. While her English language skills are nearly flawless, 
her accent has isolated her from co-workers and inhibited her from cold-calling 
in her job as a part-time realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my friends hold the phone a good distance away from their ear when 
they talk to me. They tell me that," Amper, 44, of Irvine, said recently as she 
sat in an Irvine Valley College classroom working to adopt the pitch and 
pattern of mainstream American English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, every time I say something, they ask me to repeat what I'm trying 
to convey. I feel very embarrassed," Amper said. "I think I have problems. I 
talk too fast and too loud." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more of Orange County's immigrant residents -- who hail from Mexico, 
Honduras and as far away as Iran, Korea and Vietnam -- are craving the American 
cadence they hope will bring them acceptance in a county that still feels 
predominantly white despite steady demographic change. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter "Talk American," a program taught by Laguna Niguel speech pathologist 
Jill Farman, one of a gradually increasing cadre of specialists offering 
courses in accent reduction at colleges and businesses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For some students, improving their tone and adopting the "step up, step down" 
rhythms of American English mean a better relationship with an American 
boyfriend, the end to taunts by their kindergarten-age children, or an increase 
in sales on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Amper practices daily in her car using Farman's cassettes, and already has 
noticed an improvement in her office relationships. And Mexican-born Miguel 
Diaz of Santa Ana said two courses that he took with Farman -- one of them at 
the Irvine company where he works -- led to a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the courses are not without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana insisted on changing the title of 
Farman's class from "Reducing a Foreign Accent," to "Improving Your English 
Pronunciation," fearing her title might offend the immigrant community by 
implying that accents are shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 And some students said they suspect complaints about their accents are 
motivated by discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Alcaraz, 50, who pursued English studies at the graduate level in the 
Philippines, said her previous Orange County boss lauded her as the best 
employee in the collection department, urging others to emulate her style. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so in her current job. After a customer in Georgia complained that Alcaraz 
sounded "rude," and her boss reprimanded her, Alcaraz signed up for Farman's 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my job, I am dealing with a lot of people. I know that there are some 
who are discriminating. Even if I don't mean to be rude, they say I'm rude, and 
it affects my job," she said. "Why is it that some people, they find British 
accents classy, but an Asian accent, they call it no good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alcaraz said she doubts she will ever lose her accent completely because she 
continues to speak Tagalog with other Filipinos and is encouraging her children 
to learn the language. 
</P>
<P>
 But for work, she said, it will serve her well to speak English more slowly, 
open her mouth wider for "ah" sounds, and practice the "f" and "sh" sounds that 
come slowly to native Tagalog speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her enthusiasm, however, is tainted by a mild resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they hear that you have an accent they immediately jump at you," she 
said of some clients she deals with on the phone. "I feel this should not be, 
because everyone here is an immigrant. But when you're in Rome, do as the good 
Romans do." 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals in the field of speech are more than aware of the need for 
sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the term accent reduction has been largely 
supplanted by accent enhancement or improvement, said Judy K. Montgomery, an 
assistant professor at Chapman University in Orange and president-elect of the 
Maryland-based American Speech-Language-Hearing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The association stresses in its literature that accent classes are elective, 
and that accents are not to be treated as speech disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone to deny their culture or deny their ethnicity," 
Montgomery said. "And we don't want to make it sound like an individual has a 
disability. They don't. They may just need a broader repertoire. The point is 
to Americanize the use of English, because that's what we respond to in this 
country. It's that 'You sound like I do' that makes people comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bahman Sepahvan, who recently started a mortgage company in Irvine with his 
friend, Ali K. Darian, 35, said the pair, both from Iran, came to Farman's 
class precisely to make potential customers more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Iranians want you to sound American," the 37-year-old Sepahvan said, 
joking. 
</P>
<P>
 In class recently at the end of Farman's four-week course, Sepahvan and others 
videotaped themselves one last time and complimented one another on their 
improvements. One native Spanish speaker no longer mixed "v" with "b," and 
Darian was praised for picking up the singsong of American English, a stark 
contrast to the flat tones of Farsi. All said they watched newscasters 
vigilantly for that uniform American accent that rarely betrays ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sonia Bautista, 35, a dentist who moved to Mission Viejo from the 
Philippines several years ago, speaking English strained her breathing, sapped 
her confidence and limited her patients' ability to understand her when her 
back was turned. It also led to bitter fights on the phone with her Van Nuys 
boyfriend, who complained that she should "speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say, 'Why can't you communicate better? I can't understand you,' " 
Bautista recounted after Farman's class. "Since I'm a dentist I talk to people 
all the time. I can see when people have trouble understanding me because they 
look to my mouth instead of into my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 The class has helped turn things around. Because she puts less strain on her 
vocal cords by breathing properly, she is more easily understood on the job, 
Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And my boyfriend doesn't yell at me anymore," she added shyly. "I think any 
foreigner who believes they have a problem should enroll in a class." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said the field is becoming increasingly popular: Five years ago, 
there was only one person in Orange County to whom she would refer clients 
hoping to hone their American accents. Now, there are "10 or 12 I would have 
great confidence in." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot right now. Some people say they've been looking for something like 
this for 20 years," said Farman, who also teaches at Saddleback College in 
Mission Viejo and Golden West College in Huntington Beach. "People want this 
stuff. They're clamoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Hiser of Newport Beach-based Speech Communication, which has about 30 
corporate clients, said they used to be predominantly defense and aerospace 
companies. Now, she said, many are in the biomedical, health and computer 
engineering fields. 
</P>
<P>
 FileNet, a software company with 500 employees in Costa Mesa, has paid Hiser 
to work with small groups of interested employees since a few requested a 
course in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Diaz swears by it. Five years ago, he was cleaning bathrooms at 
Trimedyne Inc. in Irvine, a recently arrived Mexican immigrant who spoke no 
English. Today he is a computer technician in laser manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more confident. It encouraged me to move up," said Diaz, who persuaded 
his supervisor to attend a class with him and then helped bring Farman to 
Trimedyne to teach. Diaz, 32, is determined to keep improving -- fishing for 
words he does not know, practicing them while driving and repeating them in 
front of the mirror at night in his Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I try to bring it up in conversation, to prove that I did it right. I've 
gained a lot of words in that way," said Diaz, whose most recent victory is 
pundit.  
</P>
<P>
 Even after he became fluent in English, Diaz said, his accent hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, what you're saying is right, but you don't give the right 
pronunciation, the right pitch. Sometimes, people don't understand or they 
pretend that they don't understand," he said. "It blocks the communication. A 
lot of people stop at that. They don't go beyond it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; BREYER FITS THE MOLD OF STATUS QUO JUSTICES; JUDICIARY: CLINTON 
IS FOLLOWING THE PATH OF HIS REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS BY CHOOSING A 
CONSENSUS-BUILDER. 
</P>

<P>
 The nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer to the Supreme Court, like the 
choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year, appears to put President Clinton on 
the same path as his Republican predecessors, who sought to build a court more 
likely to adhere to the status quo than to boldly reshape the law or expand 
individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer and Ginsburg, like most recent Republican presidential nominees, are 
careful, moderate judges inclined to make consensus rulings. The trend, which 
extends back at least to the 1987 defeat of Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination, 
has created a high court whose first instinct is to avoid dramatic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the downsizing of the Supreme Court," said Georgetown University law 
professor Mark Tushnet. Stacked with low-profile jurists, the court "is 
avoiding the high-profile issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands in a marked contrast to the court led by former California Gov. Earl 
Warren, which often moved boldly to correct what it saw as social evils by 
writing new constitutional rules. It was the Warren court, for example, that 40 
years ago this week struck down racial segregation in the schools with the 
landmark ruling in Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the issue is abortion or affirmative action, the prime 
constitutional battles of the 1980s, or the emerging 1990s disputes over gay 
rights and the "right to die" through assisted suicide, the current high court 
is inclined to defer to the decisions of others, especially elected lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in this term the justices have shunned controversies of all sort and 
are expected to issue written decisions in only 85 cases, the lowest number 
since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, the trend toward centrist judges reflects a reluctance by 
presidents to nominate candidates who will set off sparks during the Senate 
confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer won the nod from Clinton late Friday afternoon only after some Senate 
Republicans had vowed to fight the nomination of Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt, who was seen as a bolder and more liberal choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer appears to be "one more vote to keep the court on a middle course," 
said University of Virginia law professor A. E. Dick Howard. "He is not likely 
to be a vote for innovation." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years when the Republicans occupied the White House, the process 
worked in reverse. Senate Democrats did their best to block strongly 
conservative nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, President Ronald Reagan, at the height of his power, elevated 
conservative Justice William H. Rehnquist to lead the court and appointed the 
strongly conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Democrats mustered 33 
votes against Rehnquist but failed to stop either confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next year, Reagan tried to add Bork, another bold conservative. If 
confirmed, he would certainly have joined Rehnquist and Scalia in an effort to 
overturn the Roe vs. Wade decision on abortion and to outlaw any preferential 
treatment for racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democrat-controlled Senate defeated the Bork nomination, and Reagan 
then turned to a low-key, more moderate appeals court judge, Anthony M. Kennedy 
of Sacramento, who won a unanimous confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, President George Bush wanted to avoid a Senate fight over abortion 
and selected a so-called "stealth candidate," Judge David H. Souter of New 
Hampshire. With no written record on controversies, Souter easily won over 
Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Kennedy and Souter combined to preserve the status quo in two key 
areas. They cast the deciding votes against overturning the Roe vs. Wade 
decision and permitting prayers at school graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 While many conservatives were frustrated by the failure of GOP appointees to 
change the law on abortion, school prayer and affirmative action, liberals may 
well find themselves disappointed in the future with Clinton's nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming on the horizon are two controversies that will test the direction of 
the new high court. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases, gay-rights lawyers are challenging government policies that 
discriminate among individuals based on their sexual orientation. These include 
not only the military's continued ban on open homosexuals, but other laws 
involving marriage, adoptions, employment and survivor's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court has not ruled squarely on whether government discrimination 
against homosexuals is constitutional. In recent cases involving the military, 
the justices have simply ducked the issue by refusing to hear appeals filed by 
gay service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a federal judge in Seattle has ruled for the first time that the 
Constitution gives a terminally ill person a right to die through assisted 
suicide. In her opinion, Judge Barbara Rothstein cited the "right to privacy" 
principle set out in the high court's abortion decisions and then extended the 
doctrine to cover the choice of ending one's own life. 
</P>
<P>
 If the high court were to adopt Rothstein's view, it would sweep aside laws 
nationwide that prevent doctors and others from aiding in suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one can forecast how a Justice Breyer would rule on such issues, the 
veteran Boston jurist has not shown a tendency to expand the Constitution into 
new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a good, gray choice who will not do anything dramatic in the immediate 
future," Tushnet predicted. "He will keep things going the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
 As a scholar, Breyer has written mostly about issues involving the cost of 
health and safety regulations, rather than debating the reach of the 
Constitution and its protection of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly doesn't seem to have an activist agenda," Howard said. "I don't 
think he will strike out in new directions. He is likely to be the solid 
craftsman who can shore up the center."

BOSNIA FACTIONS BALK AT NEW PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his fellow foreign ministers said 
they did not expect immediate results from their new peace plan for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. On Saturday, they were proven right. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Muslim leaders denounced the proposal from the United States, Russia 
and the European Union as legitimizing the Serbs' conquests, and they said a 
proposed four-month cease-fire is too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs said the cease-fire is too short and showed no sign of embracing 
the allies' terms for a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the peace plan's authors said they consider its prospects for success to 
be slim -- at least without military intervention or some other form of direct 
pressure from the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "History tells us the chances are probably not great," said a senior U.S. 
official involved in the negotiations. "Nonetheless, we have to give it a 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he added, is that the United States and its Russian and European 
allies do not have enough leverage over the Bosnian Serbs to push them into a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that has always been lacking," he said. "That is very much on 
our mind." 
</P>
<P>
 What the big powers accomplished here last week was to agree on their goals in 
Bosnia: an early cease-fire, followed by negotiations toward a settlement that 
divides the country about equally between the Serbs and a Muslim-Croatian 
federation. After two years of discord, they are finally singing from the same 
page in the diplomatic hymnbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not doing much more than singing, and the Bosnian Serbs have not 
paid much attention to the outside world's entreaties thus far. If they ignore 
this new appeal for negotiations, the allies are not quite sure what their next 
act will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslim prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, put the dilemma in a 
nutshell when he spoke to reporters at a champagne reception Christopher hosted 
at the U.S. mission Saturday to honor the doleful Muslim and Croatian 
negotiators: 
</P>
<P>
 "What if the Serbs don't talk?" he asked. "We could be frozen in the situation 
we're in. What if they talk and stall? We will be stuck again. What if they 
reach an agreement and just don't implement it? Where do we go then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic condemned the plan as a sellout of the Bosnian Muslims' hopes of 
keeping their country unified -- "Munich on television," he said, referring to 
the diplomatic conference that awarded part of Czechoslovakia to German 
dictator Adolf Hitler in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, said the four-month 
cease-fire proposed by the allies is too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe two months would be enough if we want to obtain a political 
settlement," Izetbegovic told reporters in Sarajevo, according to the Reuters 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said 
that four months is too short. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in favor of a permanent cessation of hostilities," he said -- a 
formula the Muslims fear would lead to a permanent Serbian occupation of their 
lands, of which the Serbs have captured 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Silajdzic said he will try to work with the new proposal -- especially 
if the allies back up their unified message with measures to enforce a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for guarantees," he said. "We are looking for commitment from 
the international community." 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of commitment? "Force should be used to implement these agreements," 
Silajdzic said. 
</P>
<P>
 To which the allies replied, in effect: We're not ready for that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand what the prime minister is saying," the U.S. negotiator said, 
but "we have to give (the peace plan) a chance" without any threats of force. 
</P>
<P>
 If that does not work, then the question of using military power to implement 
or enforce an agreement may arise, he said, but "I can't tell you how it's 
going to be answered by the political authorities of any of our countries." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has repeatedly ruled out the use of U.S. ground troops in 
Bosnia except as peacekeepers after a settlement is reached. Senior State 
Department officials said that prohibition still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's chief negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, said 
cheerfully that the way ahead is clear: "Now is the time to tell the parties 
what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the allies have not agreed on how to enforce their 
desires. Russia has often defended Serbia's interests in the talks, urging the 
other countries to begin lifting U.N. economic sanctions against Belgrade as an 
early part of the process.

DEADBEAT PARENTS PLAN EXPANDED; CHILD SUPPORT: STATE'S SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROGRAM 
THAT GARNISHES WAGES WILL BEGIN COLLECTIONS NATIONWIDE. AIM IS TO TAKE IN $103 
MILLION FROM 11,600 TARGETED DELINQUENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California, a state that has long harbored one of the worst records for 
collecting child support payments, this week will extend the reach of its 
highly successful pilot collection program and begin tapping into deadbeat 
parents' wages nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded program, to be announced Monday by Controller Gray Davis, 
authorizes collection agencies to garnish wages to support children in six 
California counties even if the parent has moved out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The California wage-garnishing pilot program, launched five months ago, has 
collected $11.2 million and is being reviewed by the Clinton Administration for 
possible inclusion in the President's new welfare program, according to Carol 
Thorp, spokeswoman for the controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded program's aim is to take in $103 million from 11,600 targeted 
parents living outside the state -- a particularly intransigent group, 
according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
Nearly a third of child support cases involve out-of-state fathers, who turn 
over only 10% of the child support money collected, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's pilot program has district attorneys forward the toughest 
collection cases to the state's Franchise Tax Board, which then taps computer 
databases also used to collect delinquent state taxes -- databases that can 
ferret out virtually anyone with a Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
 Although district attorneys must go to the courts to garnish any wage or 
income, a process that often takes a year or longer, the tax board is able to 
tap wages immediately. So far, 12,000 families, most of them in Los Angeles 
County, have benefited from the program, and a majority of the cases referred 
to the tax board have resulted in payments, the controller spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is still in the backwaters of child support," Davis said, 
acknowledging the state's hefty $3 billion in unpaid court-ordered child 
support payments. "But our new program is a model for the nation," he said, 
adding that it is aimed at reducing the state's burgeoning welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program is operating in Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Clara, Fresno, 
Solano and Nevada counties, but legislation introduced into the Assembly last 
week would expand it statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House task force on welfare reform has said that only $13 billion is 
collected in child support in the United States each year, although the 
potential exceeds $47 billion. And census figures show that about a quarter of 
women eligible for child support receive the full amount they are owed. 
</P>
<P>
 California has long been a golden state for parents who don't want to pay 
child support. Although most states do little to force scofflaw parents to meet 
their obligations, California has one of the least effective child support 
systems in the country, a 1992 report by Children Now, a California advocacy 
group, found. In 1990, it said, only 39% of child support orders tracked by 
district attorneys resulted in any payment, a figure that has improved somewhat 
since then. In Los Angeles County, only 37% of the support ordered in 1987 was 
paid, a figure that dropped to 34% by 1990, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 study by the House Ways and Means Committee gave the state an overall 
grade of D and ranked it 47th in the country in several key indicators of how 
effectively its child support program was run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fathers make up 93% of the child support scofflaws in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they use the greater resources of the tax system to identify where people 
are, it becomes much easier to get a collection," said Joseph Liu, director for 
policy at Children Now, adding that district attorneys offices that are 
overwhelmed dealing with violent crimes often do not aggressively push child 
support prosecutions or they lack the tax board's tools and records to track 
down parents. Prosecutions have been stepped up, in part for fiscal reasons: 
California's welfare system through court actions recovered about $300 million 
in payments in fiscal 1993. About half of the money collected by the pilot 
program is returned to the government to reimburse it for past welfare 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles mother Valencia Robins said she was unable to get any child 
support payments through the district attorney and was reduced to living in a 
Torrance homeless shelter for two months with her daughters, 4 and 1, then went 
on welfare. The daughters' father, a professional rapper, would not pay child 
support, she says. The state's tax board was able to find his bank account and 
collect $105,000 in child support payments, of which about $20,000 went to 
reimburse the government for past welfare payments to Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They changed my life. I don't have to worry about where the kids' next meal 
will come from," said Robins, 24, who is now taking courses to prepare for 
nursing school. 
</P>
<P>
 California has used other techniques to battle the problem. It has begun 
denying professional licenses to child support delinquents and last year 
required that all hospitals offer fathers the option of signing birth 
certificates, a measure that helps to establish paternity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states have tried other techniques: A Massachusetts initiative called 
the "10 Most Wanted" project hangs posters with mug shots and the names of 10 
child support delinquents on billboards and in subways in an effort to shame 
people into paying up. 
</P>
<P>
 But other states have balked at the increasingly assertive measures, raising 
concerns that tougher measures give the government too much power and that some 
approaches only drag men who owe child support into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho's lawmakers this year killed a bill that would have revoked driver's 
licenses of those who failed to make child support payments.

NEW WITNESS RE-ENACTS FIRST MOMENTS OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a potentially significant new witness in tow, authorities Saturday toured 
the area where last year's Calabasas/Malibu fire started, asking him an array 
of detailed questions and re-enacting the fire's opening minutes on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Blakeley, who emerged from anonymity this week with new information 
about the fire, fielded 90 minutes of questions from two Los Angeles County 
sheriff's investigators, Jerome Beck and Mark Winters, and from Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Sally Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 As they conducted their interview, investigators and Blakeley repeatedly 
walked up and down Old Topanga Canyon Road -- and the now-barren hillside above 
it -- where the Nov. 2 fire started. Authorities declined to comment about 
their investigation and tried to keep reporters at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze eventually burned a path to the Pacific Ocean, overwhelming 
thousands of firefighters, killing three people and destroying more than 350 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley is a potentially important witness because he was among the first 
people to arrive at the scene of the fire, and he joined the early efforts to 
battle the blaze. Investigators have been trying to locate him for months, but 
he only surfaced last week after The Times ran photographs of him and friends 
told him that authorities were eager to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley told the investigators that the two suspects -- Nicholas A. Durepo 
and Steven R. Shelp, both of whom were volunteer firefighters at the time -- 
pulled up moments after he did, parked their blue pickup truck behind his 
vehicle and ran up a small road leading to two water tanks just above the spot 
where the blaze started. At some point, they fished a garden hose out of the 
back of Durepo's pickup truck, Blakeley told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember those two guys dragging the garden hose," up the hill, he told 
them. "They didn't go up too far, if I remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, one of the lead investigators in the case, recorded Saturday's 
re-enactment on videotape as Blakeley and investigators noted the locations of 
fire hydrants and other pieces of equipment that figure in the arson 
investigation. Accompanied by his wife and son, Blakeley arrived for the 
re-enactment in his white pickup, the same vehicle he said he was driving on 
the day of the blaze as he drove from Los Angeles International Airport to his 
home in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 During the questioning, investigators repeatedly asked Blakeley how long Shelp 
and Durepo stayed on the hill before returning to Old Topanga, where the trucks 
were parked. He said the two were on the hill just a short while -- less than a 
minute, Beck concluded after questioning Blakeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives inquired at length about minutiae related to the case, seeking to 
determine whether Shelp and Durepo knew the locations of potential water 
sources in the area. If so, it might suggest that they had scouted the area, 
consistent with investigators' theory that they deliberately picked a location 
where they believed they could start a fire and put it out, all in an effort to 
be praised for their heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by investigators, Blakeley said he told Shelp and Durepo 
that he had an adapter in his truck that would enable them to hook the garden 
hose to one of the hillside fire hydrants. Durepo and perhaps Shelp then headed 
up the hill with the hose and tried to battle the blaze, Blakeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow the short guy (Durepo) ended up with the hose and went (back) up the 
hill," Blakeley told the investigators. "He wasn't up there very long -- they 
were getting smoked out" by the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the windblown fire had gone down the hill and jumped Old Topanga, and 
was racing toward several homes. Within minutes, the fire had grown so large 
that it badly burned one victim, Ron Mass. Mass ran to the road, where Shelp 
and Durepo doused him with water from the hose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't getting much water" out of the hydrant, Blakeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley also told investigators that Durepo gave him the keys to his truck 
and asked that he move it down the hill and out of the path of the fire. 
Witnesses have said they saw a blue pickup matching the one driven by Durepo as 
he fled the scene of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Blakeley's account could fill in many of the missing pieces in the 
investigation, it may not by itself resolve many of the questions about Durepo 
and Shelp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, both of them failed polygraph tests, provided questionable 
accounts of their whereabouts on the day of the fire and offered other 
statements about the incident that investigators consider dubious, according to 
sources familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, during a break in one of their many interviews by authorities, 
sources say Shelp was overheard to tell Durepo: "Don't sweat this. I won't give 
you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have eagerly sought Blakeley because he was among the first 
people at the fire and because Shelp and Durepo contended that a passing 
plumber had provided the adapter that allowed them to connect the hose to the 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, investigators believed that Shelp and Durepo had made up that 
part of the story to explain how they happened to have the unusual piece of 
equipment. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said investigators had been 
unable to find the "plumber" for months. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent days, The Times ran photographs of the man the two suspects told 
friends was the missing plumber. Blakeley's friends recognized him, and when he 
returned from a trip to Oregon last week, he notified authorities that he was 
the man in the picture and that he would cooperate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley is an underground contractor instead of a plumber. He uses a variety 
of adapters in his work and happened to have several of them in his truck on 
the day of the fire, he told investigators Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times last week, Blakeley said the two men were 
telling the truth and that he had indeed supplied them with the adapter. Also, 
Blakeley said the two men had pulled up behind him at the scene, arriving about 
three to five minutes after he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators questioned Blakeley about those and other issues 
Saturday, they would not comment afterward about whether their interview with 
Blakeley had changed their views of Shelp and Durepo. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley's sudden appearance has thrust him into the center of the volatile 
case and made the soft-spoken contractor an instant celebrity. More than a 
dozen reporters and camera crews staked out his house last week, and his wife 
said the family has been besieged with requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, she said, they received 117 phone messages from reporters 
seeking comment. Beyond his interview with The Times, however, Blakeley has 
only spoken briefly about the incident in public and has declined to offer his 
opinion about whether the two set the fire. He has been told by authorities to 
keep quiet about his involvement in the case.

ARCHITECTS' TOUR SHOWS L.A. AS A LAND OF EXTREMES

 Kate Woodman of Newburyport, Mass., is surprised to see a live chicken 
strutting around a Boyle Heights back yard. "That's the last thing I imagined 
I'd see in L.A.," she says. "It feels like I'm in another country." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Chen of Honolulu is fascinated by the peaceful and well-maintained side 
streets in some neighborhoods hit by the 1992 riots. "It doesn't look like the 
Bronx or South Chicago," he says. "Just by the reputation in the past, one 
would think it would look more depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 And the sheer enormity of the Los Angeles flatlands is making a deep 
impression on Reagan Reep of Jacksonville, Fla. "It's so vast. I've never seen 
so much of the same kind of run-down, overpopulated area. It just goes on and 
on and on," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodman, Chen and Reep and 27 other out-of-towners are on a bus, taking in 
sights in Downtown, on the Eastside, in Watts and South-Central that most 
tourists never glimpse and that some Angelenos avoid. 
</P>

<P>
 "The Real L.A." tour was offered Friday and Saturday as part of the American 
Institute of Architects' national convention, the first in Los Angeles since 
1956. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the convention also sponsored tours of glitzy Beverly Hills 
shopping streets and Malibu mansions by the sea. But "The Real L.A." guide, 
local architect Carlton Davis, wanted to show a more diverse city, one of 
lively ethnic markets, graffiti-marked gang turf, endless railroad spurs and 
cozy bungalows with rose gardens out front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get beyond the myth of glamour and the more recent images of total 
destruction," said Davis, whose design work includes the Los Angeles Mission, a 
large homeless shelter on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who think they know Los Angeles, they know images of L.A. from 
Downtown to the beach, nothing to the east and nothing to the south. My 
philosophy is to make the rest of the city more well known," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and their relatives, he assumed, might be more receptive to 
exploring urban life than a gathering of, say, dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone boards the sightseeing bus at the new Convention Center in Downtown. 
Soon they are cruising past the historic movie palaces on Broadway. Then the 
bus hooks through Skid Row. Some homeless men on San Julian Street glare 
angrily at the tourist invasion while other flash peace signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus then drives through the Civic Center and Chinatown, past Union Station 
and the new high-rise County Jail and over the Brooklyn Avenue Bridge to Boyle 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the river?" several passengers ask in unison upon seeing the concrete 
ditch that carried a murky trickle. Yes, indeed, Davis answers, helpfully 
adding that a band of homeless South American transvestites is living under a 
nearby bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 (Parts of this four-hour itinerary would never meet traditional Chamber of 
Commerce standards.) 
</P>
<P>
 Through Boyle Heights, Davis explains how a once-largely Jewish neighborhood 
had become a Latino community. To emphasize the point, the bus stops at the El 
Mercado shopping complex for some churros, then later pauses in the evocative 
Home of Peace Memorial Park, the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles and 
final resting place of Hollywood moguls Jack Warner and Samuel Goldwyn. 
Japanese temples and community centers are also on the Eastside route. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lynn George, Los Angeles' ethnic mix of Latino, Anglo, African American 
and Asian seems much more varied than back home in Pittsburgh. "Here you really 
have a feeling of a melting pot, as if it's very fluid," she said. "This city 
really does turn over." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Davis stresses, it is a city that changes block to block. Just off the 
bustling shopping district of Whittier Boulevard -- where he salutes the 
blue-and-yellow-tiled Pedorrero muffler shop -- he points out quiet side 
streets and homes with astonishingly lush gardens. Suddenly the peace ends and 
an industrial zone begins. Through the gritty Alameda corridor of factories and 
railroads, the bus aims for the Watts Towers, then up Central Avenue to one of 
the 1992 riot zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The many empty lots remaining from the arson fires around Florence and 
Normandie and along Vermont Avenue fit into the ever-mutating urban landscape, 
Davis tells the bus riders: "It's sort of like everyday L.A. One day you pass a 
building on a street in L.A. and the next it's gone. Something else has 
replaced it. This city is constantly changing." 
</P>
<P>
 New mini-malls, supermarkets and fast-food joints are sprouting on lots left 
empty from the civil disturbance, but not enough to soften the shock for some 
visiting architects and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Arkansan Sue Gaskin -- a first-time visitor to Southern 
California -- had toured multimillion-dollar homes in Bel-Air with fellow 
conventioneers. Now, as the "Real L.A." bus passes Pico-Union streets with 
traffic barricades to discourage drug dealing, she is finding it hard to 
comprehend that she is in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just from one end to the other, as far as extremes go," the Little Rock, 
Ark., resident remarked as the bus neared the Convention Center again. "You 
have everything and anything here."

4 DECADES LATER, LEGACY OF BROWN VS. TOPEKA IS CLOUDY; CIVIL RIGHTS: THE BELIEF 
IN THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION IS NOW CORRODED BY A NEW GENERATION OF PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It opened the modern era of race relations, yet it now seems to belong to a 
bygone time, an era when right and wrong itself was as stark as black and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago this week -- May 17, 1954 -- a unanimous Supreme Court struck 
down racially segregated education in Brown vs. the Board of Education of 
Topeka, Kan. The historic decision still reverberates through American life. 
And yet in some respects its echo has grown faint, even discordant. 
</P>
<P>
 On both sides of the color line, many say, the belief in integration that the 
Brown case came to symbolize has weakened. Today, few leaders of any race place 
high priority on encouraging greater integration in housing or schools. 
Approximately two-thirds of African American children still attend schools that 
have a majority of black or Latino students, largely because patterns of racial 
separation in housing remain immutable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown case typified the conviction that the key to providing blacks with a 
better life was expanding civil rights and eliminating discrimination. Now that 
belief has been corroded by a new generation of problems not clearly rooted in 
prejudice and largely beyond the reach of legal remedies, the courts and 
perhaps government policy of any sort: the loss of low-skill, high-wage jobs to 
automation and foreign competition and the crashing waves of violence and drug 
abuse immersing many inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the decision's popular legacy of equal treatment regardless of skin color 
casts an ironic shadow through the years. Today, that logic is perhaps more 
likely to be cited by conservative critics of race-conscious affirmative-action 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown belonged to a certain period in American history, but what we confront 
now is something very different," said Harvard Law School professor Randall L. 
Kennedy, editor of Reconstruction, a journal on race relations. "We know what 
we don't want -- de jure segregation, persistent discrimination. When it comes 
to what we want, that's where we get fuzzy and the conflict breaks out." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's signal achievement was to undermine the social legitimacy of 
state-sanctioned inequality. Overturning the 1896 Supreme Court decision that 
approved "separate but equal" public facilities for blacks, the high court 
ruled in Brown that in education, segregated facilities were "inherently 
unequal." 
</P>
<P>
 The court followed with decisions striking down segregation in other public 
facilities, clearing the way for the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act that buried 
the last vestiges of Jim Crow and outlawed discrimination in employment and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the notion that all Americans should be treated alike not only under the 
law but in personal relations "is not just an accepted principle, it is a 
valued principle," said political pollster Geoff Garin. "If you think about 
where the country was 40 years ago, it's striking that in every major Southern 
city people watch the news every night delivered by an African American anchor 
and never think twice about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But many whites have never accepted to the same degree the corollary of 
Brown's logic: that integration in schools and other aspects of life was a 
positive good for society, Garin and other opinion analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attitudes bounded Brown's impact. After the initial Brown decision 
failed to meaningfully promote desegregation, the Supreme Court in 1968 and 
1971 compelled school districts to move affirmatively toward integration, with 
busing plans if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Milliken vs. Bradley case involving Detroit, the court ruled in 
1974 that federal courts could not order busing between cities and their 
suburbs merely to achieve racial balance in the schools; the courts had to 
first find that the racial separation developed from acts of official 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision etched the limit of Brown's reach -- and accelerated the 
resettling of urban areas into predominantly black inner cities ringed by 
largely white suburbs, many experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once Milliken came down, it was clear that once whites could withdraw across 
a municipal boundary, there was no way to promote integration in schools unless 
you promote integration in housing, and we as a society have been unwilling to 
do that over the past two decades," said Douglas S. Massey, a sociologist at 
the University of Chicago who has extensively studied residential housing 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential separation by race remains intense: Though some middle-class 
blacks have moved into formerly white suburbs, Massey said, the overall level 
of segregation in cities like Chicago, Detroit, New York, Cleveland and St. 
Louis remains as great as 40 years ago, and in such Southern cities as 
Birmingham, Ala., housing segregation is actually rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Those housing patterns, combined with demographic trends like the powerful 
influx of Latino students, have hollowed Brown's promise in most urban school 
districts: According to a National School Boards Assn. survey conducted late 
last year, more than two-thirds of all black students attend schools that are 
primarily made up of minority pupils -- the highest figure since 1968. In the 
Northeast, where separation is most intense, half of the black students attend 
schools where at least nine out of every 10 students are members of minority 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "You basically had no serious sustained effort to desegregate outside the 
South," said Gary Orfield, a Harvard University education professor. "You never 
had a national Administration committed to enforcing it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Integration appears to be receding as a priority for blacks too. In a recent 
Gallup survey for USA Today, roughly 2-to-1 majorities of blacks said they 
would rather strengthen neighborhood schools than increase efforts at 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Russell Sage Foundation survey of African Americans found that three 
out of five support the creation of all-black male academies within public 
school systems. On college campuses, minority students now often seek 
affirmative segregation in separate dorms, student organizations and ethnically 
based academic departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the way these kids have latched onto some of the black 
nationalists, you get the sense that the rejection of integration by major 
forces in society makes them feel they have to go it alone," said Ronald 
Walters, chairman of the political science department at Howard University, a 
historically black college in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If faith in integration has waned since 1954, so too has the belief that 
ensuring civil rights is the key to narrowing the divides between blacks and 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there's much less consensus that the most troubling trends in the black 
community are grounded in discrimination -- and thus capable of being reversed 
by the kind of legal action Brown symbolized. Though affirmative action and 
other legal strategies have enlarged the black middle class, such programs 
offer less practical help to African Americans trapped in poor neighborhoods 
where family structure and social order have substantially broken down and 
industrial restructuring has decimated high-wage manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some sympathetic analysts view the continuing legal battles over 
discrimination as far less important than combatting problems such as the 
explosion in gang-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong with black America has nothing to do with rights," said 
historian David J. Garrow, author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. "It is largely internally generated and will require a 
kind of fundamental cultural change that is going to come very slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Massey dissents, arguing that those negative cultural trends derive from the 
continued isolation of most blacks into segregated neighborhoods -- and that 
such isolation is itself rooted in continued housing and lending 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you segregate and isolate people . . . you build in these 
self-perpetuating cycles of violence and social pathology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Massey's concerns are the same that inspired the lawsuits that led to the 
Brown decision: overt discrimination denying minorities equal treatment under 
the law. But since Brown, much of the civil rights debate has shifted to 
different terrain: whether, to overcome past discrimination or encourage 
diversity, it is appropriate to grant minorities preferences in hiring and 
college-admissions decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Brown decision, the Supreme Court carefully avoided ruling that the 
Constitution prohibits government from making any distinctions on the basis of 
race. But the decision was received as bearing precisely the message that all 
Americans, regardless of race, should be treated equally under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 That standard shaped the Civil Rights Act. But starting with President Lyndon 
B. Johnson's 1965 commencement address at Howard University, liberals have 
argued that government has to grant racial preferences in employment and 
education to produce "equality as a result" not "just legal equity." 
</P>
<P>
 With that historic switch, Brown's legacy became confused and contested. In 
one of its briefs in the case, the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People suggested it was unconstitutional when government "confers or 
denies benefits on the basis of color or race." Now conservatives routinely 
cite that argument against affirmative-action plans the civil rights movement 
promotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been this incredible flip-flop," said Linda Chavez, executive 
director of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission under President Ronald Reagan. 
"The whole point of Brown and the civil rights movement was to make race 
irrelevant. Now we have come full circle and there is an attempt to elevate 
race and ethnicity to a category of ultimate importance." 
</P>
<P>
 As candidate and as President, Bill Clinton's instinct has been to leave 
undisturbed the liberal consensus behind affirmative action -- seeking neither 
its expansion nor retrenchment. But in other respects, he is moving back toward 
the idea of common opportunities and standards that some see as Brown's 
essence. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's agenda combines programs aimed at increasing opportunity without 
regard to race -- such as job training and expanded tax credits for the working 
poor -- with tougher enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in housing and 
credit. It also calls for moral renewal and personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Brown itself, many question whether those programs and exhortations 
are sufficient to bridge the chasm between white and black Americans. Indeed, 
there is precious little optimism that any group along the ideological spectrum 
holds the key to that lock. 
</P>
<P>
 That mist of despair marks the most stark contrast from 40 years ago. For an 
earlier generation, the Supreme Court's majestic Brown decision illuminated a 
path to equality through the dismantling of segregation. Today, Brown's beacon 
has dimmed, and in the gloom lurks the fear that no one knows which road now 
leads to racial reconciliation. A Progress Report 
</P>
<P>
 In the four decades since the Supreme Court struck down state-sanctioned 
segregation in Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., African 
Americans have made great progress relative to whites in some arenas but 
suffered reversals in others.

 Larry Goldberg's town has a grocery store, a theater, a library, an art 
gallery and, of course, a teen-agers' hangout. But you won't find it on any 
map. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called Northcoast Electronic Town, or N.E.T., a cybernetic linkup of five 
of the state's northernmost counties that Goldberg launched last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Humboldt, Del Norte, Mendocino, Trinity and Lake are rural counties with more 
redwoods than people, where people go to escape the cold efficiency of 
computers and other trappings of high-stress urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldberg -- a former New Yorker who came west to attend Humboldt State 
University -- thought that with all the remote towns that make up the North 
Coast, why not use high technology to help close the miles separating them all? 
</P>
<P>
 So with $20,000 of his own money, the Eureka business consultant created 
N.E.T., a cybertown where people can order blackberry jam from a food store, 
browse through an art gallery, find out what's playing at the local theater, 
read the complete works of Shakespeare, or debate President Clinton's timber 
policies, all without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the community of the future," Goldberg, 41, said of the fledgling 
computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same reason I stayed here is why I created this system -- to maintain my 
quality of life," he said. "You can live in the country and have this quality 
of life and still be connected to big-city services." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's company, Sequoia Technical Services, is headquartered in Eureka, 
about 250 miles north of San Francisco. Thus far he has enticed about 200 
subscribers, with about half of those paying the monthly $10 fee. To get the 
system going, he has offered free access to schools, local governments, 
libraries and hospitals. He hopes to someday have 1,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to train people," said Goldberg, who lives in the tiny fishing 
village of Trinidad about 20 miles up the coast from Eureka. "We're always a 
little behind the times up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Clicking on the "calendar" button, a subscriber can find the title of this 
month's play at Humboldt County's Ferndale Repertory Theatre, as well as a 
schedule of sailboat races on Humboldt Bay. Teen-agers click on the 
"coffeehouse" and tap into the on-line forum "Northcoast Teen Topics." Business 
leaders use the "professional building" section, looking for grants and ways to 
build coalitions to attract business to the economically depressed region. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg sees N.E.T. as a new tool for economic development of the five-county 
area, which has been battered over the last decade by federal regulations that 
limited timber harvests and hurt the salmon fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest area of concern for businesses here is people are very remote 
from each other," he said. "We began electronic networking as a means of 
talking to our colleagues and seeking funding. Nobody was providing a 
regionwide service." 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers receive some services from the global network Internet. These 
include Associated Press wire service, electronic mail service to other 
Internet subscribers and 200 of the 8,000 USEnet "conferences" news groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But N.E.T. subscribers also receive local news provided by two area magazines 
and Arcata's Humboldt State University newspaper. There are N.E.T. discussion 
groups about Northern California politics and other issues of interest to those 
living behind the "redwood curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 N.E.T. is different from most other networks because it ties together a region 
and its people. Having similar lifestyles, the people of Northern California 
can talk to one another about fishing, timber harvesting, watershed work, 
social service programs, economic development and other local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Patenaude, a computer expert who lives in Blue Lake, about 20 miles 
northeast of Eureka, subscribes to several national computer networks. "After a 
while I found I had little in common with most people" on discussion groups on 
the Internet, Patenaude said. "But the N.E.T. is community-based. You might 
have something to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Subscriber Jim Moorehead, owner of the Joshua Grindle Inn on the Mendocino 
coast, is using N.E.T. to meet with members of the Mendocino County Visitors 
Bureau Board. Using electronic mail, he can send the same message to all board 
members with a few clicks of the mouse. No copying, no stamps, no fax machine 
and no "snail mail" (a computer term used to describe the U.S. Postal Service). 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes me two hours to get to a meeting," Moorehead said. Using N.E.T. and 
its 800 number, he can talk longer for less. Other board members can listen and 
make comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Another subscriber relies on the network to communicate with his researcher in 
Eureka, a two-hour drive from his office in Crescent City, near the Oregon 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of subscribers from three counties -- Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity 
-- is using N.E.T. for "bio-regional marketing" to sell herbs, mushrooms and 
other products harvested locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are using the service to find economic support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use it to track Option 9," said Tim Cochrane, president of Six Rivers 
National Bank, headquartered in Eureka. Option 9 is Clinton's new forest 
policy. It includes grant money that could spur Northern California's economy 
as employment in the timber industry drops. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been complaints about the price on N.E.T. For $10 a month you get 
two hours of on-line time. After that the rate is $5 an hour. That is slightly 
higher than other, larger networks. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Goldberg said, "we've created the feeling of living in a small town . . . 
an electronic village with access to the world."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN GUN STANCE DRAWS NO 
NRA FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Now that Sen. Dianne Feinstein has taken on the nation's powerful gun lobby 
and helped win a cliffhanger decision to ban assault weapons, what is the 
National Rifle Assn. going to do about it? 
</P>
<P>
 "My only reaction is that you have to be realistic," said Terry O'Grady, 
spokesman for the NRA in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 State and national gun advocates said last week that their resources would 
probably be better spent elsewhere instead of trying to defeat a strong 
incumbent. Instead, they said, they may take aim at one of her leading 
Republican opponents, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was not a strong supporter of the ban, which he downplayed as a 
helpful but largely ineffective crime-fighting tool. But his vote in favor of 
it stuck out like a red cape to gun advocates because he was one of only two 
California Republicans to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, the repercussions are going to come down on Michael Huffington's 
head (instead of Feinstein)," said John Stoos, director of the Gun Owners of 
California. "He had the chance at a real defining issue there and he blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington dismissed the challenge, saying he is confident of winning the June 
7 Republican primary and does not believe his vote on assault weapons will hurt 
him in the general election. He also said it demonstrates his independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent all of the people in California. I don't represent the special 
interests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of gun ownership has seen dramatic shifts in the last two years 
as the public's fear of crime has changed the debate from a fight over 
constitutional rights to one about controlling violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage in November of the federal Brady bill, which requires a waiting 
period for handgun purchases, followed by the narrow House vote May 5 to ban 
assault weapons, was a stunning setback for a lobby that has been one of the 
most powerful in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, gun advocates also suffered a high-profile defeat last month 
when they were soundly rejected in an attempt to recall state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) for his role in passing the state's assault weapons ban 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling out there that somehow it takes a lot of courage to stand 
up for an assault weapons ban, and I think that was true in the past," said Bob 
Walker, legislative director for Handgun Control Inc. in Washington. "But 
people are discovering it is not only good policy to stand up for an assault 
weapons ban, but it is also good politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said he was not surprised that the NRA will probably stay out of 
Feinstein's reelection bid, because he predicted their involvement would 
backfire. "They would probably be doing her a favor . . . because it would only 
accent her leadership on this issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein would seem to be a primary target for pro-gun groups because she is 
a member of Handgun Control and was the leading sponsor of the assault weapons 
ban when it passed in the Senate, 56 to 43, in September. But this week, gun 
advocates in California and Washington said their response will be determined 
more by pragmatism than spite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as easy as it looks" to defeat Feinstein, O'Grady said. "And we are 
not going to waste money if there is no opportunity to have an impact. We are 
going to be here for a long time and there will be other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoos said the gun owners' analysis of Feinstein's reelection campaign might 
change if Huffington lost the Republican primary to his chief rival, William E. 
Dannemeyer, a former Orange County congressman and an opponent of the assault 
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Republicans give Huffington the best chance to win the primary because, 
with his personal fortune from a family oil company in Texas, he is expected to 
outspend his opponents at least 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoos and O'Grady said their organizations will evaluate the primary battle in 
the next few days to decide whether they should dedicate financial resources 
and manpower to oppose Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look to see if anybody else has a chance of winning the primary," 
O'Grady said. "Mr. Dannemeyer has been calling us and looking for our support. 
. . . We will probably decide (this) week." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said that even though he and Feinstein agree that the assault 
weapons ban is a good idea, he believes voters will see a sharp distinction 
between Feinstein and him on crime control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main way to slow down the slaughter is to lock up the people who are 
pulling the trigger," said Huffington, a co-sponsor of California's "three 
strikes" initiative. "That is the means by which I . . . hope to make a 
difference. Feinstein has put her capital on gun control." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who also supports the "three strikes" initiative, has told her 
backers at fund-raisers that she needs their help because her support for the 
assault weapons ban is likely to make her a prime target for the NRA. But she 
also said she is confident that most people agree with her position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't dismiss the National Rifle Assn.," she said recently. "But 
overwhelmingly, I believe the people of the state are supportive of the 
legislation."

ON CALIFORNIA: PUBLIC DEBATE AT THE LOWER ELEVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Letters to the editor of the Siskiyou County Daily News have been quite lively 
of late. For example, in correspondence published last Tuesday, county resident 
Bendan Butler unloaded a series of rather breathless disclosures about 
opponents of a proposal to place a prison at the foot of Mt. Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
 One anti-prison leader, Butler declared, "once claimed that she saw a flying 
saucer the size of Safeway land in Mt. Shasta." Another, he huffed, "used to be 
an attorney! No more need be said." And a physician fighting the prison, well, 
Butler's information was that this "so-called doctor" was in fact a 
radiologist, "using deadly illness to further his political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the paper published a rebuttal from the doctor in question. Kobi 
Leder compared Butler to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, suggested that the 
prison booster was "the one hallucinating, not us," and concluded with a 
caustic offer to "treat" his accuser to a "barium enema." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows," Leder advised Butler, "the catharsis just might help you think 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like a proposed maximum-security prison to drop public debate 
to the lowest levels. Typically, it takes a certain amount of economic 
desperation for a town even to want a prison in the first place. Just as 
typically, not everyone in that town -- or in the town just down the road -- 
will thrill to the prospect of living within the same ZIP code as Charles 
Manson or decommissioned gang soldiers from L.A. And so it has gone here, in 
Weed. 
</P>
<P>
 The town is named for Abner Weed, the logging tycoon who founded it on the 
eastern flank of Mt. Shasta. It had a good run as a company town. Decades of 
furious tree-cutting, however, pretty much depleted the forests, and recently 
the mills began to shut down. As people moved away and shops closed, leaders of 
Weed began hunting new industries. They invited something like 300 companies to 
move here -- and didn't get a single bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could get something glamorous," said Mayor Mel Borcalli. "A 
prison wasn't our first choice." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, though, Gov. Pete Wilson shared his grand new vision for 
California: prisons. Billions of dollars would be invested in new prisons. 
Anticipating a $50-million payroll and a stable employer, Weed invited the 
California Department of Corrections to place a prison here, and the CDC 
appeared eager to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Weed, enthusiasm for the prison was not shared throughout 
Siskiyou County. "If this prison was such a profitable deal," one Daily News 
letter writer argued, "Southern California would be wining and dining the CDC. 
. . . Most of the prisoners come from their area, not ours, so they are dumping 
it all on us." From nearby towns such as Mt. Shasta and Yreka came questions -- 
about maintaining a rural lifestyle, about the impact on the tourist trade and 
schools, about the general cut of prison visitors, and about the mountain. Mt. 
Shasta attracts a steady flow of fine-tuned souls who believe the shimmering 
mountain contains mystical qualities. The prison, it was said, might create a 
"negative energy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fight grows more bitter every day. In Weed, they consider their neighbors 
arrogant mystics, unsympathetic to a working-class town. Conversely, prison 
opponents see the advocates as misguided fools, mesmerized by false promises. 
One thing both sides agree upon is this: The dispute already has ripped apart 
friendships, neighborhoods, towns. And the battle is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Siskiyou supervisors last week passed up an opportunity to settle the matter 
with a simple board vote, deciding instead to hold a countywide "advisory" 
election in November. So proponents and opponents alike quickly began plotting 
full-bore campaigns. If they are slinging UFOs and enemas in May, imagine what 
October might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, an interesting facet of the conflict has been the absence of outside 
voices, of what might even be called leadership. Sacramento teems with 
politicians eager to build more prisons -- but not one has the political 
courage to suggest where. Similarly, most Californians seem to want to lock up 
more criminals for longer periods of time. Where? Somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, California has embarked on perhaps the biggest buildup of prisons 
ever -- without even attempting to form a consensus about where they should be 
placed. Instead, it's left to down-on-their-luck towns such as Weed to 
volunteer themselves for the duty. And left to their neighbors to challenge the 
wisdom of putting prisons near treasures like Mt. Shasta. They say up here that 
the mountain can be a source for inspiration. They will need it.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; 77TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; CONNOLLY USES POETRY TO DODGE 
SALVOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his official biography, first-term Assemblyman Tom Connolly (D-Lemon Grove) 
tells us he is devoted to the works of Robert Service, the bard of the Yukon. 
</P>
<P>
 These days Connolly is particularly drawn to Service's poem "The Quitter," 
about a sourdough who is lost in the woods, "scared as a child" and "sore as a 
boil" but continues "to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a good thing that the 48-year-old Vietnam veteran and criminal 
defense attorney finds succor in poesy. He has had enough political flak 
recently to send a weaker-willed pol running for the tall trees like one of 
Service's snow-mad gold miners blitzing into the Great Alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The salvos began with a lengthy front-page profile in the San Diego 
Union-Tribune detailing all the untidy aspects of Connolly's private life that 
had been largely missed by the media and his opposition when he won a surprise 
victory in a Republican district in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On the published list were three divorces, a cocaine habit that ruined his law 
practice in the 1980s, personal bankruptcy, a fight with the IRS over unpaid 
taxes and a history of being in arrears in child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 After the profile came stories about four former staff members alleging that 
Connolly subjected them to boorish and harassing statements about sexuality, 
including a continued reminder to women that an assemblyman's staffers "serve 
at the pleasure of the member." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came a document leaked to a radio talk show host showing that the San 
Diego Police Department vice squad had watched Connolly for six months in an 
unsuccessful effort to catch him trolling for prostitutes in his 
state-subsidized car with legislators' license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice squad officers say they are convinced that Connolly was seeking sex 
when he was spotted five times "cruising" along the city's most notorious 
hooker hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping his week in media hell was an editorial in the Union-Tribune branding 
Connolly a hypocrite for calling himself a "children's advocate" on the ballot 
in 1992 despite being behind in child support payments. The paper endorsed his 
Republican opponent in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly denies all wrongdoing and predicts reelection in November. "I've been 
through worse than this," he said. "My whole life has been a quest for 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Rules Committee staff will look at the harassment allegations and 
then forward a recommendation to the committee, which is controlled by Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Punishment could range from a scolding to 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 One allegation forwarded to the Rules Committee staff is that Connolly made 
references to Brown's sexual stamina. Connolly, who met with Brown last week, 
denied making any such statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the other statements were made innocently while discussing AIDS 
legislation and how AIDS has changed sexual mores. 
</P>
<P>
 His overarching defense is that the harassment allegations were trumped up 
after he moved to fire the director of his Lemon Grove office for using the 
office to help congressman-turned-consultant Jim Bates, who was dumped by 
voters in 1990 after being snared in a sex harassment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly found the profile story possibly beneficial because it showed voters 
how far he had fallen before kicking his cocaine habit and rebounding to win 
the '92 race. He says he is current with his child support and is fulfilling an 
IRS schedule for paying $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that the police lieutenant who authorized the vice squad surveillance 
twice ran for the state Legislature and has ideological links, through the 
Christian Right movement, to Steve Baldwin, the Republican who lost to Connolly 
in 1992 and is making another try this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said: "Regarding non-payment of taxes, child support and soliciting 
prostitutes, I'll let the voters decide on these character and integrity 
issues." He called the harassment allegations "serious and troubling." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly insists that he was on El Cajon Boulevard, a prostitutes' hangout, 
because his wife works at a vitamin store there and a key political supporter 
lives nearby. He says he had first come to the officers' attention by 
intervening in their street-corner interrogation of a prostitute who was eight 
months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 A talk show host demanded to know why he was so concerned about a prostitute. 
Connolly replied that while others might have seen only a prostitute, he saw a 
woman in distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The same world view is found in Service's "My Madonna," which says: "I haled 
me a woman from the street/ Shameless, but oh so fair . . . I hid all trace of 
her heart unclean/ I painted a babe at her breast."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked later about the similarity between his answer and the poem, Connolly 
reeled off four quatrains and added: "My whole belief in people is contained in 
'My Madonna.' "

COURTS GAG MEDIA AT SENSATIONAL CANADA TRIAL; JUSTICE: THE FACTS IN THE MURDER, 
KIDNAPING AND ASSAULT CASE WILL EVENTUALLY COME OUT. CITIZENS RELY ON U.S. TV, 
SMUGGLED PAPERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Even on a continent numbed by the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer and Night Stalker 
Richard Ramirez, the story unfolding at the trial here of Paul Bernardo, a 
boyish, 29-year-old bookkeeper, is striking in its depravity. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, there was his alleged accomplice, then-wife Karla Homolka, 23, 
who prosecutors say assisted Bernardo in kidnaping, molesting and killing 
teen-age girls. In a controversial plea bargain struck last summer, Homolka was 
convicted of two counts of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
She could be out on parole in as little as four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is expected to be the crucial prosecution witness against her 
ex-husband. Bernardo has pleaded not guilty to nine counts, including murder, 
sexual assault and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the mysterious death of Homolka's 15-year-old sister, Tammy, on 
Christmas Eve, 1990. Authorities initially wrote it off as an accident but 
exhumed the body for re-examination after Bernardo's 1993 arrest. After more 
than a year of silence about what they found, prosecutors last Tuesday charged 
Bernardo with manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault in Tammy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may be most startling about this case, at least to Americans, is the 
secrecy enshrouding it. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a year, Canadian reporters have been prohibited from reporting all 
that they know -- including the details of Homolka's confession and what 
authorities now believe really happened to Tammy. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts have enforced the publication ban under Canadian laws protecting an 
accused's right to a jury untainted by pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ban -- or, more properly, delay, because the material will be made 
public at some point -- is far from unprecedented here, it has stirred debate 
and even defiance. And it has heightened public interest in the case even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have been accused of using the prohibition to screen themselves 
from criticism over their deal with Homolka. 
</P>
<P>
 The proximity of St. Catharines to the United States -- it is just a few miles 
from Niagara Falls, N.Y. -- has complicated the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. media have reported far more complete accounts of the evidence than 
have been published here. And while U.S. newspapers and broadcasts are beyond 
the reach of Canadian courts, in an era of satellite television, computer 
modems and fax machines they are well within the grasp of Canadians. Some U.S. 
reports have leaked north, illustrating how hard it can be for Canada to 
protect its laws and traditions from U.S. encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
 The order has also divided Canadian journalists, who for the most part have 
observed the ban but disagree on its merits. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Toronto newspapers and the Canadian Broadcasting Co. have appealed 
the order and await a ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main argument is that when you're talking about prejudicing a jury, you 
need to balance that with the public's right to know about what happened at her 
trial," said Toronto attorney Peter Jacobsen, who represented Thomson 
Newspapers before the appeals court. "Jurors can perform their tasks no matter 
what they've seen or heard beforehand, as the courts say they do in other 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mandel, a law professor at York University in Toronto, said bans "take 
jurors for such morons that they can't tell the difference between evidence 
heard at trial and what appears in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But Catherine Ford, associate editor of the Calgary Herald, believes along 
with many other Canadian journalists that publication bans are acceptable in 
some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a hierarchy of rights, and the right of the accused to a fair trial 
has to come first over the public's right to know every detail of what happened 
whenever they want to hear it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed "The Ken and Barbie Killers" by the tabloids for their blond good 
looks, Bernardo and Homolka met while she was still in high school in this city 
of 120,000 on Lake Ontario. He was an accountant trainee in suburban Toronto, 
where women at the time were being terrorized by a serial rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were married June 29, 1991, and the ceremony was dedicated to the 
memory of Tammy. On the same day, the dismembered body of 14-year-old Leslie 
Mahaffy, encased in concrete, was pulled from a reservoir south of town. It was 
later determined that she had been sexually assaulted and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months later, 15-year-old Kristen French was abducted while walking home 
from school. Her body was discovered in a ditch two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police concluded that she had been held captive and sexually assaulted until 
shortly before her body was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from several jurisdictions joined in a hunt for the killer or 
killers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they made little apparent progress until January, 1993, when officers were 
summoned to hear a domestic violence complaint by Karla Homolka Bernardo. She 
told them that her husband had struck her with a flashlight, but she didn't 
stop with that. After listening to Homolka, investigators arrested Bernardo as 
the suspect in the murders of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until May, 1993, however, after protracted negotiations between 
Homolka's lawyer and the Ontario attorney general's office, that Bernardo was 
formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
 His trial began here May 4 and is expected to last up to a year, with no jury 
selection until this fall. Procedural arguments are expected until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have brought two additional indictments against Bernardo, one in 
Tammy's death and two additional sexual assaults and another for 28 unrelated 
sexual attacks in the Toronto area. Toronto police questioned Homolka earlier 
this month about two other unsolved murders of teen-age girls but did not 
disclose what they learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Homolka was convicted of two counts of manslaughter in a brief trial last 
summer that resulted in the publication ban, which, in an unexpected twist, was 
sought by the prosecution and opposed by Bernardo's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 5, Judge Francis Kovacs excluded the general public from the courtroom 
where Homolka entered her plea. 
</P>
<P>
 He permitted Canadian journalists to remain but prohibited them from reporting 
what they heard. Saying he could not control what American reporters would 
write, Kovacs also ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed behind closed doors was a 27-minute recitation of the evidence 
against Homolka, as agreed to by the defense. The account was so gruesome even 
veteran police officers and crime reporters were visibly shaken, according to 
some of those present. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian news reports were sketchy, but the ban whetted U.S. journalistic 
appetites. Before Kovacs imposed the publication ban, only a handful of U.S. 
newspapers and television stations from nearby Buffalo had followed the case. 
Afterward, television -- including CNN and the tabloid show "A Current Affair" 
-- and Newsweek, among others, pursued the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The most detailed account appeared last November in the Washington Post, 
written by Toronto-based correspondent Anne Swardson. Based on "interviews with 
people knowledgeable about what was said in the courtroom, and on press 
reports," the account disclosed that the evidence read at Homolka's trial 
included the information that she had drugged her sister with an animal 
tranquilizer and joined with Bernardo in a sexual assault on the girl while she 
was unconscious. Tammy Homolka started vomiting afterward and choked to death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. coverage of the case reached Canada despite extraordinary efforts by 
authorities to stop it. When the Post story was reprinted in the Buffalo News, 
Canadian border inspectors seized hundreds of copies that Canadians sought to 
bring home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable television systems in Toronto routinely black out portions of U.S. 
newscasts on the case. But the story was relayed by computer bulletin boards 
and on-line services, transmitted by fax machines and passed along by mail and 
word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this peculiar atmosphere, Nick Pron, a Toronto Star reporter who was 
present in the courtroom when the evidence was read, found himself wondering 
whether some of the readers who called the Star newsroom unsuccessfully pumping 
him for banned information actually were police officers on a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 And a retired Canadian police officer named Gordon Domm embarked on a campaign 
of civil disobedience. Domm has been arrested three times for distributing U.S. 
or British press reports that include banned information. He was charged with 
contempt of court in one of the instances, and a trial is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Domm, a self-styled agitator for tougher criminal sentences, dismisses 
assertions that the ban is intended to preserve Bernardo's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real reason is to cover up the severity of the crime to prevent public 
outcry over the light sentence" given Homolka, Domm asserted in an interview. 
"Doesn't the public have a right to know so it can judge whether justice was 
done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among the unanswered questions: How important is Homolka's testimony to the 
prosecution? Was she a battered wife, forced into these acts by her husband, or 
could she have been a willing participant? Why was she not charged in Tammy's 
death? 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the ban contend that at some point -- following Bernardo's 
trial, or perhaps when a jury is selected -- the prohibition will be lifted, 
and the press and public will have access to all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how often Canadian courts impose publication restrictions is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no statistics on this," said Robert Martin, law professor at the 
University of Western Ontario. "One of the problems of doing any research of 
criminal justice in Canada is the appalling state of criminal statistics here. 
. . . There are no clear definitions and no clear numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also points out that it is often difficult to judge whether a 
publication ban is necessary, because once one is imposed, the general public 
has no immediate access to much of the evidence on which it was based.

THOUSANDS EVACUATED AFTER RUSSIAN BOMB DEPOT BLAST

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bomb storage depot belonging to Russia's Pacific Fleet exploded Saturday, 
forcing the evacuation of thousands of nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian news reports said there were no chemical or nuclear weapons in the 
depot, used by the fleet's air wing, about 60 miles northeast of Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
 But the afternoon blast was so powerful that it shook the earth 60 miles away. 
Several people were injured by flying glass when windows shattered in the 
nearby village of Novonezhino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interfax news agency said several fires were ignited in a nearby forest. 
</P>
<P>
 A train was pressed into service as rescue units began evacuating 
Novonezhino's 3,000 residents to a nearby town. News reports said authorities 
had cordoned off an 18-mile area around the depot.

 Carlos Catalan's run-in with the Guatemalan army began as a traffic 
altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving his bus along a steep road 40 miles outside this capital, he 
encountered a Nissan utility vehicle, but neither motorist would let the other 
pass. It was the kind of traffic macho that is common on Central American 
streets. But when the driver of the Nissan lowered a tinted window and began 
shooting at the bus, Catalan's nightmare began.

<P>
 Fearing for the safety of his 60 passengers, Catalan sped away until he 
reached a police post, where he expected to report the incident. But the other 
driver turned out to be an army intelligence officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the days that followed, Catalan said, he was beaten, followed, snatched 
from a hospital at gunpoint and threatened with death if he tried to file 
charges or speak publicly about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The beating and kicking that Catalan says he received from the well-placed 
army colonel caused him to lose a testicle, and his family has fled the 
country. Catalan now lives a frightened life, taking refuge at a Roman Catholic 
church while his case goes through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They destroyed my life in a way you cannot imagine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalan's story is one of dozens of cases that human rights activists are 
pressing in an effort to challenge what they describe as the continued power 
and impunity of the Guatemalan military. Despite changes in the command of a 
notoriously brutal army, and an end to the kinds of army-directed massacres 
that decimated Mayan communities in the 1980s, murder, torture and 
disappearances by government security forces continue, human rights and church 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 With one of the most abysmal human rights records in the Western Hemisphere, 
Guatemala has finally agreed to allow the permanent presence of an 
international monitoring team from the United Nations. The decision was hailed 
as a major breakthrough in Guatemala's efforts to end a 33-year civil war that 
has claimed about 100,000 lives. Human rights verification had been a key 
stumbling block in reaching a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the mission begins, there are signs its mandate will be 
limited by unrest and government resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent wave of anti-foreigner violence, in which North Americans were 
accused of stealing Guatemalan children and two U.S. citizens were beaten by 
enraged crowds, is being seen in some circles as a warning to the U.N. mission, 
which is scheduled to arrive this month. U.N. officials say privately that they 
are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 And government and army officials seem determined to restrict the work of the 
U.N. monitors by requiring them to turn over any investigation to existing 
Guatemalan institutions, such as the police. Some of these institutions are 
already discredited because of their routine failure to solve cases or 
prosecute abusers who are members of security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. human rights mission was authorized in a landmark agreement signed 
March 29 in Mexico City by the government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
and guerrillas of the leftist Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union. With 
this new push to end the war, the two sides also agreed to discuss the 
formation of a crucial but controversial commission to examine the past 
massacres and atrocities of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrilla spokesmen said they are confident the commission will be established 
in the next round of peace talks in Norway later this month. But the army hates 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officers warn against a commission similar to the U.N.-sponsored "Truth 
Commission" that was formed as part of peace accords that ended neighboring El 
Salvador's 12-year civil war. The Salvadoran panel named names and implicated 
government security forces or their right-wing backers in most of the war's 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan church and human rights groups argue that the commission is vital 
to building peace on a foundation of justice that clarifies who killed whom and 
what exactly happened to about 40,000 missing union, student and peasant 
leaders. The criminals, they argue, should be held accountable. Army officers, 
accused of many of the crimes, do not agree, saying the past should be 
relegated to the past. And they contend that the guerrillas would be unfairly 
spared scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were up to me, the commission would not exist," the defense minister, 
Gen. Mario Enriquez, told The Times. "It will not reconcile. It will only 
polarize." 
</P>
<P>
 Such resistance could doom the panel to failure. President De Leon, himself a 
former human rights ombudsman, wants the commission to report on war crimes 
without including the names of murderers and torturers, nor the institution to 
which they belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Rosada, the government's representative to negotiations with the rebels 
and army, said that if the commission probes more deeply, if it follows the 
Salvadoran example, the entire peace process would be torpedoed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to provoke vengeance," he said in an interview in the 
presidential palace here. "We want to put the emphasis on the victims, not on 
those who made them victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics doubt that such a limited evaluation of war crimes will satisfy 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do not name people, there will be resentment and anger," said Nineth 
Montenegro, a human rights activist whose husband was among the tens of 
thousands of people who disappeared in the 1980s. "We are not asking for 
(public) trials, but there should be a moral judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the U.N. monitors is especially welcomed by those who argue 
that Guatemala's human rights situation has not improved under De Leon and may 
have actually deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon's surprise election by the National Congress last June ended a 
dizzying series of coups and countercoups. His background as a human rights 
prosecutor raised high hopes of sweeping reform, but many Guatemalans today say 
they are disappointed. He failed to disband army-backed Civilian Self-Defense 
Patrols, armed peasant vigilantes blamed for widespread abuses. Their 
elimination has been recommended by human rights advocates the world over -- 
including De Leon himself before he was president. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon made progress early in his administration by starting to remove the 
military influence from the national police. But this year, civilians he had 
named to key posts were replaced by military hard-liners or extreme rightists. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Roman Catholic archbishop's office on human rights, the 
number of reported summary executions, disappearances and other violations grew 
at an "alarming" rate after De Leon took office. Extrajudicial executions, for 
example, jumped from four in June to 27 in July and 50 in January, the church 
office said in a 468-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been many steps backward with respect to human rights," said 
Fernando Lopez, legal director of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The reported violations come amid a wider escalation of violence in Guatemala. 
In addition to the attacks on foreigners, which prompted a U.S. State 
Department warning against travel here, kidnapings, killings, unending 
public-service strikes, demonstrations and sit-ins -- plus renewed rumors of a 
military takeover -- have contributed to a climate of tension and instability. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the single most shocking incident was the April 1 slaying of 
Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of Guatemala's Constitutional Court, the 
highest court in the land and possibly the country's last public institution 
with credibility. Several days later, Obdulio Chinchilla Vega, the most 
powerful and reputedly most corrupt member of the Guatemala's unicameral 
National Congress, was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt -- the 
second in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas, whose war against the Guatemalan army has dropped off 
considerably in recent years, have also been accused of human rights 
violations, such as forced recruitment of child soldiers and the use of peasant 
villagers as shields in the remote Peten and Quiche regions.

MUSLIMS GAIN GROUND FROM BOSNIAN SERBS

<P>
 Fighting between Muslim and Serbian forces around the northern Bosnian Muslim 
enclave of Tuzla is intensifying, and Muslim troops have gained ground, U.N. 
sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeeping spokesman Capt. Jens Kirk reported "rather hectic" tank and 
artillery duels around Vares on Friday that forced U.N. military observers to 
take shelter five times in as many hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuzla, a U.N. source said Muslim fighters had captured a strategic hill 
near Ribnica on Wednesday. The hill is the highest in the Mt. Ozren range, and 
its capture was an unusual success for the Muslims, who can rarely match 
Serbian firepower.

RESURGENT VIOLENCE KILLS 12 S. AFRICANS

 Assailants burst into a house in a black township and opened fire, killing 12 
people, in a shocking return of political violence that had virtually 
disappeared during last month's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings occurred Friday night in the violence-racked township of Thokoza. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims ranged in age from 13 to 25 and were staying in an abandoned 
house, police Capt. Janine Smith said. Ten bodies were found inside the house 
and two were outside amid spent cartridges from AK-47 assault rifles. The 
identities or political affiliations of the victims were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 But the house where the attack occurred is near a workers' hostel dominated by 
Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. Most area residents support the 
African National Congress.

HAITI STRONGMAN SAYS U.S. PANEL -- BUT NOT TROOPS -- IS WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haiti's military chief would welcome a proposed U.S. fact-finding commission 
but says military invaders would meet strong popular resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense of the country does not come only from the armed forces. The 
American troops would have in front of them a people," Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
said in an interview broadcast Saturday on CNN's "Evans & Novak." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras, a leader of forces that overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide in 1991, tacitly endorsed a proposal by Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) for a commission to help set a new U.S. policy on Haiti. Dole and 
other members of Congress have raised doubts about Clinton Administration 
efforts to return Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton wants to force Cedras and other coup leaders out of power 
with a worldwide trade embargo, though he has said military action remains an 
option. Some members of Congress have urged Clinton to invade. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing Dole's idea, Cedras said, "What we hope is that finally, for once, 
somebody may come here and understand the Haitian problem, not come with 
preconceived ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras was interviewed last week during commentator Robert Novak's trip to 
Haiti. He spoke through an English translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole on Friday reiterated his proposal in a Senate speech in which he warned 
against an invasion of Haiti to restore Aristide to power, calling instead for 
a bipartisan fact-finding commission whose recommendations could form the basis 
of a new Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras also said he hopes former Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), whom 
Clinton recently appointed as a special envoy for the Haitian crisis, would 
"come in a spirit of justice, in an open spirit, to understand the Haitian 
problem and to understand that truth is not really what is being said." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras denied that refugees who flee and are returned by the United States are 
subject to military abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a 16-member soccer team that recently failed to gain political asylum 
during a trip abroad is now back home playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras asserted that tougher U.N. sanctions to be imposed May 21 if he and 
other military leaders do not step down and allow Aristide's return will only 
cause more suffering. Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, was elected 
with a strong vote by Haiti's poor and has lived in exile since his September, 
1991, ouster.

GAZANS HAIL PLO OFFICERS AT BIRTHPLACE OF INTIFADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crowds of jubilant Palestinians streamed into Jabaliya's police station 
Saturday after Israeli soldiers left in darkness from the teeming refugee camp 
where the intifada began. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some, limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's Jericho 
area was insufficient reward for more than six years of sacrifice during the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli troops turned over three installations in Jabaliya to about 100 
Palestinian officers just before dawn Saturday. Another 220 Palestinian 
officers took up positions in Gaza City, where Israeli soldiers remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jabaliya withdrawal appeared to be several days ahead of schedule. Israel 
finished pulling out of the southern Gaza Strip on Friday and was to hand over 
the rest by Wednesday. About 1,800 Palestinian officers are in the strip, 
Israeli Army Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, which Palestinians took over Friday, the first full day of 
self-rule exposed the daunting tasks facing Palestinian authorities -- from 
ill-equipped post offices to border patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police detained an officer who gave his loaded Kalashnikov assault 
rifle to a 6-year-old boy, who then accidentally shot and killed his 
12-year-old brother and wounded two others Friday. Police commanders had 
ordered officers showing their weapons to civilians to first unload them. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, whose name was not released, is being investigated. PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat has demanded his court-martial, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio said a joint Palestinian-Israel patrol apprehended 10 Israelis 
from the banned extremist movement Kach who entered Jericho against Israeli 
army orders. The group left without violence, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaza and Jericho withdrawals were arranged under an accord signed by 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 11 days ago in Cairo. Israeli 
soldiers left Jabaliya as they did the rest of the strip: while most residents 
slept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very low key, no ceremonies, nothing," Palestinian police officer 
Shafiq Khalil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's last commander in Jabaliya, whose name was given only as Lt. Tomer, 
told Israel Radio that the withdrawal from the town was an important symbol. 
"The intifada started in Jabaliya, and it will end here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As word spread that the Israelis had left, hundreds of Palestinians streamed 
to the new police station in Jabaliya's central square, hugging officers and 
chanting slogans of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy because there's peace, and because the Jews have finally 
left," Amina abu Nader said. 
</P>
<P>
 The square was filled with joyous graffiti and makeshift signs put up by the 
police. "We beg you not to destroy police property," one officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival atmosphere was a far cry from the street battles that have 
characterized Jabaliya since riots broke out there in December, 1987, and 
escalated into the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of 100,000, which includes a refugee camp that is among the poorest 
in the squalid strip, became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation. 
Some residents are still bitter over the years of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not worth the risks we took," said Ismail Salama, 40, an unemployed 
construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Israeli soldiers will still guard settlers in a 10-mile bloc of Gaza 
along the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued presence of about 5,000 Jewish settlers among Gaza's 750,000 
Palestinians has been criticized as a dangerous error in the peace agreement 
that turns over most of the strip and Jericho to Palestinian self-rule.

CLINTON CALLS FOR UNITY WHERE RFK ONCE INVOKED IT; MEMORIAL: PRESIDENT HELPS 
DEDICATE 'LANDMARK FOR PEACE,' WHERE ROBERT KENNEDY GAVE STIRRING SPEECH ON 
NIGHT OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, flanked by oversized photos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
and Robert F. Kennedy, implored the nation Saturday to heed the message of his 
heroes by forswearing violence and working "to pull this country together." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke at the dedication of a memorial to King and Kennedy at the 
corner of 17th and Broadway, where Kennedy gave a memorable speech that quieted 
a distraught crowd on the night of King's murder in Tennessee 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis memorial, named "A Landmark for Peace," will be built from 
melted-down guns seized by police or voluntarily exchanged for tickets in a 
program sponsored by the Indiana Pacers basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, attended by Kennedy's widow, Ethel, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) and King's two sons, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, was 
abbreviated by a sudden downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending was Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who was in the state 
to deliver a speech at the University of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said Clinton had planned to deliver more extensive remarks about 
violence, community and individual responsibility, but he spoke for only six 
minutes on the general themes of unity and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he had recently read about a crime-ridden neighborhood in 
Washington that had built a tall fence and hired security guards to keep gunmen 
and drug dealers out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it freedom in the '90s when we have to put up walls between our own people 
even as we celebrate the walls coming down from Berlin to South Africa?" 
Clinton asked. "Is that our freedom? Are we going to live in a time when all of 
our political dialogue becomes a shouting match?" 
</P>
<P>
 He said those who preach hate get talk shows. "If you preach love, you'll get 
a yawn," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial commemorates King's assassination in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 
1968, and Kennedy's words to a crowd that was ready to erupt in riot, as angry 
mobs across the nation did following the civil rights leader's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, ignoring the advice of police and aides who said it was too dangerous 
to venture into a black neighborhood, stood on the street corner and announced 
the news of King's death to the gasps of the stunned crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United 
States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or 
lawlessness," Kennedy said, "but love and wisdom and compassion toward one 
another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our 
country, whether they be white or they be black." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking without notes, Kennedy then quoted the Greek poet and playwright 
Aeschylus in words that are now engraved at Kennedy's grave site at Arlington 
National Cemetery: "In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop 
upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom 
through the awful grace of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Saturday, Clinton spoke to a Democratic Governors' Assn. luncheon, at 
which he decried the "shrill, uncivil and diversionary rhetoric" that has 
replaced reasoned discourse in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He recounted his Administration's legislative accomplishments, saying that 
most had been enacted despite fierce partisan opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in perhaps a veiled reference to the scrutiny he has been under over 
his finances and personal behavior, Clinton said: "Ultimately we cannot prevail 
unless there is a new spirit among the American people, a new determination to 
change the way we evaluate politics and politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Kennedy/King event, Clinton met privately for about 15 minutes with 
Prime Minister Reynolds and Dermot Gallagher, Ireland's ambassador to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House aide said Reynolds briefed Clinton on progress toward a peace 
agreement for Northern Ireland. "The President commended him for his good works 
and expressed the hope that this will work to some resolution," said White 
House Communications Director Mark D. Gearan. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting came one day after Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish 
Republican Army, breathed new life into the peace initiative by communicating 
with Britain's Northern Ireland Office in Belfast, an indication the talks have 
not stalled.

GACY ARTWORK TO GO UP IN SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A businessman spent about $20,000 to buy up many of executed serial killer 
John Wayne Gacy's artworks, and he plans to get a return on his investment by 
burning them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them wiped off the map," said Joe Roth, who bought more than two 
dozen of the 40 Gacy works at an auction Saturday."It's too bad we couldn't 
have wiped them all off the map." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old owner of a truck parts business said he wants to make a point 
by burning the paintings created by the man convicted in 1980 of killing 33 
boys and young men during the 1970s. Gacy was executed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction attracted about 200 potential buyers, and some pieces sold for as 
high as $800, auctioneer James Quick said. Included were some of Gacy's most 
noted renditions -- Elvis Presley, Jesus and clowns named Pogo, Patches, Skull 
and Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said he was fed up with coverage of the execution because it did not send 
strong enough messages to parents. "We're going to burn all the pictures and 
try to get the attention of parents to watch their kids so this never happens 
again," he said. "Young people have to be watched -- so there's never another 
Gacy."

POLICE CALL BURGLARY SUSPECT A 1-MAN CAMPSITE CRIME WAVE

<P>
 Police say that Harold Huddleston has been roaming the West for decades, 
robbing sleeping campers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they've got him and, they say, the loot to tie him to the crimes -- six 
pickup truckloads' worth: 10,000 compact discs, 5,000 knapsacks, dozens of 
fishing poles, sleeping bags, coolers, sunglasses, jewelry, a chain saw, and 
five $400 tickets to Barbra Streisand concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddleston, 51, was arrested on burglary charges last week after raids on his 
suburban Portland, Ore., apartment and storage locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is a genuine career criminal, a sociopath with a true criminal 
mind," said Kelly C. Carroll, Huddleston's probation officer in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddleston's wife, Pamela, said her husband has a legitimate business dealing 
in used CDs. "They're dreaming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddleston has eight convictions on burglary, drug and stolen property charges 
dating back to 1963. He served prison sentences in Oregon, California, Oklahoma 
and Utah for preying on campers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was serving a 10-year burglary sentence when he was paroled in 1991. Since 
then, authorities in California alone have linked him to 1,200 car break-ins 
and losses of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddleston is accused of breaking into cars parked at campgrounds as the 
owners slept in nearby tents. Police say he used a wire tool he kept stuffed 
down the back of his jacket to pry up car roofs and crank down windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers confronted him several times, but Huddleston always talked his way out 
of trouble, Portland Police Sgt. David Lerwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities got a break when one of his neighbors, a police officer, noticed 
that Huddleston's odometer showed he routinely made weekend trips of about 
3,000 miles. The officer alerted California officials who were investigating 
the burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers searching Huddleston's apartment shouted with joy when they 
discovered marked items they had planted in a car at a campground, Lerwick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they must catalogue every one of the estimated 50,000 items they found, 
Lerwick said. "It's a monumental task."

NATION IN BRIEF; WASHINGTON; POWELL URGES BLACKS TO REJECT ALL BIGOTRY

 Delivering a commencement address before nearly 20,000 people at Howard 
University, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell urged fellow American blacks to reject 
all forms of bigotry, including anti-Semitism. "African Americans have come too 
far, and have too far yet to go to take a detour into the swamp of hatred," 
said the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is frequently 
mentioned as a potential presidential candidate.Powell waded into the 
controversy involving charges of reverse racism and anti-Semitism at the 
predominantly black campus in Washington. He did not mention Khalid Abdul 
Muhammad of the Nation of Islam, who delivered a speech at Howard denouncing 
Jews. But Powell said students have an obligation to "make informed, educated 
judgments about what you hear and accept the burden to sort out wisdom from 
foolishness."

PACKWOOD PREDICTS HEALTH CARE MANDATE WON'T PASS CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key Republican senator said Saturday that a crucial part of President 
Clinton's health care reform plan requiring employers to pay most of their 
workers' health insurance will not pass Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support mandates, but I am afraid the mandate is dead," Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.) told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton had proposed the so-called employer mandate as a way to 
provide health care benefits for the 39 million Americans who lack insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton proposed that employers pay 80% of the cost while workers pay the 
rest, but the mandate issue has run into stiff opposition from small business. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers have suggested requiring individuals to buy health insurance, 
but Packwood said that proposal does not have enough support in Congress to be 
enacted either. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Finance Committee, talked to 
reporters after speaking about health care reform behind closed doors to the 
Business Council, an elite group of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, who also met with the executives this weekend, said 
they are optimistic that health care legislation will pass Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be very late in the session, but there will be legislation," Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said.

RITES HELD FOR WOMAN KILLED IN STOLEN NAME PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends and family of Stella Sproule grieved at her funeral Saturday and shook 
their heads in disbelief, reflecting on a world where a person could be used 
and tossed aside with such ease by another. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 mourners packed the church where Sproule was a faithful and involved 
member. Meanwhile, the woman accused of plotting Sproule's death and trying to 
assume her identity remained in a Mississippi jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wittacker, one of the mourners, described how Sproule went to meet Annie 
Cole, a former co-worker, with a resume by her side, sure that she was going to 
finally get a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so nice she didn't know what she was getting into," Wittacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they agree. They say that Cole, 32, asked to meet Sproule during 
her lunch hour to give her a job application. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, police say, Cole had promised a nephew and one of his friends 
$5,000 each to abduct and kill Sproule. When Sproule's body was found May 3, 
police say, Annie Cole went to the scene, identified herself as "Betty Cole" 
and said the victim was her sister -- Annie Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty Cole" then told a Detroit funeral home operator that she wanted her 
sister's body cremated, with no service and without visitation by the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the body was to have been cremated, police suspected that 
"Betty Cole" did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 They proved it when Annie Cole's brother looked at Sproule's body and said it 
did not look like his sister, and when a department store reported that a woman 
was using a credit card issued in the name of Stella Sproule -- whose relatives 
had reported her missing by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who police said was seeking to escape a criminal past including 
bad-check charges and a parole violation, was arrested Tuesday in Indianola, 
Miss., where she had fled to stay with relatives. She said she will not fight 
extradition to Michigan to face a felony murder charge, officials said. The 
teen-agers were arraigned Thursday on murder and armed robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Police Sgt. Christopher Buck said Saturday that he did not expect Cole 
to appear for an extradition hearing until at least Monday.

GIS SLAIN IN SOMALIA TO GET MEDAL OF HONOR; MILITARY: CLINTON WILL AWARD THE 
FIRST SUCH DECORATION SINCE VIETNAM WAR TO TWO WHO WENT TO THE AID OF DOWNED 
PILOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton will award the Medal of Honor to two Army Rangers who were 
killed in last October's ill-fated raid in Somalia -- the first such decoration 
to be conferred since the Vietnam War, the White House announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The medals will go to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon of Lincoln, Me., and 
Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart of Newville, Pa. The two men died trying to 
rescue crew members of two Army helicopters that were shot down in an attempt 
to capture Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, who was a fugitive at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The citation, made public by the White House, said Gordon and Shughart fought 
their way through intensifying rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades to 
rescue an injured pilot, providing him with protective cover until they were 
almost out of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 After Shughart was killed, Gordon recovered another rifle from the crash site 
and gave it to the injured aviator -- along with the last five rounds of 
ammunition. He then continued to fight, armed only with a pistol, until he 
himself was shot. The pilot was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has come under criticism over the way the raid was 
conducted. Eighteen U.S. servicemen died in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged that the deaths were unnecessary and that the raid would 
have resulted in fewer casualties if then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin had 
not turned down an earlier request from field commanders for more tanks and 
armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing last Thursday, the two Army generals who supervised the raid also 
said they asked the Pentagon to send another AC-130H "Spectre" gunship to help 
cover the Ranger assault teams, but the request was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met privately with the families of some of the dead Rangers on 
Thursday and reportedly told them he was surprised and angry that subordinates 
had ordered the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The medals, which will be presented in a ceremony at the White House on May 
23, will be received by Carmen R. Gordon and Stephanie A. Shughart, the widows 
of the two slain soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration, is awarded for 
extraordinary gallantry in combat.

 Fellow officers arrested two policemen in New Orleans for allegedly robbing 
six people while on duty, stealing at least $1,475 and kidnaping one victim. 
Bruce Douglas and Fred Russell were suspended after they were charged with six 
counts of armed robbery and official malfeasance, one count of kidnaping and 
one count of possessing stolen property. Police began investigating in December 
because of complaints that the officers stopped people and took money while on 
duty, Lt. Sam Fradella said.

NORTH KOREA REPLACING NUCLEAR FUEL RODS AT REACTOR, DEFYING U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea has begun replacing fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor 
without international inspectors present, in a direct slap at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency had demanded that it be present at 
the refueling to determine whether North Korea had extracted plutonium, which 
can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons, from the spent fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea had agreed to let agency officials watch the fuel replacement, and 
a team of inspectors was scheduled to be sent to North Korea this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, 
said Saturday that the refueling had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea denies that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons, but it has 
refused to cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Without taking samples of the freshly removed spent fuel, it will be virtually 
impossible to tell whether North Korea has diverted significant amounts of 
plutonium, the nuclear watchdog agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has received no information that North Korea had begun unloading 
the fuel rods, spokesman David Kyd said Saturday. He said the move would be a 
very serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials have known North Korea would need to replace the spent fuel 
in the coming months, but said there was no reason the refueling could not wait 
until an agreement on sampling was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear agency had insisted on being allowed to take samples of the spent 
fuel to determine whether the fuel rods were the first to be used in the 
reactor, as North Korea claims, or whether earlier rods had already been 
removed and plutonium extracted from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Central News Agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry 
official as saying the agency's request was unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove seals and start 
taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the process could not be stopped because that "may cause a new 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the rods would be removed in full view of the agency's 
cameras. The agency has said that is inadequate.

77 WILD HORSES, BURROS OFFERED FOR ADOPTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wild horses could -- and did -- drag admirers to a Vallejo fairgrounds 
Saturday as federal officials offered 77 mustangs and burros for adoption 
during a special weekend program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Land Management began capturing the wild animals and putting 
them up for adoption in 1973. Since then, more than 140,000 burros and horses 
have been taken in nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 By limiting herd sizes, the program prevents death by starvation. It also 
furthers an ecological balance in the wilds. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse can be adopted for $125, a burro for $75. Fifty-nine animals were gone 
by 5 p.m. Friday, according to bureau spokeswoman Laura Harris.

BLOOMING PASTIME; ROSE LOVERS ARE IN THEIR GLORY THIS TIME OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every spring, members of the Ventura County Rose Society quietly huddle by 
their prized rosebushes and await the onset of an ancient biological ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For this is the time when their prized roses enter their peak blooming season 
and explode with color and fragrance -- something the plants do simply to 
perpetuate their species, but something that society members see as cause for 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the peak of the season -- I've already had one very good bloom in my 
garden," said Bob Livesay, 69, of Westlake, a retired petroleum engineer and 
the society's treasurer. "It's this time of year that makes it all worthwhile. 
I like the fact that I can get up in the morning and look out my window and see 
such beauty. It makes my day." 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-member society has members spread the length and breadth of Ventura 
County and into Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, said Ojai resident Tee 
Bower, the society's president. 
</P>
<P>
 An affiliate of the American Rose Society, the society is home to a diverse 
group from all walks of life and economic strata. The group holds monthly 
meetings, pruning demonstrations and at least one field trip or other activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The society also produces a monthly newsletter, "The Ventura Rose," a deftly 
written eight-page tome that many in the society say is what binds the group 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the newsletter has been instrumental in our growth as an 
organization," Bower said. "Many of our members say they joined to receive the 
advice that you can find in the newsletter." 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter offers advice and care columns -- including ever-critical 
pruning tips. Other stories address garden pests and upcoming trips to gardens 
across Southern California. One recent issue carried an article titled "Zen of 
Disbudding." 
</P>
<P>
 Society members say they are drawn to the thorny, flowering bushes for 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are intrigued by the thousands of different species. Some are fascinated 
by the challenges of rose propagation. Others say it was the intensity of one 
rose's particular shade of red, or their nostalgia for a favorite grandmother 
who maintained a rose garden, that drew them into the hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say they like the challenge of growing the "perfect" rose and 
then competing with other gardeners in local and regional competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing quality roses takes time, dedication and technical knowledge, society 
members say. Some growers spend hours every day to maintain quality gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the precise time to prune and then how much to cut off are probably 
the most critical skills to acquire, but also knowing when to fertilize the 
plants is important. Society members say that keeping a sharp eye for the onset 
of bud and leaf-eating pest infestations and knowing what kind of pesticides to 
use and when to apply them are key to raising the best roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeri Collari, 50, of Camarillo said that when she stops to breathe in the lush 
fragrance of a freshly picked rose, or touches one of its soft, colorful 
petals, she's doing far more than simply taking in the aesthetics of a pretty 
flower. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she is touching history itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Collari said some of the roses that line her yard are direct descendants of 
roses that once pleased Egyptian kings, decorated the Appomattox battlefield, 
and graced the royal gardens at Buckingham Palace for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because all varieties of roses come from a cutting of the original bush, it 
really isn't too much of a stretch to say that I have a little bit of history 
growing in my garden," Collari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Collari, who edits the society's newsletter, said the group is structured so 
the average gardener can gain basic information on back-yard rose-growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make the society and the newsletter user-friendly," Collari said. 
"We want to make it accessible to people who are just interested in keeping 
beautiful, healthy roses and who don't really care too much for the science." 
</P>
<P>
 The society's most recent project, finished in January, was planting a public 
rose garden at Camarillo's Constitution Park, next to City Hall. Society 
members planted more than 142 rosebushes donated by a local flower wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution Park project follows a smaller-scale effort in January, 1993, 
at the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park, where society members planted a 
43-bush rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Harms, a Newbury Park resident and society member, said the Stagecoach 
garden, which will be formally dedicated next month, features roses known for 
their Western historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the roses planted there are known to be in existence prior to 1867," said 
Harms, who is also a docent at the museum. "Planting this particular kind of 
garden is in keeping with the history of that facility. The earliest we have 
can be traced back to 1752." 
</P>
<P>
 For Harms, 40, the fragrance of her own tea roses and hybrid perpetuals is one 
reason she is an enthusiast. Another is her admiration for the plant's sheer 
pluckiness and survival instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real respect for them," Harms said. "People have come across roses 
planted at barns and ranch houses abandoned decades ago and they're still 
growing, still producing beautiful flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Jennings, a civilian engineer at the Naval Construction Battalion Center 
at Port Hueneme, started his back-yard rose garden with longtime companion 
Collari in 1988. They now have more than 300 rosebushes on their terraced 
Camarillo property. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Jennings said that before they started the garden, he didn't 
think he had a true green thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I thought that my four cacti were all that I needed," said Jennings, 
now the society's vice president. "Since then, I have come to really love 
working with roses. I find getting out into the garden is a great 
stress-reducer. At the end of a long day, it's one of the things that I really 
look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>

ELECTIONS / BALLOT MEASURES; VOTERS' OK WOULD RELEASE FUNDING FOR MASS TRANSIT; 
CITY ISSUES: OAK PARK WEIGHS ANNEXATION, PORT HUENEME TO DECIDE FATE OF POLICE, 
AND SANTA PAULA WANTS MONEY FOR LIBRARY.

<P>
 Ventura County voters will decide June 7 whether to approve a ballot measure 
that would enable the county to tap into a special state gas-tax fund that 
would bring in $1 million annually to pay for local mass transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, residents in Oak Park will help determine the future of 
their community by deciding whether to join the city of Thousand Oaks, become 
an independent city or remain a county jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, voters will face a special property tax needed for the city 
to continue operating its own Police Department. And in Santa Paula, residents 
will be asked to approve a ballot measure that would nearly double the 
operating hours of the city library. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the only four local ballot measures voters will face in the June 7 
election, which will also include a number of local, state and congressional 
races. Election officials predict that less than 45% of the county's 335,702 
registered voters will cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide transportation measure -- known as Measure X -- guarantees that 
a portion of the gas-tax money now collected by the state from each county for 
mass transit projects will be returned to the region, officials said. Last 
year, the so-called Transit Capital Improvement Program doled out about $100 
million to local jurisdictions across California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a tax," Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission, said of Measure X. "It simply allows the state to 
send money back to us that it already collects from the county. It's a 
no-brainer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Measure X would require a $1-million matching fund, Gherardi said the 
county's share would come from what the county and its 10 cities already spend 
on mass transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't take money away from other programs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from the gas-tax fund could help pay for rail stations, bus stations or 
other transit projects, such as the proposed transportation center in Thousand 
Oaks, Gherardi said. The money, however, cannot be used for operations 
involving mass transit services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said the county did not previously seek access to the funds because 
the county qualified for other state funds to pay for its transit projects. 
Also, she said, the county's share of the fund in the past would not have been 
large enough to warrant the time and expense of placing a measure on the ballot 
for voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years the fund has grown, prompting the county to take action to 
put the measure on the ballot. For example, officials said, the county could 
have received $1.2 million in the 1992-93 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't pass this, we're still going to be paying into the fund. But we 
won't be getting any of the money back," Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no formal opposition to Measure X, nor is there a ballot 
argument against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Oak Park, voters will help decide the future of their small 
unincorporated community. They will be asked if they would prefer annexing to 
Thousand Oaks, incorporating as a city or remaining a county jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, whose 2nd District includes Oak Park, wrote the 
ballot argument in favor of annexation, saying it would greatly improve 
services for the community of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said Thousand Oaks residents now collect the equivalent of $124 per 
resident in taxes that can be used for city services, while the corresponding 
amount Ventura County has available in the unincorporated area is $47. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said that with the state continuing to siphon money away from 
counties, Oak Park might see even fewer tax dollars spent in their community in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Oak Park need to realize that being part of an unincorporated area 
is not the best place to be, because the county does not have the money to 
provide many of the essential services people say they want," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With annexation, VanderKolk said Oak Park would receive more police protection 
services. She said residents, who now pay a $55 annual fee to use the Thousand 
Oaks Library, would have free access to the library while still being able to 
pursue plans to build their own facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, VanderKolk said she believed annexation would have no effect on Oak 
Park's ability to maintain its own school district, considered among the best 
in the county, or to remain within its current park district. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite VanderKolk's arguments, officials of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory 
Council, which advises the Board of Supervisors on local issues, say they 
believe annexation would result in a reduction of services. They argue that 
their community would just become a small segment of a large city and as a 
result would have less influence on decisions affecting Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we become part of Thousand Oaks that means we have to do what the rest of 
the city does," said Ron Stark, a member of the MAC and a 28-year resident of 
Oak Park. "If that means they don't have any school-crossing guards, then we 
don't have any crossing guards. If that means there are no street sweepers, 
then we don't have street sweepers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks collects more in taxes for city services than Oak Park 
for its community, Stark said Thousand Oaks also has more expenses and a larger 
overhead. He said residents are also concerned about assuming some of the debt 
that may arise from the building of the $64-million Civic Arts Plaza in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 As for use of the city library, Stark said Oak Park still prefers to have its 
own library because "Thousand Oaks is too far to drive for our students." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-three years ago, the county asked the residents of Oak Park if they 
wanted to annex to Thousand Oaks and at that time, they said no," Stark said. 
"I think this time they will do the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said while he prefers cityhood because "it's better to have the people 
who are governing you as close to home as possible," he believes the majority 
of Oak Park residents will want to remain an unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county in Port Hueneme, residents there could determine whether the 
city keeps its Police Department or instead contracts with the county Sheriff's 
Department, which could result in a reduction in services, police officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure Z asks Port Hueneme voters to levy a special tax in order to make up 
for a $500,000 funding gap needed to maintain current levels of police services 
in the city of 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, homeowners would pay an additional $56 in taxes for police 
services; renters, $47; commercial and industrial businesses, $0.0250 per 
square foot, and owners of vacant property, $0.0083 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been no major opposition to the measure, supporters of 
Measure Z acknowledge that any type of tax initiative is a hard sell, 
especially in a tough economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Measure Z requires a two-thirds majority vote for approval. Since 
Proposition 13 was passed in 1978, there have been only three Ventura County 
cities that have met the law's 66.7% vote requirement to approve new local 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes it so tough," said Detective Ken Dobbe, who is also a 
representative of a citizens committee campaigning for Measure Y, the Santa 
Paula library issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If Measure Z were to fail, Dobbe said the city would seriously consider 
contracting with the Sheriff's Department to help cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Police Department is staffed by 19 law enforcement personnel, 
he said. Meanwhile, the Sheriff's Department has offered to provide about a 
dozen officers to patrol the city at an annual savings of $385,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a decline in services, resident Valorie Morrison, also a member 
of the citizens committee for Measure Z, said the city would lose its anti-drug 
and gang prevention programs, use of its jail and its volunteer police reserve 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just lose too much," she said. "We have so many pluses right now, 
people don't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the two-thirds majority vote required for passage, Morrison said she 
is confident that residents will approve the property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be two or three people in the city who don't want it," she said. 
"But this city is so pro-police." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, voters will be asked to pass Measure Y, which would authorize 
the expenditure of already approved property taxes to benefit the city's 
Blanchard Community Library. The library is part of the Santa Paula Union High 
School Library District. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, local voters approved a $25 annual increase in property taxes to 
expand the operating hours of the library. The measure doubles -- to $340,000 
-- the amount of money the city can collect annually for library services. 
</P>
<P>
 But state tax laws require that local voters approve a spending limit for its 
library services before the new property taxes are appropriated for those 
services. The current annual spending limit is $455,000. Measure Y on the June 
ballot would increase that to $555,000, which under state law would remain in 
place for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending limit exceeds the amount of money the library district collects 
in property taxes. The higher spending limit would allow for any additional 
revenues generated from future residential or commercial growth in the city 
during the four years, said Dan Robles, Santa Paula's head librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 If Measure Y is passed, the new library funds would be used to buy new 
materials and equipment as well as to increase the number of days and hours the 
library is open. The library is now open 18 hours a week. With the new funding, 
library hours would increase to 30 hours a week, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Measure Y fails, the library district would be forced to refund the $25 
property tax to each property owner next year, and library services would 
continue to shrink, he said. A simple majority is required to approve Measure 
Y.

MAN TO MAN, 52,000 SEEK A BETTER WAY 
</P>

 Matt Greenly and Rick Brausch, both 33 and wearing shorts and T-shirts, stood 
by a refreshment stand at Anaheim Stadium Saturday afternoon deep in 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't talking about the Angels or the Rams. They weren't discussing 
cars or women. 
</P>
<P>
 They were trying to remember whether their fathers had ever told them they 
loved them, and saying they hoped the 1990s would be the decade when men 
realize it's OK to cry and open up to other men about their innermost fears and 
joys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento friends were two of about 52,000 men who filled Anaheim Stadium 
for "Promise Keepers," a Christian men's conference that blended hugs and 
tears, clergymen's speeches and boisterous hymns into what organizers hoped was 
a strengthening of men's integrity, responsibility and reconciliation with 
people of different ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm with my family 364 days out of the year," said Greenly, a Hewlett-Packard 
financial analyst who lives in Sacramento. "So if I can come here for one day, 
that will make me a better father and husband the other 364, then it's worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers began four years ago in Boulder, Colo., the brainchild of 
Colorado University head football coach Bill McCartney. The first conference 
was held in Boulder in 1991, drawing 4,200 men. Last July, the Boulder 
conference drew more than 50,000 men.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, a nondenominational Christian organization, plans to hold similar 
men's gatherings in Indiana, Texas, Oregon and Colorado later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers throughout the day urged the men, who ranged in age from the early 
teens to the 60s, to throw out the chauvinism they said society imposes and 
replace it with a healing, reassuring perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have been taught that we can live as men in isolation," Glenn Wagner, the 
vice president of National Ministries, shouted through a microphone set up on 
stage behind second base. "We focus more on competitiveness than camaraderie. 
But even the Lone Ranger needed Tonto with him." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the crowd was almost rowdy, rising in sections to form a "wave" that 
went around and around the stadium. Beach balls floated in the air, as did 
Styrofoam airplanes and peanut shells.  
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as Jack Hayford, a Van Nuys minister, invited the participants to 
form circles of four men apiece and tell one another what addictions or 
relationship problems they were struggling with, the crowd settled into a more 
serious mood.  
</P>
<P>
 In every row, men put their arms around each other's shoulders or held hands, 
talking quietly about their shortcomings. As they finished their discussions, 
many removed sunglasses to wipe tears and to give each other encouraging bear 
hugs or simple pats on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford then asked everyone to join hands across the aisles for the singing of 
a hymn. Men in cowboy hats and pointed-toed boots joined hands with tattooed 
bikers, raised their arms and sang. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-male nature of the conference, speakers and participants said, was in 
no way a backlash to the feminist movement, but rather affirmation of many 
feminist goals. The men, they said, were trying to become more open to their 
emotions and more involved with raising their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas painter Jim Cameron, 39, the father of eight, recalled a previous 
conference when one of the speakers told the men to "treat your wife like you 
would want your daughter's husband to treat her." Tears welled in his eyes as 
he recalled the effect that exhortation had on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'I've got to sit down and have a good talk with myself.' And I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Participant Greenly said he came to the Anaheim conference hoping to bond with 
other men who also are trying to be better husbands and fathers by listening to 
women's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this event is very pro-woman. We're out here saying, 'We've messed 
up, we've made mistakes.' Women have been telling us the same thing."

EASING THE PAIN, COST OF INOPERABLE CANCER CASES; DOCTOR'S TECHNIQUE REDUCES 
NEED FOR INTESTINAL SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Realizing that medical science can't always save lives, a UC Irvine physician 
has developed a technique that determines when cancer is inoperable and surgery 
would only add to the suffering of the dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth J. Chang, head of gastrointestinal oncology at UCI Clinical Cancer 
Center, is one of a few doctors in the world who has mastered the use of a new 
technology that discovers when gastrointestinal cancer is too advanced for 
surgery. He uses a combination of ultrasound technology and an aspiration 
needle to reach into parts of the body that can't be clearly imaged by CT 
scans, MRIs and other diagnostic tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Without this new technique, he said, in many cases surgery would be the only 
way to determine how far the cancer had spread. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to cancer within the gastrointestinal tract, he added, there is 
a high risk of cutting into a person without the hope of cure: the percentage 
of cases in which cancers are found inoperable during surgery, he said, ranges 
from 33% for cancer of the esophagus to 75% for pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only can unnecessary surgery add pain to the final months of dying 
patients, he said, but exploratory surgery is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's experience using a non-surgical method for diagnosing gastrointestinal 
cancer is groundbreaking, said Dr. Charles Lightdale, editor of the journal of 
the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The journal recently 
accepted the results of Chang's research for publication later this year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Chang will present his findings at an annual international 
conference of gastroenterologists in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really very important work," Lightdale said. "It is going to save a lot 
of unnecessary pain and suffering and expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultrasound is not new. Placing a high-frequency transducer against a pregnant 
woman's pelvic area is routinely done to monitor the development of a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas sound waves travel easily to the uterus through the water of the 
bladder, Chang said, sound waves do not transmit well enough from outside the 
body through the gassy contents of the stomach to locate what can be very tiny 
cancerous lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Chang said, he threads a scope tipped with an ultrasound sensor into 
the tract through the esophagus or rectum. The endoscope emits high-frequency 
sound waves that come back as echoes. The echoes are converted into electronic 
signals which, when portrayed on a television monitor in shades of gray, can 
reveal to the trained eye the presence of a tumor or enlarged lymph node. 
</P>
<P>
 After locating a lesion, which may be lurking in any of the five paper-thin 
layers of the gastrointestinal tract, Chang said, he uses a needle to make 
quick and painless biopsies that are sent to the laboratory for a more accurate 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tract, Chang said, he also has easy access to parts of the lungs that 
are unreachable by other diagnostic techniques short of surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 The entire ultrasound and biopsy procedure takes up to two hours and can be 
done on an outpatient basis without general anesthesia. It costs $1,500 to 
$2,000, compared to $15,000 to $20,000 for exploratory surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Chang's patients, George Cornett, 67, of Buena Park, was prepared for 
surgery that would take six hours and involve cutting out most of his cancerous 
esophagus before Chang lowered an ultrasound endoscope down his throat and 
found that the cancer already had spread to a distant lymph node close to his 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It saved me a lot of grief, I believe," Cornett said. 
</P>
<P>
 While endoscopic ultrasound has been available for five years in the United 
States, Chang said, it has been possible for U.S. physicians to use this 
technology to simultaneously image and sample cancerous tissue inside the body 
for about a year.  
</P>
<P>
 That is when Pentax Precision Instruments Corp. developed a new ultrasound 
endoscope that allows a physician to guide a biopsy needle with great precision 
into the masses that he finds. The new technology, Chang said, allows lymph 
nodes to be safely biopsied only a few millimeters from blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 From February, 1993, to February of this year, he said, he performed the new 
diagnostic procedure on 38 patients, with a mean age of 60, at UCI Medical 
Center and Long Beach Veterans Administration Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was able to diagnose cancer in 66% of the patients who previously 
were undiagnosed and discovered that 44% of the cancers were more advanced than 
other diagnostic procedures could have determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significantly, he said, the findings directly influenced the 
decision not to perform surgery on six patients, representing 26% of the 
patients with a previous cancer diagnosis, whose cancer had spread too far for 
surgery to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all information gleaned from the combined ultrasound and biopsy procedure 
is necessarily bad, said Chang. "In one instance a guy had a tumor in the 
pancreas and was scheduled for surgery. But the aspiration showed the tumor was 
not malignant, and so the surgery was canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang cautioned that the technology is not 100% accurate. In his research, 
about 9% of cancers initially were missed by the technology because the tissues 
that he sampled were not malignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides identifying inoperable cancers, the new technology also may be used in 
the future to make much earlier, life-saving diagnoses of cancers of the 
pancreas, Chang said. He said the technology may provide a non-surgical means 
for confirming the results of blood tests that are being developed to detect 
tiny cancers of the pancreas while they are still operable. Diagnosing 
Inoperable Cancer 
</P>
<P>
 A new non-surgical technique developed by a UC Irvine physician combines 
ultrasound and a needle to determine when cancer is inoperable. The outpatient 
procedure decreases the need for exploratory surgery, takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours 
and does not require a general anesthetic. 1. Scope inserted down patient's 
throat to stomach 2. Surgeon studies fiber optic and ultrasound images on TV 
monitors; uses hand-held device to maneuver scope left or right; follows 
needle's movements on monitors. 3. If tumor is detected, surgeon protracts 
needle, inserts it into tumor. If needed, surgeon can insert a syringe through 
hollow needle to suction out a piece of tumor. 4. Surgeon examines tumor under 
microscope, and within 45 minutes can determine if it's malignant. Scope: Three 
feet long; thickness of a small finger Ultrasound tip: Emits high-frequency 
sound waves that come back as echoes to TV monitor Rubber balloon: Filled with 
water to help ultrasound conductivity Fiber-optic lens: Relays images to TV 
monitor Retractable, hollow needle: Used to pierce suspected malignant tumor

PAPERLESS PUBLISHER BUILDS POLITICAL NETWORK; CYBERSPACE: THE ORANGE COAST 
COLLEGE STUDENT AIRS VIEWS VIA INTERNET WITH HIS ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTER ON 
COLLEGE DEMOCRATS. 
</P>

<P>
 Scott Lay had a choice: keep paying $300 telephone bills, or jump on the 
on-line computer bandwagon.  
</P>
<P>
 To a 21-year-old college Democrat on a tight budget with a need to network 
with other young politicians, it was an easy decision. Now when Lay finishes a 
few hours of work at a local hospital, he sits down at his PC to write his 
quasi-weekly, late-night political catharsis for the world to read.  
</P>
<P>
 Lay puts out an electronic newsletter through the Internet, a worldwide 
collection of several thousand computer networks. His paperless letter shoots 
into the computer mailboxes of about 100 people throughout the world -- not 
counting the thousands of browsers who can skim his newsletter on any of 
several computer bulletin boards that can be reached with a modem. 
</P>
<P>
 He bills it "The Donkey's Mouth: The Newsletter of College Dems in 
Cyberspace." With chatter ranging from the latest doings of Gov. Pete Wilson to 
the dirt on Whitewater -- not to mention a memorial of late grunge rocker Kurt 
Cobain -- Lay's letter is free to anyone with an Internet connection.  
</P>
<P>
 As a last jab at his home, he always signs the newsletter "Alive and Kicking 
from Behind the Orange Curtain." All this from his computer headquarters, 
a.k.a. his Placentia home, less than three miles from the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace in Yorba Linda.  
</P>
<P>
 "I get more motivated when I think I'm putting this out from Orange County," 
Lay said recently, sipping an iced mocha and wearing a pin pushing an upcoming 
state ballot initiative. "But then, I have to admit I got the idea from a 
college Republican newsletter based out of Berkeley, of all places."  
</P>
<P>
 Lay, an Orange Coast College student who goes by the computer name politico , 
uses the letter to ask other students to pressure legislators to approve laws 
improving collegiate education and increasing college funding. The newsletter 
is a political springboard for him as well: In April, Lay was elected to be 
statewide president of the California College Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been a life of political gamesmanship for Lay, who probably 
is one of the few young, local community college students to tote both a 
backpack and a leather briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two years ago, when he was considering going into medicine, he and his 
OCC classmate Paul Mitchell were talking over a cup of coffee about how to get 
their fellow students to vote. Neither had ever been politically active. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even in student government in high school," said Lay, a graduate of 
Valencia High School in Placentia. "I was into drama." 
</P>
<P>
 Lay and Mitchell put together a voter registration campaign at OCC. "We're 
well aware we were registering more Republicans than Democrats, but the 
important thing was that students were registering," Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about voting and political awareness fired them up to start the Orange 
Coast College Democrats Club in 1992, he said.

<P>
 "I don't think that either of us would be doing half of what we do without the 
support of each other," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Donoff, vice president of student services at OCC, said Lay has rallied 
students to organize and pay attention to statewide issues. "The Democratic 
club has been the most active political club we've had on campus since I've 
been here," said Donoff, who has worked for the college since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay got a taste of statewide politics with the nonpartisan California Student 
Assn. of Community Colleges, a group that recently elected Mitchell as its 
president. As the group's current legislative chairman, Lay often hops on 
commuter flights to lobby state legislators in Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 The political bug led him to work as a student organizer in the Clinton 
presidential campaign as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night before the 1992 election, Paul and I were putting up signs on 
Fairview (Street) at 3:15 a.m." for the Clinton-Gore ticket and Senate 
candidates Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, Lay said. "We put up signs on 
public property, which is perfectly legal, and we drove down the street. When 
we came back, the signs were gone. We couldn't figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we saw a car slowly following behind us, and guys were tearing the signs 
down. Luckily, the Costa Mesa police caught wind of what was going on at about 
4 o'clock," Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers stopped the youths trailing Lay's car, scolded them and let them go, 
Lay said. "I'm glad the police got involved because maybe fists would've gotten 
involved," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying up late is typical for Lay, who said he gets about four or five hours 
of sleep a night. After a day of tutoring, studying and working as a clerk at 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, he sits down at the computer to exchange 
messages with computer users in the Midwest or East Coast.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to know what students in Minnesota are doing, for example," he 
said. "How are they dealing with issues?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before, he spent time on the telephone talking to people. Now, he subscribes 
to an Internet carrier to link his computer to others by telephone, at a much 
lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the ballyhoo about the "information superhighway," Lay does have one 
concern: that everyone should be able to use it regardless of class. "As we go 
to more of an information-based society, we have to think about how to make 
sure everyone can have access to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic quickly spins back to the newsletter. An avant-garde 'zine it's not; 
but in it, readers might find a tongue-in-cheek "check your political leanings" 
quiz or random notes submitted by a member of a liberal party in Canada. There 
are few content rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the beautiful thing about it is there's no editor," he said. "If 
people don't like it, they can bypass it. I can do what I want with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about it is hearing the responses," he said. "One person said, 
'I've been waiting for a newsletter like this to come out but I never expected 
it to come from Orange County.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearing the end of his stint at OCC -- extended to three years because of 
illnesses caused by an immune deficiency -- Lay will move to UC Davis in the 
fall to study political science. But he's not sure about the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I want to go into politics," Lay said. "I like policy. I like 
teaching. It's like, 'Should I make a right turn or a left?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he said wryly, "I always make a left."

SLIDE DANGER MAY HINDER CONSTRUCTION; GEOLOGY: MORATORIUM ON REBUILDING IS 
AMONG STOPGAP OPTIONS UNTIL CITY AND LANDOWNERS STABILIZE FIRE-RAVAGED LAND 
ABOVE AN ANCIENT LANDSLIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are considering a construction moratorium for a tear-shaped 
area of Mystic Hills that lies above an ancient landslide undisturbed for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would be a stopgap measure until the city of Laguna Beach and 
owners of almost 40 properties in the fire-scorched area can reach an agreement 
to stabilize the hill and fund repairs estimated at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, City Council members met for nearly three hours with 
more than 65 residents who peppered two geological consultants with technical 
questions about the severity of the dangers posed by the newly discovered 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank raised the prospect of a 
moratorium as a temporary strategy while city and local residents consider 
launching a special assessment district to tax themselves for the shoring work, 
which -- in a "worst-case scenario" -- could amount to $50,000 per homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, saving the moratorium suggestion for last, said, "This is one that 
sounds terrible. We're recommending that the council impose a temporary 
moratorium on the issuance of building permits in any area adjacent to the 
landslide." 
</P>
<P>
 The slide lies under a section of a hillside and is bordered on the south by a 
steeply dipping fault, according to the city's geological consultants, Geofirm. 
After the Laguna Beach fires last fall, Geofirm was commissioned to study rows 
of homes and vacant property above City Hall, including parts of Vista Lane, 
Bermuda Drive, Coronado Drive and Anacapa Way. 
</P>
<P>
 They concluded that with the right mix of natural forces, such as an 
earthquake or heavy rainstorms, the dormant landslide could rumble to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of an earthquake and added water could be devastating to this 
area," said Gary Stoney of Geofirm. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the hilly neighborhood, Geofirm proposes to sink a retaining wall 
above Bermuda Drive and to sink in the rest of the area a series of 
90-foot-deep rods and cables called "tie-backs." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of defending this neighborhood from a landslide could range from 
$25,000 to $50,000 per homeowner, depending on how many properties ultimately 
are included in the troubled zone, according to Frank. The figures could drop 
further once the city's share of the project is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier estimates had ranged as high as $100,000, but Frank said that figure 
applied to homeowners in the heart of the landslide area who do repairs 
individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank added that the city will seek federal aid to subsidize costs, but held 
out little hope that the neighborhood could qualify for disaster relief for an 
ancient landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not count on it," said Frank, who repeatedly encouraged the residents 
to join together to solve the problem and whittle down the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the meeting wore on, the subdued participants listened politely, scratching 
notes on yellow legal pads about the risks of earthquakes and water. Many 
already were veterans of disaster, having endured the Laguna Beach fires that 
incinerated 13 of the houses in the landslide area on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question for many was summed up by Tony Clark, a resident of Buena 
Vista Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ancient slide and something stopped it," said Clark. "Any probability 
that this is through sliding?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was not reassuring: "Given certain conditions, this is unstable 
regardless of what happened in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents left the meeting still wondering what was the right course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't made up my mind yet," said Jim Rakshani, who lives on the edge of 
the landslide area on Coronado Drive. "I'm going to wait until the next meeting 
to make up my mind. It's not as bad as we all thought it was going to be. The 
cost is less, and I think it may even be cheaper when they're through with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has scheduled another meeting with homeowners and geologists on May 
21 at 9 p.m. in City Hall. If a consensus develops, the City Council could move 
as soon as its May 23 Council meeting to take preliminary steps toward 
launching a special assessment district.

MAN BOUND 6 DAYS MAY HAVE HANDS AMPUTATED; CRIME: A WORRIED FRIEND CHECKING ON 
THE 72-YEAR-OLD ALTADENA RESIDENT FINDS THAT INTRUDERS BEAT RETIREE AND LEFT 
HIM TIED UP ON THE FLOOR OF HIS HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 72-year-old retiree was facing possible amputation of his hands Saturday 
after assailants broke into his modest Altadena home, beat him and left him 
bound and gagged on the floor for six days. 
</P>
<P>
 James Farrell was in stable but guarded condition at an undisclosed hospital 
after an operation in which doctors were able to restore some circulation to 
his hands and were hoping that amputation could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians initially said that Farrell, who retired last month from his stock 
and mail department job with Home Savings, probably would lose both hands as a 
result of being tied up for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors feel (his condition) is remarkable considering all that he has been 
through," sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people who had broken into Farrell's home attacked him as the man, who 
lived alone, entered the small, white frame house shortly after 8 p.m. on May 
7, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell lay beaten and bound on his living room floor until Friday, when a 
worried friend looked in on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was ransacked, but sheriff's deputies were unsure if anything was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell was able to give only a general description of his assailants, but 
said one of them was wearing a blue uniform-style shirt with a badge. No 
suspects had been arrested as of late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 George Winn, a longtime neighbor of Farrell's, said the area has become tough; 
he and Farrell have been burglarized several times and there are occasional 
shootings on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Winn, 77, said he had helped Farrell patch windows with plywood after 
burglaries because his neighbor was too frail to do the work alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Winn said he and Farrell moved into the neighborhood after serving in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 50 years as neighbors, Winn said, he hardly knew Farrell, who kept 
to himself in the neighborhood but regularly socialized with a set of friends 
at a cafeteria in downtown Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of Beadle's Cafeteria, largely patronized by senior citizens, say 
Farrell had been coming into the restaurant every night for dinner for at least 
18 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was very friendly," said Rosa Jaime, assistant manager of the restaurant. 
"He always had a nice joke to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell's friends, as well as cafeteria employees, became worried when he did 
not show up last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent (Gene) Cusic, 78, who has known Farrell for 30 years and regularly 
drives him home from Beadle's, went to his friend's house to check on his 
welfare about noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cusic found newspapers on the front lawn, mail in the box and the front door 
slightly ajar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hollered, 'Jim, what's going on? Where are you?' " Cusic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, who had managed to chew through his gag, called for Cusic to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cusic entered the living room, he found Farrell lying on the floor with 
his head under a table, but could not tell in the dim light that he had been 
tied up. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong?" Cusic asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Farrell said. "I don't know where I am." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after emergency workers arrived that Cusic learned that his friend 
had been tied up and badly beaten.

FOES CALL IT A DISGUISED RESORT, OWNER SAYS IT'S A CAMPGROUND 
</P>

<P>
 The campground that developer Irwin (Red) Lachman wants to build near Malibu 
would be a humdinger. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure describes it as a New Age retreat, an outdoor study hall for 
reading the great books and a research lab for environmental education. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to have a restaurant, state-of-the-art fitness center, tennis and 
basketball courts, two swimming pools, an arts and crafts pavilion and outdoor 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 But do not bother to bring a pup tent. 
</P>
<P>
 For accommodations, the 93-acre Latigo Ranch Resort in the Santa Monica 
Mountains is to offer tent cabins complete with kitchen and bath for up to $125 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters hail it as a prototype for camping resorts of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say it is an environmental disaster masquerading as a campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Los Angeles County officials have approved it, dropping a commitment 
to conduct public hearings, opponents are angry. It marks the county's second 
flip-flop on the development in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project by any other name would never fly," said Steve Best, whose house 
is near the site along Latigo Canyon Road two miles from the Pacific Ocean. "To 
call it a campground is outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best heads a group of residents who fear that Latigo Ranch will bring 
increased traffic, noise and the threat of fire. Theirs is an isolated 
community surrounded by parkland, where residents are accustomed to seeing deer 
and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman, the developer, dismisses them as a small group who want to keep the 
property for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't want to see anything built there, in my opinion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman insists that the project is environmentally sound and will not 
diminish the beauty of the rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for less than 10,000 cubic yards of grading, buildings are to cover 
less than 2% of the land, and nearly half the property -- including an 
environmentally sensitive habitat area -- is to be off limits to any 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the neighbors are not the only ones critical of the project and the 
county's handling of it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the issue is the county's designation of the development -- 
with its planned facilities for 400 guests and staff -- as a "campground." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has called classifying the project as a 
campground a "clever linguistic tango" on the part of planning officials to 
avoid requiring the developer to obtain a conditional use permit and prepare an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Each would have required extensive public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the permit should have been required because the zoning for the 
property dictates a permit for projects that include such features as dining 
facilities, guest ranches, health resorts and recreation clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The county planner who reviewed the project in 1991 concluded as much. 
</P>
<P>
 But a month later her boss, planning administrator John Schwarze, exempted the 
developer from the requirement, citing a Xzoning provision that allows 
exemptions for "campgrounds and accessory structures." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some campground," Best scoffed. "Who ever heard of a tent with a 
refrigerator?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarze's action might have elicited an immediate outcry from opponents, 
except that they did not learn about it until shortly before the state Coastal 
Commission considered the proposal in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since (Schwarze) had removed the need for a (conditional use permit), there 
was no public hearing, and no notification about what was going on," Best said. 
"It was strictly a closed-door type procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal panel -- impressed by Lachman's pledge to make the resort 
available to inner-city youngsters -- approved the project after the 
developer's lawyer testified that the county had conducted an environmental 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternate commissioner from Northern California was the lone dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, who had insisted to no avail before the Coastal Commission that the 
county had done no meaningful environmental work on the project, cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter county Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose district includes Malibu. In the 
face of publicity about the handling of the matter, he took the unusual step 
last June of directing county lawyers to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opponents won a sympathetic ear from the Sierra Club's Santa Monica 
Mountains Task Force, the city of Malibu and officials of a resource 
conservation district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, whose board had informally endorsed 
the resort earlier, did an about-face, expressing serious environmental 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon county officials changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, deputy county counsel Charles Moore, reversing an earlier legal 
opinion, announced that the developer should have been required to obtain the 
conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman, the developer, threatened to sue the county. He also hired Alma 
Fitch, Edelman's former chief of staff, as a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, this spring, came the big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, as the county Regional Planning Commission prepared to reconsider 
the project, one of its members -- Bob Ryan -- concluded that because the 
Coastal Commission had approved it, it must be environmentally sound and the 
county should not stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Moore, the county lawyer, issued a third opinion, this one arguing, 
like the first, that no conditional use permit should have been required. 
</P>
<P>
 A mid-level planner in the Planning Department signed off on the project the 
last week of April. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic shell game," said Greg Aftergood, a lawyer for the homeowner 
group. "They go before (the) Coastal (Commission) and say the county did its 
work. At the county, they say it must be OK because Coastal approved it. You 
get the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who, like Moore, declined to be interviewed, issued a statement 
saying he was "surprised and disappointed" by the Planning Department's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 It is small consolation to detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can view it a couple of ways," neighbor Janet Katz said. "Either 
(Edelman's) heart was never in it, or else since he's a lame duck about to 
leave office he just doesn't care anymore."

BILL BOYARSKY: HOW TO BEAT THE RAP: TAKE YOUR NINE-IRON AND BE RICH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his latest movie, Jack Nicholson plays a man who, after being bitten by a 
wolf, is transformed into sort of a werewolf. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the trailer last weekend and Nicholson certainly looked fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
 But not nearly as fearsome, I bet, as he looked to Robert S. Blank, 38, a 
salesman who had stopped his 1969 Mercedes Benz at the Toluca Lake intersection 
of Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive at 11:50 a.m. last Feb. 8. As related by 
police and prosecutors, this is what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 A black Mercedes stopped next to Blank's car and two men emerged. One of them, 
the driver, told Blank: "You cut me off." Quite sensibly, Blank locked the 
doors of his car. The driver proceeded to beat on the roof of Blank's car with 
a golf club. Then he came around to the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then, as he looked through his windshield, did Blank see his assailant's 
face. It was the face known to millions, that of Jack Nicholson. Nicholson 
swung the club once more, hitting the window directly in front of Blank. The 
safety glass window smashed, sending tiny bits of glass flying over Blank. 
Nicholson and his companion then drove off in the actor's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank reported the attack to the police, and the actor was charged with 
misdemeanor assault and vandalism. Scott also filed a civil suit against 
Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 The next move was Nicholson's. He settled the suit by agreeing to give Blank 
an undisclosed amount of money. Blank told the court he didn't want to pursue 
the case. Then, over the prosecution's objections, Municipal Judge Martin Suits 
dropped all criminal charges against Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 As they say in the legal trade, when referring to a defendant who escapes 
tough punishment, Nicholson walked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to joke about the attack. A lot of people have. But, in truth, it 
was one of those incidents we Southland motorists have nightmares about -- the 
driver in the next car suddenly turning violent. 
</P>
<P>
 And the outcome of the case of the People of the State of California vs. Jack 
Nicholson illustrates something equally disturbing -- how our criminal justice 
system is stacked in favor of the rich and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, for example, if a machinist from Boyle Heights or a student from Van 
Nuys High School had done what Nicholson did. They'd be in a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was on my mind Wednesday when I went to the Van Nuys municipal 
building and talked to the prosecutor, Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Jeff 
Harkavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkavy, who has been a prosecutor for 10 years, talked about the Nicholson 
case with a disciplined lawyer's calm. Nobody put in the fix, he said. Judge 
Suits isn't a Tinseltown groupie. Rather, he presides over the small Avenal 
Justice Court in rural Kings County, a part-time job. He comes down to Van Nuys 
court the rest of the week under a law designed to make full use of justice 
court judges and to allow them to earn full judicial salaries. "I truly did not 
believe Mr. Nicholson's celebrity status had anything to do with it," Harkavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have been the actor's fame, but as I went over the case with 
Harkavy I could see that Nicholson's money had everything to do with the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll start with the police. Detective Robert Searle sought to talk to 
Nicholson. He said he "spoke with Mr. Abe Somer, attorney for suspect. (I) was 
advised suspect would make no statement regarding incident." 
</P>
<P>
 It usually doesn't work out as well for an ordinary suspect, unequipped with a 
battery of lawyers. The unmoneyed, once police advise them of their right to 
remain silent, often end up telling all when under the spell of a persuasive 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Nicholson's money gave him the luxury of settling the case 
under an 1872 law permitting many misdemeanor charges, including assault and 
vandalism, to be dropped if the accused pays off the victim. After the 
agreement, the amount of the settlement was sealed, despite the objection of 
Deputy City Atty. Harkavy. "The people have a right to know how much it was," 
he told me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I placed several calls to Charles English, the top criminal lawyer on the 
Nicholson team, but we never made connections. However, earlier this month, 
Times reporter Thom Mrozek quoted him as saying Nicholson has "been treated 
more severely than an ordinary citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkavy disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "A crime of violence toward a person takes on a very different dimension than 
a crime against property," he said. "In this case, Mr. Nicholson, whether or 
not he intended it, placed Mr. Blank in danger of injuring his eyesight, losing 
his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is that we don't want this to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a case tried in criminal court -- as Nicholson's would have 
been without the settlement -- sends a message that we are a nation of laws, 
applied equally and fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're guilty, you're convicted, and you have to live with your criminal 
record. This happens to hundreds of thousands in our criminal courts every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy and well-advised enough to escape that fate, Nicholson walked. As 
Harkavy told Nicholson's lawyer afterward, this "wasn't in the interests of 
justice."

PARK TAX WEIGHED FOR UNINCORPORATED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time their tax bills arrive, homeowners in the county's unincorporated 
areas shell out money for such services as fire protection, flood control and 
mosquito abatement -- some seven fees in all. 
</P>
<P>
 By fall, they may have to cough up an additional fee for parks.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation is quietly exploring 
the feasibility of making up an $8.5-million budget shortfall by taxing 
homeowners at least $10 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks Director Rodney E. Cooper said the fee may be necessary to avoid 
shutting down 37 of the county's 121 parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county budget is so tight that it's my responsibility to bring forth all 
the options we can find," Cooper said.  
</P>
<P>
 But county sources said the Board of Supervisors is unlikely to impose the 
parks tax this year because the cash-strapped library system is in greater need 
of tax-generated funds because of state cutbacks. If Gov. Pete Wilson signs 
enabling legislation, the supervisors will support a ballot initiative for a 
library tax instead of imposing the parks fee because they do not want to be 
seen as advocating two new taxes in one year, the sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 By proposing such a politically unpalatable alternative as a new tax, parks 
officials are hoping to pressure the board into tapping the county's 
$20-million reserves and fully funding the department. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the parks department paid two consultants $50,000 to study the 
feasibility of the proposed tax and come up with a plan to levy it.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the parks department threatened to close dozens of parks in the 
face of a 25% proposed budget cutback. In the end, the board reduced the parks 
budget by only about 12%, forcing the department to transfer to other 
government agencies 10 county parks it could no longer afford to maintain, but 
forestalling any park closures.  
</P>
<P>
 All five supervisors were in Washington, D. C., last week and could not be 
reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 But an aide to Supervisor Ed Edelman said new taxes may eventually be 
necessary because of state budget cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be willing to look at new ways to generate revenue -- Ed talks 
about having to 'grow the pie,' " spokesman Joel Bellman said. "Whether it's 
appropriate now remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 However, an aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich said the parks department needs 
to generate more revenue through an aggressive marketing campaign, including 
promoting its facilities as concert venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike strongly opposes the tax," Peter Whittingham said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. also opposes the tax, which would be levied 
by creating an assessment district in the unincorporated areas.  
</P>
<P>
 "The new surge of assessment districts since a key court decision in 1992 is a 
grave concern of ours because they're clearly and purely a property tax," said 
Joel Fox, the group's president. "Assessment districts could be the undoing of 
(the property tax-cutting) Prop. 13 because there are no limits and you pile 
one assessment district on top of another." Parks officials said past cutbacks 
in funding have left the department with no fat to trim. The department now has 
844 employees, down from 2,231 about 15 years ago, and has eliminated most 
recreational programs as a result.  
</P>
<P>
 To raise revenue, the department has taken a series of steps, including 
contracting out the management of its 20 golf courses, transferring the 
responsibility for roadside trees and median strips to the Department of Public 
Works, and using welfare recipients and criminals assigned to community service 
to maintain parks. It saved $600,000 this year simply by processing its own 
utility bills and pursuing billing errors instead of paying another county 
department to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said the department also has created a marketing division and is trying 
to raise money by recommending that the board approve the rental of parks 
facilities to bingo operators, among other programs. But he said that such 
programs could only generate about $1 million annually, far less than $6 
million to $8 million the department needs.

ABUSE CASE TO CHALLENGE NEW LAW ON LIMITATIONS; COURTS: SANTA CLARITA MAN'S 
DEFENSE IS LATEST ATTACK ON 'RECOVERED MEMORY' SYNDROME. ENCINO WOMAN'S STORY 
SPURRED LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Encino woman's sad story of sexual abuse she suffered as a child prompted a 
new state law which allows victims of such abuse to file criminal charges 
against their alleged attackers years after the incidents occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But that law, only 5 months old, is already under attack by a Santa Clarita 
man who stands accused of sexually molesting four girls more than 20 years ago 
-- years after the statute of limitations expired. His ex-girlfriend also 
stands accused of aiding and abetting the molestation of her own daughter, who 
recalled details of the alleged attacks during therapy two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the pair said the law is unjust and improper, especially if 
applied retroactively. The only other crime in California not subject to the 
statute of limitations is murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned attack on the new law is the latest assault on "recovered memory" 
syndrome, which has divided the mental health profession since it surfaced in 
the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychologists contend that child victims repress their memories of sexual 
abuse and retrieve them, sometimes in great detail, years later. Others 
maintain the practice consists of overzealous therapists using questionable 
techniques to plant false memories in the minds of their patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark malpractice suit involving repressed memory therapy, a Napa jury 
on Friday found that two therapists destroyed a man's life by implanting false 
memories of sexual abuse in his daughter's mind and awarded him $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona, 50, filed a suit against his daughter's former therapist and 
psychiatrist after his daughter accused him of sexual abuse in 1990, triggering 
the collapse of his marriage, the abandonment of his family, a damaged 
reputation and the loss of a $400,000-a-year job with Robert Mondavi Winery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona, now 23, testified last month that she recovered buried memories 
in 1990 of her father's hand on her stomach, of him stroking her inner thighs 
and of him being on top of her with his penis inside her. She testified that he 
raped her repeatedly between the ages of 5 and 8 and that neither her former 
therapist Marche Isabella, nor psychiatrist Richard Rose, helped her 
manufacture any memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's verdict was a sharp contrast to what was perhaps the most highly 
publicized case involving repressed memory, the case of George T. Franklin. He 
was sentenced in 1991 to life in prison for the 1969 fatal beating of Susan 
Nason, 8, of San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was prompted after Franklin's daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, 
suddenly recalled a long repressed memory while looking into the eyes of her 
own daughter. It was then that Franklin-Lipsker recalled watching her father 
rape Nason in the family van and beat her with a rock. He then threatened to 
kill her if she ever told. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was a murder case. The case involving the Santa Clarita man, 
64-year-old retired aerospace worker William Lynch, will be played out in 
another courtroom and under the new state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch was arrested in April and subsequently charged with 14 counts of lewd 
conduct with a child stemming from alleged attacks on the four women when they 
were between 7 and 13 years old from March, 1967, to July, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch's former girlfriend, Mildred Fleetwood, 61, who was arrested in Florida, 
faces eight criminal counts as an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fleetwood's daughter set the case in motion when she recalled during a 1992 
therapy session details of Lynch molesting her and her childhood friends, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Francesca Frey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other alleged victims are sisters who Lynch frequently baby-sat when 
their mother was attending air traffic control school. Frey said her case is 
bolstered because two of the three other victims fully remember the sexual 
molestations, but never came forward with them. The women, now 37, 33 and 31, 
live in Tennessee, Kentucky and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 By challenging the law, attorneys for Lynch and Fleetwood will make the case a 
test of a state law that became effective Jan. 1. It allows prosecutors to file 
charges in certain types of sex cases within a year of the date the crime is 
reported to police, regardless of when it was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was written by Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) after 
learning of the case of Susan Jarreau, an Encino resident who says she did not 
remember being sexually abused until more than 10 years after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau, who says she was abused from the age of 6 to 14, could not file 
criminal charges against her abuser because a state law covering all crimes but 
murder imposed limits for prosecution ranging from two to six years from the 
time the act occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law also requires that the victim be under 18 when the crimes occurred 
and that evidence exists that corroborates the victim's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law allows us not to reward people who choose children as victims," Frey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Lynch and Fleetwood said they plan to file motions 
challenging the validity of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying the complaint is defective on its face value," said Frank 
DiSabatino, an attorney representing Lynch. "My client is devastated by this." 
Legal technicalities aside, DiSabatino said his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Verah Bradford, an attorney representing Fleetwood, said that although the law 
could apply to crimes committed in the future, it should not apply to her 
client because it was passed after the statute of limitations in the case 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is a nice Christian woman who has been going to church for the last 
five years," Bradford said. "She knows her daughter has problems, which will be 
revealed as this case continues." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lynch case, Frey said that Fleetwood's daughter had vague memories of 
what Lynch allegedly did to her and her friends, but it was during the therapy 
session that she recalled many of the details of what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey, the prosecutor, said the 35-year-old woman, who now lives in Santa 
Clarita with her husband, had undergone voluntary treatment in 1992 for severe 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey also said that authorities uncovered evidence during a November, 1993, 
search of Lynch's home that may link him to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who is free on $100,000 bail, and Fleetwood, who is married and has a 
husband in Florida, are scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court on June 9. A bail hearing for Fleetwood, who is now in custody in Los 
Angeles, has also been set for Thursday.

AVIATION'S PAST, FUTURE MEET AT CAMARILLO SHOW; AIRCRAFT: OLD WAR BIRDS AND 
EXPERIMENTAL PLANES ARE DISPLAYED AT AIRPORT. CROWD OF 5,000 ALSO SEES 
AEROBATIC SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 High-tech aviation ran headlong into old-guard aluminum, rivets and spit 
polish Saturday during the 14th annual Fly-in/Air Show staged by the Ventura 
County chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Assn. at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 5,000 people braved early morning low clouds and cool 
temperatures to walk among experimental airplanes boasting radical new designs 
and old war birds that enjoyed fame more than 50 years ago when the country was 
embroiled in war. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, as the clouds parted and blue skies appeared, the crowd was 
treated to a two-hour aerobatic show involving aircraft old and new. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event is designed to get people, especially kids, interested in sport 
aviation," event spokesman Bob Switzer said. "People who take in our show have 
the chance to look back into history and forward into our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Steve Pryor said today's air show audience should expect morning 
low clouds and fog with temperatures in the low 50s and the sun burning through 
by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's events concluded with a dinner talk by NASA astronaut Col. Carl J. 
Meade. Meade, who recently flew aboard the space shuttle Columbia, said he is 
preparing to fly again this September as a mission specialist in the shuttle 
Discovery. His job during the 10-day space flight will be to test a jet pack 
that, if successful, will allow astronauts to maneuver more easily in space 
outside the shuttle cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Meade, a Houston native, said he builds and flies experimental aircraft as a 
hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "NASA has us do a lot of air shows, but I chose this one because I can learn 
some things and trade some information with others that are constructing 
home-builts too," Meade said. "Plus, any time I can help support sport 
aviation, I'm happy to lend a hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered throughout the show compound were vendor tents offering everything 
from aircraft parts to kits to make whole airplanes. The airplane kits were 
selling for $30,000 and up, depending on the type of design, equipment and 
finish selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tents held seminars on the latest techniques in handling aluminum, wood 
or composite material used in the construction of home-built aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Miller, 63, of Oxnard said he came out Saturday to take in the aerobatic 
show and to do some airplane-kit browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would do a little shopping," Miller said. "I come to the show 
every year, but I think this is the year I might take the plunge." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest attention-getters at the show was the Berkut I, a sleek 
two-seat aircraft featuring a canard design -- a configuration where a plane's 
horizontal stabilizers are located in front of its main wings, instead of in 
back of them in the tail section. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Riley, a spokesman for the company marketing Berkuts, said the 
airplane kits -- which cost from $29,000 to $75,000 -- have been selling 
steadily since the prototype was built in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, people typically ask if the plane isn't something off the set of 
'Star Wars,' " Riley said. "But once they take a demonstration flight, they 
like it so much that we have to practically pry them out of the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting less than 30 yards from the high-tech Berkut was a collection of 
antique war birds that had been lovingly restored in tribute to pre-jet 
military aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy SN-J trainer, a Beechcraft AT-7 and a Marine Corps T28-C attracted 
scores of old veterans and younger curiosity-seekers. But perhaps the biggest 
draw was the hulking C-121C Super Constellation military transport. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950s-era Constellation, the Boeing 747 of its day, recently received 
permission from Ventura County officials to operate out of the Camarillo 
Airport after fears were raised by some county employees that the giant 
four-engine plane was too heavy for the airport's runway. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon, a dozen or so aerobatic aircraft took to the skies in front of the 
crowd and performed a multitude of high-precision stunts. One of those 
airplanes was a shiny black Pitts Special biplane, made from a kit and flown by 
Alyson Behr of Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love this show," Behr said. "It's a great way to show off the airplane. 
It's a lot of fun and the folks up here seem really interested and 
knowledgeable about what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dan Higginbotham, 30, of Ojai, the show whetted his appetite for aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work across the freeway from the airport and see the planes flying over all 
the time," Higginbotham said. "But being at a show like this, seeing the planes 
up close and watching the aerobatics has got me seriously considering taking 
flight lessons. I think it'd be a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Gates will open at 7 a.m. today for the second day of the 14th Ventura County 
Experimental Aircraft Association's Fly-in/Air Show at the Camarillo Airport. A 
two-hour aerobatic program featuring several stunt aircraft will start at noon. 
The fly-in/air show will close at 2:30 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults. 
Children under 12 will be admitted free if accompanied by an adult.

VICTIMS STILL RECOVERING FROM JOLT TO THEIR LIVES; AFTERMATH: RESIDENTS ARE 
QUIETLY TRYING TO PUT THINGS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AS THE FOUR-MONTH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE QUAKE APPROACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the four-month anniversary of the Northridge earthquake approaches this 
week, San Fernando Valley residents continue to struggle with the temblor's 
invisible successors: bureaucracy, doubt and the longing for security. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rebuilding goes noisily on at downed freeways and heavily damaged 
apartment buildings, most quake victims are quietly trying to put things back 
together again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Perez, whose Pacoima house has only been partially repaired, longs for a 
past life of normalcy -- when her walls were free of cracks and she knew little 
about the workings of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor store owner Daniel Whang has borrowed from relatives and his children's 
college fund to help cover quake damage to his Northridge liquor store and 
Glendale apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sadd expected to be back in his Sherman Oaks home in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, faced with $200,000 in damage, he'll be lucky to be back home for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Joaquin Moreno has fully recovered, and is actually doing better than 
before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He has an apartment and a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was unemployed and living in a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, each aftershock sends  
</P>
<P>
 his mind spinning back to that dark morning in January when his world would 
not stop shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Perez  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huge cracks still splinter the outside of Lucy Perez's home, nearly four 
months after the Northridge quake rattled her Pacoima house and threw her life 
off kilter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 68-year-old widowed grandmother has a calm tone to her voice when she 
talks about recovering from the quake. And she has begun to express the hope 
that her life will fall back into place some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen tomorrow or the next day," she said. "But it will 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's optimism is in stark contrast with the anger and frustration she 
vented in the weeks immediately after the temblor caused about $44,000 in 
damage to the home she shares with her son and two teen-age grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, most of her rage was aimed at federal emergency officials and 
others who she said moved too slowly to provide help for working-class people 
like her family and her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before workers patched gaping openings and fractures in her 
living room walls and ceilings -- the first progress toward putting her home 
back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, that is where we are at," she said. "Others haven't even started 
(repairs) so I guess we are lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 That work was made possible by a $3,450 grant from FEMA. But it is only a 
fraction of the $44,100 Perez says is needed to repair her home and replace 
damaged furniture and personal items. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said the family used the entire grant, plus some of their own savings, 
to begin the inside repair work. Patching of the huge fissures in the stucco 
walls on the outside of her home will have to wait until they get more money. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is still a lot more work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the family's belongings remain in boxes in anticipation of the 
additional repair work they hope to launch soon. The bedrooms are still in 
disorder, so they must sleep on mattresses on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the kitchen is the next room to be repaired, Perez said, cooking 
utensils, food and other kitchen items have been packed away, making meal 
preparations nearly impossible. These days, she said, they eat out a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perez retains some anger for FEMA and other recovery agencies, which she 
says are still moving at an apathetic pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask them and ask them and they say 'Wait, wait, wait,' " she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Then her optimism breaks through again and she talks about how she knows 
things will somehow come out right in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to make it," Perez said. "Don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel K. Whang  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five years from now, when he reflects on how the earthquake changed his life, 
Daniel K. Whang thinks it will barely register a blip. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a merchant who, while still recovering financially from property 
damage sustained during the riots, suffered an additional $83,000 worth of 
quake damage to his Northridge liquor store and Glendale apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 The willingness of banks to grant loan extensions, and the fact that Whang was 
a man of means before the temblor, have made it easier for the store owner and 
his family to bounce back. During the past 10 weeks, lenders that held 
mortgages on his store, apartment property and home have allowed loan 
extensions of up to six months, giving him some fiscal breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Only his home lender is requiring that he pay in full several months' back 
mortgage payments on June 1. The others are redistributing his debt over 
periods of 18 months to 23 years, freeing up cash he is using to restock his 
store and repair his buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration also has granted Whang a six-month grace 
period before it will require payments on the riot-recovery loan issued for his 
South-Central liquor store, which was torched by arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an unexpected quake windfall, a surge in neighborhood construction has 
sent a steady stream of workers to Whang's Continental Liquor Store on Balboa 
Boulevard for beer, snacks and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have turned out better than I expected," Whang said as he counted out 
change for a customer. On a recent afternoon, money piled up in the cash 
register drawer -- which Whang didn't even bother to shut as he pulled down 
cigarettes and printed out lottery tickets for patrons.  
</P>
<P>
 Such bustling business does not pay all the bills, however. The merchant 
recently was forced to borrow $10,000 from his children's college fund and 
$6,000 from his sister to pay for repairs to his market and apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 His store counter and the area behind it has become a staging area from which 
he tackles all the paperwork applying for loans entails. During downtime at 
work, he follows up on the status of his commercial and SBA loans using a phone 
and fax machine, and drafts letters for his brother-in-law to type and send. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Whang has displayed an indefatigable, almost inexplicable, 
confidence in his future, an optimism which has been largely borne out so far. 
</P>
<P>
 As he rang up her purchases, a customer smiled at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Whang smiled back and answered, "I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sadd  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sadd is confident he has more than enough insurance to cover the 
$200,000 in repairs to his hillside home in Sherman Oaks, yet he's thinking of 
walking away from it all anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But parting company with his house may not be so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadd is afraid he wouldn't be able to sell it if he ever decided to because of 
the damage his neighborhood suffered. Even if he could find a willing buyer, 
financing might be elusive because half the nearby homes have been standing 
vacant since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an economic disincentive because of all the damage still around it," 
Sadd said. "You won't find a lender out here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest in a string of realizations forced on Sadd, 48, since the 
Northridge earthquake sent his house on stilts twisting and sliding 10 inches 
down a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize . . . I may be there for the rest of my life because I may not ever 
be able to sell it again, and that's something I never thought of before," said 
Sadd. "Even if I could snap my fingers and my house would be perfect, what kind 
of situation am I in?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Sadd, a Century City attorney, who must decide whether to 
repair his home or settle with his insurance companies and take the money and 
buy a new house in an unscarred neighborhood with healthy property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Sadd and his wife choose to stay and fix their home, they face months 
of repair, which they would wait out at a Westside house they have been renting 
since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, they expected their home to be ready in two months. That date came 
and went and they pushed their arrival date back to July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll be lucky to be home by Christmas," Sadd said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Sadd and his wife can make any decisions, he says they must find 
out how much each of their two insurance companies owes them -- though he says 
he's confident that he has enough coverage between the policies to cover all 
the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 They also expect to wait another two months for a structural engineer to 
complete final repair plans for their home. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few things that remain clear to Sadd is that he and his wife have 
some tough decisions ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in a middle-age situation like I am, it makes you realize you 
need to re-evaluate everything, from where you work to where you live," Sadd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice may be made for them should the final repair estimate exceed the 
current $200,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes much above there I think we'll just walk away and find a new 
home," Sadd said. "I hate to say it 'cause I love it there. Every time I go by 
I just want to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Moreno  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Moreno certainly never wished for an earthquake to knock his mobile 
home off its foundation and leave him on the brink of homelessness. But he 
might be one of the few quake victims who is truly better off today than he was 
four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the quake, Moreno, 29, was unemployed, and living in a cramped 
room in a Sylmar trailer with two roommates. Now, he has a job and a spacious 
apartment subsidized with federal relief funds. He even talks of saving enough 
money for a car or truck, something he hasn't had in almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing much better than before the earthquake," Moreno said. "Now I have 
my own place. . . . The last time I had my place was two years ago. I have 
everything I need. And the bathroom is never busy." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 16 months or so, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay 
about 60% of the rent for his $425-a-month apartment in Panorama City. The 
one-bedroom place on a busy stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard seems luxurious to 
Moreno -- it came furnished with two cream-colored sofas and a comfortable 
chair in the living room, along with a stove, a refrigerator, and a table and 
chairs for the kitchen. A bed and a big closet are in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends have chipped in to supply the rest: two telephones -- one for the 
living room and one for the bedroom -- a black-and-white television set and a 
microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment is also air conditioned, Moreno points out, handy for those 
summer days when the temperature is in the 90s and above. "This is very, very 
bueno," he said of his place, speaking in his characteristic mix of English and 
Spanish. "I have todo. " 
</P>
<P>
 Though modest, the apartment is a big step up from the San Fernando Recreation 
Center, where Moreno spent several weeks after the quake, sleeping on a cot in 
a shelter run by the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel lucky," Moreno said. "I feel really sorry for the people living 
without houses and things, because I know how that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said he isn't worried about what will happen once the FEMA subsidy 
ends. He tries to save money, he says, and is thinking about learning a trade: 
automotive repair, or maybe computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of April, Moreno switched jobs, and now works at Century Oldsmobile 
on Van Nuys Boulevard in Van Nuys where he drives customer's cars to the 
dealership garage for service. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he lives only 10 minutes from work, he takes only one bus, instead of 
the three he had to catch to get to his last job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moreno wants a car, one that he considers "top of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 What he means is that he'd love to get a Buick Riviera. Nothing fancy, he 
says, any year between 1979 and 1986 would be fine. After all, he can only 
spend about $1,500, which he doesn't have yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without the car he's happy. "I'm on the road again," he said. "I got 
an apartment. A job. I'm back. . . .Really."

STRAPPED POLICE PUT BURGLARIES ON BACK BURNER; CRIME: VENTURA COUNTY AGENCIES 
POINT TO SHRINKING BUDGETS AND FEWER OFFICERS. SITUATION FRUSTRATES VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Auto sales manager Bob Bowe arrived at work early last week to find that 
thieves had slipped into his Simi Valley dealership overnight, jacked up two 
pickup trucks and grabbed four new tires worth $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe was not only outraged by the thefts, but angry because police were quick 
to say there was not much they could do about the heist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a high priority," Bowe fumed, as he stood next to the tireless 
trucks and watched an officer fill out a theft report. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglaries and thefts, which make up 87.5% of crime in Ventura County, are not 
a high priority for Ventura County law enforcement agencies. Of the 26,808 
crimes reported last year in the county, about half were taken only as reports 
over the telephone and received no further investigation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police chiefs say years of shrinking budgets have meant fewer officers to 
respond to more crimes in a county that is growing ever larger and more 
violent. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of officers has forced every local police agency to make tough 
choices about which crimes they can still afford to investigate. Murders, rapes 
and robberies are top priorities--and violent crime is up one-third since 1980, 
while total crime is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the surge in violence, burglaries and thefts must take a back seat, 
especially in the majority of cases where there are no witnesses and little 
evidence, making the chances of solution low. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now take some reports over the phone, whereas 20 years ago an officer 
would have responded," Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas said. "We record the 
fact that the crime was committed, but we don't do any follow-up work. And we 
don't assign it to a detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and other top police officials say they are trying to save even more 
money by increasing the number of reports taken by phone and training more 
civilians to investigate crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not added an investigator in 10 years," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers are generally sent out to home and business burglaries, but they 
spend little time on them, authorities said. Officers say they spend only about 
an hour on a typical burglary and even less on a major theft such as the one at 
Bowe's Simi Valley car lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrolman Frank Ahlvers spent just 30 minutes questioning Bowe and dusting one 
pickup truck for fingerprints last Monday morning. The thieves had left only 
two rusty jacks for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting bolder and bolder and bolder," Bowe told the officer. He 
noted that the brazen bandits stole the tires even though the pickups were 
parked under bright lights and close to a street that is busy even late at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales manager questioned the officer: "How many patrol cars do you have 
out here? Not to insult you or anybody, but . . .!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlvers calmly responded: "Five or six. We've only got so many units out here. 
We can only do so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlvers, an 11-year veteran, said there is little hope that Bowe will get his 
tires back. The thieves were professionals who stole for resale, he said. And 
tires have no serial numbers and are nearly impossible to trace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in looking for specific targets," Ahlvers said. "They got a floor 
jack, an electric impact gun and pulled those puppies off--five minutes max." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the dealership, Ahlvers wrote a crime report and filed it away. 
Because there is nothing substantial for him to follow up, he will not 
investigate any further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only about 5% of the time is there anything to follow up," Ahlvers said. "If 
I'm lucky, I'll hear something later on in connection with this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless an eyewitness saw the crime, or pristine fingerprints are available, 
most burglary reports are filed away and never investigated further, Ahlvers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say they only have the manpower to investigate cases 
they have any hope of solving. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, police officers went into the field to do firsthand investigations 
of even routine, small-scale crimes such as bike thefts or missing garden 
hoses. Now, such routine reports are handled over the phone, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have limited resources, you have to prioritize," said Simi Valley 
Sgt. Robert Gardner, who is in charge of investigating property crimes. "If we 
go to a scene, and the victim says, 'It was there, and now it's gone,' there's 
nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Police also say the increase in violent crimes has sapped their resources in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a higher priority on life and individuals than we do on property," 
Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said. "We're having more violent crime, and we 
have not made a significant increase in the number of officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Police Chief Kathy Kemp said she recently transferred one of her 
detectives from a property crime detail to the major crimes unit, which 
investigates violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In most burglaries, detectives say, the usual crime-solving methods involve 
interviewing witnesses, fingerprinting and checking the pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ventura, which has one of the highest burglary rates in the county, 
police say they don't take fingerprints at some burglaries, depending on the 
surfaces. For a fingerprint to be any good, it has to be clear and not smeared, 
Cpl. John Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks fingerprints can be taken off the sand, off the wood, you 
name it," Leach said. However, glass, metal and other smooth, polished surfaces 
work best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if police lift decent prints, it only pays off if the suspect's 
fingerprints are on file with state or federal agencies, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Thayer, a 36-year-old machine engineer, said he was burglarized twice, 
and both times he asked officers to take fingerprints. And both times they 
refused, he said, saying it was not worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1992, Thayer had about $2,000 worth of tools and equipment stolen 
from the private storage company where they were kept. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides declining to take fingerprints, Thayer said police "didn't even list 
what I lost, because I couldn't remember precisely everything that was there. 
They told me to send them a list." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, Thayer was victimized again. This time, burglars snatched a 
specialized sliding window and an engine part from his pickup truck, which was 
parked outside his apartment in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer said he called Port Hueneme police and encountered the same apathetic 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never took a fingerprint, even though there were fingerprints all over 
the place," Thayer said. "They said it was too much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Tony Paradis, who investigates burglaries for Port Hueneme, said 
patrol officers in his department are supposed to dust for fingerprints off any 
surface that may retain prints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks we're MacGyver," Paradis said, referring to the crime-solving 
hero of a television program. "No one realizes how sophisticated some of these 
14-year-old burglars are. Eighty percent of the time, you never get a print." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paradis said it's understandable that victims feel resentful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pure frustration," Paradis said. "I've been a victim of an auto burglary 
myself a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradis said police are upfront with burglary victims about whether they have 
any hope of getting their property back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let people know exactly what the score is," Paradis said. "If we have 
something that we think will lead to an arrest, we'll tell them. If we have a 
big zero, we'll tell them that too. You don't want to give people false hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Most burglaries are committed by addicts looking to trade stolen merchandise 
for drugs, Paradis said. Even if police manage to arrest the burglar, chances 
are the victim won't get his or her property back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, in most burglaries, it will be sold within a few minutes, and 
those folks won't ever give up their dope connections," Paradis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police advise residents to keep a record of the serial numbers on their 
property, and to put their driver's license numbers on property that doesn't 
have serial numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just found a gun that was stolen more than 20 years ago," Ventura Cpl. 
Leach said. "The police found it in New York and mailed it back to us because 
it had a serial number on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thayer and other burglary victims who have not recovered their stolen 
property are often left disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will spend money to give me a speeding ticket, which in the big scheme 
of crime is pretty trivial," Thayer said. "But when something major happens to 
me, they do nothing." 
</P>

CONDO OWNERS DELAY VOTE ON ABANDONING UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a Reseda condominium association have delayed a vote on whether to 
walk away from their earthquake-damaged units after attorneys for a real estate 
lender obtained a temporary restraining order to stop any action. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from North American Mortgage Co. showed up at a Sherman Court 
Condominium Assn. meeting Friday and told residents of the 132-unit complex at 
19350 Sherman Way that they could not vote on the matter until after they had 
consulted with officials of the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, an association board member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old federally subsidized complex houses mostly single women and 
families, said board member Terry Feld, adding that it would cost $3 million to 
repair the yellow-tagged units. 
</P>
<P>
 If residents vote to abandon their units, it would be the second condominium 
association known to have done so since the Jan. 17 earthquake. In March, 
residents of a 30-unit complex in Sherman Oaks, some of whom owned their units 
outright, voted to abandon their homes because they could not afford to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have rescheduled the vote for May 26.

POSTAL WORKERS ALSO COLLECT THE GOODS; CHARITY: MAIL CARRIERS PICK UP 
NON-PERISHABLE FOOD DONATED BY RESIDENTS AS PART OF AN ANNUAL DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most mail carriers came back to their post offices Saturday with heavier loads 
than when they left on their routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal workers returned with bags and boxes of non-perishable food items left 
at mailboxes by residents participating in the annual national food drive for 
the needy sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service and the National Assn. of Letter 
Carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a rewarding thing, and good to make it so convenient for 
people," said letter carrier Chris Guyse of Reseda, who works at the Northridge 
Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake, the volume of canned goods and 
foodstuffs was lower than last year in Northridge. But mail carrier Kurt 
Whitesell said the collection has a bright future because people trust mail 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they trust us with their checks, they'll trust us with a few canned 
goods," said Whitesell, who is living temporarily in Canyon Country because the 
quake forced him out of his Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers sorting bags of food instead of mail late Saturday said that the 
Northridge office has been involved in volunteer food drives for years. But the 
current cooperative effort between the letter carriers' union and the U.S. 
Postal Service dates from the first drive in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual collection date was switched last year to May because officials 
said that food banks are lowest in supplies as summer approaches and donations 
dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Marva Golden, chief shop steward at the Northridge branch who was donating her 
time Saturday, said Lutheran Social Services and B'nai B'rith will collect the 
foodstuff from the Northridge and Porter Ranch branches. But across the San 
Fernando Valley area, a variety of nonprofit agencies, religious and secular, 
will receive the food for their hunger relief programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail carriers who walk their routes had to design a new strategy so they would 
not be overloaded with donations too far from their trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavin Williams felt he had a plan. "I pretty well know who's going to donate," 
said Williams who has been on the same route for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, whose mail had already been delivered, ran out with a paper bag 
filled with cans to Williams' truck. "Kavin, I forgot to put my cans out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Thomas, a 21-year-old Cal State Northridge student who lives in an 
apartment complex, said, "I didn't remember that this was the day until I saw 
somebody else's bag by the mailboxes. It could have been more publicized." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Northridge Post Office, several workers were pawing through large 
mail bins full of groceries searching for a carrier's beeper that had fallen 
in. One carrier lost a receipt from an express-mail delivery while unloading 
her groceries. Another worker luckily spotted her dog-spray repellent that had 
fallen out of her jacket as she helped with the bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated cans and packaged groceries were as varied as any supermarket's 
stock, but carrier Peter Butcher held up an item especially familiar to postal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, what's this stuff?" he asked. "Didn't we deliver this?" 
</P>
<P>
 To the chuckles of colleagues nearby, Butcher displayed two small cereal 
boxes, still unopened and held together by clear plastic wrapping. There were, 
in fact, quite a few of those mailed samples sticking out of bags.

47-YEAR-OLD EARNS TOP HONOR AT GRADUATION; CAL LUTHERAN: KAREN SEARLE HAS 
HIGHEST GRADE-POINT AVERAGE IN HER CLASS. SHE SHARES THE PRESTIGIOUS DEAN'S 
AWARD WITH LANCE YOUNG. 
</P>

<P>
 Of all the awards she won from Cal Lutheran University last week, graduating 
senior Karen Searle was most effusive about the pen set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried it out," Searle told a friend Saturday morning as they gathered with 
other black-robed classmates for a photo before commencement began. "It really 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 433 undergraduate students who received their degrees Saturday, Searle, 
who majored in computer-information systems, is one of the least traditional 
and most successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old divorced mother of three worked full time, attended classes at 
night, studied weekends and still managed to emerge with the highest 
grade-point average in her class, a 3.93. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pen set -- which she got for graduating summa cum laude -- 
and departmental honors, Searle won the Dean's Award, Cal Lutheran's highest 
academic award, along with senior Lance Young. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 433 undergraduates and 199 graduate students received degrees at 
Cal Lutheran's graduation Saturday morning, held under sunny skies in the 
school's football stadium before thousands of parents and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern novelist Rudolfo Anaya, author of "Bless Me, Ultima," gave the 
commencement address and accepted an honorary doctorate of humane letters. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps of many of the graduating students were adorned with masking tape 
messages to their parents and friends, and there were even some directed at the 
hands of fate. "HELP ME," begged Chad Hellmuth's cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Hellmuth, from Santa Monica, said he wasn't as distraught as his cap 
indicated. A communications major, he has a job already, as a production 
assistant in Studio City. He said his plea for help was more directed at the 
notion of leaving the comfortable and friendly surroundings of the Thousand 
Oaks campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that you're leaving another family behind when you leave school," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tressa Padellford of Denver, a biology major who hopes to get her master's 
degree in genetic biology, said she was nervously awaiting word from graduate 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit disconcerting to be at graduation not knowing if I got in," 
she said. But a more immediate concern was whether her mother would ignore her 
requests and turn up at the end of the ceremony with a bouquet of balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really bad for the environment," she told her grandmother. "I hope 
she doesn't do it."  
</P>
<P>
 Wearing the Cal Lutheran purple-and-gold hood over her black gown, Searle 
accepted her diploma with a delighted smile. A gold cord around her neck 
signified that she was graduating with honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced five years ago, Searle decided to go back to school to finish a 
degree she'd begun at Pierce College in the 1960s, continued at Moorpark 
College and put aside to return to work. She has been taking classes in Cal 
Lutheran's evening program for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got to the point where the kids were grown up and I had time to do 
things for myself," Searle said. She has two daughters, Kellie, 23, a student 
at UC Santa Barbara and Joanna, 21, a student at Santa Barbara City College. A 
son, Robert, 18, just started Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 With an associate of arts degree from Moorpark, Searle worked her way into a 
senior compensation analyst position at Hughes Missile Systems Co. in Canoga 
Park. But she worried that doors outside Hughes would be shut to her without a 
bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran was a logical choice, she said, because it was so close to her 
Simi Valley home. Hughes agreed to pay the entire cost of her education. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Lopez Hayden, the director of admissions and student services for Cal 
Lutheran's adult education program, said it was unusual for an ADEP student to 
win the top academic award, but Searle had impressed her instantly with her 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very direct, she knew what she wanted and she was very outspoken," 
Lopez Hayden said. "I knew right away she was going to be a real hard worker. 
But I just don't know where she gets all that energy." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was younger, Searle said, she concentrated that energy at home: She 
did everything from installing toilets to building an entire bedroom set for 
her son. The ambition to succeed in the workplace came later.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was first married, I was just a really non-confident little shrinking 
violet," Searle said. "But the best thing about being 47 is that I'm smart 
enough to know what makes me grow personally and to go ahead and do it. " 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, her schedule has required all her energy. Her division at 
Hughes moved to Tucson, Ariz. Because she wanted to stay near her children, she 
ended up flying to Tucson and back every Wednesday. Mondays and Tuesdays she 
worked at the company's Canoga Park office and took classes at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Thursday I was usually a blithering idiot," she said. She usually put off 
homework until the weekend to give herself time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she has a little more time to herself with the degree completed, 
Searle is looking ahead to improved prospects in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I filled in some spaces," she said. "There were some areas where I wanted to 
make sure I had all the tools. This is going to make me able to go faster in 
the direction I wanted to go in." 
</P>
<P>
 But she might not be through with classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about installing tile in the entryway," she said. "So I 
might take a tiling class."

INCUMBENT SPENDING EXUDES CONFIDENCE; POLITICS: REPUBLICANS RUNNING HAVEN'T 
BEEN OUT TRYING TO STUFF THEIR CAMPAIGN COFFERS, AFFIRMING THE COUNTY'S STATUS 
AS A GOP SAFEHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If their campaign bank accounts are any indication, Orange County's GOP 
incumbents are more than confident of victory as they head toward the June 
congressional primary. It's not that they are rolling in cash; it's that many 
of them have hardly bothered to raise much of it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 And why should they? In only half of the six races has a fellow Republican 
dared to challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of (Orange County) Republicans have gotten used to not only having much 
more money than they can spend, but also not paying much attention to raising 
it," said Mark Petracca, associate professor of political science at UC Irvine. 
"They know the Democrats who go up against them are suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a month to go before the June 7 primary election, most of the 
incumbents were financially comfortable, though hardly flush with cash. Even 
so, they were substantially richer than any of their Democratic challengers and 
seemed scarcely worried about the general election looming in November, 
affirming once again Orange County's enduring status as a Republican safehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign fund-raising statements filed with the Federal Elections Commission 
for the first quarter of this year showed that Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) had 
about $47,018 in cash on hand. That makes him a relative pauper compared to 
congressmen such as David Dreier (R-San Dimas), who had $2.2 million at the end 
of last year, more than any other House member.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) spent a mere $11,000 campaigning in that 
three-month period. Packard is one of the three incumbents facing a primary 
challenge, but his opponent, Mission Viejo realtor Ed Mayerhofer, had not filed 
FEC spending reports by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, the incumbent with the largest 
amount of money in the bank, appeared to have little reason to be so 
well-prepared. As of the end of March, the Cox camp had $263,766 on hand. 
Republican Steven J. Frogue of Lake Forest had filed to run against him; Cox's 
only challenger to file campaign finance papers, Democrat J. Wayne Allen, 
listed a war chest of $5.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Another round of financial statements must be filed May 26, but the picture is 
not likely to change. In every case, incumbents are raising more than their 
rivals. And while money is not always a measure of muscle -- Democrat Robert J. 
Banuelos raised and spent only about $5,000 in 1992 but lost to Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) by just 10 points -- it generally goes a long way 
toward winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, long known as one of the most prolific fund-raisers in the House -- 
heads toward November with 10 times the funds amassed by his strongest 
Democratic challenger. Dornan's cash on hand was listed at $85,415, while his 
Democratic challengers had far less: Michael Farber had $8,546, John M. Ivler 
listed $2,559 and Madelene E. Arakelian had $1,622. No other candidate, include 
Banuelos, who is running again, had filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The same imbalance held true in the 39th District, where Royce's Democratic 
opponent, R.O. (Bob) Davis, listed his remaining cash at $100.02. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 45th District, Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) reported $80,320 
still in his treasury, compared to attorney Brett Williamson, a Democrat, who 
had $18,450. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some observers believe Williamson has as good a shot as any of 
unseating the three-term congressman, Rohrabacher was confident he would be 
celebrating election night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent, Brett Williamson, criticized me the other day for taking away 
benefits from illegal immigrants," chortled Rohrabacher, who has lately made 
illegal immigration his battle cry. "If that's what he has to criticize me for, 
I don't think I have much to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Only Rep. Jay C. Kim of Diamond Bar, whose district takes in a sliver of 
Orange County, is facing a serious challenge in the primary. Shadowed by 
allegations that he violated campaign, labor and tax laws relating to his 
engineering firm and his 1992 campaign, Kim appeared to be working hard to 
retain his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign spending reports, he raised $104,377 -- primarily in 
small donations from Korean Americans around the country -- and spent $81,041 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although six Republicans are challenging Kim in the primary, only one had 
filed campaign spending reports. That candidate, businesswoman Valerie Romero, 
listed cash on hand of $17,415. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Democrat challenging Kim who had filed spending papers was Ed 
Tessier, who had $787 in his campaign fund.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EL RIO; VOLUNTEERS BRUSH UP ON CIVIC PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with rollers, brushes and buckets of beige paint, 73 children and their 
families covered graffiti-scrawled walls in El Rio with fresh coats of enamel 
in an effort to clean up their community Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio, north of Oxnard, has wrestled with graffiti and gang violence in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting pretty bad," said Manuela Gonzales, a parent and teacher's aide 
at Rio Real Elementary School, who was painting a wall along Rose Avenue with 
her husband and their two sons. "Maybe by doing this, some of the kids in the 
area will think twice." 
</P>
<P>
 John Lagomarsino, a fifth-grader at Rio Real, splattered himself with brown 
paint while running his roller over a brick wall. The 11-year-old said he came 
out Saturday "to clean up graffiti because our neighborhood is ugly -- and I 
wanted to get dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup project was started by the student council at Rio Real after 300 
students voted to form a club called the Graffiti Busters. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which has enlisted the help of local residents and businesses, plans 
to paint over graffiti in the unincorporated areas of El Rio, Nyeland Acres and 
Strickland Acres every four months. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio resident Beverly Philhower, whose son, Frank, is in Rio Real's student 
council, proposed the idea and helped organize Saturday's cleanup day, which 
was kicked off by Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a good community effort," Philhower said. "You talk to most people 
who live here, they love El Rio." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Serros, a liaison from Flynn's office, said she was impressed with 
the number of children involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community spirit out here is just amazing," she said. "This is like an 
empowerment zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot donated nearly $500 worth of painting supplies, the city of Oxnard 
donated paint, and Taco Bell supplied about $300 worth of food for the 
children, Serros said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a real wealthy area, so it would have been hard to raise money for 
this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department also provided extra units that 
patrolled the areas where the children were painting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Cruz, 12, a sixth-grader at Rio Real, wore a giant smile after helping 
to paint on Balboa Street and Rio School Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alley over there was filled with graffiti and I walked down there 10 
minutes ago and it was all painted," he said. "It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank acknowledged that taggers probably would spray-paint the walls again but 
said the club would respond accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will stay clean for maybe a month and then they'll be back out," 
Frank said. "But we'll be back. I'm almost sure we have more people than they 
do." TRACY WILSON

2 ARRESTED IN FATAL SHOOTING AT APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested two men on suspicion of murder in connection with the death of 
a man whose badly burned remains were found Saturday in the trunk of a car 
abandoned at a Reseda auto-supply store, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Michael Sam Casamento, 25, and Michael Wilfred Wells, 45, 
shot a still unidentified 24-year-old man several times in the head and chest 
at their Encino apartment complex. Authorities said the men then dumped the 
body down a garbage chute, stuffed it into the trunk of his girlfriend's car 
and drove it to Chief Auto Supply at Reseda Boulevard and Saticoy Street, where 
they set the car afire. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Rick Swanston of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley 
Division said police found evidence of cocaine and cocaine sales in Wells' 
apartment and believe the dispute was drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight Friday, patrol officers were called to an apartment 
building in the 5300 block of Newcastle Avenue by neighbors who reported 
hearing gunshots. There, the officers saw Casamento, a resident of the complex, 
deposit a bag into the trash chute, Swanston said.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers left the scene after briefly questioning Casamento, but returned 
more than an hour later after an anonymous tipster told police about a pool of 
blood in the complex's carport. 
</P>
<P>
 Police followed a blood trail from the carport to the trash chute, recovered a 
bag full of bloody clothing and again detained Casamento. While they were 
questioning him, police stopped Wells as he left his apartment wearing clothing 
covered with blood, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So they grab (Wells), they look in his apartment and there's blood in his 
apartment and there's a blood trail going from his door to the trash shoot," 
Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanston said police also found a cache of more than 30 rifles and handguns 
and a stock of knives in Wells' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe the men drove the car to Reseda between the first and 
second time officers were on the scene, Swanston said. The auto-supply store 
manager found the burned car Saturday morning and had it impounded, and police 
found the body after linking the impounded vehicle to a license and papers 
found in Wells' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's sloppy or brazen," Swanston said. "They take a major 
intersection at Reseda and Saticoy and set this car on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells and Casamento were booked for murder and held without bail at the West 
Valley jail.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; MR. 
DEMOCRAT O'NEILL SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS DON'T MATCH THIS BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wrong shade of Brown: As the former state and local Democratic Party chairman, 
Orange County businessman Richard J. O'Neill supported the campaigns of former 
Govs. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and his son, Jerry. But the other member of the 
Brown family now running for governor, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, won't 
get O'Neill's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill is sponsoring a fund-raiser on Tuesday for another Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who calls herself "a different shade of Brown," has not defined her 
positions well enough to suit O'Neill, he says. "I just feel she didn't promise 
enough. I don't go for somebody with blind faith." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Generation gap: During one of his recent stops to Orange County, Republican 
gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz didn't need to say too much to show how 
different he is from Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and the Democratic candidates 
Brown, Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old theoretical physicist and owner of a Silicon Valley computer 
software company is obviously the youngest candidate in the race. But he won a 
hearty round of applause during a recent meeting of the Young Republicans of 
Orange County as he listed reasons why his candidacy should be taken seriously, 
despite the long odds against him winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have actually worked more days in my life in the real world than all four 
of them put together," Unz said of the career politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Politically correct: Hoping to help define what American policy should be in 
Bosnia and the Balkans, the House Foreign Affairs Committee lined up a bunch of 
important witnesses for an upcoming hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble is, they forgot to invite any Bosnians, causing committee 
member Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) to get--as an aide put 
it--"exercised." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to have a hearing on Bosnia, we oughta have some Bosnians," 
Rohrabacher grumbled, after reviewing a witness list that included the former 
president of the Serbian Unity Congress of America and two officials from the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members heard the rumblings of protest. "At the last minute, they 
threw in a Croatian," Rohrabacher said, still displeased. "I don't know how you 
can discuss crime without talking to at least one victim." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Politically incorrect: Orange County Democratic Foundation Chairman Wylie A. 
Aitken is not usually mistaken for a Republican. But it happened last week, 
when he received in the mail a "non-transferable" membership card from the 
Republican National Committee. The card allows him entry to the Eisenhower 
museum and the national GOP headquarters in Washington, D.C. "I'll be sure to 
drop by the next time I'm in Washington and see if I'm arrested," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salute: At the first of what are sure to be many tribute dinners for retiring 
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, Chapman University officials 
last week decided to keep the roasting to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they presented a 15-minute video titled "General Principles, Tom 
Riley: Lessons from a Life," in which colleagues and friends lauded the former 
Marine Corps brigadier general for his endurance and integrity in a 20-year 
career on the county board. 
</P>
<P>
 In the video, mixed with photos from his college football career at Virginia 
Military Institute, Stan Oftelie, Orange County Transportation Authority 
director, said that Riley's life followed the example of another great general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Riley has what George Washington would say is the greatest of accolades: 
the character of an honest man." UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>

2 seat, will hold a fund-raiser at Old World, 7561 Center Ave., Huntington

2,000 KIDS HIT STREETS WITH ANTI-DRUGS, GANGS MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their cries of "no more drugs" ricocheted off apartment buildings, stores and 
houses along their three-mile , winding path, leaving a wake of clapping and 
honking residents and commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in bright-red shirts and carrying colorful banners announcing the 
march's theme, "Celebrate Family Unity with Pride," 2,000 local elementary and 
intermediate students delivered their anti-drug, anti-gang message along 
Bristol Street and Civic Center Drive early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these kids live in areas where drugs and gangs are visible," said 
Jenny Rios, coordinator of the fifth annual Project PRIDE (Parks and Recreation 
Inspire Dignity and Esteem), Santa Ana's gang prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give them the resolve early in life to combat those things," Rios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ricardo Aguilar, 13, from Sierra Intermediate School in Santa Ana, the 
march was the culmination of a year of Project Pride activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the drugs and the gangs near my school, but this program lets me know 
that there is something more important to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios said the program, which has a year-round "homework lab," and other 
activities, targets children at risk, those who may have been exposed to or are 
likely to be exposed to gangs and drugs. She said Saturday's events were held 
to congratulate the students who had participated in the program throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before beginning the procession beginning at Rancho Santiago College, the 
students, from the Santa Ana and Garden Grove unified school districts, were 
treated to several skits, including a "speaking puppet" show performed by Santa 
Ana DARE Officer John Reed, a ventriloquist. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon-toting youngsters were then led by the horns, drums, and 
cheerleaders of Carr Intermediate School Band from a parking lot at the college 
to 17th Street and Bristol Street, where they stopped and chanted to surprised 
onlookers before continuing their march. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see all these ninos and ninas out here marching for something," 
said Carlos Espinoza, who waited for the block - long procession to filter down 
Civic Center Drive so he could drive away. 
</P>

FIRE AT DWP CAUSES BLACKOUT IN VALLEY AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire caused more than $2 million in damage to a Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power receiving station late Friday and left 20,000 homes and 
businesses in the eastern San Fernando Valley without power for two hours, a 
DWP spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blaze, which ignited in a transformer bank, is unknown, said 
Lucila Alvelais of the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported just before midnight. Nine engine companies put the fire 
on Whitnall Highway out in 45 minutes, said Bob Collis of the Los Angeles City 
Fire Department. There were no injuries, and the cause of the fire is being 
investigated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The power outage at the automated station affected portions of North 
Hollywood, Studio City, Burbank and Glendale.

CONFUSION BLAMED FOR SCHOOL BOND FAILURE; EDUCATION: BURBANK RESIDENTS WERE 
UNSURE HOW FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT OR HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A $100-million bond measure to renovate and repair Burbank's public schools 
failed on the April ballot because some residents didn't understand how the 
money would be spent and how much it would cost them, school board members 
learned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A town meeting in the library of Burbank High School, the site most in need of 
reconstruction and repair within the school district, was intended to help 
board members figure out what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they got, for the most part, was an earful of complaints from some of 
the more than 30 people at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question for me is how much money do you really need?" said resident John 
Phillips. "If you go with a bond issue, my recommendation is that it's a 
reasonable amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this economy, with this public, you didn't realize who you were selling 
to. Everyone wanted to vote for it. . . . No one could understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members acknowledged that information distributed to the public about 
the bond measure did not make clear where certain dollar figures came from. 
They were advised by unpaid consultants "to debate the need, not the numbers," 
said board member Denise Lioy Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of Burbank's public schools are in need of renovation, many 
residents and officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the $100-million bond measure, expected to cost most residents less than 
$50 a year, the district would have received an additional $23 million from the 
city's Redevelopment Agency and $15 million from the state -- for a total of 
$138 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank High School, which is about 70 years old, was slated to receive nearly 
$56 million to be completely rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure garnered 53% of the vote on April 12, but needed a two-thirds 
majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Murphy, wife of former Councilman Tim Murphy, told the board she was 
shocked by its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know our schools need to be revamped," she said. "Just tell us where you 
got the numbers. People didn't understand all the factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the suggestions by residents included hiring a public relations firm 
to work on a future bond issue and establishing a committee of volunteers to 
point the board toward the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of people out there who don't trust the school board 
and City Council," said Bill Wiggins, Burbank's new mayor.

FOOD DRIVE COLLECTS 30 TONS OF GROCERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U. S. Postal Service workers and representatives of Food Share, an 
Oxnard-based food bank, collected 30 tons of groceries Saturday as part of a 
nationwide food drive sponsored by the National Assn. of Letter Carriers and 
the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year that mail carriers and the regional food bank have 
joined forces to stockpile provisions for hungry county residents. More than 40 
tons of food was collected during last year's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter carriers filled their trucks Saturday with bags of canned food, which 
Ventura County residents had set outside to be donated to Food Share. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had carriers who've made two trips," said Troy Dickey, customer service 
supervisor for the Postal Service's East Ventura Station on Wake Forest Avenue. 
"They're doing their route at the start of the day to deliver mail, then they 
drive back and pick up food." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really been a good response from the community," he said, gesturing 
to several large canvas mail carts stuffed with groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 At various post offices around the county, volunteers sorted and packed cans 
of soup and packages of rice and pasta, which were later delivered to the food 
bank's warehouse in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Elle Dulaney, standing among boxes of provisions stacked on the East 
Ventura Station loading dock, said she was impressed with the response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always nice when (people) come through," she said. A Ventura resident 
who has volunteered at the food bank for four years, Dulaney said the drive 
would help replenish the food bank's supply, which was strained after January's 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share delivered about 1.5 million pounds of food to disaster areas after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major drive for the food bank," said Jewel Pedi, former executive 
director of Food Share, which feeds more than 127,000 people a month in Ventura 
County. "And of course with the earthquake, (we) really need it."

<P>
 A friendly poker game erupted into a shootout Saturday in a rural area of 
Canyon Country, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 7 p.m., three men playing cards during a party at a ranch in the 
16100 block of Sierra Highway got into an argument with their hosts over 
winnings and left the party.The men returned later and two of them got out of a 
car and fired an unknown number of shots at the house, said Sgt. Bruce 
Sonnenblick of the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station.  
</P>
<P>
 Women and children were among about 25 guests at the party and were inside the 
house at the time of the shooting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Martin Rico Hernandez, 30, of Canyon Country was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 A .9-millimeter handgun and ammunition were found in his car, authorities 
said. The two shooters are still at large.

TEACHERS REJECT PAY CONTRACT; MANHATTAN BEACH: THE PACT IS REJECTED ON A VOTE 
OF 166 TO 26. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITHOUT A CONTRACT FOR EIGHT MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach teachers have overwhelmingly rejected a new contract, refusing 
to accept a deal that would have left nearly one-third of them without a raise 
for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, which teachers rejected by a 166-26 margin last week, would have 
held high school teachers' salaries to 1991-92 pay levels for the 1993-94 
school year.  
</P>
<P>
 Elementary teachers would have received an average raise of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 All teachers would have received a 3% raise for the 1994-95 school year. 
Teachers in the Manhattan Beach district earn $25,000 to $51,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been working without a contract for eight months. An impasse in 
contract talks was declared last March and a state mediator was brought in. The 
mediator offered the compromise contract in April, and negotiators agreed to 
take the proposal back to the school board and the teachers for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the proposed contract unanimously. But for the 
teachers union, the biggest obstacle was the lack of a raise for high school 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 A disparity in salaries arose when Manhattan Beach City School District and 
Mira Costa High School merged last year to form the Manhattan Beach Unified 
School District. Mira Costa High School salaries were higher than those of 
elementary teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach Unified officials say a $1.5-million cut in state funding and 
a projected deficit meant that some teachers would have to go without a raise.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for more upward movement in the salaries," said Bob Sumpter, 
president of the Manhattan Beach Teachers Assn. "We're talking about three 
years at the same pay level for the high school teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 The union executive committee, which was not part of the bargaining team, 
voted 12 to 0 to recommend that members turn down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumpter said teachers are still willing to negotiate with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials were angry about the vote. "We're obviously very 
disappointed that it was voted down," said Catherine Hagen, legal counsel for 
the district. "My understanding is that the mediator still has jurisdiction and 
that he is looking at a date to resume the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said administration bargainers felt deceived by union negotiators.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will need to evaluate whether we're willing to bargain with the teachers' 
bargaining team or demand one that really represents the union," Hagen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Union officials, however, say they didn't endorse the district's offer but 
were obligated to bring it before the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation is expected to resume this month or early next month.

ANGRY EQUESTRIANS DECRY PROPOSED HORSE REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 San Fernando Valley horse owners last week blasted a complicated 
set of restrictions they fear are designed to drive their beloved animals out 
of suburban neighborhoods across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a raucous 90-minute meeting Thursday at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, a 
standing-room-only crowd of equestrians decried a proposed Los Angeles law that 
would more closely regulate how horses are kept within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to change a whole lifestyle for a lot of people," Granada 
Hills resident Kent Lovelady said. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this 
is warped to suit somebody's needs, but not a horse owner's." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovelady and other equestrians said they felt betrayed because planners did 
not listen to recommendations they made in a 1992 document dubbed "The Horse 
Owner's Bill of Rights." That report was prepared at the request of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Hal Bernson, who wanted to streamline the complicated laws now 
governing horse keeping and to balance the needs of horse owners with the 
desires of developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But planners who drafted the regulations say the new rules would actually make 
it easier for horse owners to maintain their lifestyle in the face of pressure 
from developers. In fact, they said, the bulk of the new regulations are minor 
changes to existing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no conspiracy here," city planner Steve Ciccarelli said. "There 
really isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the regulations would require 2,000 square feet of corral 
space for horses. Opponents claim that is too much space and they also attack a 
requirement to set pens and stables back at least 10 feet from property lines. 
Existing properties that do not meet the requirements would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a licensed horse has not been kept on the property for more than three 
years, a property owner would be required to make the necessary changes before 
a new horse would be allowed. Opponents complain that would leave them with no 
flexibility and unable to sell their property to other horse enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission was to consider the regulations Thursday, but the vote 
was delayed at least two weeks because the body lacked a quorum. Arline 
DeSanctis, field deputy for City Councilman Joel Wachs, said her office will 
ask the Planning Department to meet with equestrians before the next meeting to 
talk about the regulations and to try to iron out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are totally confused right now," DeSanctis said. AARON CURTISS

2 TEACHERS LEAD DRIVE TO OPEN LONG BEACH CHARTER SCHOOL; EDUCATION: ORGANIZERS 
SAY THE PROPOSAL FOR A CAMPUS DOWNTOWN WOULD REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND 
BOOST TEST SCORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teachers are leading an effort to create the first independent charter 
school in Long Beach, which they said would save administrative costs while 
boosting test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Constellation Community Middle School would enroll about 120 
students, all of whom would enter as sixth-graders and remain in the school 
through eighth grade. At the end of three years, the school would enroll 
another class of sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers Jim Norris and Mary Ruffner, who teach at Benjamin Franklin Middle 
School, have gathered signatures on petitions and have asked the Long Beach 
Unified School District to approve their proposal to set up the school in 
downtown Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The teachers hope that the ethnic makeup of the students attending the school 
will reflect the population of the downtown area, which is primarily Latino, 
Cambodian and African American. Facilities at St. Luke's Episcopal Church at 
Seventh Street and Atlantic Avenue have been listed as a tentative site for the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many district officials said they favor the proposal, calling it an innovative 
idea that deserves to be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the union that represents non-teaching employees, however, said 
they fear that a charter school could cost some employees their jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to consider the proposal at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter school would receive $432,000 under the same formula as other 
schools in the district. The staff would consist of four teachers and two 
bilingual aides. A seven-member council of teachers, parents and community 
representatives would oversee the school, which would open in the fall of 1995 
if approved, Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they hope that teachers would design their own curriculum and 
arrange their own support services, freeing up money to buy computers and other 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at where our priorities are and where we can get the most 
educational bang for our buck," Norris said. "All of the money (would be) 
focused right into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the California School Employees Assn., which represents such 
support personnel as secretaries, custodians and instructional aides, 
questioned whether the school could function with such a small staff. 
</P>
<P>
 School organizers "are underestimating the difficulties they are going to 
encounter without all of the administrative, maintenance and clerical support 
they would get from the district," said Richard Sharp, labor relations 
representative for the organization. Sharp said he plans to meet with Norris to 
discuss the union's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools Supt. Carl A. Cohn said he favors the charter proposal. He pointed out 
that the school board is encouraging innovative approaches that might help 
boost student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administration of the school district will not be an obstacle to this 
going through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Ed Eveland initially said he was concerned that the small 
staff would be granted too much administrative independence, but withdrew his 
opposition after meeting with Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt," Eveland said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the plan, the proposal would be forwarded to the State 
Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is rejected, the organizers could appeal to the County Office of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 law allows charter schools to have virtual freedom from local and state 
school regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 charter schools are operating in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Two charter-school proposals were rejected last August in Compton by Stanley 
G. Oswalt, then acting administrator, who said that the plans for an elementary 
school and middle school were incomplete and that the schools might be too 
costly.

BONE MARROW RECIPIENT MEETS TARZANA LIFESAVER; MEDICAL: THE TWO ARE UNITED IN A 
TEARFUL CEREMONY MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE 27-YEAR-OLD WOMAN LEARNED SHE 
WOULD DIE WITHOUT A DONOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Under the rush of emotion, Tracy Van Ryswyk found simple words work best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," the 27-year-old waitress and cosmetologist said again and again. 
"Thank you. Thank you for saving my life." 
</P>
<P>
 For Paramount television executive Joe Lucas, there were no words at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were united in a tearful ceremony organized by the American Red Cross 
on Wednesday night, more than two years after the tall, bright-eyed Van Ryswyk 
learned she'd die without a bone marrow donor, and one year after Lucas, of 
Tarzana, underwent surgery to save the life of a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony at Paramount Studios in Hollywood -- which also honored 25 other 
marrow donors from Southern California -- brought to a close two years of hope 
and fear and unanswered questions for those on both the giving and receiving 
ends of the biological gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old Lucas was introduced to bone marrow transplants on his way 
home from a softball game in 1990. A friend stopped to have his blood tested, 
hoping he could match tissue types with the young Adam Brock, whose search for 
a donor had captivated the Los Angeles area at the time. The friend invited 
Lucas to be tested as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither matched (and the 12-year-old Brock died in 1991, before a donor could 
be found) but both registered their names with the National Marrow Donor 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later and more than 500 miles away in Mesa, Ariz., Van Ryswyk became 
ill. She began thinking something was seriously wrong, despite reassurances 
from various doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having stomach problems," she said. "My spleen was getting really big." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, she was diagnosed with chronic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The options were horrifyingly simple: she could find a marrow donor or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Ryswyk's early hopes for a quick cure waned when she learned that only 
about 30% of patients find a match with the most likely source -- a family 
member. She was adopted, and so faced lottery-like odds anywhere between 
1-in-100 and 1-in-a-million of finding an anonymous donor. 
</P>
<P>
 She beat the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, doctors pumped three bags of Lucas' marrow into Van Ryswyk 
through a catheter in her chest.  
</P>
<P>
 When she was checked last month, there was no evidence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of strict confidentiality rules, patients and donors are not allowed 
to meet, or even know the other's name, for at least a year after the marrow 
transplant. The primary reason for the secretiveness is in case a transplant 
doesn't take and more marrow is needed, the Red Cross can act as go-between.  
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials -- who flew Van Ryswyk in from her new home in San 
Francisco for the meeting -- went to great lengths to ensure the two remained 
unknown to one another until the ceremony, even checking Van Ryswyk into a 
Hollywood hotel under the assumed name of Sophie Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lucas first matched and learned he could become a donor, doctors told him 
of the serious risks of surgery, of the possible failure of the procedure, of 
the pain. He was undaunted then, and remains so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine any pain great enough to keep someone from saving another 
life," he said. 
</P>

ROSSMOOR ACCEPTS BID TO DEMOLISH SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rossmoor Community Services District directors tentatively accepted a $10,000 
bid by a Capistrano Beach construction firm last week to demolish four 
buildings at a former school site. 
</P>
<P>
 H&M Construction's bid is 12.5% of what officials thought it would cost to 
demolish the buildings. They had estimated that it would cost about $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition work will not begin until the company is able to obtain 
permits, proof of insurance and other documents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bid sounds too good to be true," board director Joyce Bloom said. But "we 
don't want to be accused of doing something not proper." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Sheldon said that William W. Wynder, the district's 
attorney, will review the documents and draft a contract with the construction 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition of the buildings, formerly used as offices and classrooms, is 
part of the effort to convert the vacant Rush Elementary School -- which the 
district bought three years ago from the Los Alamitos Unified School District 
-- into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon said that another company will begin later this month to remove 
asbestos found in the buildings. As soon as the asbestos removal is completed, 
the demolition work will start after the company obtains the necessary 
paperwork, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid was low because H&M Construction will also salvage wood, electrical 
parts and other reusable materials from the buildings that will be torn down, 
Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will take care of everything, including disposal of the debris," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other buildings, a 600-seat auditorium and offices behind the auditorium, 
will not be torn down. The auditorium is used for school graduations, school 
programs and other community events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the district sold $5 million in bonds to pay for the 8.5-acre site 
on Blume Drive. But after paying the school district $4.2 million and spending 
nearly $500,000 for the bond sale, the district has only $300,000 left for park 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 After several community forums, a master plan was drafted to develop the park, 
but officials said they are going slow in carrying it out because of the 
limited finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Board director Jim Alexander, who volunteered to find ways to develop the park 
without spending too much money, said that some of the work will be done by 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they will have a better idea of how to proceed after 
the buildings are torn down.

INVESTIGATORS DIGGING FOR ANSWERS; LONG BEACH: STATE OFFICIALS ATTEMPTING TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER NEARLY $500,000 WAS MISSPENT FROM CEMETERY'S ENDOWMENT FUND, 
WHICH ONCE SURPASSED $1 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State officials have seized bank accounts and launched an investigation into 
Sunnyside Cemetery, the final resting place of some of Long Beach's most 
prominent historical figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the state Cemetery Board and the attorney general's office will 
attempt to determine whether nearly $500,000 was misspent from the cemetery's 
endowment fund, which once surpassed $1 million. The fund is supposed to remain 
intact, with only interest to be used to cover cemetery expenses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Giunta, executive director of the Cemetery Board, said last week that 
investigators plan to seek a temporary restraining order to prevent Sunnyside 
operators from selling plots or conducting any business during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-acre graveyard at 1095 E. Willow Ave. has fallen into disrepair. The 
owner, Dean A. Dempsey, is battling terminal lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey said the endowment fund has not earned enough interest to cover 
expenses, and he was forced to use about $300,000 of the principal to pay 
cemetery bills. He denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no money given to me, no deposits into any personal accounts and 
no checks written to me," Dempsey said, his voice strained and hoarse. "When 
they do the investigation, they will see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Giunta said the endowment fund's balance was $1,049,000 when Dempsey bought 
the property in 1987. An unofficial audit done recently by the cemetery board 
revealed that the balance has dropped to $517,000, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemetery operators are required by state law to maintain the endowment fund to 
provide steady income once they no longer have plots to sell. For example, when 
customers buy plots for about $2,500, between $200 and $300 is set aside for 
the endowment fund, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 State cemetery officials began to look into Sunnyside's condition after 
receiving nearly a dozen complaints in two weeks about the lack of maintenance 
at the historic graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the condition could best be described as unacceptable and 
deplorable," said Giunta, who visited the cemetery recently. "Many graves were 
covered over by two or three inches of dirt. There is no running water, the 
weeds are long and the grass has died." 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey, 41, said his failing health has prevented him from keeping up the 
grounds. "I just cannot operate it," he said. "I can barely walk. The best 
thing that could happen is that state could take it over and put it up for 
auction." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery, which has had more than 18,000 burials, opened in 1907. 
Monuments bear prominent Long Beach names, including Walker, Ziegler, Price, 
Knox, Fry, Stearns and Buffum. Ray Clark, a former mayor who died in 1925, is 
interred there, as are the city's first schoolteacher and first police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Dempsey reported to the state that 400 plots remained for sale. With 
about 40 burials a year since then, Giunta estimates about 200 unsold plots 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 If the investigation determines that funds have been misspent, Giunta said, 
the attorney general's office could suspend Dempsey's license, revoke it or 
file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemetery Director Nancy Turney, who has apparently been running the burial 
ground since Dempsey fell ill, is being questioned for selling plots without a 
license. Giunta said, however, that she is not the focus of the investigation. 
"In our estimation, (Turney) was trying to run the cemetery in good faith," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey, who bought Sunnyside for $100, said he has struggled with the 
cemetery's finances for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a bad business decision," he said. "Who's going to sell a cemetery for 
$100 if it's profitable? They were losing money and I continued to lose money."

THEFT OF CREDIT A PERVASIVE PROBLEM; FRAUD: DOWNEY CASE REFLECTS SCAMS THAT RIP 
OFF AN ESTIMATED $1 BILLION YEARLY NATIONWIDE IN GOODS, CASH. IT'S BECOMING 
KNOWN AS CRIME OF '90S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Each time, the news came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman received a note from a department store thanking her for buying $600 
worth of cosmetics she knew nothing about. Another discovered $3,200 in charges 
for jewelry she had never seen. A third learned that someone used an automated 
teller machine to withdraw $1,000 from her credit account. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say one person, Debra LaGrone of Downey, carried out each 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, LaGrone allegedly stole credit card numbers and 
other personal information while working at various mortgage companies, then 
purchased thousands of dollars worth of goods in the names of people she had 
never met. 
</P>
<P>
 When Downey investigators searched LaGrone's townhouse in January, they found 
credit cards with other people's names and account numbers, jewelry that had 
been fraudulently purchased, and a spiral notebook filled with names, home 
addresses and credit information of people who had recently refinanced their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified at least 15 individuals across Southern California as 
victims, in addition to numerous small merchants, department stores, credit 
card companies and banks that incurred thousands of dollars in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone, 39, who has held a variety of jobs in the loan business in the past 
20 years, faces 16 felony charges, including commercial burglary and receiving 
stolen property. She is in jail in lieu of $55,000 bail and awaits a June 9 
pretrial hearing in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone has pleaded not guilty and contends that a friend who was recently 
convicted of a similar crime left the questionable credit cards at LaGrone's 
house and gave her some of the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the case is a brazen example of what they call the crime of 
the '90s -- credit card fraud perpetrated by individuals and organized rings 
who rip off an estimated $1 billion a year in goods and cash nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves have been known to steal credit information from mailboxes and garbage 
bins, during home burglaries or after purse-snatchings. But authorities are 
increasingly concerned about insiders -- bank tellers, real estate agents, 
automobile salespeople, loan processors and others -- who have access to 
confidential information that can open doors to lines of credit and bank 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 People with credit cards rarely lose huge sums of money when their cards are 
used to make unauthorized purchases. Their liability is limited to $50 per 
card. But it often takes months to purge their credit reports -- a process some 
have called a bureaucratic nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, some victims say, is the anguish of knowing that someone has 
tapped into their personal lives and has access to their Social Security 
numbers, home addresses, dates of birth and other family history.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel violated," said Orange resident Debbie Gallegos, an alleged victim of 
LaGrone. "Someone (has) assumed your identity. That's what is terrifying. You 
don't know who's doing it or why." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, LaGrone allegedly obtained Gallegos' credit card account numbers, a 
secret password on one account and new credit cards. Authorities say LaGrone 
made $1,000 in withdrawals on Gallegos' account at an automated teller machine 
in Downey and received $2,500 in cash advances that were charged to Gallegos' 
account at various Sears stores, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey investigators suspect that LaGrone gained access to Gallegos' credit 
information while working at a Newport Beach mortgage company last summer. 
Gallegos refinanced her home through the company early last year. When company 
officials checked recently, they found that information was missing from 
Gallegos' file, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone is accused of obtaining confidential information on numerous other 
people from files at companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties. She 
allegedly contacted credit card companies, reported cards missing and then 
requested replacements as well as address changes, according to court records.  
</P>
<P>
 Posing as the cardholders, LaGrone allegedly applied for loans and obtained 
cash advances in other people's names, made cash withdrawals and ordered 
merchandise through department stores, jewelry boutiques and clothing 
catalogues, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, one of the victims had nearly the same name, Dorothy LaGrone. 
Over a several-month period last year, Debra LaGrone allegedly used Dorothy 
LaGrone's name and credit history to obtain a $2,500 loan and purchase 
thousands of dollars in goods, including $9,300 in jewelry from a Costa Mesa 
store, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an attorney hired to represent Debra LaGrone early in the case was 
apparently caught in the web, police say. LaGrone allegedly used someone else's 
credit card number to pay $1,000 to attorney John McDonald, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities documented more than $50,000 worth of purchases, many of 
them allegedly delivered to Debra LaGrone's Downey residence and to her 
mother's former home in Bellflower. Her mother, Kathleen Montgomery, said no 
goods were delivered to the Bellflower home. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey fraud detectives, who spent 2 1/2 months on the case, say the actual 
amount of purchases and number of victims may never be known. "I think we 
uncovered the tip of the iceberg," said Sgt. Greg Griffin, who led the Downey 
police investigation. "There were so many credit card numbers in (LaGrone's) 
day planners that we didn't have time to check them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's fraud detectives began an investigation last July after a security 
officer from the Broadway department store in Cerritos complained that someone 
had made several unauthorized purchases on a customer's credit card. Downey 
detectives later began their own investigation after receiving a fraud 
complaint from a credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone was arrested Oct. 4 and released on bail two days later. She was 
arrested again Jan. 14 after police searched her Downey residence. She told 
police that the goods found in her house had been given to her or sold to her 
by a friend who had also worked at some of the same mortgage companies. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone also said credit cards in other people's names and account information 
had been left behind by the friend. LaGrone said the friend was having mail in 
other people's names delivered to the Downey address. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the friend, who was recently convicted of fraudulently using 
a bank card in an unrelated case in Orange County, is not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's attorney, Charles Mullis, scoffed at police contentions that LaGrone 
masterminded a clever scheme. He said authorities have no proof that LaGrone 
was the person who purchased fraudulent goods over the phone through companies 
such as the Home Shopping Network, which sell merchandise on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Debra LaGrone is such a sophisticated criminal, why was she dumb enough to 
have all the stuff mailed to her address?" Mullis asked. "Police assume it was 
Debra LaGrone because the merchandise was shipped to her house, but it's not an 
open-shut case." 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's daughter, Sheri, said her mother, a 1972 graduate of Lynwood High 
School, would not jeopardize a career of more than 20 years in the loan 
business in which she rose from a secretary to loan processor jobs earning more 
than $40,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheri LaGrone, 18, also was arrested but was not charged. She said she 
frequently turned away goods delivered to the condominium in other people's 
names. She insisted, however that her mother, who is divorced, is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my mom wouldn't do this," she said. "I'm watching my mother go through 
this trouble for something she didn't do. It seems like the police can send her 
to jail, innocent or not innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have identified Debra LaGrone in surveillance photographs at 
an automated teller machine in Downey withdrawing funds on the credit account 
of one of the alleged fraud victims, Debbie Gallegos. LaGrone told police the 
card belonged to the friend, who had asked LaGrone to withdraw money. 
</P>
<P>
 Two eyewitnesses also have identified LaGrone in court as the person who 
purchased jewelry and applied for a loan using other people's credit or 
identification, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Downey investigators found a credit report in LaGrone's townhouse 
belonging to a client of one company where she had worked. LaGrone told police 
she had taken the file home to work on it, records indicate. Details of the 
search and the victims' accounts are documented in a stack of police reports 
nearly an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates say cardholders have good reason to be concerned about 
whether their credit information is secure. Many companies don't do an adequate 
job of screening employees who have access to personal information on 
customers, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of LaGrone's previous employers, for instance, said they ere unaware that 
she had been convicted in 1988 on charges of check forgery and sentenced to 60 
days in jail and three years' probation. They said they would not have hired 
her had they known of the conviction. Critics also say there are so many credit 
cards in use that offenders can go undetected for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card companies say they have tightened security during the past decade. 
They use computers to detect unusual spending activity on clients' accounts, 
such as numerous expensive purchases in a short period. 
</P>
<P>
 Some credit card companies place clients' pictures on cards and use 
three-dimensional images to make alterations more difficult. But critics say 
those safeguards have limited value because so many credit purchases are now 
made over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also say that as the technology to fight the problem improves, 
so will the crooks' ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we come up with the most foolproof system to beat credit card fraud, 
somebody is going to find a way to beat the system," said Sgt. John Garcia of 
the Los Angeles County sheriff's forgery and fraud detail.

HIGH SCHOOL'S STUDENTS TAKE CENTER COURT TO DECRY VIOLENCE; SAFETY: IN WAKE OF 
FOUR DEATHS, PARENTS AND OFFICIALS JOIN YOUTHS ON WASHINGTON CAMPUS TO HUNT FOR 
ANSWERS.

 Four chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each draped with a black graduation robe. Each with a diploma on the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Each representing a student who once attended Washington High School. 
</P>
<P>
 At center court of the school's Margaret Wilson Physical Education Center last 
week, the four chairs served as a grim reminder of young lives cut short by 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, parents, city officials, businessmen and ministers gathered in the 
gym to address high school violence, a topic that Washington is all too 
familiar with. The school has lost three students -- Sam Cannady, Antonio Lewis 
and Michael Nasir -- and recent graduate Wallace Dumas to fatal shootings this 
year. "We've come here to find solutions to stop senseless violence," said 
senior Gregory Gales, a member of Washington's football and basketball teams. 
"Something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death, that of Lewis, came April 30 at a house party in 
Gardena. According to the youth's uncle, Clyde Lewis, the party had turned 
rowdy before the shooting: "The family was told by authorities that 911 was 
called to report a party that was getting out of hand and the police (then) 
drove by the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena police said they responded within minutes of shots being fired at 
11:43 p.m. The case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' slaying sparked anguish and anger among the Washington student body. 
The next week, students met to prepare for the May 9 press conference that 
would serve as a forum in which they could voice their frustrations about the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to let you know we are ready (to find solutions)," 17-year-old 
senior Jaman Cotton said. "I spent hours and hours preparing for this press 
conference. I want to know what's going to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Wright, an aide to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) who offered possible 
legislative solutions such as harsher criminal laws at the county level, said 
violence first must be dealt with "at the student-body level." 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooters can be flushed out if people in the community get involved," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Bolden, a Los Angeles Unified School District police official, agreed: 
"We need people to step forward. Antonio was my son's best friend. I used to 
play ball with Antonio from 8 to 10 every Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington graduate Rory Kaufman, an aide to County Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, said high school students in general, and at Washington in 
particular, need more positive interaction in their lives. Faith must be 
emphasized in school and community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Jones, director of the Los Angeles schools' Black Education 
Commission, said people who have lived "the South-Central experience" can reach 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to dodge bullets and gunfire all the time," said Jones, who attended 
Washington from 1972 to 1975. "We need the former people from the 
(neighborhood) to come here because their names carry more weight than 
politicians and policemen. It's amazing, this (press conference) shows what 
children will do if we provide the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 students gathered in the gym Monday represented a voice that has long 
cried out without a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are tired of being brought down by the media," said student body 
representative Shannon Jackson. "We are tired of being stereotyped in a 
negative light." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of those who were invited to the press conference said the situation 
can largely be corrected by the community itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kaufman: "(When I went to school), we students held gangs down. I believe 
students can do it. But parents, students and community have to want to do it. 
Brothers and sisters have to talk more than they fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Marguerite P. Lamotte encouraged students to sign up for future 
conferences to discuss more solutions. "This is a beginning, a commencement for 
us," she said.

2 VALLEY RAIL LINES FEASIBLE, STUDIES SAY; TRANSPORTATION: EITHER AN ELEVATED 
ROUTE OR A SUBWAY COULD BE STREAMLINED TO CUT COSTS, PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING 
FINDINGS CONCLUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Preliminary findings from two engineering studies show that both above- and 
below-ground rail lines across the San Fernando Valley floor are feasible and 
that either project could be streamlined to reduce costs, transit officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing prepared for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, planners 
say both a subway system paralleling Burbank Boulevard and an elevated line 
straddling the Ventura Freeway could be built without running into unfriendly 
soil conditions or unduly disrupting traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both options could also realize cost savings if they included new station 
designs, more efficient construction techniques and the postponement of some 
station openings, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 But no hard numbers are yet available on the projected savings, which will 
probably be the deciding factor for the cash-strapped MTA when its directors 
approve a final route later this year, resolving a debate that has dragged on 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost comparisons are expected this summer after the two engineering studies, 
now 70% done, are finally completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs are the big numbers that everyone wants to know about. Those are 
due in August," said David L. Mieger, project manager for the east-west Valley 
rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our deficits right now, we're looking at every dollar we spend," Mieger 
said. He declined to speculate which option might ultimately be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, projections tab the Ventura Freeway line -- which the MTA 
tentatively approved two years ago, pending the outcome of the studies -- at 
$2.6 billion, while the price tag on the subway system is an estimated $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary report released Monday indicates that freeway widening for 
construction purposes and stricter seismic standards in the wake of the 
Northridge earthquake would increase costs for the overland route. 
</P>
<P>
 Those increases might reduce some of the potential savings from measures such 
as performing some construction and assembly off-site and delaying station 
openings where ridership is expected to be lower. But officials predict a net 
gain for the transit agency, which faces an operating deficit next year of $126 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 An extension of the Red Line subway from North Hollywood to Warner Center 
could also be built at less than the expected $3 billion, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the line would not run under major streets, stations could be open-air 
and would not need the intense ventilation and lighting required at stations in 
Downtown Los Angeles and those under construction along the Hollywood segment. 
</P>
<P>
 This could result in savings of as much as 30% to 40% per station, helping to 
"significantly reduce the estimated costs" of the subway, the report said.

METROLINK TO CUT TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN HIGH DESERT, L.A.; TRANSIT: IMPROVEMENTS 
TO THE TRACK LINE ARE DESIGNED TO CUT ABOUT 30% OFF THE COMMUTE BY JULY 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Metrolink officials provided a tour Monday of earthquake-related improvements 
to the track on the Santa Clarita line that are designed to cut about 30% off 
commuting times between the Antelope Valley and Los Angeles by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews are straightening many of the 50 curves on the commuter rail line 
between the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, allowing the average traveling 
speed to increase 35 to 45 m.p.h., said San Bernardino County Supervisor Larry 
Walker, who chairs the Metrolink Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-mile trip from Lancaster to Los Angeles, which took two hours and 25 
minutes when the line opened Jan. 24, will take an hour and 48 minutes when 
work is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the same time as driving a car that distance during rush hour," he 
said during a news conference Monday at the Via Princessa Metrolink station in 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The line between Santa Clarita and Lancaster did not exist before the Jan. 17 
earthquake and was not scheduled for completion for at least 10 years. But the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $50 million in emergency funds for 
the extension after the 6.8-magnitude temblor collapsed a connector ramp on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, the only major highway route between the Antelope 
Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 An existing rail line used for freight trains was converted to Metrolink use 
after the earthquake, but was operated more slowly than other Metrolink lines 
because of the numerous sharp curves, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 New tracks are being laid parallel to much of the old route, with 
straightaways and gentle curves replacing the older track's multitude of sharp 
curves and allowing the train to run at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, more durable concrete ties are being used instead of the wood 
ties on the original track, and the traditional railing is being replaced by a 
continuously welded rail that provides a smoother ride. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and 
KNX-AM traffic reporter Jim Thornton touted improvements completed May 2 that 
cut the commute to two hours, seven minutes. A high-publicity campaign is 
planned to attempt to retain riders who have been using the train since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never hear me talking about a SigAlert that's going to affect traffic on 
Metrolink," Thornton said. There were 950 riders on the Santa Clarita line the 
Friday before the earthquake, according to Metrolink statistics. A peak of 
11,000 riders rode Jan. 25 and about 6,000 people used the line on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 A ridership study in March indicated that of the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
Valley passengers, 83% were boarding at two stations in the Santa Clarita 
Valley, said Peter Hidalgo, a Metrolink spokesman. He said recent figures 
indicate that stations in Acton, Palmdale and Lancaster are each attracting 100 
to 200 passengers daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt said extending and repairing the 
line is cheaper than expanding freeway service, but the challenge is convincing 
people to ride the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty million dollars is a tremendous investment in this line and we need to 
justify that with ridership," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said the daily total ridership of the five Metrolink lines is about 
18,000, compared to just under 10,000 before the earthquake. He said Metrolink 
officials hope to permanently retain 30% to 40% of the riders who began using 
the line after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials had projected a month after the earthquake that about 10% 
of passengers riding because of the disaster would become permanent, based on 
commuter rail ridership figures in San Francisco after the Loma Prieta quake in 
1989, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said current ridership figures far exceed expectations, but acknowledged 
that those are likely to go down during the next few months when repairs to the 
Golden State Freeway and parts of the Antelope Valley Freeway are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving the speed of the Santa Clarita line is the key to persuading 
commuters to leave their cars at home, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure Metrolink is the fastest way in and out of the valley," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A discount on monthly passes is being offered to riders through June. Passes 
between the Antelope Valley and Burbank have been reduced from $176 to $80, and 
passes to Los Angeles have been reduced from $208 to $112.

MORE ON SCHOOLS AND WARNER CENTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was disappointed to read Bonny Matheson's attack against the school district 
in her op-ed piece "School District's Lesson: When All Else Fails, Sue" (April 
24). 
</P>
<P>
 The article is distorted and full of rather inflated rhetoric. I would like to 
set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the Warner Center Specific Plan, the city refused to require 
mitigation for the negative effects on Canoga Park High School and Parkman 
Middle School. Both schools are adjacent to major thoroughfares to be widened 
under the plan. Noise and dust from construction and increased traffic will 
affect the schools. District requests for mitigation -- such as 
air-conditioning to allow windows to be closed -- simply fell on deaf ears 
during the entire planning process. Sewers and parking spaces received more 
attention than the children in these schools. As the representative for these 
schools and the students they serve, my only interest is in obtaining needed 
mitigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Matheson suggests that state-mandated developer fees could pay for the 
needed mitigation. Unfortunately, these fees are also state-controlled and are 
not available to mitigate local needs. Instead, they are earmarked as a "match" 
for state funds to build new schools in overcrowded areas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that the city refused to address the issue of schools until 
a lawsuit was filed. Councilwoman Laura Chick, who took office after all this 
occurred, has expressed a strong interest in resolving this matter and avoiding 
costly litigation. I applaud her leadership and have pledged to work with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic development and school environments conducive to learning are not 
mutually exclusive. Working together, we can achieve both in a way in which 
everyone benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 I regret that Ms. Matheson constructed a view of these events that only 
reinforces adversarial approaches. For example, her frequent and undocumented 
charges of "mismanagement" and "fiscal incompetence" are simply cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new mayor, a new council member and a new desire to work together, this 
case can become an opportunity for improved understanding and cooperation. That 
is my goal.

KEEPING SHARP EYE ON BALD EAGLE; WILDLIFE: AN ENVIRONMENTALIST WORKS HARD TO 
RE-ESTABLISH THE NEARLY EXTINCT SPECIES ON CATALINA ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Garcelon dangles precariously over the huge bald-eagle nest on the 
southeastern cliffs of Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 He hangs from a harness connected by a long rope to a helicopter hovering 120 
feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second time Garcelon has visited the nest in a month. In early April, 
he removed an egg and replaced it with a synthetic one. As he approaches the 
nest this time, Garcelon again disturbs the nesting bird, and it takes off, 
soaring through the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a minute, Garcelon has replaced the fake egg. The eagle and its 
mate return to find a two-week-old eagle chick.  
</P>
<P>
 "The adults immediately came back and started to brood it, and then later we 
saw them feeding it," said Garcelon, 40, president of the Institute for 
Wildlife Studies in Arcata in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle chick was hatched in a San Francisco Zoo incubator from an egg laid 
by captive birds. It was the 42nd bald eagle released on Catalina Island under 
a reintroduction program Garcelon started in 1980.  
</P>
<P>
 When the chick is old enough to fly in 11 or 12 weeks, it has roughly a 50-50 
chance of survival, Garcelon said. But that's better odds than if the eagles 
had tried to hatch their own egg on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Human intervention is still the only way to ensure the survival of the 
endangered species, said Garcelon, who has worked for 14 years to re-establish 
bald eagles on Catalina.  
</P>
<P>
 At least six breeding pairs of bald eagles were nesting on the island in the 
1940s. They were among the 25 to 40 pairs on the eight Channel Islands before 
the population was wiped out by hunting and pesticide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT left over from extensive use in Southern California agriculture continues 
to permeate the environment and show up in the fatty tissue of birds and other 
wildlife. The pesticide was outlawed in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT affects the calcium deposits in the eggs of eagles and other shorebirds, 
Garcelon said. The eagles lay eggs with shells so thin they easily break or 
lose water, causing the embryo to dehydrate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're able to save at least some of them until hopefully the environment 
cleans up well enough that they can do that themselves," he said. "One of these 
days that stuff (DDT) will degrade and be out of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Catalina is home to two breeding pairs and an additional nine mature 
birds, all reintroduced. Garcelon said an unequal sex ratio prevents more 
breeding on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 When eggs are laid, Garcelon quickly replaces them with replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragile eggs are transported in a specially designed padded case to San 
Francisco for incubation. Sometimes a chick goes back to the parents that laid 
its egg, but only three of 14 eggs laid on Catalina since 1987 have been 
successfully incubated.  
</P>
<P>
 The egg removed from its Catalina nest in early April, for example, did not 
hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 After the chick is left in the nest, the adult birds quickly take on the role 
of parents. Only one foster chick has died in a Catalina nest, Garcelon said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the birds mature, they often leave the island for three or four months. 
Wing tags and radio transmitters help Garcelon monitor their travels.  
</P>
<P>
 One bird released in 1991 was spotted on the California/Oregon border earlier 
this year, he said. But eventually it may return.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect them to come back to at least the general area of Catalina Island 
because they have what's known as a 'natal site tenacity' and like to breed in 
the same area they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's aim in forming the nonprofit wildlife institute in 1979 was to 
re-establish bald-eagle populations, but he said he was not aware of how 
prevalent DDT was in Southern California waters when he began the Catalina 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon hoped the birds would be producing their own healthy chicks by now. 
Only one pair has laid and hatched an egg unaffected by DDT.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's organization and the Catalina Conservancy have spent more than 
$700,000 in private funds trying to bring the species back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has contributed an 
additional $255,000 to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes $150,000 a year to maintain the program, but it's money well spent, 
Garcelon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon added that the only other bald-eagle program in California is on the 
Big Sur coast. 
</P>
<P>
 He has reintroduced the eagles in several other locations, including Lake 
Tahoe, British Columbia, Arizona and New Mexico.

KEEPING UP STANDARDS AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Post-Quake Patience Wears Thin at CSUN" (May 1) was very 
one-sided regarding attitudes on our campus. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's true we've faced many obstacles following the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
education continues to take place on our campus. In fact, by and large, 
attitudes remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is untrue that professors have adopted relaxed standards. While some 
research-intensive projects have not been assigned as they normally would have 
been, equally challenging projects have been assigned in their place. 
</P>
<P>
 To print the opinion that one can't get a good education at CSUN this semester 
without printing the other side is irresponsible and demeaning to both the 
students and professors who are working hard to retain the quality of education 
that is expected while coping with adverse circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Education not only comes from books. It also evolves out of facing and 
overcoming new challenges. That being the case, we are undoubtedly getting an 
even better education this semester at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>

<P>
 Your story on Cal State Northridge after the earthquake leaves out some of the 
more remarkable aspects of the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Short shrift was give to its record-breaking pace. While problems exist, and 
these were the focus of your article, great things are also happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing most precisely about my particular situation, let me present it as an 
example of the amazing transformation that is indeed occurring at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a couple of weeks of the quake, I was back operating my approximately 
$2 million in programs, which involve scores of students and hundreds of 
teachers. This was made possible by my immediate relocation to excellent 
modular facilities provided and constructed by our administration and 
colleagues with extraordinary support by the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 My students are now actually more productive than before the quake and like 
the new facilities better than the old.  
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm and the spirit of challenge are not dead as you suggested. They are 
alive and well and stronger than ever. This may not be the case for everyone, 
of course, but it is for the award-winning biology department, recently ranked 
fourth in the United States among its class of comprehensive universities. 
Perhaps that's because our students are actively involved in research; more 
than 100 in my lab alone co-authored publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Our department is recruiting four new faculty to service our growing numbers 
of majors, and they are not turned off by the current condition of the 
university. The challenge provided by the quake is bringing out more enthusiasm 
on the part of our faculty, staff and students than I've seen in years.

WATERGATE PERSPECTIVE: LESSONS UNLEARNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found it fitting that on the day the House approved $28 billion to build 
more prisons and "get tough on violent offenders," students in an 
advanced-placement history class at Chatsworth High School were unable to 
articulate the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we spend billions on protecting society from its criminal element, yet we 
are unable to educate our children on the crimes a former President committed 
less than 20 years ago.Surely our future prison system will be able to 
accommodate the ignorant messes currently bred by our public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Chatsworth High hasn't changed much over the years. I got my 
substandard education there too, finally learning about history, politics and 
art in the university. I cannot blame the school for my limited interest in 
learning, but when I see an advanced-placement teacher saying "the worst thing 
that Nixon did was to try to cover up what his friends did" and used his 
"position of power to obstruct a criminal investigation," I can readily 
understand why I came to believe in college that all I'd learned in my history 
classes were lies. I was angry and I continue to be angry with the education 
offered to the young people who are the future of my country. 
</P>
<P>
 Pouring money into the prison system and chipping away at the funds for our 
schools will continue to breed ignorance. We will have children who believe 
that Watergate was no big deal, an event blown up by the media.

THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AGAINST MORE LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can't we find ways to solve political problems without creating more laws? 
Take campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently (April 25) you ran a front page article critical of City Councilman 
Hal Bernson's campaign fund spending. It seems Bernson potentially ran afoul of 
a loosely worded law that requires office-holders to maintain "officeholder" 
accounts containing their privately solicited funds. These funds must be used 
solely for "governmental, legislative and political purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the fact that any ninth-grader could creatively interpret that 
language, it appears Bernson has been called on the carpet for this before. He 
spent too much on dinner and season tickets. Who's to say they weren't 
political affairs? Define political. Who cares how Hal Bernson spends his 
campaign dollars? Or Zev Yaroslavsky or Rita Walters, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who gave him the money decide whether that's OK, not the Ethics 
Commission, whose enforcement wing talks to the city attorney, who passes 
opinions on to the State Fair Political Practices Commission. What a waste of 
bureaucratic time. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often society's response to a situation that outrages us is "there ought 
to be a law." Maybe we should consider alternatives. Maybe next time we need a 
problem like this solved we should ask an entrepreneur for an idea instead of 
another lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 What if politicians paid an independent bureau to review campaign spending and 
to mail copies of spending records to all those who contributed as well as the 
media? Let those whose money went to candidates judge whether their money was 
well-spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's free up our representatives to spend more time serving their 
constituents and less time justifying their expenses. Free up our bureaucrats 
to do something besides make more work for more bureaucrats. And free up our 
legal workers to take care of cocaine traffickers or the thug who broke into my 
car the other day.

 Your story "Bernson's Spending in '92-'93 Follows Pattern" (April 24) shows 
that all City Council members, the city attorney and the city controller all 
have spent "officeholder" money, even Zev Yaroslavsky, who outspent Hal 
Bernson.  
</P>
<P>
 Why not put the spotlight on the entire council? Why focus on Mr. Bernson? It 
seems to me the culprit is officeholder accounts.

AN UNSIGHTLY STRETCH OF VENTURA BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was surprised to find no mention in your story "Ventura Blvd. Faces a Long 
Road Back" (April 23) of the monstrosity on Ventura one block east of Woodman 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 This whole block is an eyesore of graffiti, broken-down stores and homeless 
sleeping in doorways. This was not caused by the earthquake or economics. As a 
matter of fact, it was a thriving block of unusual stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Our thanks must go to the efforts of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., which 
opposed the construction of a two-story building because it was to have a room 
for the air-conditioning unit on the roof. Does the Sherman Oaks Homeowners 
Assn. prefer what it has now to a new two-story building? Is it content to 
leave this atrocity? We who pass this street every day give our thanks.

BURBANK EDUCATION OFFICIALS' 'SORRY RECORD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times is barking up the wrong tree when it accuses Burbank voters of being 
"shortsighted and miserly" for rejecting a $100-million school bond (Valley 
Perspective, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
 The blame belongs squarely on school district officials who operate the system 
much as the Marx Brothers would.Burbank voters know their sorry record; you 
obviously do not. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hypocrisy for you to ignore Burbank Unified School District activities 
for years and then have a naive reporter weep and wail after a short public 
relations tour of one high school. 
</P>
<P>
 And its dishonest of someone to print letters like Reed Wilcox's "School Board 
Not Racist in Removing Hentel" (May 1) without properly identifying him. Did 
the fact that he's the husband of, and chief apologist for, a member of the 
school board he defends escape you? 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's population is changing too rapidly for some in the "Leave It to 
Beaver" generation who see increased minority enrollment as a direct threat. 
Rather than going public with their concerns, they privately conspired with a 
compliant and cowardly school board to demote Hentel. 
</P>
<P>
 Keiko Hentel was a superb administrator -- sensitive to the needs of her 
students, parents, her colleagues and the entire community. No one can climb 
into their minds and honestly say that removing Hentel was a racist act by the 
board, but the sorry record of the district in hiring and promoting minorities 
to the upper-level jobs speaks for itself: Of the 49 top jobs in the district 
(i.e., those with money and power) none are filled by Hispanics, Asians or 
blacks. Of the 560 certificated personnel, there are 18 Hispanics, five blacks 
and nine Asians.

PASADENA TAKES SOBERING APPROACH TOWARD CRIME; COMMUNITY: CITING THE LINK 
BETWEEN LIQUOR AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, THE CITY IS DRAWING UP ITS OWN POLICY TO 
CRACK DOWN ON STORES THAT SELL ALCOHOL.

 A middle-aged man hunches over the wall along the Orange Grove Boulevard side 
of the Rancho Super Market on Fair Oaks Avenue. He pauses for a moment and then 
vomits into the bushes and onto the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about 1:30 on a hazy Wednesday afternoon. This is one of the sights on 
Eric McWilliams' guided tour of notorious booze-soaked spots in Northwest 
Pasadena -- an area he grew up in and still patrols as a community relations 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many landmarks of trouble. "We had a murder there recently," 
McWilliams says as he cruises by the Liquor Box on north Lincoln Avenue near 
Orange Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems in Pasadena were noted in a recent study of two separate two-week 
periods that found that half of all arrests in the city -- and all homicide 
arrests -- involved alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have grown so appalled by the link between alcohol and crime, 
especially in areas dense with liquor outlets, that an innovative but legally 
risky approach is being prepared. It will seek to penalize liquor stores and 
bars that breed crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 29, the Pasadena City Council voted to have the Planning Commission 
draw up the specifics of a citywide alcohol policy. A pillar of the policy will 
be a nuisance abatement ordinance giving the city authority to penalize or 
close problem outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy would also set zoning limits on the number of bars and liquor 
stores in an effort to control areas deemed to be saturated, especially Old 
Town and Northwest Pasadena, which have the city's greatest concentrations of 
liquor establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would put the city on the edge of regulating liquor stores, which 
is the responsibility of the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. A 
similar ordinance in Oakland was overturned by the courts after a suit by the 
California Beverage Retailer Coalition. But an ordinance in Los Angeles 
survived a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena leaders say they have no choice but to act. The state agency lacks 
the staffing to ensure that licensees are not selling to minors or allowing 
aggressive panhandling, loitering, fights or drug sales around their premises, 
city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Uno Mas, a tavern on Lake Avenue, exemplifies the pace at which 
the ABC collars renegade bars, local leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of neighborhood lobbying against the bar, the ABC worked out a 
deal with the owner for Uno Mas to move out of Pasadena by June 17, 1994. 
Groups such as the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. complained that Uno Mas 
was a persistent source of public drunkenness, public urination, noise, fights 
and complaints of lewd behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just kind of a source of varied problems," said ABC enforcement 
supervisor Judy Matty. "It was a matter of accumulating enough evidence to take 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Uno Mas owner Maria Lopez denied that her bar is a source of problems and 
defended her clientele as law-abiding, working people. 
</P>
<P>
 "An injustice has been done to me," Lopez said. "I think some administrator 
wants me to move for another reason. They want the space for something else." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Pasadena began issuing conditional use permits for alcohol outlets. 
The permits set a wide range of performance criteria -- such as limits on 
cooler or bar space, operating hours and controlling loitering -- that stores 
and bars must meet in order to get a license within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has the authority to act against outlets that fail to meet their 
conditions. But officials had no tools to use against the source of most 
problems, stores that opened before 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Cities do, however, have the power to control public nuisances. The new 
ordinance would place troublesome liquor establishments under that power, 
allowing the city to slap new operating conditions on the store or bar. Any 
establishment that fails to comply could be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law also would enable the city to limit the number of alcohol outlets; 
although details are still being worked out by the Planning Commission, the 
city plans to force new applicants within 200 or 300 feet of existing alcohol 
outlets to prove that their establishment would benefit the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Administrator Denver Miller said several municipal and zoning codes 
must be amended to enact these measures. He expects the Planning Commission to 
begin writing the new policies in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not talking about prohibition, despite the impact the abuse of alcohol 
has in our society," Mayor Rick Cole said. "It is widely and readily available 
and socially acceptable, but at the fringes it has a tremendous impact on 
safety. It is the single biggest drain on our public resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Many liquor store owners agree that troublemakers tend to hang out near their 
stores, but say there is little they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott VanDenHende, manager of Rancho Super Market, said that he attempted to 
discourage problem customers by boosting prices on the single cans of potent 
malt beers and bottles of fortified wines that are local favorites. But that 
hasn't kept panhandlers and loiterers away from his store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he is losing business and that some suppliers refuse to make 
deliveries because of conditions created by loiterers in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guards hired last January seem only to have incensed locals. 
VanDenHende said that the store's front windows were broken recently after a 
guard allegedly caught a boy stealing. Some neighborhood residents say the 
youth was roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think the police would be able to do something about it," 
VanDenHende said, pointing out the "no loitering" signs around the parking lot. 
"It hurts our business because people don't want to go through (the lot) to get 
to the store." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's pending alcohol policy was first proposed by Day One, a 
community-based organization dedicated to fighting substance abuse. Day One 
leaders say the whole city pays the price for alcohol-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Day One used a grant from the Los Angeles County Health Services Department to 
study alcohol and violence, joining Pasadena police to analyze crime figures 
for two-week stretches twice in 1990-91, and twice again in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The study determined that, during the study weeks, alcohol was a factor in 
half of all arrests, all homicide arrests, 60% of rape cases and more than half 
of all domestic assaults. Not counted was the time police spent defusing 
alcohol-involved situations that did not result in arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people ask why we targeted alcohol," said Angela Goldberg, who 
spearheaded Day One's initiative. "Alcohol is the thread that runs through the 
fabric of many social problems -- domestic violence, community breakdown and 
public safety. There are things we can do to reduce the problems. Alcohol 
policy is a real tool to reduce real problems in a real way." 
</P>
<P>
 A soon-to-be-published study corroborates the Pasadena findings, reporting 
"considerable evidence that alcohol consumption facilitates assaultive 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide study by Richard Scribner, a professor with the USC's Institute 
For Preventive Research, and David MacKinnon, an Arizona State University 
psychologist, went beyond the actual use of alcohol to establish a link between 
violence and the mere availability of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed that a high density of alcohol outlets, while not the only 
factor, sets the table for violence in a community. The study predicted that 
adding a liquor store to a typical city in Los Angeles County would result in 
3.3 additional violent offenses each year. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds right to Pasadena police, who paid 400 calls last year to the 
intersection of Orange Grove and Summit Avenue, where two liquor stores are 
situated across the street from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would we have had 400 calls if the liquor stores were not there? Probably 
not," Lt. Jerry Shultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the strong association that the study makes between outlet density and 
violence, MacKinnon said that reducing the number of places where alcohol is 
available is sensible public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Renee Wasserman, an Oakland-based lawyer who represents the California 
Beverage Retailers, disagrees. Wasserman said "there is no empirical evidence" 
that alcohol retailers cause more public safety problems than other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal attempts to regulate alcohol are misguided and unfair, Wasserman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have arbitrary control over alcoholic beverages, you end up with 
more crime," Wasserman said, referring to the Prohibition era in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ordinances are a smoke screen," Wasserman said. "They are a thinly 
veiled local alcoholic beverage sales regulation. The cities want to . . . set 
up their own tribunals to revoke business licenses without due process." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman used that argument to win an injunction against a similar nuisance 
abatement ordinance in Oakland. But Oakland also attempted to fine outlets for 
overburdening police with calls. Wasserman said that practice made it easy to 
prove that liquor outlets were being unfairly persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena is looking instead to Los Angeles' nuisance abatement ordinance for 
guidance. That ordinance recently survived a legal challenge by the Korean 
Grocers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has successfully attached new conditions to stores rebuilding 
after the 1992 riots by focusing on land-use issues rather than alcohol, 
according to city zoning Administrator John Perica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot put in a condition that has the word beer, wine, alcohol and 
liquor," Perica said. "We cannot use those magic words."  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the city can't tell a problem store to stop selling alcohol after a 
certain hour -- that would be regulating alcohol sales -- but it can tell the 
entire store to close earlier. As a result, Perica said, license applicants and 
rebuilding store owners are volunteering their own conditions, such as limiting 
sales of single beers and fortified wines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been successful," Perica said. "We've addressed about 125 problem 
outlets over the last year. People now know that if they don't run a 
responsible business they will hear from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Perica is quick to point out that the city isn't just badgering alcohol 
outlets. He said that one-third of abatement cases are against other businesses 
and that his department has even pursued a church parking lot and a Little 
League that were causing nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Pasadena's alcohol policy is being hammered out in City Hall, the 
entire process has spurred some neighborhoods to confront, and win concessions 
from, several problem outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the 7-Eleven parking lot at Lake Avenue and Orange Grove has 
been a crime hot spot. During the periods in which Day One conducted its crime 
study, 7-Eleven's lot was the site of three murders, 10 armed robberies, four 
assaults with deadly weapons, five burglaries and many lesser offenses.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you carry 15 brands of fortified wines and malt liquors, you are asking 
for a certain clientele," Goldberg, of Day One, said of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Little, a leader in the nearby Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn., wrote 
a letter to a local newspaper urging Southland Corp., the parent company for 
7-Eleven, to do something. Goldberg advised Little and his neighbors to take 
their crusade to the source. 
</P>
<P>
 After several meetings with neighborhood activists and city leaders, the mall 
owner and the proprietors of the 7-Eleven and Chief Auto Parts, which share the 
mall, agreed to split costs and hire a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the guard came on late last year, violent crime in the lot has been 
reduced to one robbery report. Dev Nat, the owner of the 7-Eleven, said 
business is up 17% because people feel more secure about shopping there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of positive response from the community now," said Nat, who also 
stopped selling fortified wines and reduced her store's malt liquor selection. 
"There is a lot of community support and more people are shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar meeting of minds pushed Kazi Ahmed to rid gang members and drug 
dealers from his storefront grocery on Navarro Avenue and Howard Street. His 
efforts improved the good-natured store owner's community standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the neighborhood intervened, Ahmed, who is expanding his store, has 
started emphasizing fresh foods and groceries rather than alcohol. He also 
hired local contractors to help remodel the century-old structure, and he put 
local youths to work in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing in common is that we all want a good neighborhood in which to live 
and work in dignity," Ahmed said.

WELFARE CLIENTS FLEECED BY CITY PARKING FINES; THE COUNTY'S BUSIEST SOCIAL 
SERVICES OFFICE SERVES 96,000 AID RECIPIENTS BUT OFFERS NO OFF-STREET SPACES 
FOR THEIR CARS. THESE UNFORTUNATES DESERVE A BREAK.

 Everyone hates to get a parking ticket, even when it's justified, as most are. 
But something seems wrong when tickets regularly adorn almost every car on a 
particular block. Can all these people be so remiss? 
</P>
<P>
 No, not really. There is an irritating story behind the daily flock of pink 
tickets that I see driving in Panorama City. It's not about scofflaws; it's 
about poor planning by the county government and citations that generate lots 
of money for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The block is on Lanark Street near the county Social Services building. This 
is the busiest welfare office in Los Angeles County, serving 96,000 clients and 
employing more than 300 people. But there is no public off-street parking for 
blocks, not a single visitor's space in the lot underneath the building or 
across the street in another county lot. Many employees are bused from off-site 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-lane street is between a housing tract and Van Nuys Boulevard. Near 
the office there are a meager 56 spaces along both sides of Lanark. There is no 
parking on Van Nuys Boulevard. Parking in the residential neighborhoods is 
limited to two hours, and residents have petitioned to post the street against 
non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking in the 56 spaces is restricted to one hour. I am told that nothing in 
the county welfare system takes less than an hour to complete. Clients often 
come out to find a $15 ticket ($30 on street-cleaning day) on their 
windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the building, and parking enforcement was 
mercifully curtailed while a disaster-aid center and temporary welfare office 
operated in the parking lot. The disaster office has closed, leaving the 
welfare department in its temporary quarters. With the feds gone, torrential 
ticketing has begun again. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson, I suppose, is that you can have an absurd, unfair situation in 
which no one is clearly at fault. While the county gives money to welfare 
clients with one hand, the city takes it away with other. People who can least 
afford it are being ticketed with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 The county acknowledges there is a problem but lacks the power to change the 
time limit or stop the city from writing tickets. Several officials, including 
Bryce Yokomizo, the Social Services district director, said he has asked City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon to seek to liberalize the parking rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Moss, the Valley parking enforcement supervisor for the city, says her 
department is under pressure from the businesses on the block to write tickets 
to make space for customers. To parking enforcers on the street, of course, the 
block is as the Grand Banks is to a commercial fisherman. The enforcers are on 
the block constantly, reeling in the revenue, just doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the wrong place for such an office in the first place, in a 
10-business block with few spaces for cars. The welfare department outgrew this 
building more than a decade ago. Yet as its offices consolidate, the county 
keeps shunting more people to this office. It even repaired the building -- 
over neighbors' objections -- after a fire in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Throngs of women with small children overflow onto the sidewalk, sometimes in 
hot or rainy weather. Several welfare workers spend their day lining up and 
managing the crowds outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic slows to a halt as people pick up and drop off friends or look for 
parking. Parking-enforcers in two or more vehicles mark tires and scribble 
tickets. Periodically you hear the cry of discovery when someone finds a 
citation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the various bureaucracies ought to figure out a way to go 
easy on enforcement -- even though the city needs the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, fate in the form of the earthquake has given the county a 
chance to eliminate the sad sight of tickets on old and battered cars and 
relieve the neighborhood of the crowds and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood groups and businesses should lobby for an environmental impact 
report on the repair work under way before any more tax money is spent. The 
county should stop fixing the building and move the operation to one of the 
Valley's many large, vacant office spaces with ample parking.

CONSTRUCTION INFLATES BUDGET IN SANTA CLARITA; GOVERNMENT: THE $66-MILLION 
DRAFT PROPOSAL IS $16 MILLION HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR. IT ANTICIPATES NO LAYOFFS 
OR CUTS IN MAJOR PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most city departments here are tightening their fiscal belts for the third 
year in a row, but construction projects dominated by street and trail work 
have inflated Santa Clarita's 1994-1995 draft budget to $66.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending in the preliminary document is about $16 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget proposal includes no cost-of-living pay increases for employees, 
other than sheriff's deputies, and leaves three full-time posts unfilled. Two 
assistant planner jobs will be vacant for the entire fiscal year and an 
associate planner job will not be filled for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 No layoffs are proposed and no major programs are to be cut.  
</P>
<P>
 "The budget reflects the third year of relatively flat revenue trends clashing 
with increasing costs to maintain the same level of services," said City 
Manager George Caravalho in his annual budget message. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita expects to bring in $54.4 million in the upcoming fiscal year, 
with sales and property tax revenues totaling only about $531,000 more than the 
prior year because of a stalled real estate market and a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much locked into the status quo," said Councilman Carl Boyer. "I 
think we're fortunate it's hold-the-line rather than cut, cut, cut." 
</P>
<P>
 More than $24 million in construction work is outlined for the 1994-1995 
fiscal year. Topping that list is $11.3 million to widen sections of San 
Fernando Road, $3.2 million to repave city streets and $2.3 million for 
bicycling and walking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city departments submitted budget requests with no increases from the 
prior year, but some new expenses are outlined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About $910,000 covers the cost of an expected legal fight against a 
proposed 190-million-ton dump in Elsmere Canyon. The canyon is outside Santa 
Clarita's city limits, but elected officials fear it would harm the underground 
water supply, air quality and property values. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About $620,000 funds previously expanded bus routes, including a new route 
to Century City, for the entire fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About $600,000 covers a 5% cost-of-living increase for sheriff's deputies. 
Santa Clarita contracts for police protection with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, and the added cost maintains existing service levels.  
</P>
<P>
 -- A $575,000 reserve prepares for expenses tied to the Northridge earthquake 
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency may not reimburse to Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not included as part of Santa Clarita's city budget, an additional 
$10.8 million in construction projects is outlined for the next fiscal year as 
part of Santa Clarita's Community Recovery Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was adopted in February for the city to recover from the Northridge 
earthquake, improve infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Top projects in that redevelopment plan include $3 million for low-income home 
loans and $1 million each to repair quake-damaged homes, encourage public 
transit and install a drainage system in the Four Oaks neighborhood. Other 
projects include $500,000 for landslide prevention, $350,000 for quake-related 
school repairs, $333,000 for earthquake safety retrofitting and $300,000 for a 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan has been challenged by the Castaic Lake Water Agency in a pair of 
lawsuits that contend many of the projects in the 30-year plan are not true 
disaster recovery projects. CLWA officials say the plan diverts property tax 
revenue and therefore hampers the water agency's ability to pay off its bonds 
for a new water treatment plant and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will begin a series of budget sessions Wednesday and adopt a 
final document June 28.

JIM MURRAY: BULLDOG LOST ACE, WON BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone can win a poker pot with four aces. Anyone can win an English spelling 
bee in Rangoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone can win a Cy Young Award and set a shutout record when you have a 
sinking fastball that comes in at 95 m.p.h. and a curveball that tends to 
disappear on its way to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser won 23 games when he had all those things in place. In 1988, he 
was not only the best pitcher in the game, but one of the best ever. He pitched 
the Dodgers to the World Series championship that year. You couldn't get a run 
against him the last month of the season. A hit was a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hershiser was holding aces at the time. He was shooting with his own dice. 
It's easy to be the best speller when you have the dictionary. And when it came 
to pitching, he was the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lock for him to have won 99 big-league games in a bit more than six 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for what happened after that point that Hershiser should get the Cy Young 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Hershiser is not the Big O anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't win games with his arm anymore. He wins them with his head. He's 
like a guy crawling through barbed-wire with only a screwdriver or a swimmer 
crossing shark-infested waters with a nosebleed. He must feel as if he's got a 
deck chair on the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Hershiser was this kind of pitcher: He threw five consecutive 
shutouts in September -- really six because he threw 10 scoreless innings in a 
game the Dodgers were later to lose in the 16th. He was the Cy Young Award 
winner (unanimously), sportsman of the year in Sports Illustrated and male 
athlete of the year in the Associated Press. Among the 23 victories were eight 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 He set the all-time scoreless-inning record of 59 -- but it was really 67 
because he threw 8 1/3 scoreless innings in the first game of the playoffs that 
year. His earned-run average was only faintly visible -- 2.26. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much you could do with a pitched ball he didn't do. He shut out 
the New York Mets in the seventh game of the playoffs. Then he shut out the 
Oakland Athletics in Game 2 of the World Series and pitched the Dodgers to the 
championship in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the great solo performances in baseball history. In sports 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was only four games into the 1990 season when the calliope suddenly 
stopped, the balloons popped. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it seemed like only a springtime sore arm, one of those nagging 
pains. But a couple of X-rays and MRIs later, it was clear this was not a few 
adhesions or a winter lockup of the muscles to be pitched through. This had to 
do with the deterioration of a shoulder. This was more than serious, this was 
catastrophic. This had to do with ending a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Jobe was blunt. No one had ever survived an injury of this kind and 
returned to pitching. You were lucky to return to combing your hair, never mind 
curving a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 His manager, Tom Lasorda, has always called Hershiser "Bulldog," which was a 
mystery to press row. With his stuff, his image ran more to timber wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the league now found out what Lasorda was talking about. 
Hershiser refused to let go. He had the tenacity of an animal that would hang 
on to a rag even if you threw him out a window with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Jobe said I had the wrong injury but I was the right patient," Hershiser 
was recalling the other night at Dodger Stadium. "I did what I was told. I did 
what was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was scared. I thought 'It's over.' Then I thought 'Why?' It's 
only the first inning. They never knock me out of the box in the first inning." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in baseball expected to see Hershiser on a mound again. Except 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
 For 13 months, he kept after his stubborn dream. He got a new battery mate. 
God was calling the pitches. "I couldn't have made it without faith," Hershiser 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
 The discouragements were relentless. The game humored him, but to a man they 
thought Hershiser should take his Cy Young Award and go on home and take up 
another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally started to pitch tentatively, he found how little he had to 
work with. The fastball had lost 8 to 10 m.p.h., the sinker didn't sink and the 
curveball hung like washing on a line -- or a ball on a tee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole range of formulas to pitching," Hershiser recalls. "One of 
the formulas was how to replace the lost skills. You lost velocity on your 
fastball? How do you keep that from the batter? What do you replace it with? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a whole lot of bluffing going on. But it was stimulating. I found I 
relished the challenge. The whole upper end of the spectrum of pitching was 
erased, but I was not without weapons. I took it as a challenge. I reasoned 
that I had spent all those years pitching, I must have learned something 
besides how to rare back and say 'Hey! Hit this!' I think I became a 
professional pitcher. In other years, when all else failed, I always knew I 
could just muscle up and throw it past somebody. Now, I had to trick it past 
them. They would dig in now, which they didn't do before. But you had to find a 
way to use that." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the pain. "You couldn't throw without wincing. But I got a 
series of programs I went through after and before my turn -- three hours a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever worked harder than Hershiser to stay on a roster. The pain 
subsided but didn't go away every day whether he was pitching or not. 
</P>
<P>
 He even consented to go back to the bush leagues. He tested his arm in 
Bakersfield, San Antonio and Phoenix. It was like asking Pavarotti to sing 
barber shop, but Hershiser wasn't worried about billing. He was relearning a 
profession. "I looked at all the pitchers in this game who have succeeded 
without the great velocity or sharp-breaking stuff and I thought, 'If they can 
do it, I can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He has. The pitcher everyone thought was through on April 27, 1990, has won 31 
games since then. He has pitched in 95 games, 591 2/3 innings and struck out 
379. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy with the pair of treys can bluff the ribbon clerks. The guy who puts 
an "e" on 'potato" can get to be Vice President. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that even the arm might be coming around and 3-to-5 m.p.h. might be 
returning to his fastball, Hershiser might come to feel that's nice -- but he 
really doesn't need it.

MIKE PENNER: RAM FANS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES AT FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The five stages of L.A. Ram fandom, or so we have been told: 
</P>
<P>
 1950s: Royally entertained by Waterfield and Van Brocklin, Fears and Hirsch. 
Just happy to have the boys here. 
</P>
<P>
 1960s: In love with George Allen, Roman Gabriel and the Fearsome Foursome. 
Can't wait for Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 1970s: Tormented by Minnesota and Dallas. Cynicism setting in. 
</P>
<P>
 1980s: Re-invigorated by John Robinson and Eric Dickerson. At least until 
Dickerson is traded for a pocketful of sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
 1990s: Fickle. 
</P>
<P>
 Is anybody buying it? 
</P>
<P>
 Not the 1994 Rams season-ticket package; we already know how that's going. 
</P>
<P>
 Is anybody buying the claptrap, recently foisted by Georgia Frontiere and John 
Shaw upon the newspaper readers of Southern California, that the reason the 
Rams are contemplating a move out of town is because Ram fans are fickle, not 
true blue and too prone to bolt to the beach in the face of a measly little 
loss or two? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, it's your fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Frontiere, who inherited a smart, smooth-running football operation from 
her late husband Carroll Rosenbloom, promptly fired the general manager and 
never really replaced him, allowing the franchise to waft rudderless and 
directionless for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Shaw, who placed the team under a strict salary cap 10 years before there 
was one, turning veteran Ram players bitter before their time and scaring off 
many other potential ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Robinson, who lost interest some time after the 1989 season and let the 
talent pool go to pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not John Math, the former draft director who squandered first- and 
second-round selections on Mike Schad, Donald Evans, Gaston Green, Aaron Cox, 
Bill Hawkins, Frank Stams and Brian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Shane Conlan. 
</P>
<P>
 You. 
</P>
<P>
 You are to blame for this mess that has engulfed the Ram franchise like 
quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 You are ones personally responsible for dragging the organization so far down 
that the only way Frontiere and Shaw feel they can extricate themselves is by 
extricating themselves from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Rams were about to set the eastward-ho machinery motion by buying their 
way out of their Anaheim Stadium lease, I asked Shaw about the team's 
relationship with its fans and if he felt the Rams had any moral obligation to 
them, to keeping a 50-year-old Southern California institution in place. 
</P>
<P>
 I know -- what a naive, outmoded, simplistic concept. Where have I been living 
-- on a Tibetan mountaintop since 1962? 
</P>
<P>
 I asked anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw cleared his throat and said, "I think that because of that, because we 
have been here for 50 years, it makes our decision that much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "But obligation is a two-way street. It's not like we're saying to the fans, 
'We're not going to pay for players, we're going to take all the money we can 
take, screw you, we're going to lose every year.' . . . We'd like to provide 
the fans with a winner, we really would. 
</P>
<P>
 "But obligation lies on both sides. We were third from the bottom in home 
attendance last year. Our season-ticket base has dropped from 50,000 to 33,000 
in the three years before this one. Even when we were winning, in '88, '89, we 
came to the realization that if we were not in the playoffs every year, we'd 
have a hard time keeping the fans' interest." 
</P>
<P>
 What is Frontiere supposed to do, Shaw wanted to know -- keep the team in 
Anaheim, thereby remaining morally correct, even if the fans won't come and she 
starts losing money every year? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, obligation might be a two-way street, but it begins with the team. 
That's how it works. The team is the manufacturer -- it assembles the product 
and puts it on the field. Nothing can happen before that. 
</P>
<P>
 The fan is the consumer. If the product is good, the consumer will buy it. But 
if the product sparks and smokes and sets the kitchen cupboard on fire, only a 
fool returns to the store to buy a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're handing out medals for commitment to the cause, Ram fans beat the 
people running the Rams every time. They were the ones who demanded a winner, 
not Frontiere. Even during the good old days, 1985-1989, Ram management never 
played to win it all -- just getting by was fine. The Rams always finished 
second to the 49ers because the 49ers always outspent them. San Francisco paid 
for the top coaches, the top scouts, the top players. The Rams settled for 
second best. Wild cards were enough. Go 10-6, average 57,000, buy Georgia 
another year of international sight-seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the wild cards stopped and the 10-6s became 6-10s, the fans saw 
through the ruse. The 6-10s merely confirmed their suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 If management wasn't dedicated to winning, and if the fans had no say in 
personnel decisions, the fans felt their only course of action was to stay home 
on Sundays. Contrary to what Frontiere and Shaw want the rest of the country to 
believe, those empty seats at Anaheim Stadium last fall weren't a sign of fan 
indifference. They were a sign of fan activism. They were protest votes, each 
and every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 If Frontiere ran a movie studio instead of a football team, and that studio 
kept churning out "Weekend At Bernie's" and "Last Action Hero," the public 
response would be the same. People would stay away until they were given 
something better. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Frontiere ran a movie studio the way she runs her football team, she 
wouldn't invest in better directors and script writers. She'd just stop showing 
her films in Orange County. If it doesn't play in Anaheim, maybe it will play 
in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Some place where the audience is less discerning, less demanding, less 
quality-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Less fickle.

WORLD CUP '94; PLAYING HOST TO THE MOST; VENUES FOR THE WORLD CUP GAMES ARE 
COUNTING ON GOOD SOCCER AND BOOMING BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the soccer community, the essential numbers are 24 teams, 52 matches and 
31 days. For the business community, they are 1.4 million foreign tourists and 
$500 million in tourist spending. Coming in 33 days to a stadium near you, the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance at the sites and scenes: WORSE YET, THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE 
STANFORD BAND TO LEAVE THE FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 With assistance from the ballpark version of a SWAT team, the organizing 
committee's Architecture, Construction and Turf team (ACT), all nine venues 
have received FIFA's good groundskeeping seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet international standards, fields were widened, crowns were removed and 
artificial grass was replaced by the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl, which already had natural turf, replanted it twice within the 
last year. Its first field of dreams withstood the UCLA football season but not 
the recent Pink Floyd concerts.  
</P>
<P>
 The stadium is the only one that has not been tested by soccer within the last 
year -- that will happen June 4 in a game between the United States and Mexico 
-- but FIFA officials expect it to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The only concern they admit to involves Stanford Stadium, where university 
officials will not completely turn over the field to FIFA until after 
graduation exercises June 12. That is only eight days before the first game 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commencement comes first, not World Cup soccer," said Lois Wagner, Stanford's 
director of events and services. I CAN'T TALK NOW, I'VE GOT TO MOW THE DOME 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's not Tonya and Nancy, or Lorena and John, or the Menendez 
brothers, but the installation of natural turf inside the Pontiac Silverdome is 
big news, and not only in agronomy circles. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Sports Illustrated photographers were in Pontiac, 
Mich., taking pictures of a Thai television crew, which was filming the grass 
growing. And you thought soccer was slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so much soccer is played outdoors during chilly winter months, FIFA 
wanted to experiment with a domed stadium to see whether the concept would work 
in other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The first question was whether it was feasible to grow grass indoors. 
Professors at Michigan State's Crop and Soil Sciences Department bet that it 
was, and 6 million pounds of Kentucky bluegrass, soil from Camarillo's Pacific 
Earth Resources Sod Farm and $1.5 million later, they appear to be right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they have done in Michigan is a miracle," German Coach Berti Vogts said 
after his team played there last summer. A LATE ENTRY: BERMUDA 
</P>
<P>
 The only complaint the German coach had concerned the steamy conditions inside 
the Silverdome, which, as the site primarily of Detroit Lion games and other 
winter events, does not have air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat and humidity will be a problem at most venues, where many games have been 
scheduled for the afternoon so that they can be televised in prime time in 
Europe. European coaches have suggested that South American teams have an 
advantage because they are more accustomed to sultry conditions, but Brazil 
wilted in a day game last summer at Washington's RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers cannot do much for the players, who are forced to remain on the 
field for long stretches without breaks because of rules limiting 
substitutions. But relief has been offered to World Cup staff members and 
volunteers in two hot spots, Orlando, Fla., and Dallas. They have been issued 
shorts as part of their uniforms. PULL OVER, PAL. YOU WERE DOING 97.75 IN A 
55.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando's Public Works Dept. is spending $2,500 to erect 100 metric 
speed-limit signs on routes leading to the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an awful job for us," director David Metzker said. "But if 
we're truly an international city, we should adopt those standards." SURGEON 
GENERAL'S WARNING: THE WORLD CUP MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH 
</P>
<P>
 "These people eat later than we do, they smoke heavily, and their demands on 
our services will be unique, compared to what we are used to," said Stephen 
Elmont, owner of Mirabelle restaurant in Boston, speaking for a U.S. service 
industry that is gearing up for an expected 1.4 million foreign soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities, restaurants are extending their hours, printing menus in other 
languages and re-establishing -- or at least increasing space for -- smoking 
sections. Hotels that have nonsmoking floors also are reconsidering their 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, after the World Cup, we'll have to figure out how to get the smoke odor 
out," Elmont said. TODAY'S REFEREE: NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF 
</P>
<P>
 In their effort to wake up local law enforcement authorities to the threats 
posed by hooligans, lager louts and other rowdies, the organizing committee's 
security experts did too good a job.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, FIFA is complaining about an overreaction in Dallas, Palo Alto and 
Washington, where fences have been constructed around the fields to protect 
players and referees from overzealous fans. They point to the tragedy at 
Sheffield, England, in 1989, when 95 were killed and at least 200 injured when 
they surged forward to escape violence behind them and were crushed against a 
security fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA is of the opinion that the only things behind fences are prisoners and 
animals," said the governing body's general secretary, Sepp Blatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter also argues that misbehaving fans usually do not follow their national 
teams, but Dallas' deputy police chief, Rick Hatler, is not buying that after 
witnessing the destruction in Sweden during the 1992 European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is not, 'Will they come?' " he said. "It's how many, and where 
they will cause problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for them in Orlando is Kevin Beary, the sheriff of Orange County, 
Fla., who prepared for the World Cup with crowd and terrorist control training 
in Belfast. His most recent budget request included $262,000 for riot gear, 
bomb-squad devices and other items such as groin protectors for his deputies 
and shin guards for horses. The day after a violent confrontation at an 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando concert between police and Grateful Dead fans, Beary's request was 
approved. MEANWHILE, IN WASHINGTON, BILL CLINTON IS STILL PULLING FOR ARKANSAS 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have to cross an ocean to get here, Germany and Italy would not 
be more at home if they were playing in Munich or Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 Germans are expected to travel with their team to its first-round 
matches in Chicago, where they will be greeted by a thriving community from 
back home. The largest crowd ever to attend a soccer game there, 54,000, 
watched the Germans play at Soldier Field last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known German restaurant in the Loop, the Berghoff, is postponing 
vacations for its employees in anticipation of 4,000 customers a day, twice the 
usual summer crowd, and the Chicago Brauhaus on the North Side is erecting a 
tent in its parking lot to handle all the diners it expects. 
</P>
<P>
 But no team is likely to be greeted more enthusiastically than the Azzurri . 
Three million people of Italian descent within 50 miles of New York made it 
virtually impossible to get tickets to the team's first-round games at the New 
Jersey Meadowlands. AND IN BOSTON, NIGERIAN EYES ARE SMILING 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing against Argentina, Bolivia, Greece, Nigeria and South Korea, but 
Boston, where one in every four persons is of Irish descent, was praying that 
Ireland would play its first-round games there. Even the city's 
Italian-American mayor, Thomas Menino, wore a green tie on the day of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ireland was sent elsewhere, Austin O'Conor, the owner of three Irish pubs 
in Boston, was sobered. But that condition lasted only for a couple of moments 
before he perked up. Turning to a friend, he asked, "What does a Nigerian 
drink?" IN DETROIT, THEY THINK MARADONA IS THE BLONDE SINGER WITH THE 
CONE-SHAPED BRASSIERE 
</P>
<P>
 Desperately seeking a home is America's team, whose fans usually are drowned 
out by those favoring the opponent even at games played in the United States. 
For an example, check out the United Sates-Mexico exhibition on June 4 at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. players believe they finally will be embraced in Pontiac, where they 
open against Switzerland on June 18 before playing their other two first-round 
games at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will be the home team this time," defender Desmond Armstrong said. 
"I mean, Motor City. Motown. That's America right there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Armstrong is there, however, it will be as a spectator or TV commentator. 
He was cut from the team last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And one Detroit native believes that the only way the U.S. players will be 
loved there is if they switch to the kind of football usually played in the 
Silverdome.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Buffalo Bill owner Ralph Wilson, who once owned an extraordinarily 
unsuccessful soccer franchise in Detroit: "Soccer, I think, is a terrible 
spectator sport. Millions like it in Europe, Asia or wherever they play it. 
They don't like it in Detroit." WHAT IS A SIX-LETTER WORD FOR A SPORT IN WHICH 
YOU CAN'T USE YOUR HANDS? 
</P>
<P>
 Officials responsible for making sure that the World Cup runs smoothly in the 
various cities range from those with little previous soccer experience to those 
whose lives have revolved around the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former are Paul Klepper, a former Marine officer who pulled duty 
during Operation Desert Storm in the White House situation room and now serves 
as the assistant venue director in Washington, and Olympic triple jumper Willie 
Banks, who is the assistant venue director in Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the latter is Farrukh Quraishi. A former Hermann Trophy winner, college 
soccer's equivalent of the Heisman, and a professional player for six years 
with the Tampa Bay Rowdies, he is the venue director in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the only official who still wakes up every morning asking, "Why 
me?" is Jay Pritzker, the Hyatt chief who became chairman of Chicago's host 
committee at the behest of Mayor Richard Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew nothing, absolutely nothing about soccer," Pritzker recently told the 
Chicago Tribune. "And you want to know what I know about it now? I know there 
are 11 men on a team, and I know that because it's an answer in crossword 
puzzles." SO WHAT'S NEW? THE CUBS HAVE BEEN BOOTING THE BALL FOR YEARS 
</P>
<P>
 Church bells didn't ring when FIFA announced the World Cup was coming to 
America, but cash registers did. Commerce Department officials estimate that 
foreign soccer fans will spend $500 million, almost a fifth in Southern 
California. The expected benefits to some cities, however, cannot be measured 
in dollars, pesos or marks. 
</P>
<P>
 One city eager to project itself in a better light is Detroit, which, 
according to GQ, has the image of "Sarajevo with car plants." The city's host 
committee chairman, Roger Faulkner, told the magazine, "We've had more written 
about us in the last six months than in the last six years -- and it's not been 
about unemployment or crime, either. We are going to change the perception of 
Detroit worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Another city attempting to make itself over is Chicago, where Gerald Roper, 
president of the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "We have the 
opportunity to dispel our old image and put Al Capone in the grave once and for 
all."

<P>
 Pippen: "Man, I don't want your water. I want my water."

 Jackson: "Toni, Scottie, shut up!"

<P>
 Pippen: "You say his name first."

 Pippen: "Way to kiss up, B.J."

<P>
 Jackson: "OK, the Knicks keep triple-teaming Pippen." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong: "Yeah. It's hard getting Scottie the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Oh, sure."

<P>
 Pippen: "Wasn't hard getting Jordan the ball, was it?"

 Pippen: "Yeah, right. 'Coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "OK, listen up." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Look, just get me the rock and get out of my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc: "Excuse, please. What is 'rock?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Oh, shut up, Koo-Koo." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Look here at the diagram. This 'X' is Horace. And this 'X' is B.J. 
And this 'X' is Scottie." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "I don't like being 'X.' Make me 'O.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "OK! You're 'O!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Because if it was Jordan, you'd make him 'J.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Pippen's the decoy. He takes three Knicks with him."

<P>
 Pippen: "Bench my butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "You want to inbound to Toni. Well, then, you can just outbound 
Scottie." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Fine."

<P>
 Pippen: "Fine what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Have a seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Why let Koo-Koo take the shot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Because he makes the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 John Paxson: "Hey, remember me? I make shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "You still on the team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc: "Coach, you must please let the Mr. Scottie Pippen be taking the shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "Shut up, Toni." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Yeah, shut up, Phony." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant: "Does Kukoc make more money than me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Damn sure does." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant: "Thought so." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Cops ever find a gun in Koo-Koo's car, they'd probably reload it for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "You finished?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "They never even boo Koo-Koo around here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong: "Do they boo you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "Yeah. They boo me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartwright: "Who boos you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen: "That one guy up there, Row 99." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant: "All I want is my money."

<P>
 Jackson: "Toni, pop the J."

 Jackson: "You shoot ball. You win game."

<P>
 Kukoc: "Yes! Thank you!"

<P>
 Pippen: "Oh, brother."

<P>
 Kukoc: "Thank you, brother."

 Pippen: "That ain't what I meant."

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AZINGER, COUPLES, MICKELSON HOPING TO RETURN SOON 
</P>

<P>
 Comebacks are in the works for Paul Azinger, Fred Couples and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, the 1993 PGA champion, might be back on the PGA Tour in two months if 
he continues to respond to treatment for cancer in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart said last week at the GTE Bryon Nelson tournament that Azinger 
told him he would like to return for the New England Classic July 21-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have treated Azinger's cancer with chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood. All Azinger has said is that he intends to 
defend his PGA title at Southern Hills in Tulsa Aug. 11-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson might be back for the Southwestern Bell Colonial in two weeks. He 
suffered a broken femur and ankle in a skiing accident in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, beaten by Mickelson in a playoff at La Costa in January, is still a 
month to six weeks away, according to his agent. Couples suffered a herniated 
disk in March and has been rehabilitating his back in Dallas, where he has 
recently started to hit balls again. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples expects to be able to play in the U.S. Open June 21-24 at Oakmont 
Country Club, agent Len Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Lee Janzen has not finished among the top 10 in a tournament since he won 
last year's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI II: Seve Ballesteros won a tournament in Europe last week to qualify for 
the U.S. Open. The last foreign player to win the U.S. Open was David Graham of 
Australia in 1981 at Merion Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parity: The PGA Tour has gone 18 weeks without a two-time winner, the longest 
streak in Tour history. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A mouthful: The winner of the McDonald's LPGA Championship today will earn 
$165,000, enough for about 235,000 McDonald's cheeseburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New game: We know Andre Agassi can drill a forehand, but can he make a putt? 
The answer is forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana and George Brett are co-commissioners of the Pro Athletes Golf 
League, which kicks off a four-city tour in July at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The league comprises current and former professional athletes and a so-called 
"core group" of players who endorse the league and compete: Agassi, Jim Brown, 
Marcus Allen, John Brodie, Rick Mears, Walter Payton, Brooks Robinson, Kyle 
Rote Jr., O.J. Simpson, James Worthy and Robin Yount. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are eligible for the league only if they have played at least five 
years and have been either an All-Star or been voted most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it going to fly? ESPN has signed a multiyear contract to carry the league's 
events.

NBA TAKES A STERN VIEW OF THIS FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memo to NBA players: 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to fight, pick a game that is not attended by Commissioner David 
Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Harper of the New York Knicks was suspended for two games and Jo Jo 
English of the Chicago Bulls for one for their part in Friday's fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was fined $15,000, English $10,000. Fifteen other players -- eight 
Bulls and seven Knicks -- were fined $2,500. Each team was fined $50,000 for a 
grand total of $162,500, the second-highest total in NBA history behind the 
$163,000 Charles Barkley-Bill Laimbeer Philadelphia 76er-Detroit Piston rumble 
April 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper and English tangled in the second quarter. Harper threw English to the 
floor and other players then dived on them, rolling over fans sitting 
courtside, directly in front of Stern, who was sitting five rows back. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, asked how bad it was Friday, said only: "It's bad enough." MARK HEISLER

BULLS INSIST PIPPEN'S DEFECTION LATE IN GAME 3 IS BEHIND THEM; NBA PLAYOFFS: HE 
APOLOGIZES TO TEAMMATES FOR SITTING OUT THE LAST PLAY AGAINST THE KNICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No mas?  
</P>
<P>
 No more was right. The day after Scottie Pippen joined Roberto Duran in the 
quitting hall of fame, the Chicago Bulls circled the wagons, raised the 
drawbridge and began the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Coach Phil Jackson had already revealed that Pippen took himself out 
of the last play of Friday night's game, and because Pippen had already 
confirmed doing it after they "kind of exchanged some words," they had their 
work cut out. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen apologized to his teammates after the game for his petulance -- he had 
said he was angry because Jackson set up the play for Toni Kukoc instead of 
Pippen -- but has refused to discuss the issue since. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked where he and Jackson were going Saturday, he said only: "To Game 4," and 
took no more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, Bull players all pretended ignorance or made up reasons why 
Pippen wasn't on the floor ("I think he was hurt or something like that," Kukoc 
said). Jackson marched to the interview room and declared that Pippen had asked 
out, an unpardonable sin for a physically sound star in a critical situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, however, with today's Game 4 against the New York Knicks 24 hours 
away, Jackson issued a pardon, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than assess the damage to his team, Jackson made a statement, thought 
up excuses for Pippen and, in an increasingly popular technique among the 
Bulls, refused to take further questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I know you're all here to get a lot of answers to a lot of questions," 
Jackson said, "but I'm not going to answer your questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we did as a basketball team off the court last night was try to heal 
some wounds, to get together as a basketball club again and do the things we've 
always done well as champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basketball game was well played, and it was a topsy-turvy event and the 
players were fatigued mentally, physically, emotionally by that game, by the 
intensity of that game. I think you saw how highly wrapped maybe New York is 
and how highly wrapped the emotion is in this series and the pressures that are 
playing upon these players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to add to them. I know you don't either, as press people. And I 
know it's your job to expose and to make us all look human and naked. We're not 
going to do that, to our team or to any individual on our team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Scottie chose not to go on the court last night for his own specific reasons. 
I put in a better passer in Pete Myers. Besides, Scottie had a fat lip and 
looked ugly at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we got the job accomplished, and that's all that matters."  
</P>
<P>
 Pippen's resentment of Kukoc goes back three seasons when the Bulls, having 
drafted the European star, made Pippen wait for a contract extension, keeping a 
slot open for Kukoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan and Pippen both sneered openly at the front office's coup. At 
the '92 Olympics, Pippen went out of his way to shut Kukoc down when the United 
States played Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc joined the Bulls this season with a contract that makes him a free agent 
this summer. The Bulls are expected to bump him into the $3-million class, 
almost as much as Pippen makes. Pippen has complained privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen has been further upset at the anticipated departure of his buddy, 
Horace Grant. Only six Bulls remain from the last championship team and, after 
free-agent defections and retirements, it could be two by next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen said recently he "thinks about it every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, he took only four shots in the fourth quarter, missing three as 
the Knicks wiped out Chicago's 20-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three fourth quarters in this series, he has made only three shots as 
the Knicks have outscored the Bulls, 87-49. 
</P>
<P>
 On Pippen's last offensive play, he held the ball too long and was called for 
a 24-second violation. During the play, he yelled at Kukoc, telling him to 
clear off his side of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 After Patrick Ewing's basket with 1.8 seconds left tied the score, Jackson set 
up a play for Kukoc, who had won three regular-season games at the buzzer, 
rather than the cold Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 A replay shows Pippen in the huddle, wincing visibly, throwing his head back 
in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Jackson had a brief exchange. Pippen took a seat. Grant and assistant 
coach John Bach came over to talk to him, but Pippen stayed where he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen's assignment was to throw the ball in to Kukoc. Jackson sent in Myers, 
rescued from the CBA this season to replace Jordan in the starting lineup, to 
make the pass, perfectly it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc caught the ball, turned and made the 20-footer that won the game and cut 
the Knick lead in the series to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that was said or needed to be said was taken care of last night," 
the Bulls' Bill Wennington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a team issue, an in-house thing. It's nothing serious. It's nothing that 
probably hasn't gone on a million times in everyone else's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Pippen) talked to us all and let us know where he was standing and what 
he was feeling and apologized to everyone, just for the incident in general. 
Not that anything was done wrong or anything, just the whole incident."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; LAKERS HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF -- OR SIMPLY MORE OF SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 News item: Del Harris becomes Laker coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 The job description for the man who followed Magic Johnson was supposed to be 
a big name who coached an exciting, up-tempo game and could command the respect 
of talented post-teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is middle-aged, coaches a pattern game and hasn't been seen hanging out 
at any rap concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: Jerry Buss reportedly wanted the new coach to have pro 
experience. Rick Pitino turned them down and Jerry West's list of college 
prospects -- Roy Williams, Bob Huggins and Gary Williams -- didn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an NBA conceit that only pro coaches can coach the pro game. Indeed, a 
college coach moving up needs an experienced assistant and/or half a season to 
adjust, but basketball is basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 What, the Lakers didn't have half a season to play with? A bad start might 
cost them the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 If you want bright young coaches, they are in college. If you want pro 
experience, you either find a disgruntled star -- Don Nelson was merely 
slightly disenchanted -- an untried assistant or a retread. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is widely respected. Nelson, for whom he worked as an assistant, no 
doubt vouched for him. Mike Dunleavy, an assistant under Harris in Milwaukee, 
considered him one of the sharpest coaches in the game. West thought about 
hiring him two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They have him now. If they get him some players and show him some patience, it 
will be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, it's the oldest dance in the biz, the merry-go-round trip to 
nowhere. BULLS-KNICKS: SAY GOOD-NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 Their rivalry has lost nothing, but their day is ending. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the Knicks and Bulls were the best show in the NBA. Now 
Commissioner David Stern simply hopes to resolve this series without asking for 
U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Pat Riley saw his first Knick team collapse at the end of the regular 
season, then turned them around to take the Bulls to seven games in a series 
loaded with drama: John Starks' clothesline of Scottie Pippen in Game 6; Pippen 
swooning in the face of Knick harassment; Michael Jordan proving he feared 
nothing and no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring they went six with Starks' highlight-reel left-handed dunk in Game 
2, Jordan's midnight ride to Atlantic City, Jordan's 54 points in Game 4, 
Charles Smith's four blocked layups in Game 5 and Pippen's return to prove he 
really was a star. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring's threadbare version matches Chicago's Jordanaires in search of a 
lead singer with New York's ambitious bricklayers.  
</P>
<P>
 Only six Bulls remain from last season. With John Paxson and Bill Cartwright 
expected to retire and Horace Grant and Scott Williams to sign elsewhere, it 
could soon be two. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's Knicks were never better than that spring of '92, before they traded 
Mark Jackson for Smith and before Xavier McDaniel, worried he was out of the 
picture, fled to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are klutzes. Their only good shooter is their 7-foot center. Starks 
has a lot of heart but only one good knee and must depend on his never-trusty 
jump shot. So far, he is shooting 33%. In '92, McDaniel averaged 19 points 
against the Bulls; this spring, Smith is at six. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of Riley's popularity, dwarfing anything he had in Los Angeles, 
that New Yorkers are convinced the Knicks are title-bound, a tall order for 
this squad even in a down year. 
</P>
<P>
 They are favored to come out of the East and would have home-court advantage 
over Phoenix. But if something bad happens, management is going to be looking 
at a roster with six players over 30. 
</P>
<P>
 And management is once again in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, which owned Madison Square Garden and hired Riley, has been taken 
over by Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom says it will now sell MSG. 
</P>
<P>
 For your nightmare scenario, check this: George Steinbrenner, whose Yankees 
have a $486-million cable contract with MSG, will reportedly be one of the 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in Utah," Knick President Dave Checketts, another Paramount 
holdover, told the New York Daily News, "a new owner (Larry Miller) came in and 
wanted to be in the locker room and shoot with the players. At one point, he 
even thought he could coach it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came to the point where his sons came in and told me everything I was 
doing wrong. They were 12 and 14 years old. I'm not kidding you. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we have a new man came in who wants to sit on the bench and tell us 
how to do things? It's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley professes indifference "whether one billion-dollar company owns us or 
another." But if things go wrong this postseason and if the wrong buyer steps 
up, Riley could find his power reduced, his players old, his fans angry, the 
tabloids nibbling on him and his window of opportunity closing as the young 
Eastern powers grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also says he might keep coaching into his 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte, anyone? SONIC BOOM: WHAT HAPPENED? 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, what didn't? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone out there who wrote a Gary Payton-grows-up-story, you should have 
waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Same for anyone who said Shawn Kemp was the next great player. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a brief chronology of their series against the Denver Nuggets: 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2, halftime: Payton and Ricky Pierce, whose recent return from injury 
restored the four-man logjam at guard, had to be separated after Payton called 
Pierce selfish. The SuperSonics went on to win and take a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 3: The Nuggets won by 17. Payton snapped at everybody afterward in the 
dressing room, so offensively that mild-mannered Sam Perkins told him to shut 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 4: The Nuggets edged them in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 5: The SuperSonics -- how to phrase it? -- gagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were passive," Coach George Karl said. "We were scared. We were nervous. 
We were excuse-oriented. We had bad attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 They had Payton, who went at it with Pierce again after Game 5. This time 
Kendall Gill had to break them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later: The SuperSonics had their annual breakup meeting. Payton and 
Kemp didn't show. Said Karl: "That's disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a devastated Karl, apparently mistaking TNT's Craig Sager for a 
shrink or someone from 911, said he has "periods when I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically embarrassed. Been humbled. And I don't know what to do. I don't 
know where to go, who to talk to. I don't know where to hang out. Basketball is 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he does have an idea what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The honeymoon is definitely over," Karl told SuperSonic reporters. "The 
hammer is now in my hands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I let winning camouflage my instincts, and because of it I made some 
mistakes. You're winning games, Shawn is late for a bus and then for a 
practice. Gary doesn't practice hard. What do you do, blow up and bomb them 
when you're on an 11-game winning streak?" 
</P>
<P>
 Immaturity is an issue, but so is their pressing, open-court game. It's great 
for the fans, but if you want to play in postseason, you have to be able to 
play in the half-court. ROCKETS GO BOOM TOO 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the haunted playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets have their own public humiliation to live down after 
blowing that 20-point fourth-quarter lead to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 The scapegoat: Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, second-guessed for running the same 
play -- to Hakeem Olajuwon in the low post -- over and over down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 In an upset, it wasn't combustible Vernon Maxwell or clubhouse lawyer Kenny 
Smith talking, but mild-mannered Robert Horry and Matt Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Horry: "They were keying on one play, and we still kept running it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bullard: "Every day before games, we run about 50 plays. The last 15 
minutes of the game, we ran one play, and it was the wrong play. I don't know 
why we didn't run one of the other 49." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Rockets only scored eight points in the quarter, it's hard to defend 
Tomjanovich. He was sucked in by Paul Westphal, who had A.C. Green guarding 
Olajuwon -- but only until the ball arrived, and then he had plenty of 
defensive help. 
</P>
<P>
 When Olajuwon passed the ball out, the other Rockets -- how to phrase it? -- 
didn't respond well under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tomjanovich who created order from the years of Rocket chaos. However, 
this is only Tomjanovich's second postseason as a head coach and he hasn't been 
past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, owner Les Alexander has put him in charge of the basketball 
operation, at which Tomjanovich is a novice. Team doctors knocked down his 
first initiative, trading Horry for Sean Elliott, who had a liver problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott returned to Detroit and finished the season. He would have come in 
handy last Wednesday in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are looking for scapegoats, make it a team photo.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; REDS ARE FINDING SAFER HAVEN IN THE NL CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, no longer thumbs her nose at city 
ordinances by smoking openly in Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 She has let her team do the smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds have opened a comfortable early lead over the Houston Astros, St. 
Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep playing the way we're playing into the next month, we'll have no 
problem (winning the division title)," outfielder Kevin Mitchell said recently 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Said General Manager Jim Bowden: "It was very important to get off to a good 
start after the nightmare we went through last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds were racked by injuries in 1993, ultimately employing 53 players, and 
distracted by Schott's suspension for ethnic and racial slurs and the firing of 
popular manager Tony Perez in May. 
</P>
<P>
 They finished 73-89, 31 games behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of the race by June," Bowden said. "It was a very emotional year, 
and all of us -- from the front office to the field staff to the players -- 
were determined to put it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds' strong start is one of baseball's best. Bowden didn't make wholesale 
changes, but several players returned from injuries, some fringe deals are 
returning big dividends and the Reds are executing well under the experienced 
leadership of Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 They are first in the league in runs and team batting, second in earned-run 
average and among the fielding leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bowden -- baseball's youngest general manager at 32 -- feel redeemed for 
the heat he took over the early firing of Perez last year? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at it that way," he said. "I felt we had a nucleus good enough 
to win, but it needed the leadership of a proven manager. Davey won 90 or more 
games five times with the Mets. He won a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I got spoiled starting my career in the Pittsburgh organization and 
watching the impact Jim Leyland made. I know we pulled the trigger quickly on 
Tony, but we told him initially that we didn't have time to develop a manager. 
We even asked him what he thought we should do if the team didn't respond and 
he said, 'You have to fire me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We had that good nucleus, and I felt we needed an intelligent and experienced 
manager to take us to the next level. It was a difficult and precarious 
situation for Davey, given Tony's popularity and the injuries we encountered 
last year, but he's done a tremendous job starting fresh. The team came out of 
spring training well prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been easy, however. There has been another siege of serious 
injuries. Closer Rob Dibble, catcher Joe Oliver and pitcher Steve Foster were 
sidelined indefinitely, even before Tom Browning, off to his best start at 3-1, 
suffered a broken arm while delivering a pitch in San Diego on Monday night. 
That's a cumulative $8 million, said Bowden, guardian of the budget-conscious 
Schott's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, shortstop Barry Larkin has had trouble lifting his average above 
.215, Jose Rijo had been struggling before going seven shutout innings against 
the Padres on Tuesday night, and Tony Fernandez, signed as a free agent to play 
third base for a bargain $500,000, has done the job, but in a clearly sour way 
-- unhappy he isn't playing shortstop and isn't being paid more, even though he 
had no alternatives when the Reds made their offer. 
</P>
<P>
 After a game against Houston last weekend, the grumbling Fernandez, his 
teammates disenchanted, threw a chair into a clubhouse hamper, packed his 
equipment bag, wished Larkin good luck and left as if he wasn't returning. He 
was back the next day as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson shook his head the other day, said he wasn't concerned and wouldn't 
become concerned as long as Fernandez's attitude didn't affect the team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been in a disagreeable mood all year," the manager said. "If you gave 
him a $5 bill, he'd ask for five ones instead. It might be time for him to be a 
little more grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Working within narrow budget parameters while receiving limited help from his 
farm system, Bowden has had to mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin and center fielder Reggie Sanders are the only regulars developed by 
the Reds. Starting pitchers Browning and Tim Pugh came out of the Cincinnati 
system, as did John Roper, who was 6-0 at Indianapolis and is expected to face 
the Dodgers on Saturday in his first 1994 start as Browning's replacement. The 
bullpen was almost entirely imported. 
</P>
<P>
 "With revenues decreasing as much as they are, the only way to keep the 
payroll down is to get good young blood, and the only way to do that if your 
farm system isn't producing is with trades," Bowden said, referring to his 
largely unheralded but significant off-season acquisitions of second baseman 
Bret Boone, starter Erik Hanson and relievers Hector Carrasco, Chuck McElroy 
and Johnny Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's bullpen committee of Carrasco, McElroy, Ruffin and the rejuvenated 
Jeff Brantley has been the league's best, compensating for the loss of Dibble, 
and a key to the Reds' success. Mitchell, recovered from the broken foot and 
blown rotator cuff that ended his 1993 season prematurely and motivated by the 
last year of his contract, has provided power many thought had been lost in the 
cafeteria line. And John Smiley, 3-9 as a free-agent disappointment last year, 
is 4-2 after elbow surgery, a key to the rotation that must now weather the 
loss of Browning. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell about that, but Bowden says the Reds have one other thing going 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest acquisition we made was moving to the Central Division and out of 
any division in which Atlanta plays," he said. "Ninety or 92 wins might be good 
enough in our division, but a hundred might not be enough in Atlanta's 
division." MORE MITCH 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Reds' promising start, Mitchell is looking to return to the Padres 
or San Francisco Giants as a free agent next season. "Those are the two teams 
I'm thinking about," he said. "The Padres need a proven cleanup hitter. I think 
I can come back and help them." PADRE SALE 
</P>
<P>
 The word among major league owners is that they expect the Padres to be sold 
within two months. Tom Werner, the Padres' managing partner, has acknowledged 
that he is negotiating but added that the club would not be moved. The asking 
price is believed to be $85 million, which lends a curious aspect to Werner's 
constant laments about the sad state of baseball economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner and his group paid $65 million for the Padres in 1990. Werner got the 
expansion money, along with the cash flow and tax depreciation benefits while 
gutting the team and its payroll, now a major league-low $13.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So for taking the Padres from contender to major league pretender and 
alienating the city, the financial benefits he has already enjoyed probably 
will be enhanced by a $20-million profit on the sale. GIANT WOES 
</P>
<P>
 With Will Clark gone, Robby Thompson on the disabled list because of a partial 
tear in his rotator cuff and Barry Bonds wincing on every swing after being hit 
on the elbow by a fastball from Eric Hillman, the wheels seem to be coming off 
the San Francisco offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds insists he is in the lineup to stay, but he is also talking about 
postseason surgery for bone chips that were there even before Hillman further 
inflamed the elbow. It's no guarantee he can wait until October, acknowledging 
he can't extend on pitches he would normally drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson suffered his injury diving for a ground ball April 12. It's a major 
factor in his .202 average. He's on the 15-day disabled list, but a rotator 
tear seldom mends that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just a physical blow, it's a mental blow," Manager Dusty Baker 
said of Thompson's loss. "Baseball's about more than just hitting. Robby calls 
the plays. He calls time out so the pitcher can take a break. There are a lot 
of things he does that don't show up in the box score." PHILLIES FADE 
</P>
<P>
 Bidding to go from last to first to last in the NL East, Philadelphia took a 
2-15 road record into a 13-game trip that began Friday. Curt Schilling, the 
alleged ace, is 0-6. Jeff Juden, the alleged replacement for Terry Mulholland, 
is 1-4. John Kruk has returned to the disabled list because of knee surgery, 
deriding the Veterans Stadium AstroTurf in the process -- "It's like running on 
cement." 
</P>
<P>
 A miserable start became worse Tuesday night when the Phillies blew an 8-1 
ninth-inning lead and lost to the Braves in 15 innings, 9-8. "That's probably 
the toughest game I've ever managed," Jim Fregosi said. "Tougher even than the 
15-14 loss in the World Series. I mean, I thought I had seen it all, but I 
guess I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Bill Giles might soon have seen enough and order General 
Manager Lee Thomas, who has already questioned his players' priorities, to 
dismantle a team that has nine potential free agents. Said Giles: "We called 
last year's highlight film 'Whatever It Takes' because we did whatever it took 
to win. This year the title still works because whatever it takes to lose a 
game, we do."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * CHANGING OF THE GUARD: In a concession to his team's status as the American 
League doormat and because of the need to develop young players, Detroit Tiger 
Manager Sparky Anderson has basically benched Alan Trammell to give former Long 
Beach State infielder Chris Gomez a one-month shot as the regular shortstop. 
Trammell will play shortstop one or two days a week and be designated hitter 
against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 22 and we're in last place," Anderson said of Gomez. "What am I supposed 
to do, develop a 22-year-old or a 36-year-old? It's time to find out if the kid 
can play every day." Said Trammell: "I happen to be at the one position we have 
a young player who looks like he has some potential. I'm not so headstrong that 
I can't look at all sides of things. I want this organization to do well after 
I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * INSULT? New York Yankee outfielder Paul O'Neill is leading the major leagues 
in hitting and challenging .500, but his name does not appear on the AL 
All-Star ballot. Yankee Manager Buck Showalter said he had four deserving 
outfielders -- Danny Tartabull, Luis Polonia and Bernie Williams being the 
others -- and put four sticks in a cup. O'Neill drew the short one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost fair and square," O'Neill said. "It's not that big a deal. I never get 
enough votes anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD YANKEES: They have had special assignment scout Dick Williams following 
Montreal Expo reliever Mel Rojas, and General Manager Gene Michael says 
something might happen soon. Rojas converted seven of eight save opportunities 
while John Wetteland was on the disabled list and got to like it so much that 
he asked to be traded when Wetteland returned. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE GANT WATCH: Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos has reportedly decided 
to reopen his wallet in a pursuit of Ron Gant and a division crown in the 
formidable AL East. In his recovery from the broken leg that cost him his job 
with the Atlanta Braves, Gant is playing golf, batting in a cage, working out 
on a stationary bicycle and step machine and will begin running in June, agent 
Eric Goldschmidt said. He added that as many as 10 clubs have shown interest in 
his sidelined client. Angelos reportedly would pay $2.5 million for half a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * BAY BUSTS: It keeps getting worse for the Oakland Athletics, who had lost 20 
of 22 games before a weekend series against the Kansas City Royals. Aside from 
the injuries that had put Mark McGwire, Steve Karsay and recently signed Steve 
Sax on the disabled list, Rickey Henderson was batting .210 when he too went on 
the DL Friday. In addition, Ruben Sierra was batting .207, including .182 with 
runners in scoring position. "They've been missing in action the last few 
weeks," General Manager Sandy Alderson said of Henderson and Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 * VINTAGE YEARS: The St. Louis Cardinals' Bob Tewksbury (7-0) won only 21 
games before he was 30. He has 51 victories in the three years since then. "If 
life keeps getting this good, I can't wait until I'm 70," he said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ IS ABLE TO TAKE BATTING PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman Eduardo Perez took batting practice Saturday for the first time 
since receiving a cortisone shot in his injured left wrist on Wednesday. He 
reported feeling no pain afterward but said the real test will come this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wake up, that's the moment of truth," said Perez, who sat out his 
ninth consecutive game because of a sprained ligament. "I'm confident. I've got 
to be. It's a little tender where they shot it, but I think that's more from 
the needle. The muscle feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said his timing was a little off, but he also told Manager Buck Rodgers 
that his wrist felt better than at any time since the injury April 26 at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no firm timetable for Perez's return to the lineup. But, barring 
soreness this morning, Perez hopes to take batting practice again today. Then, 
he will have his wrist examined when the Angels return to Anaheim on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, playing at triple-A Vancouver, wasn't recalled, further indication 
that his future is elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers gave Jim Edmonds the night off and couldn't use Perez, so he started 
Spike Owen at first, Owen's first start at that position. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, primarily a shortstop and second baseman, said his major league 
experience at first amounted to "about eight innings (in late-game replacement 
roles)." 
</P>
<P>
 He joked before the game that he was particularly concerned about hard-hit 
grounders on the Kingdome's fast artificial turf. But he cleanly fielded his 
first chance, a slow grounder by Eric Anthony, and outran the Seattle leadoff 
hitter to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's Randy Johnson, 2-3 with a 6.00 earned-run average, will start 
today's game instead of Roger Salkeld, who will start Tuesday against Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners also sent reliever Jim Converse to their triple-A affiliate at 
Calgary. The Angels battered Converse for three runs and five hits in 1 1/3 
innings in their 11-1 victory Friday. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES; BRETT'S NO. 5 IS RETIRED BY 
THE ROYALS

<P>
 No. 5, worn by George Brett during his 20-year career, became the first 
player's number retired by the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the greatest players in Royals history," said Muriel Kauffman, 
the widow of Royal founder Ewing Kauffman."He is not only a good athlete, he 
played hard and he played to win, and that's what it is all about. He was one 
wonderful example in the clubhouse to all the younger players and he helped 
build a winning team." 
</P>
<P>
 With 3,154 hits and batting titles in each of three decades, it appears 
certain that Brett will go into baseball's Hall of Fame with Nolan Ryan and 
Robin Yount once the five-year waiting period is up. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Darryl Hamilton of the Milwaukee Brewers (elbow) and catcher Mike 
Stanley of the New York Yankees (hamstring) were put on the 15-day disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In his first pinch-hit appearance of the season, Michael Jordan struck out in 
the ninth inning of the Birmingham Barons' 9-7 loss to the Jacksonville Suns. 
Jordan is batting .255.

 GAME TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Games consist of 45-minute halves, with the clock stopped only for injuries 
and the issuance of yellow and red cards. Ties can occur in first-round World 
Cup matches, but after that the outcome is decided first by a 30-minute 
overtime, then by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 OUT OF BOUNDS 
</P>
<P>
 A ball is judged to be out of bounds when it has completely crossed over an 
endline or a sideline. 
</P>

 They assist the referee. They are positioned on each sideline and are 
primarily responsible for making offside calls and signaling when the ball is 
out of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Linesmen use flags that are raised to signal an infraction and possession on a 
throw-in. 
</P>
<P>
 SCORING 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the attacking team has not violated the rules, a goal is scored 
when the whole ball crosses the goal line -- under the crossbar and between the 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is played with a leather ball about 27-28 inches in circumference and 
weighing 14-16 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 GOAL 
</P>
<P>
 Posts must be eight yards apart and equidistant from the corner flags. The 
crossbar must be eight feet high. The circumference of the posts and crossbar 
may not exceed five inches. 
</P>
<P>
 THROW IN 
</P>
<P>
 The ball is returned to play from the side point it crosses a sideline by a 
two-handed overhead throw with both feet on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEATS 
</P>
<P>
 Different types and lengths of studs are used on the soles of the cleats 
depending on the field condition -- whether it is hard or yielding, wet or dry, 
slippery or firm. 
</P>
<P>
 SHINGUARD 
</P>
<P>
 Players are required to wear a protective pad inside their socks to prevent 
serious injury to their shins from tackles or errant kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 GOALKEEPER 
</P>
<P>
 The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to use his hands, and then only 
within the goal area. He is allowed to punt or throw the ball after gaining 
possession, but cannot carry the ball for more than four steps. 
</P>
<P>
 THE FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 Dimensions will vary from site to site during the World Cup. Except for the 
fields at the Silverdome and Giants Stadium, which are 113 yards long and 72 
yards wide, the soccer fields at the other sites are 115 yards long long and 74 
yards wide.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; TWO HONDA-POWERED CARS QUALIFY 26 YEARS AFTER 
FIRST SPEEDWAY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff qualified the first Honda-powered Indy 
cars for the 500 Saturday, they aren't the first Hondas to run on the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Research by Tim Considine of Autoweek reveals that Ronnie Bucknum drove a 
Honda Grand Prix car on a cold November day in 1968 to compare the capabilities 
of Formula One and Indy cars for Honda chief engineer and designer Yoshio 
Nakamura. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucknum, who later drove in three 500s, was clocked at 171 m.p.h., which would 
have put the Honda V12 on the front row with the Lotus turbines in 1968. It was 
apparently the first rear-engine car with a wing to run at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucknum's son, Jeff, who lives in Pismo Beach, Calif., and drives in the Skip 
Barber Formula Ford series, visited the Speedway for the first time this week 
as a guest of Honda. His father, once a prominent Southern California sports 
car driver, died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Why is 33 the magic number of starters in the 500? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Arie Luyendyk won the Indy 500 pole last year, he became the fifth driver 
to win rookie of the year, the pole and the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are Parnelli Jones, Jimmy Clark, Mario Andretti and Rick Mears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is his fifth year in Indy car racing, when Willy T. Ribbs 
practiced last week in a 1994 Lola-Ford Cosworth, it was the first time he had 
ever been in new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like driving a Cadillac," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Because in 1912, when top speeds were about 85 m.p.h., race 
officials determined that 400 feet was needed for each car. Since there are 
13,200 feet in 2 1/2 miles, that left room for 33 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of the 500 winner gulping milk in Victory Lane began when Louis 
Meyer, winner of the 1936 race, was photographed drinking his favorite 
beverage, buttermilk, after his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive of the Milk Foundation, now the American Dairy Assn., saw the 
picture and decided it had great promotional value. From that day on, the 
winner has received a bottle of milk to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi broke with tradition last year when he made his first drink 
orange juice, then milk. Fittipaldi is a major exporter of orange juice from 
his native Brazil. SHAV GLICK

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; FOREMAN HASN'T LOST APPETITE FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Foreman, once again a soulless sport turns its lonely eyes to you. 
</P>
<P>
 In a combination of need and greed, circumstances suddenly encourage the 
emergence of a television-friendly heavyweight to challenge the current, sullen 
champion. The big money is being flashed again to the big man. 
</P>
<P>
 And Foreman is not about to skip his second midlife title-fight payday, even 
though he is now 45 (or older), even though he hasn't fought since he was 
beaten by Tommy Morrison last June 7, and even though his family is loath to 
see him re-enter this violent world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so excited about this," Foreman said from his ranch in Marshall, Tex. 
"It's sometimes hard to believe it's really happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the deal-makers somehow botch it or old feuds overtake the 
negotiations, Foreman will fight for the International Boxing Federation and 
World Boxing Assn. heavyweight titles before the end of this year against 
Michael Moorer, the 26-year-old left-hander who overturned all of the 
multimillion-dollar unification plans by defeating Evander Holyfield last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer might make his first defense against Joe Hipp in August or September, 
then fight Foreman next. Or he might go right to a November date against 
Foreman, which could earn Moorer about $10 million and give Foreman more than 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this happening? Although there is the freak show potential -- "I'm 20 
years older than this fellow, at least," Foreman said with a laugh -- nobody 
buys this fight if they don't think Foreman has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when he gave Holyfield a decent fight in Holyfield's first 
title defense, Foreman had been slowly building credibility with a steady 
stream of victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the credibility coming from this time? 
</P>
<P>
 It's in Foreman's drawing power. The Holyfield fight drew a still-record 1.4 
million pay-per-view homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in Foreman's bulk -- he says he will get down to a relatively trim 240 or 
less to fight Moorer -- and Foreman's power against the 6-foot-2, 214-pound 
Moorer's perceived vulnerability against any larger man who can jab. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the broadest sense, it's in the vast disillusionment over Moorer and 
Britain's Lennox Lewis -- two dangerous but limited fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the champions are pretty good, Moorer and the guy from Europe, I 
can't even think of his name," Foreman said teasingly of Lewis, the World 
Boxing Council champion. "(Lewis) fought a C fighter (a knockout of Phil 
Jackson May 6), you know -- like you have B movies -- and was getting hit and 
having trouble. It makes you start wondering . . . not that they aren't good, 
but where is the competition? Where is it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The state of heavyweights in boxing is not that good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what? People who are in the business are actually saying for the 
first time I could probably whup this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Moorer camp, a unification bout against Lewis is off until next year, 
and the real cash comes when Mike Tyson gets out of prison sometime next year. 
Foreman appears to be the least risky of the remaining big-money choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about maybe Lennox Lewis or Riddick Bowe," said Moorer's 
manager, John Davimos. "Those are the real big paydays. So, before we can get 
to those, what I'm excited about is as much money as we can possibly make with 
as little risk -- without getting crucified by media." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Foreman expect another shot at the title after Moorer defeated Holyfield? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all did I think it was possible," Foreman said. "But I called 
(promoter) Bob Arum after the fight and he said, 'You know, George, this is a 
grand opportunity for you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You have a point.' All I have to do is just go in a gym to lose a 
lot of weight. . . . For this fight, I'll work hard. I might even get into the 
(230s) this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Him being a southpaw doesn't mean anything to me. I swing from left field 
anyway, so what does that matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the Moorer-Holyfield broadcast, Foreman criticized the judging 
that gave Moorer the decision and strongly implied that Dan Duva, promoter of 
both men, had unduly influenced the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 That enraged Duva, and HBO deleted the commentary from the cable replay days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when HBO did that," Foreman said. "I watched HBO one evening, 
and some of the things they say and do on there is a lot worse than anything I 
ever did, and then to take out something said as the heartfelt truth, it makes 
you wonder who's afraid of what." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to stop the Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie Randall rematch because of 
a head butt-caused cut over Chavez's right eye last week was confusing, but the 
real controversy over Chavez's bizarre eight-round technical-decision victory 
should be focused on Mexican judge Ray Solis. He was hand-picked by the World 
Boxing Council to work the super-lightweight title bout, but reportedly is not 
allowed to judge in Tijuana because of failing eyesight. He scored the fight 
for Chavez, 77-74, a strange score for anyone who saw Randall dominate Chavez. 
But this is not new. Solis also judged that Chavez, who was knocked down and 
assessed two penalty points, had won the first bout against Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, suggested 
that Solis and other "nationalistic" judges such as him no longer be approved 
to score Nevada fights. "It just looks wrong," Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
 World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez is 
recuperating from operations on his right hand that inserted, then removed a 
screw to strengthen injured ligaments. Said Hernandez, who has never been paid 
more than $160,000 for a fight: "It's about time I get a big payday. I'm tired 
of just sitting and waiting. I've decided I'll fight anybody from featherweight 
to lightweight, Rafael Ruelas, Gabriel Ruelas, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, anybody, 
if the money is right. I'm not getting anything just sitting here with my 
title. I've got to do something."  
</P>
<P>
 Among the fighters working at Larry Goossen's Big Bear gym these days are 
Riddick Bowe, Oscar De La Hoya, the Ruelas brothers, WBA cruiserweight champion 
Orlin Norris and heavyweight Jeremy Williams, who is working with trainer Joe 
Goossen. Williams, who suffered the first defeat of his career last March when 
he was dominated by Larry Donald, has left Manager Bill Cayton and has agreed 
to a series of fights for Bob Arum at the Olympic Auditorium, the first next 
Friday. Goossen had Williams sparring with Norris on Tuesday. CALENDAR 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: Rene Arredondo vs. Pat Lawlor, welterweights; Juan Lazcano vs. 
Oscar Gonzalez, lightweights; Hollywood Palladium, 7 p.m.

BAY AREA OFFICIAL SAYS RAIDERS ARE SET TO PLAY THERE IF COLISEUM ISN'T READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations have been completed on a one-year agreement to send the Raiders 
back to Oakland if they are without their home field in Los Angeles this 
season, according to Don Perata, a member of the Alameda County Board of 
Supervisors. But there is no indication the Raiders are ready to sign the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is thought that the agreement for the Raiders to play in the Oakland 
Coliseum, their home until 1982, is an escape hatch should the 
earthquake-damaged Los Angeles Coliseum not be ready by the NFL season in 
September. Coliseum officials have assured the Raiders that work on the 
71-year-old structure will be completed by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "The licensing agreement," said Perata of the deal negotiated with a 
representative of owner Al Davis, "reflects our desire to have them here. The 
licensing agreement was designed to facilitate the object, which is to 
accommodate the Raiders if they are homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider executive Al LoCasale: "It's news to me. It's the move-of-the-week 
story." STEVE SPRINGER

FATHER-SON ACT PROVES TO BE A BOONE TO CINCINNATI; BASEBALL: BOB AND BRET ARE 
ON THE SAME TEAM THIS SEASON AND THE REDS ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reunited and it feels so good. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that it happened, but how it's happening that has Bret and Bob 
Boone smiling these days. Bret has followed his father's footsteps all the way 
to the major leagues and now he can literally step in them if he leaves the 
shower after his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 If his feet happen to be touching the ground, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 15 games, the Cincinnati Reds' second baseman is hitting .353 
with three home runs and 14 runs batted in. His season average is .320, and 
he's on a pace to drive in more than 100 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 From his spot in the dugout, Bob Boone, the former Phillie and Angel catcher 
who was hired as bench coach two weeks after the Reds acquired his son in a 
trade with Seattle, has been basking in a white-hot glow of parental pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was asked to take this job, my first thought was, 'What could the 
negatives be?' " the elder Boone said. "After about five minutes, I figured out 
that was a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a perk for me, a huge gift. You get to do what you love, you get a 
salary and you get to watch your son play all year. I've never been able to see 
any of my kids play on a daily basis during the summer, so that part is real 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 And, on closer inspection, Dad likes what he sees. It has little to do with 
line drives, diving catches or stat sheets, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all love for our kids to have immediate success," he said, "but I'm 
proud of all my kids and not for what they're doing at the moment. To me, it's 
how you go about your business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you choose baseball as your profession, there's a right way and a wrong 
way to go about it. I think Bret has chosen the right way, he plays the game 
correctly, he plays the game hard, and that's what I'm most proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who ever saw Bob Boone play -- or how he handled himself before and 
after a game -- wouldn't be surprised by that sentiment. He played 19 major 
league seasons and set a record for fewest tantrums in a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a true professional in my eyes," Bret said. "The high level of 
integrity he had, the respect he had around the game. It all came from how hard 
he played, the way he worked his butt off, the way he carried himself, not just 
the things he accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds were looking for a role player not a role model, however, when they 
demanded Boone be included in the Nov. 2 trade that also brought right-hander 
Erik Hanson to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were going to give up a catcher (Dan Wilson) and a reliever with a good 
arm (Bobby Ayala), we had to get a starter and we had to get Bret Boone," Reds 
Manager Davey Johnson said. "We needed a solid second baseman and he's done 
everything we thought he would do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging around the clubhouse with Mike Schmidt, Pete Rose and Steve Carlton 
after elementary school may have set Bret Boone's fate two decades ago. Maybe 
it was the sight of the crowds lining Broad Street during Philadelphia's 
delirium after the Phillies' World Series triumph. Or maybe it was in his genes 
-- his grandfather, Ray, played 13 seasons in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, he has wanted to be ballplayer for as long as he can remember. And, 
unlike most kids, he knew it was a real profession, not a fantasy life. 
</P>
<P>
 The family came West in 1981 when his father was traded to the Angels and Bret 
began to cut his own mark on the diamond. He helped his team win the 1987 
Connie Mack World Series and was All-Orange County and All-Southern Section at 
El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
 He started for three years at USC and didn't miss a game. He ranks among the 
top three Trojans in career runs (166), doubles (51), triples (12) and RBIs 
(160). 
</P>
<P>
 "For me at least, going to college was a good decision," Boone said. "I was 18 
years old and I thought I was ready to go tear it up in the minor leagues. But 
looking back, I'm glad I didn't sign out of high school. The only reason I 
didn't was because the money didn't compare to my USC scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm glad. I think I needed it mentally more than physically. It was a 
chance for me to live away from home and adjust to the real world. I'd been 
sheltered a little growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 He was drafted by the Mariners in the fifth round in 1990. He shot up through 
the Mariners' minor league system like a weed after spring showers. He was a 
double-A All-Star in 1991 and a triple-A All-Star in '92. Last year, he split 
the season between triple-A Calgary and Seattle. In 271 at-bats with the 
Mariners, he had 12 homers and 38 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when Seattle traded me," he said. "But today baseball is a 
business and you never completely understand why certain things are done. For 
about a week there, I was walking around in a daze. I wasn't upset really, but 
let's say I was puzzled." 
</P>
<P>
 That frame of mind soon passed, however, and Boone began concentrating on new 
opportunities and the challenges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is a constant adjustment, to pitchers, to teammates," he said. 
"That's what separates the great players from the not-so-great. The great 
players make adjustments on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great situation for me. We've got a lot of talent on this team and 
the potential to win a lot of games. I'm very excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Bret Boone, 25, has yet to master his father's James Bond-like cool, 
but teething on horsehide has given him some advantages. He knows right where 
to find the sunflower seeds and how much one should tip the clubhouse boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot harder for me to toss it off, to leave it at the ballpark like my 
dad was able to do," Bret said. "You never knew whether he had four hits or 
four strikeouts when he got home. I have a little more trouble with that, but 
I'm trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, I took it all for granted. My buddies' dads went to the 
office and my dad went to the ballpark. Now I realize I was very fortunate to 
grow up in that environment." 
</P>
<P>
 When Boone first moved up to the major leagues, there were a lot of 
been-there-done-that stories in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge difference between a kid without a worry in the world who's 
running around driving people nuts and a man coming here with a job to do," he 
said. "Now I realize what a distraction I probably was for my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 So now it's dad's turn? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bret has had his father's influence his whole life, so I doubt if he really 
wants him this close at this point and time," Johnson said with a mischievous 
grin. "As cocky as Bret is, I'm sure he feels like he's cut those ties a long 
time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But any father is going to offer advice. Of course, you don't expect any of 
it to be taken, but that shouldn't stop you from giving it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone describes his relationship with his father while they are in uniform as 
"strictly professional." And father knows better than to nag, even if he feels 
he knows best. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the other day in the visitors clubhouse of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
for instance. Father could only smile -- OK, maybe it was a wince -- as he 
watched his son devour his pregame meal: three fast-food tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me a long time ago not to tell him what to do," Boone said, unable 
to suppress a laugh. "Anybody who has ever had a teen-ager knows what I'm 
talking about."

 Reality did not hit when he got "The Call." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did it set in the first time he walked onto the field at Boston's Fenway 
Park and gazed up at the Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
 The butterflies were minimal even during batting practice. And everything 
still was OK when Jeff Cirillo took over defensively at third base in his first 
major league game. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the public-address announcer introduced the next Red Sox hitter, Mo 
Vaughn, and the fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that crowd went nuts I just went, 'Oh, wow,' " said Cirillo, who played 
at Providence High and USC. "When you're out there in batting practice, it's 
basically the same stuff you do every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you put fans in the stands at a major league park and they start 
making some noise, it's a whole different thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Milwaukee Brewers promoted Cirillo on Tuesday, his head has been 
spinning. "These last few days have been pretty awesome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo wore a big league uniform for the first time on Wednesday, fewer than 
24 hours after receiving a telephone call from Chris Bando, his triple-A 
manager at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got rained out that night," Cirillo said. "So when he called, I figured 
either I was traded or was going up." 
</P>
<P>
 "How you feeling?" Bando inquired. "I feel good," Cirillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "How you swinging it?" the manager asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, you know how I'm swinging it, Cirillo thought. "Good," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you're going to be swinging it in Fenway tomorrow," Bando said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the conversation became a little fuzzy after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to go to Boston just to see Fenway Park, just as a fan, 
never knowing I'd get to play here," Cirillo said. "The place is pretty 
magical." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Green Monster, it was quickly conquered. Cirillo hit a couple of 
balls over the legendary outfield barrier during his first big league batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he was a busy young man in the hours between his airline flight that 
landed in Boston at 2:30 p.m. and the game's 7:05 p.m. starting time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo's mother and stepfather flew in from Van Nuys for the game and Cirillo 
greeted them bearing gifts: Brewers' hats and a baseball autographed by Roger 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get that," Cirillo said of the Clemens keepsake fetched by a Red Sox 
clubhouse attendant. "I still have a picture of him on my wall at home." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Cirillo viewed his idol in person, from a distance of 60 feet 6 
inches. In Cirillo's debut as a starter, Clemens just happened to be the 
opposition's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning the previous day that the Brewers were facing Clemens, Cirillo 
allowed himself to fantasize about hitting a homer off the hard-throwing 
right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will remain a dream, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston downed the Brewers, 3-1, and Cirillo was 0 for 3, striking out against 
Clemens in his first two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, a smashing debut would have been out of character for Cirillo. At 
USC he wasn't a regular until his senior season. He wasn't even drafted as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his career this week, Cirillo admonished his many doubters, 
beginning with those who questioned his ability as a high school player coming 
out of tiny Providence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I did in high school, people said, 'Well, how do you know? There's 
no competition,' " he said. "There were so many doubters all the way up. I got 
so much negative feedback sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I faced a lot of adversity. That's one of the reasons I'm so fired up now. I 
feel like finally this is my time to bask." 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo, 24, last season led Brewers' minor leaguers with 148 hits, 221 total 
bases and 84 runs. In 67 games for double-A El Paso, he batted .341 with nine 
homers and 41 runs batted in. In 58 games for triple-A New Orleans, he batted 
.293 with three homers and 32 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 He was batting .300 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in 30 games for New Orleans 
when he was promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo is replacing Kevin Seitzer, who is expected to miss about a month 
because of a torn left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cirillo's status could change when reserve catcher and backup 
infielder B.J. Surhoff comes off the disabled list in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's brewing: Scott Richardson last season led Brewers' minor leaguers with 
50 stolen bases for Beloit, Wis., Milwaukee's low Class-A affiliate. This 
season he might claim a larger thieves' crown. Richardson, a three-year starter 
at Cal State Northridge, leads minor league baseball with 22 steals in 25 
attempts. A converted second baseman, Richardson is playing the outfield and 
batting .295 for the Brewers' high Class-A affiliate in Stockton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot hitter: Brent Cookson hit a team-high 17 home runs last season for the 
Giants' Class-A team in San Jose. But in the words of Tony Siegle, the Giants' 
vice president in charge of baseball operations, the 24-year-old Santa Paula 
native also was "a league leader in temper tantrums." 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson was promoted to double-A Shreveport (La.) anyway, where his batting -- 
rather than his temper -- is causing quite a commotion. Through 27 games, 
Cookson was batting .352 and leading the Captains with 12 doubles, two triples, 
six home runs and 20 RBIs. His .739 slugging percentage is the best in the 
Texas League and he is second in the league in extra-base hits and fifth in 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson has been the Texas League's "batter of the week" the last two weeks. 
In a 14-5 victory over Arkansas earlier this month, he was four for four -- 
three homers and a double. The winning pitcher in that game was former Alemany 
High left-hander Joey Rosselli. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, who missed last season after undergoing shoulder surgery, is 2-1 
with a 2.95 earned-run average and 27 strikeouts in 39 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wild thing: Former Chatsworth High standout Derek Wallace, top pick of the 
Chicago Cubs in 1992 from Pepperdine, is off to a poor -- albeit spectacular -- 
start for double-A Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is 1-5 with a 5.23 ERA and leads the Southern League with four balks 
and eight hit batsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rally killer: Dan Chergey, who pitched for Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark 
College, is the closer for the Brevard County Manatees, the Florida Marlins' 
affiliate in the Class-A South Atlantic League. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Chergey converted all six of his save opportunities, giving up three 
hits and a walk in 12 innings. He had 14 strikeouts.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; HEARINGS ARE SET FOR FIVE TRAINERS IN DRUG INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board has issued complaints and hearing dates have 
been scheduled for the trainers whose horses recently tested positive for 
scopolamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughbred trainers Richard Mandella, Ron McAnally, Willard Proctor and Mark 
Henning and harness trainer James Grundy will have two-day hearings before 
Hollywood Park stewards Tom Ward, Pete Pedersen and Ingrid Fermin later this 
month and in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella, McAnally and Henning all came forward at an impromptu news 
conference at Santa Anita on March 27 to say they had received word of the 
positive tests. They said scopolamine, a natural substance that is contained in 
several plants, including jimson weed, came from contaminated feed and/or 
bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement released by Dr. Robert Jack in March, scopolamine is 
used to treat horses that have diarrhea or vision problems and that for humans, 
the drug is used to prevent nausea that accompanies motion sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 James Grundy, the trainer of Fast N Loose, who won the fifth race at Los 
Alamitos on Feb. 26, will be the first to have his hearing. It is scheduled for 
Wednesday and Thursday, although Ward said Saturday it is possible Grundy will 
ask for a continuance. Henning, whose Lady Blessington tested positive after 
she won the Buena Vista Feb. 27, will have his hearing May 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse in question for McAnally is Delacroix, who won his first start March 
3. McAnally's hearing is scheduled for May 28-29. Mandella, whose Water 
Prospector tested positive after breaking his maiden on March 9, will have his 
June 1-2. Proctor, whose Top Rung tested positive after finishing second in her 
first start on April 9, will have his hearing June 4-5.

 J.F. Williams remained unbeaten at Hollywood Park in races seven furlongs or 
shorter with a nose victory over Gundaghia in the $106,900 Los Angeles Handicap 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Chris McCarron, the 5-year-old Broad Brush horse caught the 11-1 
Gundaghia in the last jump to win in 1:09 for the six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Ron McAnally and owned by John Carr and Jack Goodwin's Double J 
Farm, J.F. Williams has won five of seven starts at Hollywood Park. His defeats 
came when he was last in the On Trust Handicap last Thanksgiving at 7 1/2 
furlongs and when he was second to Campo Marzio in a 1 1/16-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 One of three horses saddled by Bob Baffert, Gundaghia finished 1 1/4 lengths 
ahead of 6-5 favorite Thirty Slews, who lost for the sixth consecutive time 
since his 18-1 upset in the 1992 Breeders' Cup Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Viva El Capitan, the other Baffert starter, ran last, but had an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got awful antsy going to the gate," jockey Gary Stevens said. "He kept 
throwing his head down and he gashed his head real bad (on his lead pony) going 
to the gate. He was bleeding pretty bad when I got to the gate, and he was real 
nervous going over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a pretty hard campaign over the winter and he's a little tired from 
it mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 J.F. Williams, the second choice, paid $8.80 and earned $61,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race split good for me because the three main speed horses (Scherando, 
Gundaghia and Giant Asset) out-footed me down the backstretch," McCarron said. 
"I was able to get outside and this horse is a big, long-striding horse, so you 
don't really want to get him in tight quarters or get him stopped. Ron 
(McAnally) told me just to try to get a nice, clear run at them, and he got 
that today."

 Del Mar Dennis is among six entered in the $150,000-added Mervyn LeRoy 
Handicap today at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan and trained by Paco Gonzalez, Del Mar 
Dennis has won four of his six starts and scored his first stakes victory as an 
8-1 shot in the San Bernardino Handicap on April 2 at Santa Anita. Sal Gonzalez 
Jr. will again ride the 4-year-old Dixieland Band gelding, the 5-2 second 
choice on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 favorite is Tinners Way, third in the San Bernardino after a wide 
trip. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, who suffered her first loss when beaten by Sardula in the Kentucky 
Oaks, might be sent to New York, according to trainer Gary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the Mother Goose (June 12 at Belmont Park)," Jones said. 
"The thinking is if you're going to be a champion, you have to win in New York, 
and you have to beat Inside Information." 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Ogden Phipps and trained by Shug McGaughey, Inside Information has 
won six of her seven starts and won the Acorn by 11 lengths a week ago. Horse

 Blues Traveller, an 11-1 shot ridden by Sal Gonzalez Jr., won the $100,000 
Rolling Green Handicap at Golden Gate Fields. Favored Slew Of Damascus was off 
the board, ending a five-race winning streak. . . . As Indicated won for the 
sixth consecutive time, beating Devil His Due in the $600,000 Pimlico Special. 
He completed the 1 3/16 miles in 1:55.

OPTICAL VS. MAGNETIC; TWO O.C. FIRMS BET ON DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 
FUTURE OF COMPUTER STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Irvine Spectrum Business Park, Pinnacle Micro Inc.'s two-story building 
looks up to Western Digital Corp.'s 14-story headquarters like David looked up 
to mighty Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a stone's throw apart, these computer storage companies have lived in 
peaceful coexistence for years, because a technological wall separated their 
industries. But with the advent of multimedia technology -- where computers 
combine sound, text, graphics and video to produce film-like images -- the 
neighbors may soon become adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle, a maker of optical storage devices begun by a father-and-son team in 
1987, senses an opportunity and is readying its slingshot. Western Digital, an 
established maker of magnetic disk drives with $1.2 billion in annual sales, 
said it is not worried that it will suffer Goliath's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Each company's products perform the same basic function: storing computer 
data. Whichever can do that better at the best price will have a future; the 
other may be left spinning in the dustbin of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of skeptics out there," said Scott Blum, who co-founded 
Pinnacle Micro Inc. with his father, Bill.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that optical disks will be around 30 years from now and 
magnetic won't exist," said the younger Blum, who serves as executive vice 
president. "This is what we've worked on for seven years. It's David versus 
Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake for the winner is a share of the multibillion-dollar storage 
industry, where demand is expected to explode with the fast-approaching 
information superhighway's vast appetite for data storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every computer user cares who survives this battle. However, it matters to 
tens of thousands of workers -- from engineers to assembly line workers -- who 
make their living in the PC storage industry, which so far has remained largely 
American-owned despite strategic efforts by foreigners to grab a foothold. 
</P>
<P>
 The $700-million optical disk-drive industry is puny next to the $8.3 billion 
spent on magnetic hard disk drives each year, based on estimates by market 
researchers Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., and Freeman Associates 
Inc. in Santa Barbara. The size of the magnetic disk drive industry mushrooms 
to $23.6 billion when sales of stand-alone drives are included, in addition to 
those sold as part of computers.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be difficult to mount a serious challenge to the magnetic disk drive 
manufacturers, who grew on the enormous success of the personal computer. The 
disk drive serves as the permanent memory system for the PC. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pinnacle's executives believe business and home users will eventually 
favor their type of storage system, which is expected to undergo a major 
enhancement next year, while rivals run into technological obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Blum said Pinnacle is set to release its enhancement project, code-named 
Diablo, in the spring of 1995. For the first time, he said, an optical disk 
drive will cross a threshold and cost less than similar high-capacity magnetic 
disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum, 30, said Diablo will force magnetic drive makers to take notice. 
Pinnacle's best drives are priced at $3.80 per megabyte, compared to 75 cents 
per megabyte for standard magnetic drives, but with Diablo, the company hopes 
to greatly reduce the price gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the magnetic hard disk companies dismiss such claims as extreme 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The epitaph of the disk drive industry was written in the mid-1980s when 
optical first appeared," said Peter Knight, vice president of business 
development at Conner Peripherals Inc. in San Jose, a top disk drive maker. 
"Many theorists stood up and talked about how the fundamental limit of the disk 
drive was coming. I thought optical would be a serious challenger. As time goes 
on, it's clear that isn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Marks, vice president of marketing at Western Digital, believes optical 
drives will remain but a small part of the total storage market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have tunnel vision," Marks said. "There will be peaceful coexistence 
between hard disks and optical for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marks' view is shared by industry experts such as Bob Katzive, a vice 
president at Disk/Trend Inc., and Phil Devin, storage analyst for Dataquest 
Inc., a market researcher in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see optical drives as a replacement for the magnetic hard disk," 
Katzive said. "They're good for storing things as archives. But if you need to 
(change) it fast, the hard disk drive is better."  
</P>
<P>
 Basically, an optical drive uses a laser to read bumps and grooves on a metal 
platter, like a compact disc player. In magnetic disks, a mechanical head reads 
the magnetic pattern on the metal disk.  
</P>
<P>
 In both technologies, the disks spin past a head, which reads the data or 
changes it based on commands from the computer's main processor. Optical drives 
are a newer and fundamentally more complex technology because they use lasers 
to read the data. 
</P>
<P>
 This ability to alter or "write" on the disk quickly is key to a disk drive 
system, but for optical drives, it is still too slow and expensive -- which 
puts their manufacturers at a disadvantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think read/write optical is a ways off," said Charles Haggerty, chief 
executive of Western Digital. "Going forward for at least four to five years, 
magnetic is going to be the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Blum, 59, stresses that "rewriteable" optical technology -- which 
allows data to be repeatedly recorded and erased -- has been on the market for 
only four years, compared to more than a decade for magnetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can put more information per square inch (of disk) than them, and we just 
started," Scott Blum said. "They're pushing the limits. We're just beginning to 
make advances." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is next to impossible to forecast the best technology for the future 
based on those that prevail today, said Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really knows where the physical limits are," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technological advance is a game of numbers. If Pinnacle improves its optical 
technology faster than competing magnetic disk drive companies, then it will 
gain ground in sales. Speed, capacity and price matter the most. Analysts, 
however, say that optical technology is behind on every front. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle had about $39 million in sales last year. With barely 100 employees, 
it competes against Japanese rivals including Sony Corp., Panasonic and 
Olympus. Its principal customers are businesses that have huge archives, 
especially defense companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth for optical companies has been slow but steady over the last few years, 
for which the Blum family said it is thankful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have been wiped out by big companies coming into the market," Scott 
Blum said. "Now we've had a chance to establish ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for Pinnacle is to overcome the challenges optical drive makers 
face, which include developing better lasers that can read data squeezed into 
ever tighter spaces on a disk. It must build its drives in smaller packages to 
match the size standard of magnetic disk drives. It must also improve its 
"write" speeds, or the time it takes to record data, several times over to 
catch up with magnetic drives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this advancement depends on how quickly new laser heads are developed, 
and Pinnacle is dependent on the Japanese companies that manufacture them. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the obstacles, some optical players have simply decided not to 
directly challenge their magnetic hard disk rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think there will be a war between the two technologies," said Jim 
Kaufmann, vice president of sales and marketing for Most Inc., a Cypress-based 
optical storage company partly owned by Nakamichi Corp. in Tokyo. "It's 
important for optical not to take the hard disk drive guys on head-on because 
they are continually making performance improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 That is certainly the case at Western Digital, which is one of the world's 
five top makers of magnetic drives. It has 6,375 employees on three continents 
and is considered a global technology leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital has doubled the capacity of its hard disk drives every 16 
months. Marc Nussbaum, vice president of engineering for Western Digital, says 
there is no foreseeable "brick wall" to such advances. In fact, a new 
technology expected to be on the market in 1995 -- magnetic resistive heads -- 
will virtually quadruple capacity on magnetic disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year Western Digital established a new standard for magnetic hard 
disk drives -- dubbed the enhanced intelligent drive interface -- to 
accommodate ever higher storage levels. 
</P>
<P>
 While typical drives today store a maximum of 528 megabytes -- equal to about 
264,000 typewritten pages -- future ones could hold 10 times as much, thanks in 
part to the new technology standard, Nussbaum said. This could make magnetic 
technology competitive for years and therefore pave Western Digital's on-ramp 
to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanswered question is when magnetic drive makers will max out in their 
ability to stretch capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later there will be a limit for magnetic," said Peter Rentzepis, a 
chemistry professor at UC Irvine who is working on an $18-million project to 
develop an optical drive of the future. "The only way to overcome it is with 
optical. How soon? I cannot say." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A competitive advantage for optical is that the disks are removable. You can 
pop out one disk and put in another. That means that while it costs three times 
more to purchase an optical drive, it costs little to add more disks to 
increase the total capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Pinnacle introduced its Orray optical disk drive, a $14,995 model 
aimed at the high end of the magnetic market, a niche known as disk arrays that 
bundle a dozen disk drives together to achieve massive storage, safe from 
accidental loss. It can store 5.2 gigabytes of data, enough to hold a library 
of books in electronic form. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes a dent in the magnetic disk drive's armor," Scott Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't be able to see that dent with a magnifying glass," countered Amyl 
Ahola, vice president of worldwide marketing for Seagate Technology Corp. The 
Scotts Valley, Calif., company is the world's largest maker of magnetic disk 
drives. "For optical, they've always been two years away from a breakthrough 
for 20 years. I see them as complementary technology, but not a rival." Pros 
and Cons 
</P>
<P>
 * It takes longer for an optical disk to write data. But magnetic and optical 
drives have comparable speed in accessing recorded data. 
</P>
<P>
 * Optical disks are not affected by airport X-ray machines or other magnetic 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 * Optical cartridges allow large amounts of data to be transported with ease 
to another site, such as a locked safe for security purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Large-volume users can build a library of optical cartridges at less cost, 
increasing storage capacity without purchasing another hard drive. Cartridges 
hold up to 1.3 gigabytes. Optical disks are guaranteed for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Magnetic drives are less expensive, making them more cost-effective for 
low-capacity uses. Average drive has 20 megabytes to two gigabytes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Optical drives may be particularly useful for desktop publishing, digital 
video or audio applications, which typically require large amounts of storage 
space. Example: One movie requires two gigabytes of space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Optical drives are read by a laser beam rather than a magnetic head, which 
can "crash" into disk and destroy data. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 These drives incorporate a laser and are used for storing large volumes of 
data. The laser's narrow beam can write more data in less space than the 
magnetic drive.

TURNER MOVIE CHANNEL FACES TIGHT SQUEEZE IN CABLE SYSTEMS; TELEVISION: NEW 
NETWORK AIRS VINTAGE FILMS 24 HOURS A DAY. IT HAS A VAULT WITH MORE THAN 3,000 
TITLES, BUT VIEWERS WON'T SEE MANY CLASSICS AT FIRST.

<P>
 Ted Turner's newest cable television network is a movie buff's dream that 
relatively few people initially will be able to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Classic Movies, which was launched April 14 with a showing of "Gone 
With the Wind," is setting sail in uncertain cable waters. Many cable systems 
either have run out of space for new channels or are deferring programming 
decisions until federal regulatory questions are settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating for the programmers, the cable companies, the 
subscribers," said Patty Mosteller, marketing vice president for Wometco Cable 
TV, which has nine systems in metropolitan Atlanta and is not carrying Turner 
Classic Movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which has beaten big odds 
in the past, is pressing on with TCM, its sixth national network. 
</P>
<P>
 The new network is showing vintage flicks 24 hours a day with no commercials 
by tapping into Turner's vault of more than 3,000 movies as well as turning to 
licensed titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies have had a limited outlet in the past through the TBS Superstation 
and Turner Network Television, which show films and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this service will be really the definitive classic movie service, and 
quite possibly one day the definitive movie service," said Brad Siegel, TCM's 
executive vice president and general manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Siegel, who came to Turner last year from Woodbury, N.Y.-based cable channel 
American Movie Classics, has plenty of choice titles with which to work, thanks 
to some major film library acquisitions by TBS over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the well-known films Turner owns as a result of buying the MGM and 
pre-1948 Warner Bros. collections are "Casablanca," "2001: A Space Odyssey," 
"Chinatown" and "Jailhouse Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 And considering the controversy Turner started by colorizing many old 
black-and-white Hollywood classics, movies shown on his new network primarily 
will be black-and-white originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Osborne, author of "65 Years at the Oscars," serves as host on the new 
network, introducing each movie shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies on TCM are being packaged in a variety of ways, including tributes 
to stars and directors, and festivals highlighting musicals, mysteries and 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel acknowledged that some of that sounds a lot like American Movie 
Classics, but he said market research indicates there is demand for more movies 
on cable. A superior library and a fun, irreverent approach will make Turner 
Classic Movies stand out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, of course, if people get to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a profusion of new cable channels in the last few years, from 
41 national channels in 1983 to 89 at the end of last year, outstripping the 
capacity of most systems. The typical cable system in this country can hold 
from 30 to 53 channels, according to the National Cable Television Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballyhooed "digital compression" technology that can increase channel 
capacity into the hundreds still is a few years away for most people. 
</P>
<P>
 And cable operators are still awaiting final word on Federal Communications 
Commission regulations governing how much systems can charge consumers for 
various new services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very unsettling time in terms of knowing what you can and cannot 
do," said Jim O'Brien, president of Englewood, Colo.-based Jones Intercable 
Inc., which owns 50 cable systems across the country, none of which are picking 
up TCM. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly much more challenging now than five years ago when TNT started 
with 17 million subscribers," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner faced a similar problem with the Cartoon Network. Launched in 1992, it 
recently hit 10 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel would not disclose how many systems will be carrying TCM at its launch, 
but he said it would start with about 2 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN, the nation's top cable channel, reaches 61.7 million subscribers. Cable 
News Network, Turner's biggest channel, has 61.1 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel said TBS views the movie channel as a long-term proposition, and is 
confident that viewer demand will build by the time cable capacity is greater. 
Because there is no advertising on TCM, the network is more dependent than 
other Turner networks on cable subscriber fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we designed this business it was never intended to be a money maker in 
Year 1 or Year 2," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an ample supply of movies on hand, and the prospect of fresh material 
available from recent studio purchases, Turner is in a strong position to keep 
a new network running in anticipation of expanded cable capacity, said John S. 
Reidy, media analyst at Smith Barney Shearson in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they'd like to have 50 million (subscribers) on Day 1, but they 
have plenty of capacity to nurture this thing through," Reidy said. "Turner did 
not spend an inordinate amount of money to get this started. It's not rocket 
science to them -- it's right up their alley."

WOMEN HARASSING MEN: A GROWING PROBLEM OR THE STUFF OF FICTION?; WORKPLACE: 
MICHAEL CRICHTON, WHO ADDRESSES THE ISSUE IN 'DISCLOSURE,' SAYS IT IS AN 
ESCALATING TREND, BUT MANY RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD DISAGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Avon Products Inc., an employee repeatedly made unwelcome advances to a 
colleague, asking for dates, calling the co-worker at home and leaving 
harassing notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the human resources department was notified, the offending employee was 
pulled aside and warned that termination was the next step if the incidents 
didn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical sexual harassment case, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. The events, which occurred over several months, involved a woman 
harassing a man, said Ron Shane, Avon's manager of employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point he was so bothered that he couldn't function on the job," 
Shane said. "He was nervous about her aggressive actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The story was not unlike the tale spun by Michael Crichton in his latest 
novel, "Disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 The book tells of an ambitious woman who gets a promotion that a former 
boyfriend believed he'd get. She then tries to seduce him. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews since the book's publication, Crichton has said he wrote the 
novel believing sexual harassment of men is a real and growing problem as women 
enter positions of power within corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Many researchers in the field disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's mostly male fantasy," said Deborah Nord, acting director of the 
women's studies program at Princeton University. "That Crichton would write a 
novel about the issue is more indicative of a cultural anxiety than reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Nord she said she believed the novel reflects a male fear of public 
accountability for private behavior, not male anxiety about women holding 
positions of power. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little evidence to show sexual harassment of men by their female 
colleagues or bosses is widespread, said Susan L. Webb, a leading authority on 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crichton has certainly displayed that he is an excellent novelist but he is 
not an expert in sexual harassment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Webb said, when male employees are harassed it is just as significant 
as when women receive unwanted sexual advances. Between 15% and 18% of men say 
they have been harassed by someone, although there is evidence to suggest more 
harassment of men by men than by women, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that polices 
workplace harassment complaints, says that last year 9% -- almost 12,000 -- of 
those complaints were filed by men, although the EEOC has taken none to trial. 
Once again, it was unclear how many complaints involved men harassing men and 
how many involved women harassing men, spokesman Mike Widomski said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many years of working with the issue of sexual harassment, Webb has seen 
only one case of a woman harassing a man on the job, and he chose to quit after 
two years of tolerating the advances rather than come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think it's difficult for a woman to speak up, it's even more so for a 
man to speak up," Webb said. "We tend to laugh them out of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who see female harassment of men as a growing issue point to the 
increasing numbers of women in the work force and in positions of power. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 58 million women now hold jobs, compared with 35 million in 1973, 
and almost 72 million will be employed by the year 2005, Labor Department 
projections show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the realm of workplace authority, however, women are still far behind men. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 6.2% of seats on the boards of the largest companies are held by women 
and they fill only 5% of senior management positions, says Catalyst, a business 
research organization specializing in women's workplace issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is a sense that women are growing more powerful on the job, if 
advertising is any barometer of society, and it often presents itself as such. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two widely seen television commercials show men as the object of 
women's sexual fantasies, and some men aren't happy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coca-Cola commercial called "Diet Coke Break" features a handsome male 
construction worker who removes his shirt and downs a soft drink while female 
office workers observe from a window and drool. 
</P>
<P>
 Another for Hyundai called "Parking Lot" features two businesswomen eyeing men 
as they drop off flashy cars for valet parking, commenting on the car types 
and, indirectly, each man's sexual endowments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Siller, a New York attorney and head of a heterosexual male advocacy 
group known as the National Organization for Men, described the Hyundai ad as a 
sexual put-down of men. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gender denigration and bad taste," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siller applauded Crichton's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad he wrote it," Siller said. "Sexual harassment by women is really a 
coming thing and it will start to surface more as we get toward that glass 
ceiling." He referred to what is perceived in the workplace as an unseen but 
sharply felt limit to the progress of many women in corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Nord said the commercials indicated advertisers believe women want to see 
themselves in the position of sexual spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the assumption there is a sexual liberation going on for women that 
takes the form of women ogling men and being able to talk about ogling men," 
Nord said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age, a weekly trade publication, said 
despite the sexual content, he couldn't get worked up about either commercial. 
But he conceded that were the roles reversed, he might. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something liberating about women being able to do some mindless 
panting in the tradition of several trillion men before them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, whose Seattle consulting firm, Pacific Resource Development Group Inc., 
advises companies about sexual harassment issues, also found it hard to worry 
about the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking of a less powerful group poking fun at the powerful, it 
becomes much less harassing and less hurtful and more funny," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men can afford to be admired sexually because it doesn't detract from their 
seriousness in the workplace," she said. "They are still President of the 
United States, they are still presidents of companies."

WESTSIDE WATCH: JUDGE PROVES POST-QUAKE HUMOR CAN FIT YOU TO A T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-year law students, find the legal precedent for this: a judge who draws 
cartoons for T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the Santa Monica courthouse may be surprised to see a five-color 
T-shirt commemorating the January earthquake for sale in the halls of justice, 
whose walls are still badly cracked in some places. They may be even more 
surprised when they learn the artist is none other than the presiding judge, 
David Rothman. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it about a T-shirt that makes people happy?" Rothman asked 
rhetorically, adding that he has done about 30 other T-shirt designs, mostly 
for friends and judicial fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman's latest creation, however, was designed not only to relieve tedium in 
the chambers but to raise the spirits of the staff. Rothman's new shirt recalls 
the quake with a caricature of the building and the legend "The Rockin' and 
Rollin' Santa Monica Court." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's staff and judge have sold about 150 of the shirts at $10 apiece in 
six weeks, Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. . . . Does this mean the judge might be doodling during oral 
arguments? 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on how long the argument is, I confess," he said. 
</P>

 SORRY, WRONG NUMBER: Maybe you can fight City Hall, but it's a lot harder to 
do it all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask John Rizzo. Worried that a proposed cellular phone transmitter near 
his apartment might increase cancer risks, the Marina del Rey resident launched 
a one-man battle to block its installation at 330 Washington Blvd. in nearby 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Rizzo lost the fight when the Los Angeles City Council 
unanimously rejected his appeal. But what really vexed Rizzo -- the president 
of the Marina Tenants Assn. -- is that minutes later the council heeded 
residents' health concerns and blocked a similar transmitter at 7700 Sunset 
Blvd. in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Venice, added insult to 
Rizzo's injury by voting for the Venice site but against the Hollywood site. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said that the Venice site was in a more commercial part of town and 
posed less of a health risk than the Hollywood site. Besides, she said, "Mr. 
Rizzo is the only person who expressed concern about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter, by the way, spoke to us via cellular phone.

 'DEAR LANDLORD': So goes a song by Robert Zimmerman, a Jewish boy from 
Minnesota who went on to do great things in the music business under the nom de 
guitare Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan has explored various religions, including fundamentalist Christianity 
and ultra-Orthodox Judaism. His current state of belief is not widely known. 
</P>
<P>
 But we recently learned that some time ago he did buy a synagogue: Sha'arei 
Am: The Santa Monica Synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dylan has always gone through phases of investigating his Jewish roots, but 
he probably did it for investment reasons," said Rabbi Jeffrey A. Marx of the 
18th Street synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sort of tickled by it because the congregation is young and a lot of 
the people grew up with this music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marx's congregation has rented the building for six years. Four years remain 
on the lease, but Marx said he is hoping to renew it for another decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he'll have a little bit of rachmonis (Yiddish for pity)," he said.

SYBERT HEAVILY OUTSPENDS FOES IN GOP BID TO FACE BEILENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relying heavily on his own funds, businessman Richard Sybert is financially 
overwhelming his opponents in the race for the Republican nomination to oppose 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) in a congressional district that 
includes Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who moved to Woodland Hills last 
year, has loaned his campaign $430,000 of the $473,080 that he has raised for 
the June 7 primary, according to campaign reports filed with the Federal 
Election Commission. These records reflect activity through March 31, the close 
of the most recent reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's closest fund-raising competitor in the 24th District is Robert K. 
Hammer, a Newbury Park investment banking consultant, who had garnered $70,367. 
His fund-raising has been meager; he loaned himself $61,160 of that total. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sybert: "I have necessarily had to pay some attention to my primary 
opposition, but I don't consider it substantial and I do expect to win the 
primary. I see my major opponent as Mr. Beilenson in the general election." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who was Wilson's director of planning and research and is now 
president of a small Santa Barbara toy company, said he plans to spend $200,000 
to $300,000 on numerous campaign mailings and, perhaps, radio and cable 
television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the GOP primary, commercial real estate broker Emery Shane of Woodland 
Hills reported raising $48,631 this year, including $37,436 that he has loaned 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boos Benhard of Woodland Hills, who owns a media relations firm, reported 
raising $7,081 this year. He loaned his campaign $10,000 in December and 
another $500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park businessman Sang Korman, who poured more than $800,000 of his own 
funds into three previous unsuccessful congressional bids, did not file a 
report. He is not waging an active campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 From Malibu, the 24th District extends into the San Fernando Valley and 
continues north to Thousand Oaks. The district is considered competitive for a 
Republican candidate and the GOP nominee may benefit from national party 
funding in the fall race with Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his own largess, Sybert's fund raising has been modest. He brought 
in $8,000 from political action committees, including $3,000 from a PAC 
representing car dealers nationwide and $2,000 from the Lockheed Employees PAC 
in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Beilenson did little fund raising during the first three months 
of this year. He faces a nominal primary challenge from Scott Gaulke, a Sherman 
Oaks businessman who has run previously as a follower of political extremist 
Lyndon LaRouche. No report was available for Gaulke; candidates who raise or 
spend less than $5,000 are not required to file. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, the third-ranking Democrat on the influential Rules Committee, 
spent $753,415 to win 56% of the vote two years ago -- the first time he ran in 
the newly drawn swing district. He said he was uncertain how much he'll need 
for the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on who wins the Republican primary," Beilenson said. "It depends 
on how much he is likely to have. I tend to be responsive."

FIRST PERSON / JEFF KRAMER: DIET EXPERT GETS TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, Jeff Kramer is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No meat, no chicken, no fish, no oil, no whole dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up the weight-loss advice of Dean Ornish, a deadpan cardiologist who 
never met a legume he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with years of research and a heaping portion of common sense, Ornish is 
methodically mincing the nutritional status quo into so much vegetarian 
ratatouille. 
</P>
<P>
 How hot is Ornish? Nearly 1,000 people showed up to hear him speak in Santa 
Monica recently. Saint John's Hospital, which sponsored the free lecture, said 
space ran out two days after the talk was publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornish's two books, "Reversing Heart Disease" and "Eat More, Weigh Less," have 
rocketed onto best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by the wise and gentle guidance of this unassuming low-fat guru, I 
witnessed his Santa Monica oration more as a glassy-eyed disciple than an 
impartial journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 What can I say? I love the guy. In the course of a month, Ornish has taken my 
desire to shed a few pounds -- 60 of them, to be precise -- and introduced me 
to a low-fat, high-volume vegetarian promised land. Under his counsel, I have 
abandoned such staples as Corn Dog Wellington and 12-Cheese Pizza with Dove Bar 
sauce for more flavorful, satisfying fare, namely . . . grain. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the transition has not been effortless, but it has been far easier than 
many of you blood-thirsty meat-eaters might expect. In fact, a central Ornish 
theme is that most people find it easier to radically change their diets than 
to cut back on the bad stuff, one bratwurst at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely reduce the amount of fatty foods you eat, says the Dean of Lean, and 
you'll crave them more than ever. But eliminate such fare altogether, and 
quicker than you can say "steamed broccoli," healthy eating becomes a habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfortably sated by mass quantities of plant matter, you will find yourself 
strolling untempted past whole bins of grease-embalmed pork grenades and other 
artery cloggers. Not only will you no longer covet such foods, but you'll come 
to regard them with an indifference bordering on disdain. You might even start 
lecturing friends and co-workers on the evils of demon meat. You might expound 
endlessly on the myriad uses of nonfat yogurt. You might puree eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, you might become a crashing bore. 
</P>
<P>
 You might also lose some weight. 
</P>
<P>
 By following the Ornish regimen, which includes regular, moderate exercise, I 
have shed 10 pounds in a little more than a month. I'm now a Tinkerbell-esque 
270. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great," Ornish said with a Buddha-like smile as we chatted before his 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of angering the great master, I confessed that I was a bit 
disappointed that I had not lost more. But Ornish, who is director of the 
Preventative Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, urged me to keep the 
faith. This may not be the fastest way to lose weight, he assured me, but it's 
the most lasting. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore his point, he told me about an obese patient who was placed on 
the program and instructed not to weigh himself for a full year. Twelve months 
later, he had lost an average of seven pounds per month, which added up to a 
whopping 84 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornish, a proponent of meditation and other holistic techniques, proved even 
more inspiring during his formal presentation. He lambasted federal guidelines 
that call for Americans to limit their daily fat intake to 30% of total 
calories. (For example, if you consume 2,000 calories, no more than 600 should 
come from fat). But to make a serious dent in heart disease and obesity, Ornish 
contends, fat intake should be reduced to 5% to 10% of total calories. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we just put into practice what we already know, heart disease could be 
wiped out 95% of the time, like malaria," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Ornish suggests a link between low-fat eating and the low rates 
of cancer and heart disease in China and other cheeseburger-deprived countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notion that a healthy diet can actually reverse heart disease is 
something new. 
</P>
<P>
 As the audience gasped in amazement, Ornish showed before-and-after slides of 
clogged arteries becoming dramatically clearer after patients embarked on a 
10%-or-less fat regimen. Despite his training as a cardiologist, he was almost 
scornful of angioplasty, heart bypasses and other high-tech treatments that 
fail to address the underlying cause of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somehow conservative to cut someone's chest open and blow a balloon up 
in their arteries, and it's radical to stop smoking, walk, eat vegetables and 
meditate," he said to a hearty round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
 So persuasive was Ornish that no one in the audience seemed to care that he 
weighs nearly 400 pounds. (Just kidding.) Actually, Ornish is a trim ex-Texan 
who believed meat made him sluggish so he gave it up at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in diet eventually led to groundbreaking clinical studies on 
heart disease. An unintended consequence of his work with heart patients was 
that they lost weight on a low-fat program. So he tailored the approach for the 
general public in his book, "Eat More, Weigh Less," which includes a sizable 
collection of gourmet low-fat recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, no one in our busy modern household has time to prepare them, 
least of all my razor-thin, not-so-subtle girlfriend who bought me Ornish's 
book in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 She, of course, eats ANYTHING she wants, including whole-milk ice cream and 
beef tallow STRAIGHT FROM THE CAN and yet she never gains a SINGLE OUNCE AND I 
HATE HER AND I HATE DEAN ORNISH AND . . . Time to meditate. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that even if you don't use the recipes in the book, it's easy to 
improvise. For example, black bean burritos with tofu and nonfat sour cream 
make for a quick and tasty meal. 
</P>
<P>
 My plan is to eat this way for a year and see what happens. I'll either be 
very thin or very angry. 
</P>
<P>
 So pass the damn celery.

COMMUNITY NEWS; BEVERLY HILLS; YOUNG ARTIST HAS FIRST BRUSH WITH FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Fleiner's first brush with art was much the same as that of thousands of 
other schoolchildren: She would do art projects in class and take them home to 
her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But few pupils can boast that people wanted to buy their work. That was the 
case with Anna when her father put up her work at his auto body repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd say, 'Who did the painting?' I'd say, 'My daughter. She's 9,' " said 
Ken Fleiner. "They'd say, 'You're kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't taken long for professional artists to confirm what Anna's parents 
and body shop fans already know. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna, now 14, will become the youngest artist ever to be accepted in the 
Beverly Hills Affaire in the Gardens, where she will exhibit her oils, pastels 
and watercolors this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 21st annual outdoor art show, whose entrants are selected by a jury 
that includes college art professors and award-winning artists, will be held 
from 10 a.m. to dusk next Saturday and Sunday in Beverly Gardens Park on Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna is one of 250 artists, including 70 new to the show, chosen from about 
500 applicants by the art jury, said Brad Meyerowitz, a spokesman for the city 
Recreation and Parks Department, sponsor of the May and October event. Artists 
were judged in such categories as oil and acrylic painting, watercolor, 
sculpture, ceramics, photography, mixed media and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Student artists have exhibited their works in the show before, but Anna is the 
youngest artist to go through the juried screening process, Meyerowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader, who attends El Rodeo Elementary School as well as a private 
art school, will be joined by artists from all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40,000 people attend the two-day show, but Anna says she has no fear 
about showing her work in such a public setting. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has already participated in another show and has attended the 
Affaire in the Gardens for nine years as a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Anna said. "I wanted to get into the show for the experience 
and fun. My paintings are just sitting at home. I'd like people to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists at the Affaire include sculptor Jane DeDecker of Loveland, 
Colo., who sold one of her pieces at a recent Affaire to pop singer Michael 
Jackson, Meyerowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists themselves -- rather than representatives -- are required to show 
their works so that people can meet the artists, Meyerowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities at the show include a "mini-Monet" tent where young artists 
can try their hand at arts and crafts. For adults, there are art demonstrations 
on the main stage as well as jazz, blues, and big-band and Brazilian music.

COMMUNITY NEWS; CRENSHAW; AUTO TRAINING CENTER GIVES JOB TUNE-UPS 
</P>

<P>
 When Windy Gaston was recovering from a drug addiction at a halfway house a 
year and a half ago, her self-esteem was so low she did not believe that she 
would ever be able to learn a job skill and support herself. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gaston fought back and, thanks to the Urban League Automotive Training 
Center, is employed as a specialist in brakes, front ends and alignment at a 
Willowbrook auto repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of confidence today," Gaston said during a recent graduation 
ceremony at the training center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certified, I'm a female in a mostly male profession. . . . It makes me 
want to give more than 100%. My ego gets knocked down sometimes, but I'm 
learning character, perseverance, humility. The glass is always half full." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston was the one alumna addressing the latest graduating class and an 
audience full of political and business dignitaries at the training center, 
which recently celebrated its one-year anniversary. The program certifies 
students in auto repair skills including brakes and exhaust, air conditioning, 
tires and suspension and automotive detailing. The courses last between three 
and six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crenshaw district center, a joint venture between the Urban League and 
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., has trained 100 students and placed more than 70% in 
auto repair centers countywide, including chains such as Sears, Goodyear, 
Montgomery Ward, Jiffy Lube and Pep Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban League President John Mack said the training center is one of the few 
efforts begun after the Los Angeles riots that is living up to its commitment 
to improve the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of talk about what has not been done, but this training 
center has made it happen, and will continue to make it happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking across the stage and accepting diplomas from center manager John 
Saia, the 57 graduates jubilantly held aloft framed certificates and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias Aklilu, a former mechanic who completed the air-conditioning course, 
said he was happy simply to have a skill, learned on modern equipment, that is 
keeping pace with the increasingly complex field of auto repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do they upgrade skills, they give you guidance in terms of setting 
up your own business and networking," he said. "It's a great bunch of people, a 
great program. I'm glad I took advantage of it." ERIN J. AUBRY

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN, A summary of significant Los Angeles City Hall decisions 
affecting the Westside in the last week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * VENICE PARKING -- Instructed the Department of Transportation to initiate a 
preferential parking district in Venice in the area bounded by the center lines 
of Electric Avenue, North Venice Boulevard, Mildred Avenue and Pacific Avenue. 
The plan will restrict parking in the area from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. to residents 
and their guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * STUDIO RENOVATION -- Approved a resolution that will allow KTLA television, 
5800 Sunset Blvd., to renovate its studio complex. The five-year project will 
result in 972,000 square feet of building area and 2,528 parking spaces. The 
studio is a Hollywood landmark where the first talking motion picture, "The 
Jazz Singer," was filmed in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 * OFFICER TRAINING -- Opposed a plan that would have consolidated the training 
facilities for the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff's departments. Among the 
reasons for the opposition were differences in training policies between the 
two departments, as well as the estimated $100-million cost for the 
construction of a 40- to 50-acre joint training facility. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS -- Instructed the city attorney to draft a plan 
that will allow domestic partners of non-union city employees the rights to 
health, dental and disability benefits. Domestic partners are defined as a 
couple over 18 years years old who have lived together for more than one year, 
are not related by blood, are not married, are each other's sole domestic 
partner and have signed an affidavit stating so. Passed 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky, Mark Ridley-Thomas, 
Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg.

COVER STORY; TAKE TWO HERBS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING; HEALTH: YOUR CHILD IS 
TEETHING OR HAS AN EARACHE? RESPONDING TO GROWING DEMAND FROM PARENTS, MANY 
DOCTORS ARE PRESCRIBING HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES. BUT THEY CAUTION THAT SUCH 
TREATMENTS ARE NOT A CURE-ALL.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gail Gutierrez's 13-month-old son Daniel was found to have a double ear 
infection, the Santa Monica woman left her pediatrician's office with the 
requisite prescription for antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gutierrez had no intention of filling it. The prescription was only meant 
as a backup in case Daniel didn't respond to this brew: pulsatilla, an oral 
homeopathic remedy; the herb echinacea, and Mullin oil, an herbal eardrop 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days later, when Gutierrez returned to the pediatrician for a follow-up 
exam, her son's infection had cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always used homeopathic remedies," says Gutierrez, 27. "Daniel's never 
had antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy, a 200-year-old practice involving the use of minute doses of 
pharmaceutical agents, has long been big on the Westside, where some embrace 
alternative living as religion. Chain drug stores here offer homeopathic 
remedies over-the-counter and several pharmacies specialize in homeopathic 
remedies and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, the alternative healing method is being used on 
children -- to treat maladies ranging from teething pain and colic to upper 
respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Though homeopathic remedies themselves are considered harmless -- they are 
exempt from federal Food and Drug Administration regulations -- the trend 
toward pediatric homeopathy makes some local physicians nervous. Potentially, 
they warn, parents who use homeopathy might allow a child's cold or ear 
infection to steadily worsen, perhaps eventually leading to pneumonia or loss 
of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is that a small number of hard-core homeopathy adherents 
refuse to have their children vaccinated out of concern that vaccines might be 
harmful. That, experts say, could expose children to outbreaks of 
life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such worries, however, the demand for homeopathic treatment is rising 
-- and a growing number of physicians are taking steps to meet it. These 
doctors see at least some merit to homeopathy, and some of them credit patients 
for making them aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of my practice turns to homeopathy," said Dr. Jay Gordon, a pediatrician 
with offices in Santa Monica and Malibu who describes himself as self-taught in 
homeopathy. "I really started listening to my patients who felt antibiotics and 
tubes didn't always work (for ear infections) and who didn't like antibiotics' 
side effects. And bacteria have developed a resistance to antibiotics. It is 
frightening. We need to try different methods to treat children." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy (from the Greek Homios, for similar, and pathos, for suffering) is 
based on the belief that a substance that causes certain symptoms can cure 
those symptoms when administered in microdoses. For example, a tincture of 
belladonna, derived from a highly poisonous, fever-inducing plant called deadly 
nightshade, is used to fight fever. The remedies are intended to act on the 
same principle that allergy shots do, selectively stimulating the immune 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy has become a booming business nationwide, experts say. According to 
U.S. homeopathic manufacturers, it generates $250 million in annual sales and 
is growing at a rate of 25% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics liken homeopathic remedies to placebos and faith healing. The 
compounds, they assert, are so diluted that virtually no molecules from the 
original substance are left in them, rendering them impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeopathic practitioners contend that molecules from the compounds they 
use imprint a kind of permanent energy pattern on the surrounding water 
molecules. Those water molecules, they say, become activated and more powerful 
when shaken vigorously, producing a highly effective medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 And homeopathy appears to be gaining some legitimacy in the United States, as 
it already has in Europe. A report on the first clinical trial of homeopathy by 
a U.S. doctor was published this month in "Pediatrics," a respected medical 
journal. Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, a physician who uses only homeopathy in her 
practice in Evergreen, Wash., reported on a study she conducted using 
homeopathy in conjunction with oral rehydration to treat diarrhea in children, 
the leading cause of death for children worldwide. The study showed a decrease 
in diarrhea of about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 A repeat study is now under way in Nepal, said Jacobs, who also hopes to do a 
study on the use of homeopathy in the treatment of ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the alternative medicines branch of the National Institutes of 
Health earlier this year gave the first federal grant to study the 
effectiveness of homeopathy. The recipient was Michael Goldstein, a UCLA 
researcher and professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supposedly, there were more applications for this grant than ever in the 
history of NIH, which shows there is a lot of public interest in it," said 
Goldstein, who plans to track the treatment of 130 adult patients in the care 
of five Los Angeles homeopathic practitioners for six months. "We found that 
people who've repeatedly (sought) mainstream medicine but have been 
dissatisfied, then turn to alternative medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy has been popular for at least 20 years on the Westside, where the 
evidence of alternative health care includes underwater birthing centers, 
burgeoning midwife practices and the College of Homeopathy, which is in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica alone, there are an estimated 70 homeopathic practitioners, 
called homeopaths or homeopathics, who have received diplomas from homeopathy 
schools in the United States or abroad. Of the five Los Angeles-area pharmacies 
that specialize in the sale of homeopathic medicines, four are located on the 
Westside. And such chain drug stores as Thrifty and Sav-on are scrambling to 
accommodate consumers, offering popular homeopathic remedies for children's 
problems, including teething, colic, bed-wetting and coughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Local pediatricians say that in the last three years there has been a decided 
increase in the number of parents asking that their children be treated 
homeopathically. The interest has grown as parents have learned about 
homeopathy at birthing centers, mother support groups, natural parenting 
groups, food co-ops or just in parent-to-parent conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 With competition among doctors and hospitals especially fierce on the 
Westside, the local medical community is going to great lengths to meet the 
demand. Some medical doctors, for instance, have attended homeopathic colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Dr. Lauren Feder, a medical doctor who attended the British 
Institute of Homeopathy three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents that I see are saying that they aren't getting what they need from 
allopathic medicine, that they don't want another antibiotic," said Feder, 
whose Santa Monica practice serves both children and adults. "Allopathic 
medicine helps the body suppress symptoms and blames outside causes rather than 
an internal weakening of the individual system for the problem. As homeopaths, 
we treat constitutional weaknesses and symptoms as a whole and stimulate the 
immune system to fight off (disease and infection)." 
</P>
<P>
 That approach appeals to people such as Barbara Olinger of Venice, a mother of 
two who discovered homeopathy five years ago through a mother support group 
that grew out of the Venice Ocean Park Food Co-op on Brooks Avenue. Armed with 
stacks of books on homeopathy and container after container of tiny white 
homeopathic pills in her medicine cabinet, she has put the practice to use. 
</P>
<P>
 While on a camping trip recently with parents and children from the co-op, she 
passed out homeopathic pills derived from poison ivy. Though there was a great 
deal of poison ivy, she said, none of the children got rashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers in the group used (homeopathic remedies) and it kind of became a 
learn-as-you go kind of thing," said Olinger, who plugs homeopathy at support 
groups that she runs for mothers at Santa Monica's YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many who treat their children with homeopathic remedies, however, Olinger 
is open to using conventional medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about (homeopathic medicine) is it has no side effects, like the 
diaper rashes, digestive problems and diarrhea that come with antibiotics," she 
said. "In fact, I just cleared up an ear infection my son had with homeopathy. 
But I am not totally against acetaminophen and antibiotics, because I had 
pneumonia, and when homeopathy didn't work, I used antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Neal learned about homeopathy from a friend who handed her a book about 
it after hearing Neal complain about a sore throat that wasn't responding to 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal has treated her 25-month-old son, Luka, successfully with homeopathy for 
ear and upper respiratory infections. But when Luka got the flu, she visited 
her pediatrician, who told her to keep a close eye on her son. After waking 
from sleep, Luka's left eye area was swollen to the size of a golf ball. Neal's 
pediatrician told her to rush him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had periorbital cellulitis, and it can travel to the brain and kill them," 
said Neal, who lives in Santa Monica. "I said, 'Give him the antibiotics now.' 
He was in the hospital for two days." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said she is wary of antibiotics because she took so much tetracycline for 
throat infections over the years that she has become "immune to antibiotics." 
The drug also turned her teeth a dull gray, she said, prompting her to spend 
$10,000 for dental cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I am attracted to homeopathy is so I am not dependent on something 
that is destructive to your immune system," Neal said. "It also gives you some 
control over your own health. But I am kind of middle-of-the-road, half in 
Western medicine and half in alternative medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more rigid users of pediatric homeopathy. They tend to use 
homeopathic practitioners who take a holistic approach to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 These homeopathics typically spend an hour or more with parents, learning 
about the child's symptoms and asking a seemingly bizarre range of other 
questions: Does she fear barking dogs? Does she wake up happy from her naps? 
Does she like sweet, sour or spicy foods? What does her sweat smell like? 
Homeopathics say this allows them to treat a child's mind and body based on 
their unique set of symptoms and their constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most orthodox adherents of homeopathy shun Western medical 
treatment almost altogether -- and draw the ire of physicians who believe they 
unnecessarily place their children at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Hamilton, a Santa Monica pediatrician and assistant clinical 
professor at UCLA Medical School, acknowledges that there are medical 
applications for homeopathy. But he warns that there is also potential for 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if a child has a high fever and is taken to a homeopath and he has 
meningitis," Hamilton said. "That child might be diagnosed (too late), which 
can cause visual or neurological damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is ear infections, the second-leading ailment affecting 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of kids will get over their ear infections by doing nothing," said 
Dr. Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica pediatrician who practices conventional 
medicine but also advises parents on homeopathic remedies. "Loss of hearing is 
rare and primarily caused from chronic fluid in the ear, not from acute 
infection. The caveat we give to patients, whether they use antibiotics or 
homeopathics, is to watch it for three days and if it doesn't get better, (come 
back to the doctor.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Most physicians -- even many who see a role for homeopathy -- frown on parents 
and homeopathics who refuse to vaccinate children because of fears that the 
potential for harmful side effects from vaccines outweighs the benefits of the 
inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians warn that if parents fail to inoculate their children, they could 
be creating the conditions for a dangerous outbreak of disease. Karp says such 
a problem could occur in Topanga Canyon, where a cluster of children have gone 
unvaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions vary on when -- or whether -- homeopathy will become an accepted part 
of modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors believe that it must first be validated scientifically, through 
rigorous study. Others say the practice doesn't need Western science to prove 
its effectiveness. Parents, they say, will continue using homeopathy to treat 
themselves and their children as long as it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that homeopathy will ever be accepted by the American Medical 
Assn. because they just aren't likely to be of that mind-set," Gordon said. "I 
think its legitimacy is going to come from the bottom up, that patients are 
going to bring it to their doctors. Learning from patients is one of the lost 
arts of medicine."

CIVIC CENTER: COST OF ELECTION AND CITY LOBBYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when our city is facing severe economic pressure just to maintain 
basic services, our City Council is spending $142,000 of Santa Monica 
taxpayers' money to promote its RAND-dominated Civic Center mega-development 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 How? Last fall civic leaders, environmentalists, community organizations and 
our state senator all called for the City Council to place the Civic Center 
plan on the ballot for a public vote. The Council refused, forcing several 
dozen citizens to gather signatures from over 8,500 Santa Monicans calling for 
a vote or a rescission of the plan. The City Council then had to spend $16,000 
to validate these signatures, money that could have been saved, had they 
trusted the people and put it to a vote in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with this successful referendum, the council next chose not to put 
it on the ballot in November when a vote would have been less expensive and 
more democratic (i.e., a larger voter turnout). Instead they chose to put it on 
the June primary ballot -- Propositions D and E -- requiring another $55,000 in 
special election costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council maintains that the public already supports their 
Civic Center plan, they are spending an additional $71,000 to mail the entire 
100-plus-page, full-color plan to all 55,000 registered Santa Monica voters. 
The council did not however, include the plan's Environmental Impact Report, 
which details the plan's serious negative environmental consequences. 
Apparently, the City Council believes that it not only has a political blank 
check to approve irresponsible development but also a fiscal blank check to 
promote their political agenda -- at your expense. 
</P>
<P>
 You have two reasons to vote NO on Propositions D and E. First, you stop the 
environmentally reckless and fiscally irresponsible Civic Center 
mega-development. Second, you send a message to our City Council, that as a 
taxpaying citizen you will no longer tolerate their wasteful spending and that 
they will be held accountable.

EDUCATION: PARCEL TAX ISSUE AND POLITICS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District is becoming 
dependent on "out of district" children to make up the school enrollment that 
serves as the measure for state funding. In addition, driven by the Santa 
Monicans for Renters Rights-dominated board of education, our school system has 
become a refuge for a variety of social programs that have little to do with 
educating youth. While a federal commission headed by Education Secretary 
Richard Riley condemns the declining school day allocated to core subjects like 
math, science and English and criticizes the increasing time spent on AIDS and 
sex education, community service and similar programs, the local board of 
education supervises a system that lards on social welfare programs and 
methodically destroys its educational honors program in the name of social 
fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the protest of many parents, the high school initiated a condom 
distribution program that bypasses parental control (and, in this respect, may 
be illegal based on a New York court case of last year). The school also has a 
program for teen mothers that even the liberal former state Senate candidate, 
Catherine O'Neill, questions whether pushing baby carriages on campus is "too 
normal" and sends the wrong message. The politically correct history textbooks 
tell us that Ronald Reagan was elected President because of conservative 
special-interest groups that have dominated our political landscape for the 
past 25 years. The big-city political machines that pander to liberal agendas 
-- no, none of that is in the history book. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school English department has imported deconstruction of literature 
from the universities; students are frequently graded on their ability to 
express "politically correct" feelings whether or not there is empirical 
evidence to support their conclusions. This kind of nonsense is slowly 
filtering down to our middle and elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the school board and a number of civil "leaders" want us to vote in favor 
of a parcel tax to continue providing additional funds for this dysfunctional 
system. While they may think themselves civic-minded and "helping the 
children," the problem is that passage of such a tax will send the message that 
we are giving tacit approval for our politicized board of education to keep 
engaging in the kind of management that has led one family after another to 
pull their children out of the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with just about every aspect of Santa Monica life, the parcel 
tax is recommended by a committee that is heavily politicized. The group is 
dominated by SMRR members and fellow travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is high time we sent a message to the educational leadership in this 
community that their social engineering experiments are unacceptable. By voting 
NO on the parcel tax, the people in the community will not really deprive our 
youth of an education -- unless, of course, the school system decides to 
continue funding social programs and sacrificing classroom learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the parcel tax requires a two-thirds majority in order to pass. 
Sadly but appropriately, this is a necessary protection available to numerical 
minorities to ensure that their views are heard and responded to instead of 
dismissed out of hand as is the case in Santa Monica. (To my "liberal" friends 
who decry my approach, I suggest they carefully review the writings of one whom 
they "champion," Lani Guinier.) For too long in this community, the 
SMRR-dominated board of education has made decisions for our children with 
little or no regard for the views of any but those who agree entirely with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see them change the way they do business, choose their advisory groups, 
conduct their board and other meetings and then let them demonstrate a record 
of community responsiveness, a focus on the education of children rather than 
social welfare programs, and -- only then -- ask for us to approve a parcel 
tax.

CABLE TV: COVERAGE OF IMPORTANT STORIES BY 'FULL DISCLOSURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for Scott Collins' cover story on public access cable television on 
April 21. I see much of the same unfulfilled potential in these cable 
television stations.As an occasional participant on the public access "Full 
Disclosure" program, I can speak firsthand on what the mainstream media is 
missing with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the "commercialism" programs reported by Scott Collins, "Full 
Disclosure" concentrates on issues covering public safety, government 
accountability, crime, fraud and corruption, from the people's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years "Full Disclosure" has been cablecast every Sunday 
morning on Century Cable Channel 3 at 10 or 10:30 a.m. Sponsored by the 
Citizens Protection Alliance, a Santa Monica based, nonprofit watchdog 
organization, the program is now featured in 93 communities throughout Southern 
California on public access television channels. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday at 10:30 a.m. "Full Disclosure" will again feature "the news 
behind the news" with an almost unheard-of debate between two prominent 
Superior Court judges on a little-known but controversial proposal to amend our 
state Constitution (SCA3). This proposal, if placed on the ballot by our 
Legislature, would consolidate the Superior and Municipal Court systems into 
one big system. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mainstream media is covering the contrived divorce between Roseanne 
and Tom Arnold or Tonya Harding's latest denial, public access television's 
"Full Disclosure" is alerting our citizens to crucial issues which will affect 
the future of our communities and our country. 
</P>
<P>
 One must wonder why the Metro edition of the L.A. Times consists of only four 
pages? Perhaps that is why more people are tuning in to the public service 
programming such as "Full Disclosure" on community access cable television.

FOR SENIORS; CRAFTING ARTWORKS PROVIDES YOUTHFUL ENJOYMENT FOR LATE-BLOOMER 
</P>

<P>
 Al Greenberg, 68, is going through his teen-age years now. This is not to say 
that people get silly as they get older. This is about passion -- the kind of 
passion we associate with youth. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can hold onto passion long enough, it can be put to good use when 
you're older. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is what Greenberg has discovered through ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 From his Marina del Rey garage studio, the retired tire salesman fashions 
Jewish icons from clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his pieces: a chess set that depicts an Israeli soldier as a knight, a 
synagogue as a rook, a rabbi as a king and Greenberg's wife as a queen. It and 
other pieces sell at the Museum of Tolerance on Wilshire Boulevard and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg finally has discovered what he was meant to do on this earth. It has 
taken a long time to get this far but he's loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg is part of the golden-rule generation: people whose character was 
shaped by the values of responsibility, duty, loyalty, and, for men, the need 
to make a living and take care of your family. It wasn't necessarily the life 
you wanted to be in but because of World War II or the Depression or poverty, 
it was the one you lived. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a certain prescribed way things were done and at what age. According 
to the script of life for Greenberg's generation, he should be "retired" -- 
enjoying his leisure time by traveling, sailing, bike riding. 
</P>
<P>
 He did all that, but he didn't feel like he does when he turns clay into art. 
Greenberg found his niche. 
</P>
<P>
 For 35 years he was the Al in Hal and Al's Tires in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like Hal go to Al" was their motto. And it's hard not to like 
Al, which explains why he and his brother were so successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "These hands encrusted with grease and oil, why, I thought, 'These hands can't 
create anything but work,' " he said in his booming voice. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does a man go from rubber to clay? 
</P>
<P>
 It started with failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I washed out of Air Force cadet school," the Los Angeles native said. "I'm 18 
and I'm heartbroken. I went looking for some of my buddies, and I passed the 
old Hal Roach Studio and saw a sign for the first motion picture unit. I had 
taken some photojournalism classes in high school. Ronald Reagan was the 
personnel officer. He interviewed me. He sent me to war and he stayed home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Greenberg tried several ways to make a living. He went broke 
several times. He even became a butcher for a while to support his wife, 
Charlotte, and son, Ken. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his brother decided to go into business together selling and repairing 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The business flourished, and his life gained direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day I walked out of the business 10 years ago I dropped an anchor. I 
never felt motivated to do anything and stick to it. I tried guitar lessons, 
Spanish lessons, bought a sailboat, rented a motor home and drove to all of the 
Indian reservations, but nothing felt right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we went to Africa as part of a study abroad program. When we returned 
home, Charlotte became ill -- something which was not related to the trip. I 
couldn't go sailing or biking because we always did everything together. I 
don't like to do anything alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Charlotte got better, she turned her interest toward her first 
grandchild, who was born shortly after they returned from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 So, at 65, Greenberg went to West Los Angeles College after being persuaded by 
a friend to take some basic ceramics classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg started out making masks. But no one wanted to buy them. He stopped 
going to classes and started to develop his own style. He liked making his own 
hours too. Then he began doing Judaica, pieces that depict Jewish life and 
history. He makes religious figurines and scenes of the Wailing Wall and people 
at prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was something he had a feel for and it was part of his history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clay is dirt. It's earth. I get a religious feeling from the work but I am 
not a religious man. I didn't want to follow a mold. I feel like a Jewish-male 
Grandma Moses because I started so late. My work is primitive in many ways. I 
have a certain amount of talent, but what I turn out comes from my heart," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also teaches ceramics in the Las Virgenes School District, where his 
grandson is in elementary school. "When I give my grandson a gift that I have 
made, it will outlive me. It's stone. Stone will be around for a long time and 
he can say, 'My grandpa made that,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's pieces sell for $30 to $4,000 at the Museum of Tolerance, Gallery 
Judaica on Westwood Boulevard and J. Roth Bookseller on Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Every piece is signed and has its own story. It's an original. Just like Al.

 * CHINATOWN REVITALIZATION: Approved a motion that instructs the Community 
Redevelopment Agency to develop a strategy for the economic revitalization of 
Chinatown. In developing the plan, several public meetings will be held, at 
which Chinatown residents and merchants may express their opinions on ways to 
improve the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * OFFICER TRAINING FACILITY: Opposed a plan that would have consolidated the 
training facilities for the Los Angeles Police Department and county Sheriff's 
Department. Among the reasons for the opposition were differences in training 
policies between the two departments, as well as an estimated $100-million cost 
to construct a 40- to 50-acre joint training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP BANNERS: Approved a motion that allows World Cup USA Inc. to 
install free of charge 5,000 to 7,000 banners announcing the 1994 World Cup 
June 17 through July 17 at the Rose Bowl. The city's fees for the banner 
installation could have totaled as much as $322,000. USC economists have 
estimated that visitors and business activities related to the World Cup will 
add as much as $630 million to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE: Approved the temporary closure of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue at 
the so-called 5-Point Intersection in Boyle Heights on May 30 from 10 a.m. to 
noon for the Time Capsule All-Wars Memorial Monument dedication ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEIGHBORHOOD CLEANUP FUNDING: Approved the use of $2,000 from the city's 
General Purpose Fund to help pay for various cleanup and neighborhood 
beautification projects by the following community organizations: Glassell Park 
Improvement Assn., the Northeast YMCA, the Atwater Village Residents Assn. and 
the Women at Work of Elysian Village. Projects will include graffiti removal 
and tree planting. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS: Instructed the city attorney to draft a plan that 
will give domestic partners of non-union city employees the rights to health, 
dental and disability benefits. Domestic partners are defined as a couple over 
18 years old who have lived together for more than one year, are not related by 
blood, are not married, are each other's sole domestic partner and have signed 
an affidavit stating so. Passed 12-1. Voting yes: Mike Hernandez, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg, Rudy Svorinich Jr.

STUDENTS TAKE CENTER COURT TO DECRY VIOLENCE; IN WAKE OF 4 DEATHS, WASHINGTON 
HIGH PARENTS AND OFFICIALS JOIN YOUTHS TO SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each draped with a black graduation robe. Each with a diploma on the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Each representing a student who once attended Washington High School. 
</P>
<P>
 At center court of the school's Margaret Wilson Physical Education Center last 
week, the four chairs served as a grim reminder of young lives cut short by 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, parents, city officials, businessmen and ministers gathered in the 
gym to address high school violence, a topic that Washington is all too 
familiar with. The school has lost three students -- Sam Cannady, Antonio Lewis 
and Michael Nasir -- and recent graduate Wallace Dumas to fatal shootings this 
year. "We've come here to find solutions to stop senseless violence," said 
senior Gregory Gales, a member of Washington's football and basketball teams. 
"Something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death, that of Lewis, came April 30 at a house party in 
Gardena. According to the youth's uncle, Clyde Lewis, the party had turned 
rowdy before the shooting: "The family was told by authorities that 911 was 
called to report a party that was getting out of hand and the police (then) 
drove by the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena police said they responded within minutes of shots being fired at 
11:43 p.m. The case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' slaying sparked anguish and anger among the Washington student body. 
The next week, students met to prepare for the May 9 press conference that 
would serve as a forum in which they could voice their frustrations about the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to let you know we are ready (to find solutions)," 17-year-old 
senior Jaman Cotton said. "I spent hours and hours preparing for this press 
conference. I want to know what's going to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Wright, an aide to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) who offered possible 
legislative solutions such as harsher criminal laws at the county level, said 
violence first must be dealt with "at the student-body level." 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooters can be flushed out if people in the community get involved," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Bolden, a Los Angeles Unified School District police official, agreed: 
"We need people to step forward. Antonio was my son's best friend. I used to 
play ball with Antonio from 8 to 10 every Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington graduate Rory Kaufman, an aide to County Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, said high school students in general, and at Washington in 
particular, need more positive interaction in their lives. Faith must be 
emphasized in school and community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Jones, director of the Los Angeles schools' Black Education 
Commission, said people who have lived "the South-Central experience" can reach 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to dodge bullets and gunfire all the time," said Jones, who attended 
Washington from 1972 to 1975. "We need the former people from the 
(neighborhood) to come here because their names carry more weight than 
politicians and policemen. It's amazing, this (press conference) shows what 
children will do if we provide the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 students gathered in the gym Monday represented a voice that has long 
cried out without a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are tired of being brought down by the media," said student body 
representative Shannon Jackson. "We are tired of being stereotyped in a 
negative light." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of those who were invited to the press conference said the situation 
can largely be corrected by the community itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kaufman: "(When I went to school), we students held gangs down. I believe 
students can do it. But parents, students and community have to want to do it. 
Brothers and sisters have to talk more than they fight." 
</P>

OLD WEST EXHIBIT OPENS NEW FRONTIER AT AUTRY MUSEUM; HISTORY: THE STORIES AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF SIX ETHNIC AND CULTURAL GROUPS ARE CHRONICLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Japanese American woman in the loveliest of kimonos poured tea according to 
an ancient ritual. Nearby, two men wearing string ties oohed and aahed at 
larger-than-life bronze statues of singing cowboy Gene Autry alongside his 
faithful horse, Champion. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come to the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum expecting a curator of 
chaps or do-si-docents, forget it. At the surprisingly multicultural museum, 
diversity is an important part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated to explicating the American West, the Autry might have taken the 
easy trail and celebrated the predominantly white West of celluloid and cliche 
-- the monosyllabic cowboy, his freckled skin turning to leather in the sun; 
the frontier wife, ready to defend to the death her clutch of towheads; the 
imperial explorers and grizzled mountain men. 
</P>
<P>
 Those icons of the Old West are certainly represented at the Autry, whose 
treasures range from Albert Bierstadt paintings to chenille kiddie curtains 
bearing the hallowed name of Hopalong Cassidy. But the Griffith Park museum is 
devoting an increasing amount of money, time and space to showing visitors that 
the American West was created not just by whites but by people of diverse 
ethnic and cultural origins. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mexican American staff member Mary Ann Ruelas says: "I think people are 
beginning to understand we're more than Gene's closet or the Giddyap Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1988, the Autry has surprised thousands of visitors with 
the fact that many cowboys were African American. The often heartbreaking 
history of Native Americans is an essential part of the Western tale the museum 
attempts to tell. A current exhibit documents the unique contribution of 
Japanese American women to Western life, and past shows have chronicled the 
contributions of Russians and Italians. Last year, the museum initiated a 
Juneteenth celebration to mark the end of slavery done in a style that has 
become traditional in black communities in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the museum felt the need for a greater commitment to multicultural 
issues. To address the need, the Autry will open a permanent gallery on 
Memorial Day weekend called the Spirit of Community. The gallery will show how 
six ethnic or cultural groups interacted with the dominant whites in and around 
the year 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, which cost $500,000, was conceived by Michael Duchemin, the 
Autry's curator of history.  
</P>
<P>
 "It came about," Duchemin says, "because the museum recognized that we weren't 
diverse enough in our representation and interpretation of the history of the 
West." 
</P>
<P>
 Duchemin proposed that the museum tell the interconnected stories of seven 
Western communities: white, Asian, Mexican, Native American, African American, 
Canadian and Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Duchemin explains, each of these groups was a major player in the West of 
1890. In that turbulent year, the year the Mormon church officially renounced 
polygamy, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had 150,000 followers 
in the American West. Some were Mormons who had trekked to Utah after 
anti-Mormon violence farther east, only to find themselves hounded by 
evangelical Protestants who urged them to "Get right with God!" Others were 
recent European converts to Mormonism, many of whom sailed from the English 
port of Liverpool on their journey to what would soon become the 45th state. 
Only immigrants of German origin were more numerous than Mormons in the West in 
1890, Duchemin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spirit of Community exhibit will cover 2,800 square feet and consist of 
artifacts, maps, photographic enlargements and other objects, plus explanatory 
material. Each community's material will be displayed behind cases -- one to a 
cultural group -- that resemble buildings. The architecture of each of these 
display areas relates to the group whose story is being told. Thus, the Mexican 
area appears to be made of stuccoed adobe (it's actually made of fire-retardant 
materials, including fiberglass), with a tile roof and the distinctive canales 
, or rain gutters, typical of Spanish colonial architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian area -- mostly devoted to the Chinese -- takes a different 
architectural tack. By 1890, many Chinese were concentrated in urban areas that 
had formerly housed non-Asians. Given this history, the exhibit's Asian space 
looks like one of the brick buildings, designed by white architects, that 
filled the downtowns of San Francisco and other Western cities. But the 
building has been modified by its Asian occupants. Its window sills and doorway 
have been painted, and streamers have been hung, in the bright purples, yellows 
and greens that the Chinese believed brought prosperity and other things 
devoutly to be wished. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the exhibit is a fabulous artifact -- a gleaming Silsby 
steam-operated fire engine, made about 1860, that was the pride of Carson City, 
Nev. You can look at the fire engine from two very different points of view.  
</P>
<P>
 "From one perspective, it shows the power and dominance of the Anglo 
community," Duchemin says. But because a fire was one of the few occasions when 
ethnically polarized towns of Western America might work together for the 
common good "it can also be seen as a unifying piece," he says. Duchemin trusts 
that visitors will make up their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the project was conceived as a collaborative effort 
between the museum and the communities being featured. The Autry enlisted the 
help of a diverse collection of consultants. The advisers each have a 
professional understanding of what makes an evocative exhibit and other museum 
expertise. But each is also an ethnic and cultural insider who can bring 
experience and special sensitivity to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants have been very much involved, Duchemin says. They have 
reviewed the "scripts" that are the basis for the signs and other written 
materials in the exhibit and have ensured that each ethnic story is told in its 
own voice, not that of the dominant culture. Eventually, the Autry hopes to 
have a community-based advisory board with a revolving membership of 25 or 30 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 As one example of the consultant's insight, Duchemin points to Suellen Cheng's 
insistence that the woman featured in the Asian section be a merchant's wife, 
not a prostitute, as were many of the first Chinese women in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng, a curator at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument, objected to 
focusing too much attention on a woman who was essentially a slave. She argued 
that wives, while few in number, were more representative after the Chinese 
Exclusion Act of 1882 barred unmarried Chinese women from entering the country. 
Cheng insisted that wives and mothers were more central to the creation of 
community than marginal members of the demimonde. 
</P>
<P>
 An embroidered silk wedding costume is included in the Asian section, Osage 
marriage garb in the Native American section. Eventually, the museum would like 
a wedding dress for every community featured in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic interaction in 1890 wasn't always pretty, and that too is reflected in 
the exhibit. One of the less attractive European-immigrant artifacts is a 
ballot for the San Francisco-based Workingmen's Party. This largely Irish 
organization ran its candidates on a anti-Chinese platform.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the interactions are quite unexpected. One striking artifact from the 
late 19th Century discloses that a Navajo weaver chose to decorate her blanket 
or rug with stylized images of African American cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will give each community about 125 square feet of display area. 
Between each ethnic display will be a recessed area (the staff calls them 
fiords) where docents will be able to gather a small group of school-age 
visitors out of the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit's multiculturalism extends to the docents as well. The Autry's 
education department tapped docents from each of the cultural communities 
represented and asked them if they would share their family histories with 
visitors. As a result, volunteer Winnie Lu will tell how her grandfather 
practiced Chinese herbal medicine. And Jean Fernilius, a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will show youngsters a replica of the 
autograph book her great-grandfather kept in prison where he was incarcerated 
for having more than one wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to museum staff members for ethnic information has worked well for the 
museum in the past. When creating its Children's Discovery Gallery in 1992, the 
museum decided to build the please-touch exhibit around the Mexican American 
ranching family of Mary Ann Ruelas, assistant director of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasures that filled the Tucson townhouse of Ruelas' grandparents have 
been painstakingly reproduced, down to the traditional paper cutouts, called 
papel picado, that hung on the walls. By involving its own ethnic expert, the 
museum was able to get feedback about the accuracy of the exhibit. Ruelas 
objected, for instance, when the family ranch house was shown with sections of 
the adobe exposed, unprotected by stucco and, thus, at risk of melting away in 
a heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like showing your house with the windows broken," Ruelas protested. 
She also pointed out that her family had lived in Arizona, not California, and 
so the exhibit's simulation of an afternoon sky was repainted minus the 
Southland pinks and mauves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas was a learner in the course of the project as well as a teacher. While 
sharing information with other family members, she discovered that some of her 
ancestors may have been conversos, Jews who had been pressured into converting 
to Catholicism by the Spanish Inquisition but secretly adhered to such Jewish 
practices as not mixing meat and dairy products at the same meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autry's drive for multiculturalism is attracting a more diverse audience. 
Last year's Juneteenth celebration drew 3,000 people, most of them African 
American. As education associate Lori Givens points out: "It brought a lot of 
people here who didn't think there was anything here for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Givens thinks African Americans and other minority visitors also are heartened 
when they learn that the Autry has ties with ethnic institutions such as the 
California Afro American Museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel a little safer that their story will be told responsibly," says 
Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spirit of Community gallery will open May 28, but it won't be finished, 
says Duchemin. As the curator explains, it is his hope that the visitors who 
come to see how their ancestors struggled in the American West will become 
involved with the exhibit, which will change over time. The curator hopes that 
these ad-hoc ethnic experts will be quick to tell the staff what it got right 
and what it didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 Duchemin also hopes that visitors will bring their own ethnic artifacts -- 
also known as family treasures -- to add to the display. INFORMATION

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE CENTER; POLICE TO OPEN CENTER AT CENTRAL 
PLAZA

<P>
 Businesses and residents around Wilshire Center will have a new neighbor when 
the Los Angeles Police Department opens a community service center at Central 
Plaza, 3450 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will serve as a space for officers to take crime reports, make 
phone calls and meet with residents and merchants, said Capt. Nick Salicos of 
the Rampart Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, scheduled to open this week, will be staffed by one officer and a 
volunteer Monday through Friday from 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With officers from the Wilshire and Rampart divisions working in the area, 
including foot and bike patrols, the center also will give other officers a 
place to conduct business without having to return to their stations. The 
Wilshire station is at 4861 Venice Blvd. The Rampart station is at 2710 W. 
Temple St. Normandie Avenue is the dividing line between the two divisions in 
the Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings the Police Department closer to Wilshire Center, an area that has 
a high volume of motorist and pedestrian traffic," Salicos said. "We hope the 
increased police presence will contribute to the community efforts to 
revitalize Wilshire Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is at the junction of the jurisdictions of four senior lead 
officers, two each from the Wilshire and Rampart divisions. Senior lead 
officers work with teams of officers in specific areas within their divisions 
and are responsible for developing solutions to non-emergency crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Total Properties Management Co., managers of Central Plaza, donated the 
525-square-foot space. The Larchmont Chronicle and Armada Insurance donated 
furniture, said Donna Dalton, senior vice president of the management company. 
Dalton said Central Plaza and the Police Department would welcome donations to 
help cover phone bills and other office supplies and expenses.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WHITE HOUSE PLACE; ECO-VILLAGE PROVIDES URBAN 
BLUEPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As experiments in futuristic living go, the Los Angeles Eco-Village isn't as 
dramatic as the controversial Biosphere 2 terrarium, but the small 
demonstration project offers hopeful lessons in building cooperative, 
self-reliant neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Located east of 1st Street and Vermont Avenue, the Eco-Village demonstration 
project operates within a multiethnic, working-class neighborhood surrounding 
Bimini Place and White House Place.  
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, the Cooperative Resources and Services Project (CRSP), a 
training center and information clearinghouse in the neighborhood, has been 
working with volunteers and about 60 neighbors to coordinate the Eco-Village as 
a model for a new strategy for urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 An eco-village in its simplest form is a neighborhood in which residents know 
one another, live close to where they work, find most of what they need within 
walking or bicycling distance, recycle, minimize waste and sustain themselves 
with a limited reliance on government services. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing now is something other people can do in their own 
neighborhoods," said Lois Arkin, founder and director of CRSP and co-editor of 
"Sustainable Cities: Concepts and Strategies for Eco-City Development." 
</P>
<P>
 "It begins with people doing things together and building a sense of trust," 
she said. "Trust is the most important element of community work." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkin, a neighborhood resident for 14 years, began organizing last year by 
going door to door and talking with her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how she first met Maria Vazquez, who then met another neighbor she had 
never known even though they have been living across the street from one 
another for 23 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Before long, neighbors began spending time together, hosting brunches, 
planting gardens and trees, building benches, and publishing a neighborhood 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now most people know each other and it feels like a family," Vazquez said. 
Her children, Jimmy, 14, and Rosalyn, 10, tend a small vegetable garden and 
fruit trees they planted in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Esfandiar Abbassi, the garden coordinator, helped define the concept of 
sustainability through lessons in recycling and composting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take care of the earth, it takes care of you," said Abbassi, who 
studied agroecology at UC Santa Cruz and delights in turning a barren patch of 
urban dirt into a productive garden by using garbage to rejuvenate the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 He amazed students from the White House Place Primary Center next door with 
his "secret worm box." A small piece of Arkin's back yard, once devoid of life, 
produced squirming earthworms not long after the students buried their food 
scraps as a lesson in composting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids who never ate vegetables before are eating them now," Arkin said. "So 
the parents say, 'Maybe we should have our own garden.' We're making our way 
into the hearts of the parents through their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Eco-Village activities include efforts to slow down traffic on the 
neighborhood's two streets and a trading system that allows neighbors to 
exchange goods and services, often without cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, under an agreement with the city, Eco-Villagers are recycling 40 
tons of red clay brick from earthquake-damaged buildings for use in 
beautification projects. The bricks, once bound for city landfills, are being 
collected and cleaned by neighborhood youths, Arkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children play an important role in the Eco-Village and adults take 
responsibility for the safety and education of all the kids in the 
neighborhood. Youthful curiosity generates energy for new projects and "when 
the energy is there, things happen," Abbassi said. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; MERCHANTS GROUP PLOTTING NEW GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of reorganizing, the Leimert Park Merchants Assn. elected new 
officers last week as part of an effort to stengthen a group that many business 
owners say has not operated cohesively in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Dodson, owner of Banjo's Deli, was elected association president; 
Lorenzo Thomas, owner of Modern Concepts bath fixtures, was elected first vice 
president, and Kongo Square Gallery co-owner Jackie Ryan was elected second 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members say they will try to involve as many merchants as possible 
in the group to better promote the village and raise a collective voice with 
politicians planning the area's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to try and create a stronger business community," said Dodson, who 
has worked with other merchants since October to draft new association bylaws. 
"We want to try to make each business prosper a little more. We haven't done a 
sufficient job capitalizing on what's down here, what we have to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson and others said that the merchants association has operated on an 
ad-hoc basis for too long, holding meetings sporadically and not setting goals 
to improve the village. 
</P>
<P>
 The old association was composed largely of artists and gallery owners -- who 
put Degnan Boulevard on the city's cultural map -- and other merchants felt 
excluded, Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, the only new officer to serve in the old association, said she hopes 
that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This association is for everyone, whatever their business," she said. "Our 
objective is to stay alive as an area, and have a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The association, which now includes 27 of the area's roughly 80 merchants, 
will be recruiting members until May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, it is planning strategies to beautify Leimert Park and bring 
more attention to the area through advertising and special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said the association is working to bring the Cameroon World Cup soccer 
team, and the the Cameroonian delegation, to Leimert Park for an African-themed 
event next month.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said special events, better organization and aggressive promotion by 
merchants will increase business from residents of nearby Baldwin Hills, 
Windsor Hills and View Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an image problem that we want to correct," he said. "We want 
world-class events here. People don't realize the vitality we've had here since 
the riots. We need to make that known." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Fulton, owner of Fifth Street Dick's jazz coffeehouse, is one merchant 
who says he will probably not join. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing is fine, but I really think the arts places should have a 
separate group," he said. "Their agendas, their concerns are a little 
different." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Nine months ago, a block of apartments on Nicolet Street in Baldwin Village 
was an urban war zone captured by squatters, gang members and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like New Jack City over here," said Donnell Washington, who lives 
nearby on August Street. He gestured toward walls that once were scrawled over 
with graffiti, windows that were broken out and ceilings that were torn open by 
thieves who wanted the aluminum insulation to resell on the street. Things got 
so bad that, one by one, tenants abandoned all 12 units by last August. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a community program that employs neighborhood residents is taking back 
the apartments at 4045 and 4051 Nicolet St. The two buildings bustle with 
construction activity and are sporting fresh paint and new floors and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight men on the rehabilitation crew are local residents. Some are former gang 
members who once prowled the block and who say they are ready to clean up their 
acts along with the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past month, building owner Bondie Gambrell has employed the men as 
part of a grass-roots solution to the problem of physical decay that has long 
plagued Baldwin Village, known as the Jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting these guys in the position to rehab themselves," said Gambrell, 
who also owns a company called 40 Acres Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambrell began work on the building a month ago and plans to open it for 
rentals in the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost control of the neighborhood," he said. "The only way to deal with 
it is to take the community back ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Gambrell and project manager Michael White rounded up locals to supplement the 
RLB Construction crew they had contracted for the job. In addition to $7 an 
hour, they offered residents a chance to develop journeyman skills, make 
employment connections, and train at other apartment buildings and construction 
sites around the city, with Gambrell's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Marshall, 28, jumped at the chance to work even though his day begins at 
6:30 a.m. and often doesn't end until 12 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have a job," he said. "A lot of guys want to work but don't get 
the opportunity. Everybody I know wants to work here now. I'd like to be a 
manager myself when the buildings open." 
</P>
<P>
 Gambrell said he got the idea to put local residents to work from his friend 
and fellow property owner Malcolm Bennett, who owns several apartment buildings 
in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, president of the Minority Apartment Owners Assn., began a 
community-employment program at other troubled locations where workers and even 
residents were leery of going. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, if (trouble-makers) get involved, they're much less 
likely to tear things up," Bennett said. "They get more out of construction 
than destruction. These guys are taking pride in their work. They come up to 
the project manager and say, 'Check this, check what I've done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett added that since the project began, a stretch of Nicolet that once was 
a favorite hangout of gang members and vandals is now usually empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Bolden, 28, relishes the calm. Bolden, who lives across the street from 
the two buildings and was hired as a security guard, said he is happy to take 
part in improving a place where he once saw one of his homeboys shot and 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, I was responsible for this -- breaking windows, doing 
graffiti . . . this place was a hangout," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great idea, hiring guys in the 'hood. People want to give back to 
the community, but you don't really get the chance. It's like I'm putting back 
all those windows now." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; APPEALS COURT KOS LAW ON ADULT STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both a state appeals court and a federal court have declared unconstitutional 
a county ordinance restricting adult businesses within 500 feet of churches and 
schools, leaving uncertain a neighborhood's battle to close an adult book and 
video store on Whittier Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina held a rally May 5 in front of Andy's Adult World 
Bookstore, 4624 E. Whittier Blvd., to encourage residents to continue their 
fight at the street level to drive the business away, despite the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals courts decision was issued April 29; the federal court ruling came 
on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and residents have been picketing the store daily to discourage 
would-be customers, decrying the negative effect that they say pornography will 
have on their neighborhood and children. They have stepped up their efforts, 
joining with Mothers of East Los Angeles and two neighborhood groups in 
picketing the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't beat them in the courtroom, but we can beat them on the streets," 
said Robert Alaniz, Molina's press deputy. "They're very determined to get rid 
of Andy's Adult World." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roger Diamond, attorney for store owner Greg Tucker, said customers 
usually enter from the alley, so picketers have ended up harming other 
businesses on the boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Diamond filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the county in November.  
</P>
<P>
 Alaniz said lawyers for the county will consider rewording the restriction and 
appealing the Court of Appeal's decision to the state Supreme Court. No 
decision has been made on appealing the federal decision. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; CLASSES HELP REPAIR FAMILY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Licensed marriage, family and child counselor Elise Nickel hadn't been in a 
classroom for 10 years and knew she needed to learn more ways to tackle family 
problems, "not only for my own children but for the parents that I counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 So she enrolled in Saturday classes in Cal State Los Angeles' Parent Educator 
Certificate Program and was one of its first eight graduates April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickel said the classes helped her learn about the stress a family experiences 
with a developmentally disabled child, the strong bonds of gang members and the 
problems pregnant teens face. "I had a lot of experiences that I wouldn't have 
had any other place," she said. The Parent Educator Certificate Program, 
offered through the university's Continuing Education Program, is open to 
anyone with a minimum of an associate degree, and targets professionals in 
nursing, teaching, religion and family therapy, said program coordinator Linda 
Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Parenting classes are not required to be taught by certified professionals, 
she said, but that may change as the demand for qualified teachers in the field 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who graduated April 21 work with families as teachers, social 
workers, therapists and law-enforcement officers, said teacher and counselor 
Martha Serrano-Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
 She works at the East Los Angeles Systems of Care for the Mental Health 
Department, focusing on children with developmental disabilities. A former 
marriage encounter teacher, Serrano-Lujan emphasized the importance of keeping 
the marriage intact to best help the children through tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents come apart at the seams and don't know how to deal with (problems), 
not only with the child, but with themselves," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 When a child gets in trouble, parents often are left wondering what happened 
and find themselves at odds trying to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that they're not communicating," Serrano-Lujan said. "One of 
the core areas we teach is (the importance of) communication between the 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 She said parents need to become aware that children sometimes pit one parent 
against the other, and that a united front works better than if the parents are 
in disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano-Lujan believes the stigma of families seeking help has faded somewhat, 
leaving the door open to better understanding. "A lot of parents end up 
divorced. Some parents need the support to know that they are not alone," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in the program start every fall and spring and take 1 1/2 years to 
complete. An informational meeting for the fall quarter is scheduled Sept. 10. 
Tuition varies, but one class, Family Dynamics and Parenting, costs $364. 
Scholarships are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Los Angeles is at 5151 State University Drive.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; BIG BROTHERS SEEK LATINO VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past two years, Julio Lopez and Roberto Longoria have become like 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Longoria, 30, even gave 13-year-old Julio his dog, Albert, a year ago and the 
two frequently take him to run at the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area, giving 
the man and boy a chance to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're not blood relatives. The two are paired in the Big Brothers of 
Greater Los Angeles program, which finds adult men to befriend younger boys who 
have no male role models at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Brothers opened an office in East Los Angeles in March to sign up more 
Latino men for the large number of Latino boys who need Big Brothers, said Elsa 
Greenfield, a social worker and coordinator in charge of the Latino community 
and Spanish-speaking population. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the organization's 300 6- to 12-year-olds waiting or recently 
matched are Latino, according to March figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino men make up only 7% of the Big Brothers, Greenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need is there," she said. "Ideally, we would like to match Latino boys 
with Latino men because they know their history, values and customs." 
</P>
<P>
 Each boy's mother also needs to feel comfortable with the Big Brother, who 
often plays a pivotal role in her son's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, the relationship affects performance in school and grades and 
improves attitudes, Greenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they have had this person consistently in their lives, you see the kids 
becoming happier and the moms are happier when their kids are happier," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked where his father is, Julio pursed his lips, looked down and shook 
his head. "I wouldn't know him," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents separated before he was born. His older brother recently 
arrived from Mexico and has had to fill his time with school and adjusting to a 
new country. 
</P>
<P>
 So Julio has relied on Longoria, a deputy public defender in Orange County, to 
teach him about the world, take him places and, mostly, just to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He guides me," Julio said. "For one, he tells me advice about problems at 
school, problems at home and what I need to do. He's become sort of like my 
dad." 
</P>
<P>
 For Longoria, the chance to become a part of Julio's life has lessened the 
frustration of seeing so many young boys become a part of the juvenile justice 
system in which he works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to talk to them and ask if there is a father figure in their life. Most 
of the time, that is not the case," said Longoria, who lives in Boyle Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 The two meet weekly and mostly just talk about school and life. Occasionally, 
they'll see a movie, go to a flea market, see a Dodgers game or go to Magic 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Longoria takes it upon himself to ask how Julio is doing in school and wants 
Julio to talk to him about problems before they become a serious concern to his 
mother, Martha Esquivel, or his teachers at Griffith Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with their relationship," Esquivel said. "He's doing well and 
maturing with his Big Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization asks Big Brothers to commit to one year with their Little 
Brother, but many, such as Longoria and Julio, continue beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of just spending time with your Little Brother and talking and 
finding out what's going on, trying to find new ways to keep the relationship 
going. There's all the give and take," Longoria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how long they believe their relationship will last, Longoria nudges 
Julio and says, "Forever, right? You're stuck with me."  
</P>
<P>
 The Big Brother office is at the East Los Angeles Skills Center, 3921 Selig 
Place. Because the new office is still being established, organizers ask 
interested people to call for an appointment: (213) 343-1607. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; CITY MANAGER'S ROLE IN ELECTION 
CRITICIZED 
</P>

<P>
 City Manager Todd W. Argow implemented unusual, and potentially unethical, 
procedures that may have favored incumbents during the recent City Council 
election, said Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 2 memo, Argow instructed all department heads to "remember that our 
loyalties lie with the existing" City Council members and ordered them to 
inform him when council candidates requested information or documents on city 
policies and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 If the incumbents benefited from Argow's efforts, the results of the election 
did not seem to reflect it -- two of the three on the ballot were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Argow's order potentially muddied what should be an atmosphere of 
neutrality at City Hall during an election, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does raise the specter of impropriety to the extent that it implies that 
the city employees should be other than neutral," Miller said. "In the election 
business, the appearance (of impropriety) is very important in undermining the 
integrity of the process to the public. I'm not aware of anything criminal, but 
it does raise one's eyebrows." 
</P>
<P>
 Argow said he regrets using the word loyalties, but he defended his memo as a 
reminder to his staff to continue serving the council with gusto despite the 
additional pressures of an election. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Nina Banuelos said Argow bypassed standard procedure by instructing 
his staff to handle information requests that are usually funneled through her 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos asserted that another of Argow's policies may have given incumbents 
an unfair advantage. In a second document, an internal weekly update to select 
city officials and council members, it is clear that Argow ordered city 
staffers to inform council incumbents when their opponents requested 
information and the nature of that information. 
</P>
<P>
 "As promised, we are keeping you informed of requests for information which 
staff receives from council candidates," states the Feb. 17 newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow said he allowed department heads to expedite information requests to cut 
down on bureaucracy during the election. Providing summaries of the requests to 
the City Council was a way to keep the council "informed, to let them know what 
the public interest is and what the staff workload is . . . and where the 
demands are coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk, as the city's election official, should be involved with any 
election-related matters, Banuelos said, adding that her office is the official 
clearinghouse for document requests. Providing incumbents with summaries of 
information requested by opponents gives them ammunition that challengers do 
not have, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Johnny Ramirez and Larry Leonard lost their seats to Bill Martinez 
and Henry Gonzalez. Mary Ann Buckles was reelected to her second term.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who said he had difficulty obtaining city documents during the 
election, said he believes Argow's policy was improper and gave incumbents an 
unfair advantage. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; STRIKERS FILE 2 SUITS AGAINST 
UNIHOSIERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Striking workers at UniHosiery Inc. have filed two class-action lawsuits 
against the company and its managers, alleging that male Korean supervisors 
practiced pervasive sex and race discrimination and sexual harassment, and 
assaulted male Latino employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court are the latest 
charges against the company, where workers walked out two months ago to protest 
what they called unfair labor practices. The sock manufacturer at 6724 S. 
Alameda St. also has a warehouse at 321 32nd St. and distributes wares to 
swap-meet vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the first complaint, UniHosiery Manager James Paik and other male 
company officials subjected at least 14 male workers to sexual harassment over 
several years. Paik said he did not know about the lawsuits and could not 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that managers frequently grabbed, poked and pinched 
workers in the buttocks and crotch with their hands or with tools. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a manager driving a forklift allegedly cornered a worker against 
a wall. Once trapped, a second supervisor began to remove the employee's pants, 
the document states, and the managers left after the worker screamed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In several instances, managers allegedly followed the workers into the 
bathroom to ogle or assault them. When workers complained about the harassment, 
supervisors said they were "just playing," according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 One five-year employee, who asked that his name not be used, said workers were 
treated "like animals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever my hands were busy (on the production line, a supervisor) would try 
to touch me," said the 24-year-old Los Angeles resident.  
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs are seeking $25,000 each in addition to punitive damages and 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also discriminated against Latino employees on the basis of race, 
denying them promotions and pay raises allotted to Korean employees, according 
to the second complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 All positions of responsibility -- managers, office staff and mechanics -- are 
held by Koreans, while all production workers are Latino, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino employees who filled in as mechanics were reportedly told that they 
could not be permanently promoted to the position because "the company rules 
were that no race or nationality other than Koreans can hold any of the higher 
positions at the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Another worker said managers told him Latinos were "too stupid" to be 
mechanics, the complaint stated. The workers are seeking back pay, punitive and 
compensatory damages and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 workers have been on strike since March 14. Organizers with the 
International Ladies Garment Workers Union said workers asked the union for 
help in February after the company passed new rules that they felt were unfair. 
Three weeks later, the company suspended about 50 workers, telling them their 
Social Security numbers were questionable. The garment-workers union helped 
organize the strike. Nearly all production employees walked out in support. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Charles Goldstein, who is representing the company, said Social 
Security numbers were reviewed after burglaries were discovered at the factory. 
The review revealed that many employees did not have legal documents, Goldstein 
said, and these workers cannot be rehired by UniHosiery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would you strike a company that can't take them back without violating 
the law?" Goldstein said. "And if (the company doesn't) take them back, (the 
union) can't declare a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board is investigating charges of unfair labor 
practices within the company. MARY HELEN BERG

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR TREE PLANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is seeking 50 or more volunteers to help plant 350 trees in Hollydale 
Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree-planting is scheduled for 9 a.m. to noon. Volunteers are asked to 
meet at the south entrance of the park near Century Boulevard, west of Garfield 
Boulevard. They are encouraged to wear hard-soled shoes, work gloves and hats, 
and bring shovels and sack lunches. Cold drinks will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees were provided in part through a $327,989 Department of 
Transportation grant that will fund 2,500 trees throughout the city during the 
next year. The total planting project will include $112,928 in city funds and 
about $88,000 in in-kind donations from the county, a city spokeswoman said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; TENSIONS AT SCHOOLS PROMPT CLASSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with a few calls from concerned parents anxious over stories their 
children were bringing home from school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had complaints about kids being assaulted in bathrooms, having their 
money taken or getting beat up," said Arturo Ybarra, president of the 
Watts/Century Latino Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all Ybarra needed to hear to spur him to action. He and the 
organization quickly put together a program to defuse tensions between Latino 
and African American youths and their parents through conflict-resolution 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 After securing a $10,000 grant from the California Community Foundation in 
November, the organization began recruiting students from area schools, 
including Jordan High School and Markham Middle School, to take part in the 
Watts Community Bridges Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and parents are taking part in a series of biweekly workshops 
beginning Saturday. The classes will identify sources of tension in the 
community and offer community organizing strategies and techniques to defuse 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra said the goal is to help both communities identify problems they share 
and help them develop skills to address them. 
</P>
<P>
 "These situations are mostly provoked by misunderstandings or individual 
conflicts, rather than racial problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups called in to help with the program is the Multicultural 
Collaborative, a coalition of 12 service organizations that work with the 
Latino, African American and Asian communities in South-Central and Watts. The 
collaborative is providing technical assistance to the Watts Community Bridges 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools often do little to teach groups about each others' culture," said 
Ruben Lizardo, co-director of the organization. "We think this is an example of 
black and brown parents and students wanting to sit down as a collective." 
</P>
<P>

 "I think that when these ethnic communities interact, that will lead to

"When you have a group of people that are united, then the resources will 
follow."

 The Hoover Street Gym Foundation will use a $48,000 grant from the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles to expand the gym at 7805 S. Hoover St., 
purchase boxing equipment and increase youth services. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent grant is part of a $1-million program set up by the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation following the 1992 riots to increase youth sports programs 
in areas affected by the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym recently acquired a 10,000-square-foot facility on Washington 
Boulevard near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They showed us that their program wants to help youngsters and they will get 
our help," Barry Zepel, a spokesman for the Amateur Athletic Foundation, said 
of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are providing an outlet for youngsters to spend time in sports instead 
of something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was established with 40% of the profits from the 1984 Olympics.

 A bone-marrow donor drive will be held at Centenary United Methodist Church, 
300 S. Central Ave., in Little Tokyo from noon to 2 p.m. May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 With minorities accounting for only a small percentage of the national bone 
marrow donor pool, there is an urgent need for Asian, Latino, Native American

</P>
<P>
 Patients with blood disease are more likely to find matching bone marrow in 
their own ethnic group.

 Tissue types, which are inherited and can be traced to specific geographic 
origins, must match perfectly for a successful lifesaving transplant, according

COMMUNITY NEWS: ECHO PARK; NEW PLAN FOR HILLSIDE PROJECT CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents fighting to preserve a scenic Echo Park hillside has 
agreed to study a West Los Angeles developer's offer to scale back a housing 
project proposed on the 1 1/2-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be positive," said Susan Borden, member of a committee organized to 
protect Kite Hill at 1450 Avon Place."I'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to do a study was reached Wednesday just as the Los Angeles City 
Council was scheduled to vote on a planning and land use committee's 
recommendation to allow four duplexes on the 64,000-square-foot property. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had favored only three duplexes or five single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved postponing the vote until June 21, 
pending review of the compromise plan from the developer, Mark Kaufman, general 
partner of Avon Terrace Homes Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, who purchased the land in 1991, now wants to build six houses 
covering 30,000 square feet -- scaling back his original proposal of seven 
houses across 45,000 square feet, said his attorney, Benjamin M. Reznik.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the parcel would be donated to the city or a land conservancy for 
recreational use.

COVER STORY; WHERE THE LIVING ISN'T EASY; RIDDLED WITH HAZARDS AND UNSANITARY 
CONDITIONS, THOUSANDS OF THE CENTRAL CITY'S AGING APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND 
HOTELS ARE HOME TO DESPERATE TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to the Hotel Californian. There are no mirrors on the ceilings or pink 
champagne on ice. Still, like the near-namesake hotel immortalized in the 1977 
Eagles hit, this could be heaven. But it seems more like hell. In this 
five-story, single-room-occupancy building in the middle of cacophonous 
Westlake, gaping holes in ceilings, trash-strewn hallways and roach-infested 
rooms welcome tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions like these at the Hotel Californian beset a host of dwellings in 
Central Los Angeles, creating a legion of substandard housing, or slums as they 
are commonly called. The problem is especially acute in the Westlake and 
Pico-Union areas, home to some of the city's oldest buildings. Scores of those 
neighborhoods' deteriorating 1920s and '30s apartment buildings and hotels are 
rife with fire and safety hazards and unsanitary living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7% of Los Angeles' 780,271 multiple-dwelling units are considered 
substandard, according to the city's Department of Housing. Local regulatory 
agencies do not find scads of earth-shattering violations -- such as an open 
elevator shaft or a collapsed roof. But violations are cumulative, in some 
cases adding up to 20 or more for a single building. 
</P>
<P>
 And small problems can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11 years she has lived in the Cambria Apartments, at 738 S. Union St., 
Maria Conteras has endured trash-filled hallways, unreliable plumbing, and rats 
and roaches. Those problems were compounded in 1992 when the owner fired the 
building manager, leaving no one to make even minor repairs. The owner also 
stopped paying the bills for trash pickup, gas and electricity bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would complain to the landlord," said tenant Josephine Guzman, "but he 
wouldn't do anything. He wouldn't listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Conteras and other tenants took matters into their own hands. They 
organized a rent strike with the help of the Legal Aid Foundation and took over 
basic management duties, including collecting money from residents to pay the 
gas bill and trash collection, and cleaning the building themselves every 
Saturday. "We didn't want it to get real bad," Conteras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local regulatory agencies try to compel owners and landlords to keep their 
properties safe and habitable through warnings, citations and the prospect of 
prosecution. Some landlords pull their buildings up to code to comply. But a 
number of other structures continue to slide into disrepair under owners who 
skirt those warnings, keeping the law at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know how to work the system and play into the sympathies of everybody in 
the system to get as much time as possible," said Lauren Saunders, an attorney 
with Bet Tzedek Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, building owners end up becoming the scapegoats for destructive 
tenants. "Some of these landlords have tremendous problems with drugs, gangs, 
prostitution, in addition to dealing with old buildings" that are costly to 
repair, said Barry King, an attorney who has represented landlords for 12 
years. "In some cases, no matter how much work they do, there will still be 
problems with the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners can sometimes avoid prosecution if they can persuade 
individual inspectors to grant them more time to do repairs. But if conditions 
are grave enough to call in the city's Slum Housing Task Force, the law usually 
will catch up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can try to put things off for a while but we don't go away," said 
Richard Bobb, deputy city attorney and head of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The multi-agency task force was created in 1980 to crack down on the owners of 
the city's most dilapidated apartment buildings. Its seven inspectors, 
representing the county health department and the city's building and safety 
and fire departments, focus on multiunit structures with common hallways, 
mainly found in Central Los Angeles and parts of the San Fernando Valley. 
Smaller, "garden-style" apartment structures on the Eastside and in South Los 
Angeles are handled separately by the health and building and safety 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're after just the basic services for human beings. . . . Just the basic 
necessities of life," said building and safety task force inspector Howard 
Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings on the task force caseload -- about 100 at any given time -- are 
usually in code violation of all three inspection agencies involved. The goal 
is not demolition, but rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb said that since the task force's creation, he has seen many more 
landlords in the past few years bring their buildings up to code to avoid 
criminal charges, hefty fees and possible jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that increase in compliance is due to the change in the types of 
property owners, he said. Some of the '70s and '80s slumlords who milked rent 
out of buildings with no regard for living conditions are being replaced by 
owners who do the minimum required maintenance, and unsophisticated owners who 
bought property without fully understanding the amount of work involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Most landlords, said King, do not run "empires of low-standard housing, but 
more are mom-and-pop people who are trying to do right." 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical task force case, a landlord is cited and given 30 days to 
complete the repairs or at least begin the work. Failure to make some 
significant progress by the deadline may result in criminal charges being filed 
depending on the number and types of violations, Bobb said. Guilty owners face 
penalties that range from a fine and the cost of the investigation to doing 
community service, or being sentenced to house arrest or jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some who slip through the system's cracks. A number of 
factors allow this to happen, judges and officials from city agencies say. 
</P>
<P>
 The overburdened system can, at best, investigate complaints and possibly do 
follow-up visits, but has few resources to do preventive work. Ten members of 
the city Fire Department handle inspections of commercial and residential 
buildings over three stories tall throughout the city, said Chief James Hill of 
the high-rise division. In the Building and Safety Department alone, 260 
inspectors in the community safety division were responsible for checking out 
49,555 complaints in commercial and residential buildings during fiscal 1993, 
said Phil Kaainoa, the division's assistant chief. Budget cuts have dropped the 
number of inspectors to 228. 
</P>
<P>
 And several officials said there is a desire by some sympathetic judges, 
attorneys and inspectors to work with the landlords to improve the property, 
only to have some landlords take advantage of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end goal is to have a building that's up to code. That's what we're all 
working toward here," said Municipal Court Judge Vicki MacBeth, who in 1985 
became the nation's first judge to sentence a slumlord to house arrest. "You 
have to make some allowances sometimes. Because you want to make sure these 
people still have a safe place to lay their heads at night." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent reinspection of the 200-room Californian, at 1907 W. 6th St., the 
list of what was wrong with the building far exceeded what was right, said 
Frank MacIntyre, a health inspector for the task force. The building has been 
cited at least three times since 1989 with as many as 20 violations, some as 
serious as faulty fire doors and no emergency exit signs, according to the 
city's building and safety department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette butts, used tissues and chewing gum littered the hallway floors and 
carpets. In one room, a purple T-shirt was strung through a doorknob hole; the 
door had no lock. Inside was a mess of empty beer bottles, food and dirty 
clothes, holes in the wall, a broken smoke detector and a pale-green carpet 
covered with large black and gray blotches of ingrained dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's recorded owner, Dali Dale Inc. of Los Angeles, has done little 
or nothing in the way of repairs or cleanup, MacIntyre said. Gregorio Groisman, 
who holds most of the interest in the building but is not on record as the 
owner, was out of the country, according to the building's general manager. The 
only telephone number and address for Groisman was at the Cecil Hotel, 640 S. 
Main St., which he and now-deceased partner Josefa Lerner sold several years 
ago. Both the Californian's business manager and the manager of Cecil Hotel 
said they had no idea how to reach Groisman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get in touch with him too," said Roger Birdseye, general 
manager of the Cecil. "He really took (the new owners) for a ride when he sold 
the building."  
</P>
<P>
 Tenants seldom live in these buildings because they want to, officials say. It 
is a matter of necessity. They are simply desperate to avoid the dangers of 
living on the street. For them, any space of their own is a step up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants are illegal immigrants, fearful that complaints might land them 
in trouble with immigration officials. Some are drug addicts or dealers. Others 
are just looking for an inexpensive, decent place to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Loper, 39, who has lived in the Californian for the past year, is 
tormented by the flying water bugs that swoop down over her head at night and 
the cockroaches that crawl freely across her walls and floor. Loper's 2- and 
4-year-olds were taken from her last month by a social worker who said their 
cramped room at the Californian was unlivable. They had moved here from a local 
shelter the Red Cross put them up in after their South-Central apartment 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get out of here and get my children back, but I can't right now," 
Loper said. She cried with each mention of her children. 
</P>
<P>
 With the single sweep of an arm, a tour of Loper's $350-a-month home is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunlight tries to make its way through a filthy yellow shade. The floor is 
barely large enough to fit the two single mattresses for her and her children. 
The walls, their paint peeling, are splattered with dirt and crusted with food. 
Clinging to a corner of the bathroom ceiling are the remains of a roach nest, a 
cluster of brown spores about the radius of a bowling ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I complain to (the clerk) at the front desk all the time about the roaches 
and the water bugs and they don't do nothing," Loper said. "And when the 
(social worker) came, a rat ran across the floor and she seen my bathroom and 
took my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But while tenants complain of landlords' misdeeds, landlords have their own 
gripes -- about tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people, they don't know how to treat these places. They kick in the 
windows, the doors, the screens, everything," said Joe Tabello, owner of a 
100-unit building at 840 S. Hobart St. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 of the apartments are rented now. The building looks shoddy in some 
places -- broken windows, filthy carpets and dingy walls -- but there are few 
serious violations, said Herb Zimmerman, a building and safety inspector for 
the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabello said that soon after tenants move in, they stop paying rent. He said 
he has lost more than $20,000 annually since he bought the building in 1985. 
Once eviction proceedings get under way, he said, tenants start breaking things 
up. "They destroy the apartments and we end up looking like the bad people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Michael Wilkinson agreed that tenants sometimes vandalize 
buildings and fail to pick up their trash. But, he said, the lack of 
maintenance and repair -- not poor tenants -- ultimately creates slums. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bobb: "Of course, if you didn't have any tenants in any property, they 
would remain pristine. But in any property there will be wear and tear. And as 
management you have the responsibility to limit that wear and tear." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb has a laundry list of excuses landlords and their attorneys have thrust 
at him when cited for substandard housing: 
</P>
<P>
 "We hired an exterminator. What more can we do?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Any building this old is bound to have problems."  
</P>
<P>
 "My client is not a slumlord. He didn't know what he was getting into."  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Woodard, manager of two buildings on Westlake Avenue since 1988, has seen 
it from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is bad tenants," said Woodard, who lived as a tenant in one of 
the buildings he manages. "Some of it is the landlords' fault too because they 
don't take care of the places properly." 
</P>
<P>
 One building Woodard oversees, at 720 S. Westlake Ave., was cited by the task 
force in 1987 while Woodard was still a tenant. Then-owner Tim Priest started 
to make repairs, but fell behind on his payments and didn't have enough money 
to complete the work, Woodard said. Priest, who owned other properties that 
were also in disrepair, was sentenced to house arrest in the building and later 
was sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place was a mess. People would throw trash in the hallway. When I would 
come home at night from work there'd be flies and mice in my room," said 
Woodard, a former Merchant Marine and a recovering alcoholic. "I remember 
saying that if I ever took over this place, I'd fix it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard is a no-nonsense manager: No drugs. No alcohol. No visitors after 10 
p.m. Rent is due on the first of the month. His rules are strict. His security 
guards are tough. And his buildings are clean and up to code.  
</P>
<P>
 "You do what you have to do around here," he said. For Woodard, that has meant 
evicting dozens of problem tenants and using his own money to clean up an alley 
behind the building and making repairs to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward is the type of manager needed to successfully run apartment 
buildings, said MacIntyre. "You have to weed out the bad or else your 
legitimate tenants will move out and you end up with a drug-infested, 
crime-infested rat hole." 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many ways buildings deteriorate as there are landlords, from 
professional slumlords who milk their buildings for everything they can, to the 
neophytes who have gotten in over their heads financially.  
</P>
<P>
 And judges, such as MacBeth and Susan Person, say individual circumstances 
must be taken into account when building owners are sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will put people in jail if they are deserving, I have no problem with 
that," Person said. "But there is no hard-and-fast rule here.

 "And you have to look at how your judgment will affect the people living in 
these buildings," she said. "If the landlord goes to jail, the building still 
doesn't get fixed. So you have to look at everything." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bobb and other prosecutors said that making building repairs goes 
with the territory of property ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone can be a brain surgeon. Not everyone can be President. And not 
everyone can be a landlord or building manager," Bobb said.

 About 7% of the city's multiunit housing structures are considered substandard 
-- many of them in Westlake and Pico-Union. Regulatory agencies don't usually 
find earth-shattering building and safety code violations, but in some cases 20 
or more can be found in a single building. Building owners can sometimes avoid 
prosecution but if conditions are grave enough to call in the city's Slum 
Housing Task Force, the law usually catches up with them. "We don't go away," 
said Richard Bobb, head of the task force.

GOSPEL CHOIR GIVES A LESSON IN LOVING; INEZE CASTON TEACHES DIVERSE GROUP TO 
SING WITH ONE VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "God put this choir together." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Ineze Caston of South-Central explains the group of mostly older 
women she directs Tuesday mornings at the Calvary Baptist Church in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir could be described as multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural -- but 
Caston's goal is for them to sing with one voice, feeling the same thing at the 
same moment and radiating what she thinks is the most important thing in life: 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 This choir sings gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir that Caston directs is a course offering at Santa Monica Emeritus 
College. There are more than 40 members -- all of them women. Men occasionally 
enroll, she said, but when they see all the women they get scared off and don't 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they are welcome and should see it as a good thing. It's a place 
where everyone loves each other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our members used to go to physical therapy because she has one lung, 
but since she joined the choir she doesn't have to go anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Caston also leads the Caston Community Chorale and teaches music and Christian 
education at the annual National Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The music and church have been a key part of her life from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston was 12 when she took over the choir at the Second Baptist Church in 
Riverside decades ago. Being the minister's daughter helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who else was going to do it?" she said. "I enjoyed it. I used to sit on three 
telephone books to play the organ." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to marry a minister whose church didn't have gospel music. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 12, I had no difficulties leading adults," Caston said. "The fur 
did fly when I organized a gospel choir at (her husband's) Trinity Baptist. 
Gospel hadn't come to the West Coast. It was the late '40s. They were still 
singing hymns from Europe. The syncopation, freedom of spirit and feeling of 
gospel wasn't accepted yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gospel is a combination of spirituals and blues. Spirituals were written by 
slaves as a way to express themselves. Many were work songs; others were 
promises of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slaves weren't able to choose their own wives and husbands," Caston said. 
"The slave owner did that to make sure they bred strong new slaves. When they 
were freed, they migrated to other parts of the country. Different life. They 
chose their husbands and wives, and love started and then came the blues. So 
the gospel music is the combination of the slave life and the free life. It's 
really the only authentic American music we have." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand gospel, Caston said, is to understand the broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all about sending a message from the best part of a person -- the soul. 
Singing what you lived. "I remember this woman in the choir, she was Jewish, 
who came up to me and asked, 'What is it that you have that I don't have? I 
want it.' And I laughed. I said, 'Keep living.' We have a lot in common. 
Everyone has a soul," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens are "the most resourceful people in the world. They have 
gotten through it," Caston said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I once saw a little child crawl up on this old lady's lap and ask her, 'What 
did you do when you were a little girl?' And the woman said, 'I lived on a big 
plantation. My mother was a slave and my father was the plantation owner. 
Northern soldiers marched right in front of me. One of them picked me up and 
asked if my father was kind to me, and I said yes. My father was sitting 
silently on a surrey swing right behind me. The soldier took out his sword and 
cut the fringes from the surrey and rode off.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now where can you get a story like that? We have to start listening to older 
folks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston remembered bringing in "Hold Back the Night," a song written by someone 
who was seriously ill. He died before writing a second verse:  
</P>
<P>
 I'll do thy will  
</P>
<P>
 if you just say to my soul  
</P>
<P>
 please be still  
</P>
<P>
 I'll be all right  
</P>
<P>
 if you hold back the night  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the black girls and one of the Jewish girls got together and wrote a 
second verse. I sent it to his mother and told her they finished his song. It's 
so easy to be kind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second verse: 
</P>
<P>
 Your voice speaks loud and clear  
</P>
<P>
 your arms enfold me and I have no fear  
</P>
<P>
 Take my hand and hold me tight  
</P>
<P>
 Grant me your blessings and  
</P>
<P>
 hold back the night  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Caston brings out the love in people. It's her living. 
</P>

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: DOUGH NUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago an advertising campaign for a beer used the slogan, "It's the water, 
and a lot more." If Osteria Nonni, a spare, mod Italian restaurant in Atwater, 
ever mounted an advertising blitz, they should use, "It's the dough, and a lot 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 The dough is featured prominently in the menu here, from the pizza and calzone 
to the sandwiches and house bread. The origins of the dough could be called the 
Angeli-Pasquale Connection. Nasser Saee, the owner of Osteria Nonni, was a 
friend of the owner of Angeli, a trend-setting Italian eatery on Melrose. It 
was Angeli's original pizza chef, Pasquale Morra, who designed the menu at 
Nonni. 
</P>
<P>
 You might begin a meal here with two fried treats that Angeli customers will 
recognize: arancini ($1.50), a tomato-flavored rice croquette stuffed with 
mozzarella and peas, and the croquettes di patate ($1.50), a potato version 
stuffed with smoked mozzarella and salami. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad options include insalata al caprino ($6.50), tender leaves of bibb 
lettuce, roasted garlic and a mustard vinaigrette topped with goat-cheese 
croutons, or the insalata all rucola ($6.50), a potpourri of vivid flavors, 
with the bitter, aromatic salad green arugula mixed with fennel, anchovies, 
Parmesan, olive oil and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 For the calzone al forno ($8.25), the pizza dough encases mozzarella, 
Parmesan, ricotta, spinach, mushrooms and black olives. Pizza al quattro 
stagioni ($8) features four pizzas in one, with slices of artichokes and 
mushrooms, prosciutto and salami, garlic and oregano, basil and Parmesan.

VOICES: ORIGINAL THINKER; A MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT USES HIS HANDS, FEET AND 
INSTINCTS TO PRACTICE AND TEACH. AFTER HUNDREDS OF HOURS SPENT IN THE LIBRARY, 
HE WROTE A HISTORY OF HIS CRAFT'S AFRICAN BEGINNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIJEL BINNS, Nijel Binns, 37, has practiced martial arts since age 11. The 
South-Central resident is the author of the 1990 book Nuba Wrestling: The 
Original Art, which presents his theory that martial arts originated in the 
ancient northeast African kingdom of Nubia. He also has written articles for 
Inside Kung Fu and Karate Illustrated, co-produced martial arts instructional 
films and coordinated fight scenes for the two China O'Brien movies. Also an 
artist and a sculptor, Binns heads a sculpting and fine arts company 
specializing in portrait bronze statues. He was interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I started to find bits of information about the origins of martial arts in 
Africa in different books in the USC library.  
</P>
<P>
 The first solid clue that I found that Africa was the birthplace of the 
martial arts came from a 1942 edition of National Geographic, which showed 
drawings from an Egyptian tomb depicting Africans doing martial arts more than 
3,800 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I later discovered that not only were all those figures originally painted by 
and about Africans, but castles and battleships appeared on a larger wall that 
was not shown in the magazine. More than 500 individual pairs of figures 
illustrating wrestling techniques appeared in two additional tombs. 
</P>
<P>
 I started my research in 1983. I would choose a subject and simply go through 
every book on the shelf. I had to go through literally hundreds of books to 
find clues that led to a larger picture. The more I dug, the more I uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the earliest writings to identify the bow-and-arrow technology as 
a military or martial weapon come from the northern part of lower Nubia, what 
is now Sudan. The earliest name for Nubia was "Ta-Seti" or "Land of the Bow." 
The discovery covers a period 2,500 years before the first Egyptian dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 I came to the conclusion the Nuba practiced a form of martial arts wrestling 
over 2,800 years before Christ. I am convinced Nuba wrestling is the original 
martial art that spread throughout Africa, Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 African origins of the martial arts predated Buddha's visit to China from 
India around 520 A.D. It also predates the Olympic Games, which began in honor 
of Zeus in 776 B.C. and the predominantly African rule in the Hsia Dynasty in 
China 2205 B.C.  
</P>
<P>
 Considering the martial arts began in Africa and developed in Asia, it's 
unfortunate that the true innovators and masters from Africa and Asia are not 
seen in martial arts films and given their due respect. 
</P>
<P>
 I look at people like actors Jackie Chan and Jet Lee, whom I consider 
phenomenal martial artists, and realize that they will never become known among 
the general public, particularly to Africans, Asians and Chicanos in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teen-agers today go into adulthood without the discipline needed to 
create families and support those families effectively. If the true moral 
values of the martial arts were introduced and spread through African American 
culture, it would begin to affect the youth in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traditional practices in the martial arts, such as the rites of passage, 
would help to bring a clearer perspective on life to many young African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The rites of passage is an ancient African ritual designed to bring young men 
into adulthood. The adolescent males of the community are taken to a camp by 
elders for an extended period of spiritual and philosophical teachings. The 
males are also counseled on their responsibilities as an adult and a guardian 
of the community. Martial arts and wrestling forms part of the education of the 
Nuba people. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope people will discover some of the benefits of the martial arts in 
developing a strong spiritual and moral outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the correct knowledge and use of any form of self-defense is 
essential. Lasting growth and prosperity of a culture is possible only when its 
members are able to define, develop and then defend what their ancestors have 
established.

VOICES: THE VOLUNTEER SPIRIT; MYRTLE FAYE RUMPH TURNED HER GRIEF INTO GIVING. 
SHE WANTS OTHERS TO 'CATCH THE VISION' AND DONATE THEIR TIME AND SKILLS TO HELP 
CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Myrtle Faye Rumph was determined not to let the death of her only son in a 
1989 drive-by shooting be in vain. She and her husband, Harris, sold their home 
of 13 years to bankroll an after-school enrichment and study center in 
South-Central that bears his name: the Al Wooten Jr. Heritage Center at 9106 
Western Ave. Rumph is hoping people across Los Angeles will catch her vision of 
volunteerism. She and her volunteers, who tutor about 150 children ages 8-18, 
were interviewed by Carolyn Patricia Scott. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When my son died, I was devastated. It was like somebody snatched my heart 
out. I said, "I am not going to put a period behind his name." 
</P>
<P>
 I woke with a vision of my son's name in lights on buildings across the 
country. I could see children inside the buildings, studying, playing and 
learning to respect life. I thought, "If only I could get others to catch hold 
of this same vision." 
</P>
<P>
 I began in my living room, with my husband, Harris, family and friends. We 
talked about what we could do to make a difference. We began with donated 
items. It seemed everyone close to me understood how important our efforts 
were. Everyone understood when I made "Catch the Vision" our theme. 
</P>
<P>
 We started the center in a storefront with four taggers, some 11- to 
13-year-olds who lived on the next street. They stopped tagging and helped 
paint the center.  
</P>
<P>
 A 9-year-old came to us with a note from her mother: "I hope you can teach her 
to read -- I can't." In six months she went from a D to an A in reading. Now, 
we have more than 100 participants, ages 8 to 18, and we've just moved the 
center to a larger facility across the street from the original Western Avenue 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, money is tight. We need people to get involved in teaching, tutoring, 
supervising games. We need homework helpers, bilingual instructors. We have 
roughly 20 volunteers, but ideally we'd like to have one tutor for every two 
students. With math, as with reading, we need tutors who are patient enough to 
sit down with the kids and show them techniques. Sometimes they'll need help 
with simple multiplication. Each of these children requires individual 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are the backbone of this organization. We need help in the office, 
people who can update mailing lists, file, make phone calls, do maintenance and 
repairs. There is always something to do. There is no set amount of time 
required -- 15 minutes is OK, if that's all you have. Willie Woods 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a Federal Express courier who lives in Carson, teaches karate at the 
center. His minister encouraged him to get involved with the program.  
</P>
<P>
 We have 15 students and I can take them where I've gone -- tournaments, the 
nationals, the medals. I can help them stay out of trouble, away from drugs and 
alcohol. I don't teach them violence, I teach them self-control, 
self-discipline, confidence and respect. I can be a role model. And, if I can 
turn them from peer pressure, gang activity, I've accomplished something. 
</P>
<P>
 One 7-year-old kid really has a future. He's a hyper kid, and I want to 
enforce that type of energy in tournaments. Since Tae Kwon Do has become an 
Olympic sport, his and other parents have something to encourage their children 
to get involved in. I do this because somebody took time out for me. Pauline 
Morris Lewis 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a Gardena resident and library assistant at El Camino College, 
volunteers as the center's librarian and teaches health and beauty to girls. A 
friend told her Rumph was looking for volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 You work, try to do for your family and you've got more left in your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I volunteered -- I saw books stacked against the wall and said, 
"Hey, I can help get your books together!"  
</P>
<P>
 We're putting together a reference library; primarily, we need reference 
books. Soon we'll be able to start loaning books. 
</P>
<P>
 In my health and beauty class, we talk about hygiene and attitudes. We also 
talk about staying in school.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm giving of myself. I'm giving to the kids that might not get enough adult 
attention. The attention I give might turn one around. Mary Talbot 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot, a Torrance housewife, is the center's reading instructor. She 
volunteered her time after reading about Rumph's efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, I waited to see what the government would do. They didn't do 
anything. People were afraid, but I thought, I am not going to sit back. 
Neighbors near the center say "Hello." I've never had a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 I get love from the children. After you get to know them, they'll come in and 
talk to you, share their lives: "My grandmother died," or "My dog got run 
over." You become friends. Now, we have a separate reading room. The kids want 
to read so badly. I need help. I can't get to all the kids.

VOICES: PANELISTS WATCH OVER WHO GETS PERMITS AND WHO DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Milton G. Gordon, 52, is a management consultant and real-estate adviser. 
After the Watts riots in 1965, he chaired the Emergency Task Force for the 
Economic Rehabilitation of Watts. Last year he served as chairman of the 
five-member Police Permit Review Panel, which reviews and sometimes amends 
decisions by the Police Commission regarding permit issuance and violations. 
Attorney Andrew Friedman, 46, has been a contributing editor to a 
Hungarian-language weekly newspaper for 20 years. He has tried cases before the 
California Supreme Court and contributed to the Black Law Journal. He is 
chairman of the panel. The panel was formed as a result of a recommendation by 
the Christopher Commission, the citizens group formed after the Rodney G. King 
beating. Gordon and Friedman were interviewed by Nancy Slate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon: Los Angeles issues about 4,000 permits in 52 categories dealing mainly 
with public facilities like theaters, pawn shops and towing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone with a permit violates a law, the permit can be revoked after the 
Police Department files an accusation. The case goes to an impartial hearing 
officer appointed by the Police Commission. If the person is found guilty, he 
decides whether to revoke or suspend the license. 
</P>
<P>
 The person can then come before our panel and present a case. Maybe he feels 
the hearing officer was wrong. Maybe there were mitigating circumstances or new 
evidence. The panel either upholds or changes the decision. For instance, the 
hearing officer may have recommended suspending the license for 60 days, and we 
decide to suspend for only 30.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case a family came before the panel. They had a store and were accused 
of receiving stolen merchandise. They claimed not to be aware that it was 
stolen, but the evidence indicated they deliberately violated the law. So we 
upheld the decision. Still, it's important to have a place where everyone can 
go and present their cases and be treated fairly.

 Friedman: I was born in Hungary and came to Los Angeles with my parents in 
1956, after living under communism. One reason I'm on this panel is because, 
when we came here, it was paradise on Earth. I want to do all I can to make it 
that paradise again. I'm sure there are members of minority communities who 
have the perception that enforcement is discriminatory in permits as well as in 
everything else. Based on my contact with members of the police force, the 
majority -- and I stress the majority -- are doing their best to equally 
enforce permit laws. Our cases have involved a vast array of people of all 
races, creeds and national origins. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that a dictatorial system can do away with a fair legal system 
overnight. So it's extremely important that we be watchdogs and make sure laws 
are fairly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Permit Review panel meets on the second and fourth Wednesdays of 
the month at 3 p.m. in Room 146 at Parker Center, 150 N. Los Angeles St. if the 
caseload is sufficient. Information: (213) 485-3531.

 The Bell tennis team chose an unfortunate time to lose its first match of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning all 13 of its regular season matches and three playoff contests, 
the Eagles succumbed, 18-11 1/2, to a stronger Van Nuys team Tuesday in the 
City Section 3-A Team Finals at Studio City Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were beat by a better team," said Coach Janet Spurlock, who guided the 
Eagles to their first finals appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys, which finished its season at 14-1, had two singles players -- No. 1 
Steve Parks and No. 4 Arash Parang -- who did not lose a finals match. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell got as close as 12-11 1/2 in the round-robin tournament, but the Wolves 
scored the final six points. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise of the afternoon was an unusually poor performance by 
Bell's top singles player, Jose Cardenas, who lost all four of his matches by 
6-2 scores to Steve Park, Peter Nam, Arman Dautyan and Arash Parang. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's No. 2 player, Anton Chow, fared slightly better, winning one of his 
four matches -- 6-2 over Nam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jose and Anton played up to their potential but lost to better players," said 
Spurlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's No. 3 player, Alfonso Chacon, won only one game against Nam, while 
losing each of his four matches. Juan Ubario lost three of his four matches but 
defeated Nam, 6-1, in his final match. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's doubles team of Jaime Cruz and Seo Seung-Hyun took first place, 
defeating Eric Mendez and Kenny Hsu, 6-3; Kevin Urayama and Anthony Caoyonan, 
6-3, and Shashank Sharma and John Florez, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our third doubles (team) played outstanding," Spurlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's other duo of Jose Ruiz and Oscar de la Rosa took second place, losing 
only once, 6-4, to Urayama and Caoyonan in their second match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' No. 1 doubles team of Mitchell Apodaca and Edgar Flores also won 
two of three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reaching the finals for the first time was good news for Bell, the 
bad news is that only three players from this year's team will return next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alfonso, Oscar and Jaime are the only ones coming back," Spurlock said. "It's 
going to be a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell defeated Verdugo Hills in the first round, Venice in the quarterfinals 
and Marshall in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Playoffs are scheduled to begin Tuesday at various sites.

<P>
 Baseball player Damon Bihm walked around life with two strikes on him. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he had no job and he was struggling to stay on the Los Angeles 
City College baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make matters worse, his mother threatened to throw him out of the 
house. "She told me either to be a man and live my own life, or go to school 
and get an education," Bihm said. "The main thing was: She wanted me to stop 
playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 But the seeds had been planted for Bihm's dream. And he left with his duffel 
bag and bat in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He cried. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mother's Day approached last year, Bihm wanted to give his mother a 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy her a rose," major-league scout Phil Pote advised his protege.  
</P>
<P>
 Bihm did one better: He rose to be a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihm, 21, is a starting right fielder and one of the leading hitters for 
Talladega College, a private black college about 35 minutes from Birmingham, 
Ala. And Bihm is also a B-average student majoring in clinical psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "He exemplifies a teen-ager who has overcome obstacles, temptations, pressures 
and disappointments," said Pote, a former Fremont High baseball coach and 
current Seattle Mariners scout. "If you asked someone two or three years ago if 
they thought Damon Bihm with his ups and downs would go to college, they would 
say no. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty safe bet he wouldn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 What frustrated many was that Bihm was bright enough to do well in school. He 
loves to read, especially comic books, and has an extensive vocabulary. But 
education took a backseat to baseball, which he began playing at 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon is a very articulate, strong-minded, strong-willed kid," said his 
mother, Marjorie. "I never had trouble with Damon hanging out with the wrong 
kids or doing drugs. It's just his mind was always on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Pote discovered Bihm sitting in the stands of a Los Angeles High 
baseball game. He asked the then-high school sophomore why he wasn't playing 
for the Romans. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-hour conversation, Pote decided to take Bihm under his wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with youngsters for close to 40 years," Pote said. "He looked 
like he had the potential to be an athlete. He is also a pretty sharp kid. 
Articulate. Personable. He can be a very charming conversationalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what impresses me the most is that I tell him something and he comes 
back three or four months later and repeats exactly what I said." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing one season with Los Angeles, Bihm transferred his senior year to 
University, a perennial Westside power. He played 11 games under Coach Frank 
Cruz before he was declared academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a guy who didn't have much direction," said Cruz, now an assistant 
coach at USC. "He had a Darryl Strawberry-looking body. He had a decent swing 
but an average arm and not much experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, upon Pote's suggestion, used a low-round pick to take Bihm in 
the 1991 June amateur draft. Bihm wanted to sign a minor-league contract but 
Pote, whose discoveries include Chet Lemon, urged him to play at the community 
college level. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihm bounced from Compton to El Camino colleges before landing at Los Angeles 
City. He struggled to play for LACC Coach Dan Cowgil and eventually was kicked 
off the team for arguing with a teammate. Bihm said it was a setup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ill-prepared athletically to compete in a structured program," Pote 
said. "Not because of ability or potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Bihm also had trouble keeping a part-time job because he often missed work to 
attend practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Bihm, a single parent, grew frustrated with her son and told him to 
either get a full-time job or move out. "I tried to set goals in order to teach 
him how to take care of himself," she said. "It was a tough-love situation. You 
love him, but you have to show him he can't always have his way." 
</P>
<P>
 After moving in with different friends, Bihm found a permanent home with his 
godparents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-age minority finding a job in Los Angeles is no day at the beach," 
Pote said. "He was faced with a crisis situation. It was fortunate his 
godparents stepped in." 
</P>
<P>
 While Bihm earned his associate of arts degree at Los Angeles City, Pote began 
searching for a four-year school for Bihm to complete his education. He 
contacted Florida Marlins scout John Young who put Bihm in touch with Talladega 
Coach Mark Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never guessed in a million years that I would be here," said Bihm, who 
received an athletic scholarship to the school. "The fact that my mother was 
stern and said it was 'my way or the highway' taught me to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being homesick, Bihm has developed close friendships with his 
teammates. He lives in an apartment complex and shares a telephone with 11 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 During long bus trips through the South, Bihm has found time to reflect on his 
life in Los Angeles and his relationship with his mother. He is ready to come 
home. "I've gone through a maturation. I've become more responsible and learned 
to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season at Talladega, Bihm has a .309 batting average with three 
home runs, four triples and 10 doubles, and 30 runs batted in. The Tornadoes 
are competing in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Southern 
States District 27 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a hitting standpoint he's considered to have one of the best swings in 
the Southeast region," Salter said. "He's got a nice stress-free swing. He 
takes the same cut every time and he really puts some juice on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little short in the throwing area. If he enhances that part, he could 
easily be a big leaguer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bihm said he owes his success to Pote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a son, I would name him after Phil Pote," Bihm said. "If it wasn't 
for him I would probably be in jail or dead. When all else failed and everyone 
else gave up on me, he took care of me. I have his picture on my wall that I 
look at for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "My motto in life is: Don't expect anything, but accept everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can do it, anyone can do it."

 Apparently, Jordan Coach Ray Duron had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bulldogs gave up two runs on a lead-off walk and three consecutive 
singles, Duron pulled his team off the field in the bottom of the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate won the Southeastern Conference game, 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was weird," said South Gate assistant coach Scott Pearson. "One minute we 
were playing and the next minute (Duron) pulled all his players." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate catcher Danny Mojarro went three for three with one RBI and two 
runs scored. CHARLES SMITH

CITY SECTION SEMIFINALS; DEFEAT TOLLS END OF SEASON FOR BELL; VOLLEYBALL:

 It's hard to imagine upperclassmen looking up to a sophomore for inspiration. 
Unless, of course, you're volleyball standout Raoul Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a sophomore outside hitter, had 28 kills and served 16 points, 
including the game-winner, as University beat Bell, 15-6, 15-12, 15-10, Tuesday 
in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals at University. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's amazing," Bell Coach Mike Mayfield said about Williams, the Western 
League co-Most Valuable Player. "I look at him as a teaching tool for our 
hitters for next year. He has a great jump serve. Face it, he beat us. They 
went to him a million times." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior outside hitter Rick Lopez led the Eagles with 11 kills, and Dickie 
Purcell had nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest difference was experience," Mayfield said. "They have players who 
play at the club level and all year long. We play for three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell ended its season at 13-3. University, which was to play Granada Hills on 
Friday in the City 4-A finals, was 14-4. SEAN WATERS

 Marshall 3, Garfield 0 -- It took the minimum of three games for defending 
champion Marshall to eliminate the Bulldogs from a City 3-A semifinal at 
Marshall on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores were 15-1, 15-6, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Sanchez led Garfield with only eight kills and seven blocks as the 
Barristers proved to be too powerful for the smaller Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle hitter Eli Brueggemann led Marshall with 15 kills, and hitter Jeff 
Grigsby had eight kills and six blocks. Setter Darry Tse had 38 assists and 
four aces for the Barristers. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the last home game for Marshall Coach Marji Donatella, who will stay 
at the school but will pursue other interests. She was the boys coach for six 
seasons and led them to three consecutive City finals, winning the 3-A title 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield finished the season with a record of 13-4; the Barristers improved to 
16-0 and advanced to the finals for the third year in row. GARY CHAVEZ

 Real estate agents always seem to clutch their MLS books tightly to their 
bosoms. Ask to borrow a copy overnight and they look horrified and mumble 
something about it being against board rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they really worried that you'll crib valuable information from the 
Multiple Listing Service and then try to close a sale without them? Well, that 
could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But their real worry is confidentiality. The MLS books -- which list most 
homes and condos for sale in a given area and are owned by local realty groups 
-- are filled with private phone numbers, financial information, directions to 
hidden keys, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, wouldn't it be nice to take a book home, settle into a cozy chair and 
leisurely thumb through for possibilities. It feels so direct. No middle person 
interpreting what you want. You're not trying to do the agent out of a 
commission -- just making house-hunting more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dallas, the realtors have loosened their grip on MLS listings -- with a 
high-tech twist. And many realty associations around the country, including 
some in Southern California, are watching the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program that started in February, anyone in the Dallas area with a 
computer and modem can call up the Greater Dallas MLS' new Homefacts system and 
look at slightly abbreviated listings for more than 8,000 houses and condos 
(out of 15,000 for sale). The sellers have agreed to be listed; confidential 
information (home phones, commission rates, key boxes) has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 House-hunters can call up listings by ZIP code, number of bedrooms, school 
district, map book grid, price, city or suburb. If they see something 
promising, they can contact the agent or leave an e-mail message to have the 
agent call them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas service is free to buyers. Realtors pay a small fee to list 
properties on Homefacts, just as they do to be included in the MLS book and 
computer program available to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Dallas agents are not worried that the new system will cut 
them out of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Data by itself is of no value," said Sheila Rice, president of the Greater 
Dallas Assn. of Realtors. "It's just a place to start. This is electronic 
advertising. It's another way of getting the same information. It's just more 
efficient to sort through the data." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas is way ahead of Southern California and the rest of the United States. 
The soonest that a Southland home shopper might be able to modem into MLS 
listings is this fall. And then, only if you want to buy in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Realtors has left consumer access to MLS to local boards 
to handle as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly not discouraged," said NAR spokesman Jeff Lubar. "Essentially 
what we're saying is that non-members will be able to access the information 
for a fee." The details on fees will be set by local markets, who may decide 
not to charge a fee to the modem user but to the listing agent, as Dallas has 
opted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Local boards in Southern California have widely differing opinions on the 
wisdom or necessity of allowing consumers direct access to listings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Combined Los Angeles Westside (CLAW) MLS is not talking about consumer 
access, according to MLS president Lannie Mott. "As far as any plan, any 
implementation, I haven't heard a thing. We haven't had any discussion at the 
CLAW level." 
</P>
<P>
 (CLAW covers, and is owned by, the realtors' associations for central Los 
Angeles, Santa Monica, Malibu, Southwest L.A., Culver City and Beverly Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, Jim Link, executive vice president of realtors' 
association there, said his group began thinking about consumer access to 
listings about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely inevitable," he said. "We've discussed it and the current 
thinking is to offer some form of consumer access, possibly with an 800 
number." 
</P>
<P>
 Link sees direct consumer access by modem as a marketing tool. "The 
home-buying public is more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago," he said. 
"(House-hunters) can go through the listings by themselves, get general 
information, then talk with a broker. It'll mean less time in the car. It's a 
natural progression of technology." 
</P>
<P>
 While Link and his board members are enthusiastic about the technology, they 
feel it will only be worth doing if photos of the properties are included. They 
are now installing photo capabilities in their broker-accessed computer program 
and want to get that working smoothly before offering the consumer program. The 
best case scenario is fall 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange County MLS, general manager Russ Bergeron said, "We realize that 
we're going to have to move in this direction (consumer access). We're 
investigating different ways to go." It's still in the "informal talk stage," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeron said his MLS is concerned about making the right long-term choice. 
They could set up an 800 number, he said, or a 900 number. "We're also looking 
into a possible joint venture with Prodigy or another on-line company," 
Bergeron said. Or they could hold off a little and see if interactive 
television seems like the best idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other MLS organizations around the country, the Orange County MLS would 
hate to sink their money into a program that, down the line, goes the way of 
Beta and eight-track. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, which is part of the Multi-Regional MLS that covers the greater 
San Gabriel Valley, consumer access is not in the near future. "We're not 
looking into public access at this time," said spokesperson Jackie Johnson. 
"It's not happening here. We're proud of the fabulous services to the public we 
serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Regional MLS, which covers greater Phoenix, has joined forces with 
the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette newspapers to offer access by modem to 
reader/buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is only a few months old but, by May, Michael Hibert, real estate 
advertising manager for the Republic, expects to have 2,000 listings (of 14,000 
in the greater Phoenix market). 
</P>
<P>
 In Baltimore, Coldwell Banker/Grenpler, a real estate company with 22 offices, 
has been on-line for more than two years. Their newspaper ads have a line that 
reads "Modem owner: Our computer talks to your computer." Dial a local number, 
hit a few keys and most of Coldwell Banker's listings (about 15% of the greater 
Baltimore market) are on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use this as a weapon to get listings," said owner Don Grenpler. "We tell 
sellers this advertises their listing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. People 
come in the office with printouts in hand, wanting to see the listing agent. 
We've definitely sold homes from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grenpler credits the success of the system on having in-house computer experts 
and agents who were willing to give it a go. "There were mixed emotions at 
first," he said. "Agents worrying that public access seemed on the surface to 
negate the need for an agent. But it's worked out great. The world is just now 
catching up with us." 
</P>
<P>
 While local realty associations wrestle with their options or dismiss the 
subject, house-hunters with computers already have limited access to real 
estate listings. The major on-line systems (Prodigy, CompuServe and America 
Online) offer real estate listings of varying sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe offers classified ads by owners and some agent listings, from 
single-family homes to grocery stores. The number of California residential 
listings is small: 255 for the whole state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have too many California listings," said spokesman Dave Kishler, who 
added that company is not exploring the idea of hooking up with MLS boards. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online has several real estate-oriented departments: one called MLS, 
others offering advice and mortgage rates. Online's MLS has about 6,000 
listings for the country, 299 for California. It's a time-consuming search for 
listings in a specific city. They are not organized geographically and are 
currently accessible only by the date they were put on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Many listings are little more than business cards put on by real estate 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy has joined with Homes & Land Magazine (which publishes free magazines 
of real estate listings in 300 markets around the country) to offer Homes & 
Land Electronic Magazine to its users. 
</P>
<P>
 This service has 100,000 listings nationwide, according to Bob Horning, Homes 
& Land's vice president of business development, with a goal of 2 million 
listings. They can be sorted by city, price and style and, in a few months, by 
number of bedrooms and other criteria. Photos are planned by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes & Land has used the same extensive data base as the printed magazine but 
the Prodigy component has advantages: sorting by criteria and continual 
updating. Horning said that sometime this summer, three other on-line services 
(Genie, CompuServe and America Online) are expected to be hooked up to the same 
database.

HOT PROPERTY: HE KEEPS HIS SHOW ON ROAD

<P>
 RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN, who last month ended his yearlong starring appearance as 
Prof. Henry Higgins in the Orange County-to-Broadway revival of "My Fair Lady," 
has sold his Beverly Hills condo, which he bought after he sold his Beverly 
Hills-area house to actress Anjelica Huston in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 When he bought the condo, Chamberlain, who was born in Los Angeles and lived 
in the area most of his life, thought he would spend more time in California. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the 59-year-old actor, who has been described as "the king 
of prestige TV" and "the Grand Master of the Miniseries" ("Shogun" and "The 
Thorn Birds" in particular), spent more time away from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides appearing on stage, which he has done fairly regularly since the late 
1960s when he studied Shakespearean acting for three years in England and 
played Hamlet for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Chamberlain has been 
traveling on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 He is living in an Oahu home that he purchased five years ago when he starred 
as a doctor in the TV series "Island Son," which was filmed in Hawaii. 
Chamberlain, one of TV's most bankable stars, began his acting career as TV's 
popular Dr. Kildare when he was 26. 
</P>
<P>
 His Beverly Hills condo has three bedroom suites, marble floors and a family 
room in 2,300 square feet. It is on the fifth floor of a low-rise building 
constructed in 1990. The condo has city and mountain views as well as a 
three-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain sold the unit for close to its last asking price of $895,000 to a 
Beverly Hills dermatologist who was leasing another condo in the same building, 
sources say. Chamberlain's condo was originally listed at $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra Nourmand of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented Chamberlain 
in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy-winning producer DON OHLMEYER, who took over the newly created post of 
president of NBC West Coast in February of 1993, has purchased a Beverly Hills 
home for about $2.6 million, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old home, on an acre with five bedrooms in slightly more than 
6,000 square feet, was about to go into foreclosure when Ohlmeyer bought it, 
sources say. The asking price had been $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohlmeyer, 49, was a high-ranking sports executive with NBC and ABC before he 
formed his own production company in 1982. Last year he sold his company to 
ESPN. Ohlmeyer, who is now in charge of NBC's 22 hours of prime-time 
programming, has won more than a dozen Emmy awards, and he is well known as a 
producer of Olympics TV coverage and a director of live-sports specials. The 
late IRVING (SWIFTY) LAZAR'S Beverly Hills home is due to close escrow this 
Friday at a price of $1.4 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's best-known literary and talent agent, who was also famous for his 
three decades of Oscar night parties, died last December at the age of 86. His 
wife, Mary, died in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Beverly Hills home, in Trousdale Estates, is being sold to Don Robinson, 
a realtor with Prudential Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills and an interior 
designer for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who just sold his three-acre Montecito estate to a partner in a 
stock brokerage firm for $3.4 million, bought Lazar's house to refurbish and 
call home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tired, but it has a beautiful floor plan," Robinson said. "He 
(Lazar) thought of everything when he built it in 1966. It has a large library, 
a breakfast room, a city view, and it's a nice size (5,400 square feet) for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Neumann of Prudential Rodeo has had the listing; Robinson is 
representing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Mets pitcher BRET SABERHAGEN has put his home in David Murdoch's 
gated Sherwood Country Club near Westlake Village on the market again, this 
time at just under $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Cy Young Award winner, who was raised in the San Fernando Valley, 
originally listed the 2.45-acre home a year ago at $3.95 million. He took it 
off of the market last fall and recently re-listed it. It was put up for sale 
as part of his divorce proceedings, sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen, who turned 30 last month, had a bad year last year in terms of 
injuries and other problems. Among his difficulties, he acknowledged 
responsibility for throwing a firecracker near a group of sports writers and 
spraying bleach onto a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 His home near Westlake Village has six bedrooms, a 17-seat movie theater, a 
gym and batting cage in 8,500 square feet. There is also a garage with a limo 
bay and wine cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Moran and Sigi Ulbrich of Bob Ely's Pavilions office, Westlake Village, 
share the listing.

ESTATE PLANNING HITS CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY LUKAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lukas is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Estate planning deals with two of life's major anxieties -- money and death -- 
which explains why many people avoid the subject until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the phrase may sound forbidding, or at least unfamiliar. And the topic 
doesn't crop up much at cocktail parties or back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 Estate planning is something you're more likely to think about after a major 
illness strikes a family member, a friend dies or you watch a grandchild get 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, estate planning simply means deciding in advance who gets which of 
your assets after you die and under what circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the right estate planning tools, such as trusts or partnerships, you can 
even give away some of your wealth to family, friends or charity while you're 
living. Some strategies offer tax breaks and income. Plus, these tools can save 
your heirs a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating an estate plan takes a lot of serious thinking about your assets and 
what to do with them, but the effort can bring peace of mind and a great sense 
of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Estate planning is particularly important for people who have owned Southern 
California real estate -- either their own home or rental property -- for a 
considerable length of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term appreciation, combined with a paid-off mortgage and other 
possessions (cars, jewelry, etc.), can push the value of their estate over the 
$600,000 lifetime exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal taxes on assets exceeding that individual exemption range from 37% to 
55%. (There are no estate taxes in California.) Congress has made periodic 
efforts to reduce the exemption, but no change is contemplated in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Without estate planning, legal experts point out, prospective heirs can be 
left with less than half of an estate's gross value, the balance going to the 
federal government. And don't forget all those debts that need to be settled 
after you die. The gross estate, the one you thought you were leaving, can drop 
dramatically without planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people think they've done enough planning. They'll point to a will or a 
living trust as evidence of their efforts. But these devices, valuable as they 
are, should only be a starting point for longtime owners of valuable Southland 
real estate, according to estate planning experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts are even urging individuals as young as 50 to take stock of 
their assets now, especially if they are wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Ballsun of West Los Angeles, an estate planning attorney for 17 years, 
suggests that "it's important to do something while you're young, rather than 
get to a point where you're desperate to make a decision that might be the 
wrong one." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Ken Wolf of Marina del Rey even goes so far as to suggest that 
"everyone should have an estate plan, especially if they have real property. 
It's important to look ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Century City estate planning attorney Jon J. Gallo sees the current depressed 
value of real estate as a "window of opportunity" for the next three years or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because property put into one of two irrevocable trusts discussed in 
this series goes in at its fair market value at the time of the transfer. 
Future appreciation of the property will escape taxation when the owner dies. 
So why not transfer it into the trust now, while its value is depressed? 
</P>
<P>
 For people whose home or rental property is a big part of their assets, 
experts recommend three time-tested estate planning tools: the qualified 
personal residence trust (QPRT); the charitable remainder trust (CRT) and the 
family limited partnership (FLIP). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite changes in tax laws since 1986, including the most recent legislation, 
these devices still pass IRS scrutiny, estate planners say. Each offers 
different benefits and imposes different requirements, and each will be 
considered in detail in this series. One -- or more -- of the strategies might 
work for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly, here's what each of these estate planning tools does: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) removes your home from your 
estate by passing it to your children (or a friend) during your lifetime while 
still allowing you to live there, although you will eventually have to pay 
rent. If you live in a highly appreciated home and want to remove it from your 
estate now, this popular technique could be for you. And, if you own a vacation 
home, you can create a separate QPRT for it as well. See accompanying story, 
K1. -- The charitable remainder trust (CRT) removes your home or rental 
property from your estate by allowing you to create a tax-exempt trust that 
offers you substantial tax breaks and income during your lifetime and 
distributes the remaining funds to the charity when you die. 
</P>
<P>
 Westwood residents Alan and Elaine Armer have accumulated $4.75-million worth 
of real estate during their 44-year marriage. With the guidance of an estate 
planning attorney, the Armers have created a CRT and have named Cal State 
Northridge's Radio, Film and Television Department and to Jewish Big Brothers 
of Los Angeles as recipients of the trust proceeds when they die. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll hear more about the CRT in Part 2 of this series, which will be 
published in the Real Estate section on May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The family limited partnership (FLIP) is a way of making gifts of real 
estate to children at deeply discounted prices. As long as the value of these 
gifts falls below the $600,000 lifetime exemption for each parent, the children 
will avoid gift taxes. A FLIP also serves to reduce the value of the estate 
when the parents die. The FLIP is the most sophisticated and expensive of 
estate planning techniques, and especially appropriate for families who own 
several pieces of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Sakharoff and his wife, Micheline, came to Southern California almost 
50 years to start their married life. Now the Sakharoffs, both 70, have assets 
estimated at $9 million -- much of it in real estate -- and they want to pass 
their wealth to their only daughter, as free from taxes as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish this, the couple used an attorney to set up a FLIP, which you'll 
more about in Part 3 of this series, which will be published on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Expert legal advice is essential to implement each of these estate planning 
strategies. They are much too complicated to tackle on your own. Even 
Berkeley's Nolo Press, publisher of self-help legal books, suggests using an 
attorney for sophisticated estate planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the QPRT and CRT are irrevocable, care must be taken when making 
estate planning decisions. "People must realize what's being gained and what's 
being given up," warned Edna R. S. Alvarez, a veteran Westside Los Angeles 
estate planning attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 She urges prospective clients to "look closely at family considerations, the 
irrevocability of the plan and the terms of the plan and not just at the 
potential tax savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why estate planning attorneys ask prospective clients: "Will you 
still be financially comfortable if you give this property away?" and "Will you 
be able to maintain your present lifestyle?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena attorney William Johnstone advises: "Don't talk about making gifts 
during your lifetime unless you're talking about surplus assets." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about people giving away (property) and then having to look to 
the kids for help," said veteran Beverly Hills estate planning attorney Ron 
Kabrins. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, maybe you've been thinking about creating an estate plan 
and have finally decided to do it. Then this series is for you. The popular 
qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) is explained in the accompanying 
story.

GIVE YOUR HOME TO THE KIDS, BUT STAY PUT

<P>
 Unlike many people, who give little or no thought to estate planning, Lorraine 
Sodaro has been paying attention to such affairs. And with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband of 40 years died suddenly of a massive heart attack in 1981, 
she was faced with an unexpectedly large federal tax on his estate. "It was 
terrible," she said in an interview in her desert home. "I never quite got over 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 With that bitter lesson in mind, she's been seeking ways to help her two 
children avoid a similar experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-year-old widow moved to the desert from Santa Monica five years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year she bought an $800,000 home in an Indian Wells community. She 
occupies her time with volunteer work, frequent visits with children and 
grandchildren and with travel. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also applied herself to planning her estate with a commitment that is 
rare among her friends, she said. "People don't want to talk about death, so 
they avoid making plans," Sodaro said. "They are comfortable talking about 
birth, but what's wrong with talking about death?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sodaro, with the help of an estate planning attorney (who experts agree are 
essential for a large or complicated estate), has employed a variety of 
techniques to guard her assets from the tax collector. A family limited 
partnership (topic of the third part of this series), plus trusts and annual 
tax-free gifts to her children are part of her arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 But the centerpiece of her estate planning is a qualified personal residence 
trust (QPRT), and she has put her Indian Wells home into it. The QPRT allows 
her to pass the home to her children during her lifetime, avoiding estate taxes 
on the property when she dies. 
</P>
<P>
 The QPRT is an irrevocable trust that allows you to give your home to anyone 
you choose, but to continue to live in it during the term of the trust. Sodaro 
chose to give her home to her children, but it could have been another family 
member or a friend. And, if you own a vacation home, you can create a separate 
QPRT for it as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how a QPRT works: 
</P>
<P>
 Using an attorney, you set up a trust and put your home into it for a specific 
period of time -- say 5, 10 or 15 years. Sodaro, for example, chose a 
seven-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 During that term, you live in the home, continue to pay all the bills 
(mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, etc.), and even sell it if you like -- 
a condition of the trust. (If you sell the home and buy another house, the new 
home goes into the trust.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, except for submitting a gift tax return the year you create the 
trust, it's almost as if nothing has changed. However, under the QPRT, 
something quite important has occurred: 
</P>
<P>
 By creating the trust you are considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be 
making a gift of the home at its current value -- not some future, appreciated 
value. And you are allowed to reduce that current worth by 1) the value of your 
right to live in the house and 2) your right to give it away by a will if you 
die before the QPRT term ends. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the actual dollar amount of these two reductions in value, the 
IRS publishes statistical tables that put specific values on your right to live 
in the house and on your right to give it away. The values are based on your 
age and life expectancy at the time the trust is created. Naturally, your 
health as well as age are major factors to consider when choosing the term. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is where the only significant risk of a QPRT exists: If you die 
before the term of the trust ends, all bets are off -- the home once again 
becomes part of your taxable estate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, should you survive the term, the home is transferred to whomever 
you're giving it to and your estate is reduced by the value of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the home has been transferred to the new owner, you have two choices: 
remain in the house and pay fair-market rent or move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Sodaro's friends are wary of renting from children. "They don't trust 
their children. I trust my children completely," she said. "I know they won't 
put me out once the house is theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 But any worry about being evicted can be eliminated, say legal experts. A 
properly drafted QPRT can give the donor an option to lease the house back when 
the trust ends and the ownership passes to the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Estate planners see the currently depressed value of California real estate as 
a real advantage for those considering a QPRT. The next three years are 
"choice," said attorney Jon J. Gallo of Century City. That's because any 
property going into a QPRT is valued at its current, depressed price, 
sheltering it from any appreciation that might occur during the term. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cost of a QPRT, some $500 worth of consultation time with an 
estate-planning attorney is probably necessary to determine if the trust is 
even appropriate for you. If it is, a tailor-made QPRT can range from $1,500 to 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Your accountant will charge about $150 to file the gift tax return; an 
attorney, on the other hand, is likely to charge $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it's best to pay off any remaining mortgage before putting the 
property into the trust. Additional expense is involved if you don't, because 
annual gift tax returns are required as the mortgage is paid down. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sodaro reflected on her estate-planning accomplishments of the past year, 
she observed, "I am very relieved. I feel I've done everything I possibly can 
(to minimize estate taxes), and nature can take care of the rest of it." How 
the QPRT Works 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a hypothetical example of how the qualified personal residence trust 
works: 
</P>
<P>
 You've got a $500,000 home to put into the trust. You're a healthy 65-year-old 
so you pick a 15-year term. (The longer the term, the smaller the gift to the 
children because you're living in the house longer, making the gift worth 
less.) 
</P>
<P>
 By consulting the IRS table that refers to your age and the 15-year term 
you've picked, your attorney tells you that your right to live in it for 15 
years is valued at $300,000. The table also values the right to give this house 
away by a will as worth $100,000. (These are two rights you retain in the 
trust.) The $100,000 remaining value of the house is considered a gift to your 
children or a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the IRS -- at least for the time being -- allows a $600,000 lifetime 
gift-tax exemption, all you need do is file a gift tax return that says you've 
made a $100,000 gift, which, of course, is well within the $600,000 lifetime 
exemption.

AT HOME: QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD IS FRIENDLY MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW HOMES; ARTESIA: 
INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR PERVADES ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY WHERE HOME PRICES ATTRACT 
NEW RESIDENTS.

<P>
 For Esperanza De Vega and Joann Fili, their search for a new home in a quiet 
neighborhood ended when they found their four-bedroom, three-bath home in 
Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about Artesia is it's developing," said Fili, 34, who manages 
a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant in Sunset Beach. "So you will see, if you go 
around this area, brand new houses and old houses." 
</P>
<P>
 The friends, both natives of the Philippines, bought their 1,800-square-foot 
house in August, 1993, for $225,000. De Vega, 33, and a controller for 
SnakClub, a packaging and manufacturing firm in Vernon, and Fili both 
immigrated from the Philippines in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women are the regular recipients of fruit and vegetables grown by 
their next-door neighbors, a retired Portuguese couple. "They are very 
hospitable," said Fili. "We Oriental people, we feel the same way. We are 
hospitable people, so I feel very secure and at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia is situated near the southeast edge of Los Angeles County, and its 
1.64 square miles are roughly bounded by the 91 Freeway on the north, South 
Street to the south, Cortner Avenue to the east, and Gridley Road to the west. 
The more than 15,000 residents are primarily blue-collar, largely Anglo and 
Latino, with growing numbers of Asians and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 House prices in Artesia range from $90,000 for a 600- or 700-square-foot house 
in an older neighborhood, to $750,000 and up for a huge five-bedroom custom 
home. The median price for a two-bedroom, one-bath house runs about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the people that are buying in Artesia are basically buying some of 
the older homes for land value," said Frank Lee, owner of Century 21 Center in 
Artesia. "In many cases they are tearing those down and building much larger 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what happened next door to Janet Paglia. A grocery checker for 
Alpha-Beta in Torrance, Paglia, 41, and her husband, Dave, bought their 1920s 
three-bedroom, one home in 1992 for $170,000. The 1,000-square-foot house has 
large front and back yards for their two young children to play in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this neighborhood, a lot of the people have knocked down their houses 
completely, and built big . . . houses," Paglia said. But she's not worried 
about Artesia's new development. "I think that a lot of the houses that were 
knocked down should have been knocked down," she said. "I think that's fine, 
because it improves the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the abundance of artesian wells in the area, Artesia was subdivided 
in 1875 by the Los Angeles Immigration and Land Cooperative Assn., formed by a 
group of local farmers. Countless small farms grew a variety of crops, 
including corn, alfalfa, feed and sugar beets. Vineyards thrived and the 
Artesia Winery Co. was established in 1900, but Prohibition soon put the winery 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture declined in the 1920s when the dairy industry began to grow. 
Portuguese immigrants came from Central California to work in what was then 
known as Dairy Valley, and by the 1930s, so had many Dutch immigrants from the 
Middle West. For nearly 30 years, the area was known as the Dairy Capital of 
the western United States, until the early 1970s, when rising real estate 
values tempted the dairies to sell to developers and the land was subdivided 
for housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime resident, Mary Barcelles, recalled the city in its early days. 
"We worked hard, walked to school a mile and a half, having crossed the dips 
filled with water, no drainage, no nothing." Barcelles' mother and father 
originally emigrated from the Azores to Central California in search of gold. 
Finding no gold, her father started a dairy, which he then brought to Artesia 
in the 1920s, along with his family, when Barcelles was a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father bought five acres at $600 an acre, and set up the dairy. The whole 
family worked the dairy, with Barcelles and her sisters and brothers milking 
cows and doing chores after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Barcelles' own two-bedroom, one-bath home was purchased from a local builder 
in the late 1950s for $10,000. She estimates she could sell the 
1,000-square-foot home today for about $175,000. And even though over the years 
Barcelles has watched the dairies go and the city grow, she isn't leaving 
Artesia any time soon. "I've really loved living in Artesia all my life," she 
said. "It's still a great, great city." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for Artesia's growth is the influx of overseas immigrants who have 
moved to the area over the past 20 years. This growing ethnic diversity is most 
evident in the businesses that line Pioneer Boulevard, the main drag through 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of an international community," said Richard Lee, son of realtor 
Frank Lee, and himself a commercial real estate broker. "If you drive the 
commercial district you'll see Chinese shops, Korean shops, Filipino shops, 
white shops, Indian shops. A little bit of everything, kind of a hodgepodge." 
</P>
<P>
 The Little India Chamber of Commerce, active for three years, represents the 
many small Indian businesses on Pioneer Boulevard, the commercial center 
catering to the more than 400,000 Asian Indians living in Southern California. 
"We have east, west, north, south, all the (Indian) communities are here," said 
Ravi Merchant, owner of Patel Brothers grocery store on Pioneer Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1960s, three Indian residents teamed up to sell hard-to-find 
Indian groceries and spices from their garages on weekends and to prepare 
home-cooked meals for Indians who missed their native foods. These weekend food 
fests quickly became a tradition for homesick Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are living here since 20 to 25 years said that they used to 
wait for the tradition on Saturday and Sunday," Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition grew, and when the dairies left the area, leaving empty shops, 
incentives were offered to rent the spaces along Pioneer, and more Indian 
merchants moved into the area. Today, Indian restaurants and Indian clothing, 
jewelry, music and video stores flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Indian merchants have been under fire from residents who object 
to a proposed sign on the 91 Freeway identifying Little India. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had Portuguese here for 80 years and Dutch here for 80 years," said 
Hank Grey, executive director for the Artesia Chamber of Commerce, "and 
nobody's ever tried to name (it) the Little Netherlands, or Little Portugal, or 
little anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we want to change the name of the city," said Ravi Merchant, 
"but we want to tell everybody that the Indian community is existing in the 
city of Artesia." 
</P>
<P>
 But before there was a Little India there was Hank's Coffee Shop on Pioneer 
Boulevard. Opened in 1959 by one of the original Dutch settlers, Henry Herrema, 
the diner was the social center of Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always bought his hamburgers and French fires," said Mary Barcelles. "I 
took my kids down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrema bought his first house as a newlywed in 1939 for $2,100. He now lives 
in a three-bedroom house he built 30 years ago, which he estimates is currently 
worth around $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrema, 73, retired 12 years ago, and has no plans for leaving Artesia. "I 
always think when people move out of town when they retire, they're making a 
mistake," he said, "cause they're leaving all their friends." At a Glance

YOUR MORTGAGE; 'NO-COST' LOAN CLAIMS COME UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's real estate regulatory agency, the Department of Real Estate 
(DRE), is cracking down on mortgage brokers who claim to offer "no-cost" and 
"no fee" loans. 
</P>
<P>
 According to DRE spokesman Pablo Wong, "advertising claims by brokers of 'no 
cost' or 'no fee' loans are patently misleading and are in violation of the 
State of California Business and Professional Code Section." That's because 
borrowers are actually paying a higher interest rate on the so called "no cost" 
loan in exchange for not having to pay fees or closing costs up front when the 
loan is secured. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what lenders claim, "there is no free lunch," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, when these types of ads first began to appear, the 
Sacramento-based regulatory agency fired off warnings to more than 100 mortgage 
brokers around the state who were making "no-cost" claims in their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually receive compliance when we contact these lenders," said Thomas L. 
Pool, deputy commissioner of the DRE. But "it is still a big problem," he said. 
This is in part because there are only three staff members at the DRE who are 
monitoring advertising practices. There are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 
licensed mortgage brokers in the state. The DRE doesn't know the exact number 
because real estate agents also broker loans and the license is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 With rising interest rates and a variety of new home loan packages, 
competition has heated up among lenders and mortgage brokers. They are 
scrambling to make loans at a time when the number of homeowners refinancing 
their old loans has plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to this competition, lenders devised the "premium loan" package. 
With these home loans, mortgage brokers are given a rebate from the bank or 
savings and loan that actually makes the loans. The rebate goes to pay the 
closing costs such as title insurance, escrow fees, appraisal and credit 
reports and the fee charged by the broker. But the loans come with a higher 
interest rate than the standard mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Premium loans are what prompted some brokers to advertise "no-cost" loans. But 
DRE officials say the loans come with a cost that may actually be more than a 
standard loan when the fees and closing costs are paid up front. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a purported "no cost" $200,000, 30-year fixed-rate loan with 
closing costs of $2,500 and a $2,750 commission to the mortgage broker would 
cause the monthly payments to go up $83.73 a month because of the higher 
interest rate. Using this example to make his case, Pool said this loan 
"represents an extra $30,142 in loan payments paid over the life of the loan -- 
how could you call that 'no cost' ". 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the true costs of such loans, Santa Ana accountant Steven R. 
Olmsted says that a more detailed analysis is necessary, which includes tax 
considerations and how long the borrower intends to keep the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 He analyzed several loan packages and concluded that people who hold their 
loans for less than five years would be better off financially with the 
purported "no cost" loan than the traditional mortgage where fees are paid up 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't reap the benefits of that reduced interest rate with a traditional 
loan until the sixth year," said Olmsted. "And keep in mind that most 
California homeowners keep their loans less than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why some mortgage brokers have criticized the DRE for interpreting the 
"no-cost" claims too narrowly. They argue that if the borrower pays nothing up 
front then indeed it is a "no cost" loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they worry that the DRE's regulatory actions may discourage people 
from taking advantage of this type of loan. For many borrowers, a loan that 
requires no out-of-pocket cash is very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the industry have no objection to what the DRE is doing. "It's 
important that borrowers know exactly what they are getting," said Ann Carlton 
Bose, president of the Los Angeles County chapter of the California Assn. of 
Mortgage Brokers. "There are real costs (with the no-cost loan) so why try to 
fool the consumer into thinking that there aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the DRE's Pool: "Of course, there will be circumstances where choosing 
the premium-priced loan product will be advantageous to the borrower, but the 
point is to make sure to not mischaracterize the loan in advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that some brokers fail to disclose exactly how the loan works. By 
law, the brokers are obligated to disclose that they have received a rebate 
because of the higher interest rate.

BATHROOM BUILDUP IS CALCIUM CARBONATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to bring to your attention an inaccuracy that occurred in the 
April 24 Real Estate section, "That Crusty Bathroom Scum Is Actually a Buildup 
of Lime." In it, it is stated that the scale or lime building up in bathrooms 
and kitchens is calcium oxide.This is incorrect. Calcium oxide is very reactive 
and very caustic. It reacts vigorously with water, and will dissolve without 
too much effort. The scale or lime that builds up in bathrooms is calcium 
carbonate, which is not soluble, but is also not at all dangerous. The 
confusion probably comes because calcium carbonate is often called limestone, 
while calcium oxide is often referred to as quicklime, and both are often 
shortened to lime.

NOTARY TELLS WAYS TO AVOID CONTRACT SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The series on the pitfalls of re-roofing ("Top Secrets," "In Over Your Head?") 
was a valuable public service. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be brought to the attention of your readers that roofing rip-offs 
are but one of a panoply of home-improvement scams that homeowners should guard 
against. In the most pernicious of these frauds, the homeowner will be tricked 
into signing a contract that places a lien on the property and could result in 
loss of the home. The clause with the lien may not have been read because it 
was folded under the salesman's clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes an unscrupulous contractor will ask the homeowner to sign an 
estimate that turns out to be a deed of trust. This deed will then be 
"notarized" out of the presence of the signer, a serious violation of law. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the National Notary Assn., a nonprofit educational organization 
serving the nation's 4.5 million notaries, I would like to offer your readers 
some pointers to avoid such scams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's best not to sign any estimate or contract in the presence of the 
contractor or salesperson, especially if pressure is being applied. Insist that 
the document be left overnight so that you can study it. If you can't 
understand the document, don't sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If anyone tries to sell you anything in your home that costs $25 or more, 
you have three days after signing to change your mind. But there is no 
three-day protection if you had sought out the seller and arranged the purchase 
at his place of business. If you want to get out of a deal before three days, 
take a witness with you to the seller's place of business. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid whenever possible using the home as collateral for repairs. Remember 
that a lien may only be created on objects permanently affixed to the property. 
No lien may be taken on such removables as water filters, satellite dishes, 
drapes and carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these precautions are of no use in the cruel scams in which, 
without the presence or knowledge of the homeowner, phony deeds are created, 
forged and notarized using a stolen or counterfeit notary seal. Such bogus 
deeds may be sold or used as collateral for a loan that the con artist has no 
intention of repaying. As a result, the homeowner may lose the property or have 
to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees to recover its title. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson has authored legislation that now requires signers of 
deeds for property in Los Angeles County to leave a right thumbprint in the 
notary's journal. This simplifies the victimized homeowner's task in clearing 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of that legislation is just now being implemented: The Los 
Angeles County recorder will start informing property owners of any deeds or 
liens filed affecting their property. This will prevent tragedies in which the 
homeowner learns about a phony deed on the very eve of foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fingerprinting requirement is only a three-year pilot program 
that will end on Dec. 31, 1995. Every homeowner should urge the Legislature to 
make this valuable program permanent and statewide. Further, if the Legislature 
requires not only the notary's journal but also the deed itself to bear the 
signer's fingerprint, countless frauds would be prevented or readily revealed.

READERS STAY ON TOP OF RE-ROOFING ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your very informative articles about re-roofing, you stressed the 
importance of being specific about the type of roofing to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have also advised being specific about the quality and method of 
laying down the underlay (sometimes called "felt" -- laymen call it tar paper). 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, we replaced our worn-out wood-shake shingle roof with CalShake 
(a lightweight synthetic fibrated concrete tile). We did a lot of homework and 
chose this material because we liked its rustic "shake" look, its longevity and 
light weight and especially because it is fireproof. 
</P>
<P>
 The roofer removed the old roof (neatly, actually!) but did not immediately 
replace it with the underlay. Later we found that this is standard procedure 
with qualified roofers. Our roofer started underlaying and re-roofing at the 
same time (it's cheaper), when an unexpected late summer rainstorm hit. Since 
only one-fourth of the house was re-roofed, and there was not time to tent (as 
per contract), we suffered considerable interior damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the end of the story. The six-year drought gave us unexpected 
reprieve from another problem, which showed up dramatically in last year's 
heavy spring rains. The roof started to leak like a sieve. 
</P>
<P>
 An expensive roof, expected to last many years, should not fall apart in 10 
years. We called many roof repairers and all agreed that the original roofer 
had saved a few bucks by using an inferior, thin, less-expensive felt (the 
quality of which was not specified in the contract) that has dried out and is 
disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
 So warn your readers: Specify and get a guarantee for good quality underlaying 
material and insist this be installed immediately after removing the old roof.

 The recent series of articles on re-roofing was balanced and informative. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular we compliment the general theme of the series encouraging 
consumers to take responsibility in the process of buying a new roof. That roof 
over their heads is responsible for protecting then entire structure including 
contents, and the selection of the contractor to put that roof on should 
reflect the importance of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 We would like to offer your readers one additional, local source of 
information for roofing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roofing Contractors Assn. of Southern California (RCA) has been serving 
the area since 1940. Our professional staff can assist callers in need of 
technical information as well a providing resource material. RCA also offers a 
contractor referral service as well as a free copy of our brochure "Why Should 
I Hire a Licensed Roofing Contractor?" Callers can reach RCA at (818) 579-1276.

 It was a surprise to note that roofing slate was completely left out of your 
article. 
</P>
<P>
 Roofing slate has been used all over the world for many centuries. It is 
probably the oldest and most time-tested of all roofing materials. Besides the 
very durable nature of slate, it is also very competitive in price and in fact 
the price is in line with all other materials and prices you have indicated. 
Slate is the answer to most of the roofing-related problems you have addressed 
-- fire class, durability, variety, weight and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Slate is the most widely used roofing material in the cold climates and 
particularly in New York and the New England states. In Europe, half of all 
roofing is done in slate. 
</P>
<P>
 California has been influenced a lot by the Mexican clay tiles, wood shingles 
and other man-made products. Slate was never available to the West Coast, due 
to the prohibitive cost of transportation. However, this has changed in the 
last decade, and California is going to see an explosion in the use of natural 
slate for roofing in the next couple of years. Today, roofing slate is 
available to customers at under $200 per roofing square, in more than 10 
natural colors.

IN THE GARDEN: PLANTING GERANIUMS? GET THE GENUINE ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's as close to a gardening craze as you're likely to find, this sudden 
interest in genuine geraniums. Virtually unknown in Southern California, and 
seldom seen until a few years ago, avid gardeners are talking about them, and 
nurseries seem to have a new kind every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the flavor of the month" is how Robin Parer, who runs a geranium-only 
nursery in Northern California, explains their sudden popularity. She's had 
many Southern Californians make the trek north to buy plants at her nursery, 
Geraniaceae (open only by appointment, call (415) 461-4168, no mail order). 
</P>
<P>
 True geraniums -- plants with the botanical name of Geranium -- are quite 
different from what we commonly call "geraniums." 
</P>
<P>
 The pretenders, the Martha Washington, ivy, zonal and common "geraniums," are 
technically pelargoniums and are native to Africa, while the true geraniums are 
found growing in the wild worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion over names began in 1753 when botanist Carolus Linnaeus lumped 
the two together as Geranium in his "Species Plantarum." When later botanists 
noted the obvious differences (one is that geraniums have symmetrical flowers 
while pelargoniums have asymmetrical), they separated them into Pelargonium and 
Geranium , though they are still in the family. But the damage was done and 
persists to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is hard to beat a pelargonium, especially in a pot, the genuine 
geraniums also have their place in the California garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The place for the most commonly available, Geranium incanum, is unquestionably 
on slopes or in planters, where it can tumble and spill, if you listen to 
landscape architect Jana Ruzicka. 
</P>
<P>
 She used it as a water-thrifty ground cover in a Corona del Mar garden just 
blocks from the seaside bluffs, where they swirl and foam around other plants 
-- a 'Gruss an Teplitz' rose, sea statice, Santa Barbara daisies, tulhbagia and 
valerian. 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby condominium, they bubble out of a planter box on a balcony 
railing. In the misty ocean air, the flowers are especially vibrant, though 
they look nearly as good in the garden of Anne Williams in much drier (and 
hotter) Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has grown all of the true geraniums she can lay her hands on, though 
it is only a fraction of what's out there. They are numerous enough to have 
inspired books on them alone (two of the best are "Hardy Geraniums" and "The 
Gardener's Guide to Growing Hardy Geraniums," both English, though available 
here from Timber Press; for information, call (800) 327-5680). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the true geraniums are small plants with smallish flowers. They are 
almost wildflowers, and in fact, many are, including one named G. californicum 
that grows in the San Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Most have a brief, springtime flowering period. On the other hand, they have 
virtually no problems with pests or diseases and many will flower in some 
shade, definite pluses. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect the punch of a pelargonium, these are what Parer calls 
"linking, filler plants," best used in that space between other bolder plants 
in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 G. sanguineum tops Williams' list of personal favorites because it's so easy 
to grow. It finds its own place among other low plants, interweaving with them 
-- a perfect filler along a path or in the front row of a flower garden. It 
almost disappears for the winter, but from early spring on, there is a steady 
succession of nearly neon flowers, a shade of magenta purple. 
</P>
<P>
 One variety, lancastrense , has soft pink flowers for gardeners who are less 
gutsy with color, and it stays as a small spreading mat only inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams thinks the place for geraniums is in front of or even under roses 
because they can take the watering roses get and a smattering of shade, and 
they help hide the rose's knobby knees. 
</P>
<P>
 G. macrorrhizum is her favorite for this use, a dense foot-tall ground cover 
with flowers held well aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape designer Christine Rosmini has found that it even flowers in a 
half-day of shade. She has used it as a small-scale ground cover under tall 
trees in a number of gardens. Parer says it will grow under oaks with little 
water (important for the health of the oaks) and that deer don't eat it. There 
are several kinds, with white, pink or deep rose flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams doesn't recommend the English favorite named 'Ballerina,' which has 
elegant veining on the flowers, but prefers the similar 'Lawrence Flatman,' 
which does fine in our climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Others that have thrived in her garden include G. endressii 'Wargrave Pink,' 
the hybrids 'Claridge Druce' and 'Biokovo,' and the pearl-gray blue of 'Mrs. 
Kimball Clark.' 
</P>
<P>
 'Biokovo,' in particular, seems to be a winner in Southern California. The 
flowers are a very soft pink, about an inch across and there are lots of them. 
In one Westside garden it blooms furiously from March into June, with a 
smattering of flowers through summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Parer says that 'Claridge Druce' will stand the heat of the Central Valley, 
and if the true geraniums are sensitive to anything, it is summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some true geraniums come very close to true blue, a color gardeners are always 
searching for. England's 'Johnson's Blue' is the purest (though not as blue as 
some catalogue photos would have you believe), but it's a poor grower in most 
gardens here. Williams has lost it several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Better suited to our climate is G. pratense , which grows to two feet or more 
with near blue flowers. Parer thinks it does best when it's roots are kept 
cool, similar to clematis. It goes completely dormant in winter, so mark its 
place in the garden or you'll dig it out come bulb planting time. 
</P>
<P>
 A more intense blue is found on G. ibericum . It too disappears for the 
winter. Less blue (more violet), but equally easy, is G. magnificum , a bushy 
perennial 18 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 G. maderense has its place staked out in the shade. It quickly forms a burly 
trunk, several feet tall, typical of many plants from the Madeira Islands. The 
dramatic foot-wide leaves look like green paper snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of years in the garden, this biennial produces a single huge 
head, 2 1/2-feet wide, of small pink flowers. It then dies, although it usually 
reseeds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unusual plant and won't be found in the 1,290 pages of Hortus, the 
ultimate plant dictionary, nor, for that matter, at too many nurseries, but it 
and many genuine geraniums are out there, waiting for their place in the 
California garden.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * There are lots of vegetables now for transplanting -- check them out at your 
local nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prune your spring flowering shrubs (weigelia, spireas, lilac, etc.) to 
encourage new growth, which will bear flowers next year. Remember you can prune 
them while they are in bloom with the advantage of using cut branches for 
arrangements indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider setting out several varieties of herbs in your garden -- many are 
tolerant of heat and drought, and all enhance the flavor of food.

APARTMENT LIFE: STEPS TO TAKE TO EVICT LODGER FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the AAGLA, an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in Manhattan Beach and I rent out a room in my house to a 
lodger. What are my rights and duties when I want to evict the lodger? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: When there is only one lodger in an owner-occupied dwelling, you need 
only give the lodger a notice to vacate of the same duration as the tenancy. He 
can do the same to terminate the tenancy. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if the tenancy is weekly a one-week notice to vacate is 
sufficient. If the tenancy is monthly, a 30-day notice is required. The manner 
of rent payment, weekly or monthly, generally sets the tenancy's duration. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lodger doesn't leave after the notice expires, he is considered a 
trespasser and may be removed by the local police department. Remember, this 
remedy only applies to lodgers in owner-occupied dwellings where there is only 
one lodger/tenant. Tenant Changes Mind on When to Move Out 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in Palm Desert and I also rent out some apartments there. Recently, 
I had a problem with one of my renters and I'm hoping you can help me solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenant A gives a 30-day notice of his intention to vacate the premises. Tenant 
B, another of my renters, says he'll take A's apartment at $50 more rent. I 
advertise tenant B's apartment at $50 higher rent, but get no firm takers on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before move-out time Tenant A says he can't move out for at least 
another 30 days. I believe Tenant A is responsible for the $50 rent increase 
and the cost of my advertising of Tenant B's apartment. Do you concur? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to Trevor Grimm, general counsel, Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles (AAGLA): "I concur." Grimm said that the renter did not have the right 
to rescind the notice unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Tenant A's action (or inaction), you are entitled to damages, 
meaning the added $50 (market value) rent and the cost of the advertising for 
the lost month. 
</P>
<P>
 You should ask the renter for the money. If he doesn't pay, you can sue in 
Small Claims Court to try to recover it. Cancellation Law Doesn't Include 
Rentals 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A couple of months ago, the lease expired on my Los Angeles apartment. I 
signed a one-year lease at another apartment and the next day I paid the 
apartment manager the first month's rent and the security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I realized that this was not the apartment for me. I would never 
be happy in this place. The next morning, less than 24 hours after paying the 
rent and deposit, I went to the manager and asked if I could cancel the lease 
and get my money refunded. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she had already given the money order to the owner and there was 
nothing she could do about it. I called the landlord and pleaded with him to 
let me out of the lease but he said no. 
</P>
<P>
 I called a local renters' rights group and they told me that under California 
state law I had a three-day grace period in which to cancel any kind of 
contract. Another organization gave me similar information but could not 
officially confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on these comments, I sent the manager a certified letter explaining that 
I did not want the apartment while apprising him of the three-day grace period 
for cancellation of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord said he has never heard of such a law and refuses to refund the 
rent. He offered to let us give a 30-day notice and not be obligated for any 
rent after that time. He also said that if he rented the apartment within the 
30 days that I would get a prorated refund of rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the apartment did not rent during the 30 days. We have been 
refunded the amount of the security deposit, but we are wondering about the 
rent. Was the landlord right in what he did or can we get our money back? Is 
there such a law in California that allows one to cancel this type of contract 
within three days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: While there is a law in California that allows you to cancel certain 
contracts within three days, like contracts for aluminum siding, it does not 
apply to leases of real property. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord had the right to keep the rent and the obligation to refund the 
deposit. Had he re-rented the unit within the 30 days, the law requires that he 
refund you the prorated rent. 
</P>
<P>
 For your information, the landlord could have held you liable for the rent 
until he re-rented the property for up to the full term of the year's lease, 
assuming he made good faith efforts to rent the unit out. Never sign a lease 
until you are absolutely sure you will be happy in the apartment. How Can Owner 
Collect Late Payment Fee? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a rental property located in Hermosa Beach and I have a problem. It 
is written into the rental agreement that the renters will pay a 5% late fee, 
about $75, when they don't pay the rent on time, but they won't pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Can I deduct the late payment from the security deposit? If not, what are my 
options besides eviction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Since the late charge is written into the rental agreement, the renters are 
violating it when they don't pay. The remedy for that is eviction, which 
doesn't help you. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rent charge is labeled "additional rent" in the lease or rental 
agreement you may deduct the charges from the security deposit as unpaid rent. 
Your other option is to recover it in Small Claims Court.

CHOOSE VERSATILE VINE TO ACCENT THE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter what the situation is in your garden -- sun, shade, wet or dry -- 
there is a vine for you. What can be more pleasurable than sitting in a cool 
shady arbor on a hot summer's day and enjoying the beauty of flowering vines. 
They are well worth any efforts needed to grow and train them. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen of these vines is probably the deciduous Clematis. The large 
flowered (to 10 inches) varieties are available in colors from yellow to pink, 
purple or red. They are a little particular about having cool, moist roots once 
established, but the blooms are gorgeous. Evergreen Clematis ( C. armadii ) 
with its spring blanket of fragrant white star flowers is just as lovely. These 
are only two of the 40 or 50 varieties known, so don't feel restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also many jasmines to consider. Everyone knows the good old Star 
Jasmine, which takes part of its name from its jasmine-like fragrance, but how 
about the Primrose Jasmine, ( Jasmine mesyni ) with yellow flowers all summer 
and fall. Spanish Jasmine ( j. grandiflorum ) has fragrant little white flowers 
in the spring. These last vines are three true members of the Jasmine genus and 
are sure to please. 
</P>
<P>
 Another vine with a similar name is the Carolina Jessamine, which blooms in 
the spring with yellow trumpet flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer one of the more vigorous vines available, the trumpet vine 
family is a good choice and there are several varieties that will give you 
trumpet-shaped flowers in various colors -- violet, red or orange. 
</P>
<P>
 While it will take the heat and drought once established, it is still very 
fast growing; so give it plenty of room and a very strong support, but avoid 
using the side of a building for this vine. This need for good support also 
applies to beautiful wisterias, which can put out so much growth that skimpy 
trellises can break beneath their weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as vigorous as the two above, but appearing much more delicate is the 
Sliver Lacevine ( Polygonum autbertii ). Its foamy masses of white flowers 
cover the plant all summer. This one is especially beautiful cascading down a 
masonry wall and can cover 100 feet in a season. We have mentioned only a few 
of the flowering vines available to you. See your local nurseryman and explore 
the other choices available to you.

ESTATE-PLANNING TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY LUKAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gross estate -- Everything a person owns at the time of death including 
property transferred to a revocable trust. If the gross estate is more than 
$600,000, an estate tax return must be filed even if no taxes are owed.  
</P>
<P>
 Taxable estate -- This is your gross estate (see above) less all deductions -- 
debts, mortgages and/or the value of property passing to charity or a surviving 
trust. If your taxable estate is more than $600,000, you owe Uncle Sam an 
estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Probate Estate -- Everything a person owns at the time of death, except 
property that has been transferred to a revocable or irrevocable Trust. If that 
sum is less than $600,000, no probate is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Real Property -- Land or property permanently attached to land, such as a 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal Property -- Movable stuff such as furniture, automobiles, jewelry, 
VCRs and computers, plus intangibles such as securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust -- A legal arrangement by which a person (called the trustor, settlor or 
grantor) transfers legal title to certain of his or her property to an 
individual or institution, called the trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee -- The individual or institution that manages a trust for a third 
party, called the beneficiary, according to the written trust agreement. The 
trustee also may be a beneficiary. The trustor may act as the trustee during 
his or her lifetime. You can always be the trustee of your own revocable trust. 
You can also be the trustee of some types of irrevocable trusts, but not of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Irrevocable trust -- A trust whose terms cannot be changed in any way. You'd 
better be sure of its contents before you sign on that dotted line. Such a 
trust is used to make gifts or transfer property. 
</P>
<P>
 Revocable trust -- A trust whose terms can be changed or even revoked at any 
time by the trustor while he or she is living. Usually called a living trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The living trust is used as a will substitute and to avoid probate costs, 
which is why it has grown so popular during the past decade. Probate costs for 
an estate of $1 million can amount to more than $40,000 in California. The 
expense and length of time it takes to settle an estate -- often more than a 
year -- are considered two of probate's major disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Testamentary trust -- This trust comes into being only after the death of the 
person whose will creates it. The will must be probated to the bring the trust 
into existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Will -- A written document that disposes of the real and personal property in 
your estate. It is generally prepared and executed with the assistance of an 
attorney and has no legal effect until you die. 
</P>
<P>
 Holographic will -- One that is written in a person's own handwriting. In 
California, it need not be witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal will -- One that is typed or printed, with appropriate spaces to fill 
in. It requires two witnesses. A will form can be obtained at an office supply 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour-over will -- The pour-over will is a will that leaves assets to the 
trustee of a pre-existing trust. It is a companion document to the living 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Living will -- A living will is not a will at all. Rather, it's the name given 
to the written directive to your physician authorizing him/her to take you off 
life-support systems. BETTY LUKAS

 I was raised with traditional values and taught that good credit is essential 
to good character. Until age 50 I was never a day late on any payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I am facing foreclosure. My character has not changed but my income 
dropped 50%. Five years ago my home appraised for $350,000 and I qualified for 
a $280,000 loan. Today my loan balance is $275,000 and my home is worth, maybe, 
$235,000. 
</P>
<P>
 My lender rejected my request for a discount of my loan balance. But if I were 
to sell my house to avoid foreclosure, the lender might give the purchaser a 
big discount on the loan payoff under a "short sale." Lenders often take a 
$50,000 to $100,000 hit on this practice. 
</P>
<P>
 My family has been living in our home for six years. We love our house, feel 
safe in the neighborhood and appreciate having good schools for our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't it make more sense for a family to stay in their home, providing that 
the family suffering from a hardship can make the same payments after the 
reduction, than for a new buyer, on a short sale, to benefit at the family's 
expense? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that blocked an attempt of a 
Florida homeowner to force a lender to discount their loan as this would 
compromise the integrity of the lending industry. Lenders would be reluctant to 
loan money if the courts could force a discount, the high court said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an outrageous practice on the part of banks and S&Ls that families get 
tossed on the street while "short-sale" buyers get the discount that should go 
to the family in hardship cases.

REFLECTIONS ON THE BODENSEE; PART GERMAN, PART SWISS AND RIMMED WITH MEDIEVAL 
TOWNS, ANTIQUE HOTELS AND BUCOLIC COUNTRYSIDE, THE BODENSEE IS A VAST INLAND 
'SEA' VIRTUALLY UNDISCOVERED BY AMERICANS

<P>
 The Bodensee, also known as Lake Constance, has been described as Europe's 
inland sea, and this impression is particularly strong at night when a gusting 
southeast wind from the Alps churns up the waters and a heavy mist obscures the 
opposite shore. Forty-six miles long and an hour northeast of Zurich, the 
Bodensee is an immense, moody lake with a checkered past and a placid, 
prosperous present. 
</P>
<P>
 All around its perimeter are undulating landscapes of orchards, vineyards, 
forest and marshland, punctuated by imposing castles, monasteries and ancient 
towns. Every few miles the coastline changes character, both physically and 
politically. The southern shore belongs to Switzerland, the northern shore to 
Germany and a tiny segment of the eastern shore to Austria. Circling the lake 
on the impeccably maintained roads involves passing through customs checkpoints 
at least three times. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend and I made the circuit in a gleaming, claret-colored Mercedes 190, 
picked up at Zurich's Kloten airport. We had reserved a full-size Renault 25 
before we left the States and gotten a special rate for cars reserved ahead of 
time -- about $550 for the week, with unlimited mileage, a fee that would have 
more than doubled if we had waited to rent the car in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rental counter, the genial young agent said that a Mercedes 190, a car 
above our category and expectations, had been returned early, and asked if we 
would prefer that to our Renault, for the same price. Within 20 minutes, 
ensconced in our Mercedes, we were cruising up Highway N1, heading for 
Gottlieben, Switzerland, our first stop, and a week of exploring the banks of 
the Bodensee. 
</P>
<P>
 These days there is no problem waltzing across the borders from one country to 
the next, but during World War II all the borders were closed, and this small, 
intimate, cohesive region was like a house divided. Families were separated, 
courtships and friendships interrupted. The waters themselves became the only 
conduit for escape, and there are many stories of German refugees swimming 
across the lake, ducking Nazi patrol boats to attain safe haven, however 
briefly, in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleak war years are a haunting memory half a century old now, and the lake 
district has long since resumed its role as a popular, centrally located 
European resort. Although this area was once an international crossroads on the 
north-south and east-west trade routes of the Holy Roman Empire -- and later 
enjoyed a brief flowering of French tourism when Queen Hortense and her son, 
Napoleon III, resided here in the mid-19th Century -- today's visitors are 95% 
German-speaking. For Americans, as well as for most of the non-Alemannic world, 
the Bodensee, with its rich lode of baroque churches, medieval towns and 
antique hotels, remains virtually unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakeside region where Hortense de Beauharnais Bonaparte settled in 1820, 
on the far western portion of the Swiss coast, is one of the culturally richest 
and most scenic areas of the Bodensee, and would make a fine starting point for 
anyone visiting the area for the first time. Here the lake is squeezed into a 
smaller pocket of water called the Untersee, or Lower Lake, by a large 
peninsula of German land, which also creates a second pocket of water called 
the Uberlingenerzee -- Uberlingen Lake -- to the north. The Untersee, 
stretching west, becomes narrower and narrower until it becomes the Rhine 
river, once again. (The Bodensee is actually a huge basin of Rhine water, 
filled by the river from an inlet at the east end of the lake, between the 
Austrian town of Bregenz and the Swiss town of Rheineck, and emptying through 
the Untersee.)  
</P>
<P>
 Hortense, the wife of Napoleon's brother Louis, who became the King of 
Holland, was captivated by the beauty and calm of a run-down chateau called the 
Schloss Arenenberg, high on a hill and surrounded by vineyards above the 
village of Ermatingen. The chateau is today the Napoleon Museum, the perfectly 
preserved and impeccably maintained home of Napoleon III, who lived there first 
with his mother and later with his wife, the Empress Eugenie, who redecorated 
some of the interior.  
</P>
<P>
 Ermatingen is one of several pretty lakeside towns on the banks of the 
Untersee, each a cluster of antique gabled houses with lavishly frescoed 
facades. The most striking of this medieval string of hamlets is the 
picture-book Swiss town of Stein am Rhein, which looks like the setting of a 
fairy-tale. Elaborate frescoes portraying battles, legends and love affairs 
cover the facades of many houses, some of whose foundations actually descend 
into the Rhine. The houses are further distinguished by oriel windows -- 
intricately carved, loggia-style extensions of the facades capped with their 
own tiny roofs. Many cafes ring the town's Rathausplatz, or Town Hall Square, 
where you can sit and absorb the amazing architectural artistry of this quaint 
town dating back almost a thousand years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake ends and the Rhine begins just east of Stein am Rhein, but if you 
visit this old bourg just before lunch or late in the afternoon, and you fancy 
a meal that is both superb and pricey, consider heading just a few more miles 
west afterward to Schaffhausen and an extraordinary restaurant called the 
Fischerzunft. Owned by Swiss chef Andre Jaeger and his Chinese wife, Doreen, 
the Fischerzunft is a handsomely restored former fisherman's guild house built 
on the banks of the Rhine in the 14th Century. Jaeger's unique dishes, a 
sophisticated blend of Asian and nouvelle French cuisine, are hardly 
representative of regional cooking, but they are an exquisite aberration not to 
be missed if you are anywhere in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more modest and traditional meal, a pleasant choice is the Seehotel 
Schiff in the town of Mannenbach, between Ermatingen and Stein am Rhein. Modern 
and pristine, the Schiff, owned by the Union Bank of Switzerland and operated 
as an extension of its posh management training center in the nearby Castle 
Wolfsberg, serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a blond-wood dining room with 
water views. The menu offers fresh fish from the lake -- perch and whitefish -- 
crisply sauteed, wiener schnitzel and homemade noodles, crisp mixed-greens 
salads and freshly baked pastries. The Schiff has 18 businesslike, paneled 
hotel rooms, but a more memorable choice for an overnight would be one of the 
area's small, antique hostelries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these is the old Hotel Krone in the tiny hamlet of Gottlieben, a 
community full of pretty houses, two other antique hotels -- the Drachenburg 
and the Waaghus -- and virtually no commercial center. The Krone is set just 
steps from the water. Built at the end of the 17th Century and renovated over 
the last six years by owners George and Ingeborg Schraner-Michaeli, the 24 
cheerful rooms have pastel-hued floral bedspreads and curtains, airy down 
duvets and modern tiled bathrooms equipped with deep porcelain tubs and 
powerful hair dryers. In warm weather, lunch and dinner are served outside on 
the waterside terrace, brightened by tubs of red geraniums. From the Krone you 
can explore all the towns to the Untersee and the Rhine, moving west, as well 
as the handsome city of Konstanz, a German enclave almost entirely within 
Switzerland, to the east (and the town which gave the Bodensee its alternative, 
English name). Because of its remarkable location, niched next to the Swiss 
shoreline, Konstanz was spared the devastating Allied bombing that leveled 
parts of many other German cities at the end of the war. The Old Town of 
Konstanz is a time capsule of 14th- and 15th-Century houses and buildings 
dominated by a beautifully frescoed Rathaus, or Town Hall, once the guild house 
of linen weavers and remodeled in the Florentine Renaissance style at the end 
of the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In good weather, save time for a stroll over the Rheinbrucke, the Rhine 
Bridge, and along the broad, mansion-lined Promenade following the curve of the 
Seestrasse. Set off on its own small island, just before the Rhine Bridge, is 
the dramatic, luxurious Steigenberger Inselhotel, a large, resort-style 
establishment that was once a Dominican monastery, founded in 1235. The 
magnificent central cloisters are worth a visit in themselves. The Insel, with 
its private swimming club, gracious cocktail terrace and refined Old World 
rooms is a choice place to stay when you are primed for a "grand hotel" 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the west of Konstanz, in the center of the Untersee, is the small German 
island of Reichenau, which, during the Middle Ages was one of Europe's most 
important spiritual centers. Accessible by excursion boat (many departures from 
Konstanz harbor), the island's main attractions are three of the oldest 
churches in Germany, including a Romanesque basilica in the village of 
Niederzell. 
</P>
<P>
 Attached to Konstanz on its eastern flank like a Siamese twin is the smaller 
and less appealing Swiss city of Kreuzlingen. Like Konstanz, Kreuzlingen (named 
for a piece of the cross brought back to the region from the Crusades in the 
10th Century) is a point of embarkation for the lake and river steamers that 
cruise the waters of the Bodensee and the Rhine. As a destination in itself, 
Kreuzlingen offers little apart from St. Ulrich's, an impressive baroque 
basilica. Most of the Bodensee's Swiss coast, in fact, is somewhat of a 
disappointment after the cultural depth and physical appeal of Konstanz and the 
shores of the Untersee. 
</P>
<P>
 The best plan is to drive southeast along the lake, past the towns of 
Romanshorn and Arbon, and head directly for historic St. Gallen, about 10 miles 
inland from the lake but worth the detour. If the hour is appropriate, stop for 
a light lunch at the Hotel Bad Horn in the little fishing village of Horn, just 
after Arbon, then head to Rorschach where you will see signs indicating turns 
for St. Gallen. Fifteen minutes later you will enter one of the least-known, 
formerly great old cities of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Gallen was founded in 612 by Gallus, an itinerant Irish monk who tripped 
into a briar patch near where the city now stands and took it as a sign from 
God to stay. By the 10th Century St. Gallen's monastery rivaled Reichenau as 
one of Europe's most important intellectual and spiritual centers. St. Gallen 
was also known, from the Middle Ages on, for its textiles -- first for the 
linens woven in the monastery workrooms, which were prized throughout Europe, 
and later, in the 18th and 19th centuries for its embroidered cottons and lace. 
St. Gallen is still one of the most important -- some say the most important -- 
embroidery centers in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 If one has only one sight to see in St. Gallen, however, it must be the 
remarkable Stiftsbibliotek, or Abbey Library, in the center of the Old Town. A 
baroque masterwork, the Abbey Library was completed in 1767 within the enclave 
of the former monastery. The inlaid wood shelves of walnut and cherry, 
buttressed by gleaming wood columns with gilded capitals hold 130,000 rare 
antiquarian volumes. Visitors to the library must don huge felt slippers over 
their shoes before they are allowed to traverse the room's precious wood 
parquet floors, inlaid with tall, stylized starbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 To give St. Gallen its due, a full day is really necessary. If you want to 
stay overnight, the best hotel in town is the Einstein, a contemporary, first 
class establishment lodged in a former embroidery factory. A number of small 
restaurants offer traditional Swiss fare in the antique buildings of the Old 
Town. An alternative for a festive, but not inexpensive meal is a 15-minute 
drive out of town in the village of Lommerswill at Thuri's Blumenau, newly 
opened in a pretty, old village house. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing on around the lake (from St. Gallen follow signs for St. 
Margrethen), the road leads to the Austrian border, through the town of Bregenz 
and then almost immediately to the German border.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after leaving Bregenz, and Austria, which you can finesse in about 25 
minutes, the lake drive leads directly to the German shore and lovely Lindau, 
an ancient walled city self-contained on a small island just offshore and 
accessible by two bridges. Once a rich, imperial town in the Middle Ages, 
Lindau today is a wealthy resort area with lingering Gothic and baroque 
character. Here you could settle in for two or three stressless days at the 
finest place in town, the esteemed Hotel Bad Schachen. An elegant dowager that 
has been freshened and refurbished without losing its Old World class, the Bad 
Schachen is a beautifully equipped, castle-like complex on the shore opposite 
the town of Lindau proper, with 130 rooms and suites, most with balconies 
overlooking the lake. The Bad Schachen's swimming pavilion, built in 1929 for 
bathing in the lake, was enhanced with a large outdoor swimming pool in 1964.  
</P>
<P>
 The terrace breakfast buffet at the Bad Schachen is sumptuous. The long buffet 
table is laid with yogurts, fresh berries, cereals, butters, homemade jams, 
trays of assorted cold meats, cheeses, baskets of pastries and rolls, cutting 
boards holding fresh loaves of multi-grain country breads, and a chicken-shaped 
straw basket within which nestle a brood of warm hard-boiled eggs. After this 
fulfilling breakfast, you can arrange at the front desk to rent a speed boat 
with a driver, who may look more like Gabby Hayes than Don Johnson but who 
knows the lake intimately.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Lindau, moving west along the German coast, is the industrial town of 
Friedrichshafen, where Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin had his giant airships 
built in harborside hangars.  
</P>
<P>
 Meersburg, about half an hour further on, is yet another remarkable, 
skillfully restored and maintained medieval town perched high above the lake 
and surrounded by vineyards almost as old as the town. Parts of the town itself 
are believed to date back to the 7th-Century Merovingian king, Dagobert. 
Despite an influx of bus tourists from time to time in the summer months, and 
the inevitable, ugly souvenir shops that bloom in their wake, Meersburg 
deserves a 24-hour visit, particularly since the opening, in the spring of 
1991, of a tiny, beguiling hotel called the Drei Stuben, created from a 
restored 17th-Century townhouse by Brigitte Drewing, the wife of a wealthy 
local businessman. Every detail at the Drei Stuben is top of the line, from the 
Rosenthal China in the dining room to a state-of-the-art Sony "Dream Machine" 
clock radio at each bedside. The hotel's restaurant has been leased to a 
brilliant 27-year-old chef named Stefan Marquard, a representative of the 
German culinary avant-garde, and a gastronomic luminary in the making. For an 
entirely different sort of dining experience, this one in an atmospheric old 
tavern that serves up high-quality regional fare, reserve a table at chef 
Michael Benz's Winzerstube Zum Becher, set in one of Meersburg's oldest houses, 
built in 1605. 
</P>
<P>
 A car ferry runs from Meersburg to Konstanz, which is one way to complete a 
circuit of the Bodensee. The alternative is to press on around the northwestern 
tip of the lake, where the water narrows into the Uberlingensee. If you opt for 
the drive, stop for a look at Salem, Germany's most elite boarding school where 
Prince Philip was educated. Then it's on through the towns of Uberlingen, 
Sipplingen, Bodman (whose harbor hosts a splendid regatta of antique sailboats 
every four years), Dingelsdorf and finally, just before Konstanz, to the bridge 
that leads onto Germany's highly touted floral paradise, the island of Mainau. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainau, with 110 acres of cultivated gardens and a cream-colored 18th-Century 
palace, is the home of 85-year-old Count Lennart Bernadotte, his 50-year-old 
second wife, Countess Sonja, and their five young children. In 1932 the 
Swedish-born Count Bernadotte, the uncle of Sweden's King Carl-Gustav, 
inherited what was then an overgrown, run-down island from his grandmother, 
Victoria, the daughter of the Grand-Duke Friederich I of Baden who later became 
the Queen of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 A former student of forestry and agriculture, the Count slowly transformed the 
tangled, unkept acres into a world-renowned botanical wonder open year-round to 
the public. And public it is. From morning to evening the place is choked with 
tourists, particularly in July and August, more than 3 million a year. Ranks of 
tour buses jam the parking lot and 2,000 to 3,000 people a day wait hungrily 
for tables at one of the island's four restaurants. This is not necessarily a 
reason to avoid this unique operation, only a caveat to arrive as soon after 
the 7 a.m. opening hour as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainau, with its crowds and its enterprising publicity office, is an anomaly 
on the Bodensee. For the most part, the lake is a region that time, politics 
and progress have left behind. "From the perspectives of Berne, Bonn and 
Vienna, the capitals of the three countries bordering the lake," says Ernst 
Muhlemann, a member of the Swiss Parliament and director of the Union Bank of 
Switzerland's Management Center in Castle Wolfsberg, "the Bodensee district is 
considered the end of the world." But this he says with a smile, since he knows 
how nice the end of the world can be. GUIDEBOOK

TRAVEL INSIDER: CONSOLIDATORS MAY OFFER BIG SAVINGS ON LONG TRIPS; AIR FARES: 
BUT CONSUMERS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK OUT AGENTS AND TICKET RESTRICTIONS 
CAREFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a good spring for air fare bargain-hunters, with domestic fare wars 
breaking out on all sides. But come the peak travel months of summer, the cost 
of travel near and far will rise along with demand. For many frugal travelers 
planning overseas trips, that's the cue to start consulting consolidators. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidators are independent companies that act as brokers for tickets the 
airlines can't sell at regular prices. Most major U.S. and European airlines 
use them. The editors of Consumer Reports Travel Letter call them "the airline 
equivalent of factory-outlet stores" and say "they can be hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many remain squeamish about using consolidators. A large number of 
them, after all, are small-scale outfits with short lives and overworked 
reservationists. Some of them place newspaper ads that announce very low fares 
that may well turn out to be unavailable. Some ads include a phone number but 
don't include the name of the business, which understandably gives many 
travelers pause. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers shouldn't necessarily let those worries sour them on the entire 
consolidator concept. Find the right consolidator handling the right ticket, 
and you could save as much as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the consolidator business has arisen in the last 10 years, and the 
marketplace is still evolving. Some consolidators sell tickets only on a 
"wholesale" basis to travel agencies. Some companies have no direct contract 
with airlines, but act as ticket brokers selling directly to the public. Some 
sell both wholesale and retail. Most consolidator tickets are in the 
least-expensive coach or "excursion" class. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their contractual agreements, the consolidators can't name specific 
airlines in advertising, but they can specify prices -- which are often well 
beneath the most deeply discounted "brand-name" fares. 
</P>
<P>
 One prudent way to find a consolidator is to buy your ticket through an 
experienced travel agent who has dealt with them before. Though agents with 
organizations like American Express may decline to do business with 
consolidators (there's less profit in it), industry authorities say more travel 
agents are dealing with consolidators than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you use a travel agent or seek out a ticket yourself, be sure you 
understand the restrictions on the ticket before you buy. Pay special attention 
to cancellation penalties, often more severe than those on conventionally 
purchased tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask in advance about what kind of payment is accepted. Many sellers of 
consolidators, who run small businesses on tight budgets, decline credit cards 
or add extra fees when they are used. But travel authorities recommend paying 
with a credit card, so you can stop payment if tickets aren't forthcoming. 
Expect to get your tickets promptly, either through the mail or, to be doubly 
safe, in person.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you have the ticket in hand, it will show the airline involved, and you 
can call that carrier to double-check the ticket's authenticity. (In years 
past, travelers were unable to claim frequent-flyer credits on consolidator 
tickets, but consolidators say most carriers' contracts now allow it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some general rules of thumb: The farther you're flying and the greater the 
demand, the greater your chances of saving big money with a consolidator 
ticket. As with any substantial purchase, consumers should compare prices 
before committing to one seller. 
</P>
<P>
 The list below is a sampling of veteran agencies that sell consolidator 
tickets, along with background details supplied by company officials. Each of 
the firms listed below generally accepts credit cards, though some offer 
discounts for cash. Inclusion here is not an endorsement. Other discount ticket 
agencies are often listed in telephone books along with travel agents as 
"airline ticket agencies."

WEEKEND ESCAPE: HIGH SIERRA; TRUCKEE STOP; THE LOCALS WERE NOTABLY FRIENDLY, 
THE LODGINGS VINTAGE, THE PRICES TRENDING UPWARD IN THIS HISTORIC RAILROAD TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the outskirts, there are rival supermarkets and rival drugstores, competing 
video shops and pizza palaces, even an outlet shopping mall, but the heart of 
old downtown Truckee always seems to stay the same. It's down home, laid back, 
a little naughty, rough hewn. 
</P>
<P>
 And trendy, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems tourists "discover" this High Sierra frontier town every day, for its 
proximity to the ski resorts in the winter and its hiking, mountain biking and 
fishing during the thaw. The eating and drinking are pretty good all year 
round. Oh, and the gambling tables of Reno are only about 45 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this is not to give anybody the wrong idea. Truckee, so often prefaced 
with the word historic that outsiders might think it part of its name, is not 
Aspen, or even Telluride or anything close. Its 10,000 year-round residents are 
generally a rugged and proud bunch. "Truckee Local," some car license plate 
holders boast. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband, two daughters and I discovered Truckee a few years back when my 
parents bought a cabin on Serene Lakes, about a 15-minute ride over the Donner 
Summit. So just like all the other tourists who have come before us, we have 
claimed Truckee as our own. There are no dress codes. Strangers talk to each 
other, nicely. Even at the finest restaurants, our children are welcomed with 
crayons and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 (To get to Truckee, we usually fly into Sacramento and drive east from there. 
If we had to rent a car -- my parents lend us one -- we would probably fly into 
Reno, as it would cut the highway time in half.) 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, however, we had no idea about the hotels. So after a stay at 
my parents' cabin, my husband, daughters (ages 3 and 7) and I checked into The 
Truckee Hotel for an April weekend. Truckee doesn't have a lot in the way of 
accommodations, but rather than settle for what appeared to be the standard 
bed-and-nightstand-by-the-highway (i.e. the Super 8 Lodge off Interstate 80 or 
Best Western's Truckee-Tahoe Inn by the small local airport) we went with 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 This (historic) hotel used to be a stagecoach stop. It's 120 years old, 
although the woman who took my reservation over the phone assured me that the 
bathrooms have been redone since. In fact, she said that by the end of last 
summer, the entire building had been completely restored. Although it used to 
house railroad workers and lumberjacks, The Truckee is now a nonsmoking hotel, 
and flouting of that rule will bring a $75 "deodorizing charge," according to 
hotel literature. What the reservations taker didn't tell me was that there are 
no phones or televisions in the rooms -- or that there is no one to help drag 
luggage up the stairs (no elevators, either).  
</P>
<P>
 The rooms, however, have a light, feminine feel to them, with floral quilts on 
the beds, linen and lace doilies atop the antique chests and walls painted 
powder blue. Ours were certainly comfortable if a bit spare. Another unexpected 
touch: In the basket with the sample-sized shampoo and mouthwash were two sets 
of disposable earplugs. The card attached to them read, "Since we're in the 
heart of the historic railroad town of Truckee, you might hear the rumble and 
whistle of one of our trains." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has four slightly sloping floors of 37 rooms, only eight of which 
have private baths. Guests in the other rooms -- all with a sink in the corner 
-- use a common one down the hall. Since my days of dorm living are well behind 
me, I asked for one with a private bath. There turned out to be a slight 
problem with this. While there were rooms with two double beds (the plan: 
grown-ups in one, children in the other), none had baths. The solution was two 
adjoining rooms, each with a single queen-sized bed. Ours had a bath -- with an 
appropriately claw-footed bathtub -- and the kids' did not. 
</P>
<P>
 This also meant we spent more money than we had planned. Our room was $95 a 
night, and theirs, $65, and we were asked to settle the bill when we checked in 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 With that taken care of, we set off for a stroll down the town's main drag, 
Commercial Row. It's a mix of saloons for regulars, restaurants for tourists, 
coffee shops for locals, and stores selling everything from fancy children's 
clothing to kachina dolls. And if you want fishing tackle you can find it, too. 
Somehow, nothing, and nobody, seemed out of place. Elderly tourists were 
strolling next to young families with small children, who mingled with bikers 
showing off their tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroll is the operative word here, as life seems to amble along at half-speed 
on Truckee time. A stray dog who took a liking to us came, too. We took our 
time browsing in shops, then bought some frozen yogurt at the Ponderosa Deli 
and parked ourselves on the benches meant for just that. We learned long ago 
not to bother with the overpriced jewelry boutiques or the imitation Western 
clothing stores where "sale prices" would translate to more-than-retail 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner that night, we had been looking forward to The Passage restaurant, 
in the same building as the hotel but independently operated. The daily food 
and wine specials are usually intriguing and delicious, albeit with 
made-for-the-tourists prices. For example, an appetizer of oysters "Oscar" was 
$7.50 on Saturday night, and a glass of 1984 Ridge York Creek Cabernet was only 
50 cents less. 
</P>
<P>
 During this particular meal, however, the service was so outrageously slow 
that, for the first time in our lives, we walked out before our entrees 
arrived. Left to settle the bill with the waitress, I explained that especially 
with two children at the table, more than an hour's wait between the appetizer 
and the main course was more than we could stand. She slapped the bill on the 
table without a word -- neither an apology nor a thanks. It was fortunate that 
we'd saved an apple from the snack (cheese, crackers, fruit and juices) served 
in the hotel's ground-floor parlor earlier that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we ate breakfast in the same parlor: a nice buffet of 
muffins, bagels, cereal, fruit, juices and coffee is included in the price of 
the room. The good news was the train hadn't kept anybody up, although the 
steam radiator knocked steadily through the night. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We tried OB's Pub and Restaurant on Commercial Row for lunch. The food was 
straightforward and good, the atmosphere dark yet not spooky enough to scare 
the kids. They got their own coloring book with plenty of connect-the-dots. 
After lunch, we visited the Emigrant Trail Museum, just off I-80 on the western 
fringe of town. The museum chronicles the Donner Party's horrific journey 
toward Sacramento in the winter of 1846-47, and, of course, their meals of 
fellow travelers. There is a nearly continuously running movie on the pioneers' 
plight and the gift shop sells several books. I bought a $3 replica of a tiny 
doll that consoled one young member of the party through some very dark nights 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we'd taken all this in, we were ready to relax over a good (maybe 
vegetarian?) meal that night. From the outside, the Cottonwood restaurant looks 
to be part of a ramshackle lodge perched over downtown, but inside it's an 
airy, quietly graceful restaurant with terrific service and food, and more 
crayons for the kids. We'd been told not to miss the Caesar salad. It and the 
rest of the meal -- bottle of wine, hamburgers for the kids, ribs for my 
husband and seafood over linguine for me -- was first rate. The bill, with tip, 
came to $103. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing about Truckee: The atmosphere may be Twin Peaks, but the prices are 
L.A. Still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable meal -- relaxed, just like Truckee 
itself. The Truckee Hotel, too, is worth a return trip. The staff was cheerful 
and the environment kid-friendly. We felt as if we were staying in a friend's 
home. Budget for Four

TAKING THE KIDS: DRIVE IS ON FOR SUMMER BARGAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They're vacuuming out their minivans and dusting off the maps, studying those 
guidebooks and hunting for air-fare deals. Families all over America are 
getting ready to hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "1994 is going to be a banner year for family vacations. The boomers are 
taking the kids with them everywhere," said Peter Mason, who monitors family 
trends for Better Homes and Gardens magazine's annual family travel survey, 
conducted by the U.S. Travel Data Center, a nonprofit travel research 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 90 million parents and kids plan to vacation together -- up 10% from 
last year, according to the just-released 1994 survey. Half of them say they're 
heading to the beach -- 19% to Florida -- while 40% are opting for historical 
sites. More than a third of those studied will also visit a theme park. Many 
expect to spend more than they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, families want to get the most bang for their hard-earned vacation buck. 
The hotel industry knows it, so it's working to attract families by offering a 
bewildering array of discounts, giveaways, kids' programs and promotions. 
Westin Hotels, in conjunction with its Westin Kids Club, is even putting its 
staff through sensitivity training to be sure they're sufficiently attuned to 
families. So is Summerfield Suites Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the summer promotions will save considerable cash. Some are gimmicks 
designed to amuse. Some are designed to help take the aggravation out of family 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if finding a vacation spot takes too much time, the first-ever 
Family & Travel Directory lists more than 500 resorts and hotels that have such 
family-friendly amenities as children's programs, day-care and package deals, 
and comes with about a dozen coupons offering discounts on hotels, air fare and 
film. (The directory is $19.95. Call 800-96-FAMILY.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the packages being touted are truly good deals, but remember there are 
catches to many of the offers and supplies are often limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a four- or a three-day Premier cruise this summer or fall and get a free 
couple of days at Walt Disney World, including hotels and park passes (book by 
July 1; ask your travel agent for details). 
</P>
<P>
 Opt for Club Med Huatulco, Mexico, and kids between 4 and 11 can stay free 
until Dec. 10. But note: There's no special program for younger children at 
Huatulco, so families with kids under 4 might do better to book a kids-are-free 
week at one of the other family clubs; call 800-CLUB-MED for details. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott's Summer Escape deal for families offers discounts of up to 30% off 
standard rates and includes daily breakfast for two at participating hotels 
(800- 228-9290). Choose ITT Sheraton's Summer SureSavers for similar savings. 
Families staying at all Hyatt hotels can book a second room at half price 
(800-233-1234). Stay three nights at a Hilton and qualify for up to 40% off 
regular rates. And check out Hilton's Vacation Station where kids can borrow 
toys (800-HILTONS). 
</P>
<P>
 "Value is a higher consideration than just price for families now," said Vicki 
Gordon, director of marketing programs for Holiday Inn Worldwide. That's why 
Holiday Inn again is touting its kids-eat-free (from the children's menu) 
promotion (800-HOLIDAY). 
</P>
<P>
 Westin Hotels Summer Getaway is also giving free meals to children at almost 
all of its properties in conjunction with the company's new Kids Club. 
Membership in the club, which is free and automatically bestowed upon guests, 
will entitle children to gifts, such as sports bottles and first-aid kits, 
complimentary beverages at meals and a selection of children's movies through 
the in-room entertainment service (800-228-3000). Borrow free videos complete 
with microwave popcorn at the two-bedroom Summerfield Suites Hotels 
(800-833-4353). 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Terwilliger Meyers likes to rent condos to get the most value for her 
vacation dollar. "You get more space and you can eat there so you don't always 
have to go out for breakfast," she said. One resource is Condominium Travel 
Associates, a consortium of about 325 travel agents who specialize in the condo 
and villa market and offer discounts on air fares and rental cars. Ask about 
the two-bedroom units in Orlando for less than $100 a night (800-492-6636). 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

CRUISE VIEWS: GOOD LOOKS, LACKS PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 296-passenger Silver Cloud from Silversea Cruises, the newest cruise line 
to enter the ultra-luxury sweepstakes, made its debut last month in the 
Mediterranean with some of the best "hardware" we've seen since the Crystal 
Harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the fledgling line's "software" -- the food, service and 
entertainment -- has yet to develop a personal stamp or style, unlike other new 
cruise lines that have debuted in recent years. We think in particular of 
Crystal Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line and Celebrity Cruises, all of which 
sailed from the moment they were christened with a clear and fixed image they 
want to impress on a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Silversea doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a bigger version of the 
little superdeluxe ships or a smaller version of traditional classic cruise 
vessels like Crystal Harmony and Royal Viking Sun. That's a pity, since the 
ship itself has more to offer for the money than most of its competitors in the 
$600-plus-a-day bracket -- an incredibly smooth ride, even in seas so rough the 
vessel couldn't anchor and tender off the Greek island of Chios during our 
cruise; a tiered two-deck show lounge with big stage and excellent sight lines; 
a full-service spa with sea-water therepy tub, a first on a ship of this size. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabins are big and comfortable, with the 38 lowest-priced passenger cabins, 
those without verandas, measuring 240 square feet each, while the 102 cabins 
with verandas measure 294 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison shoppers in the deluxe market, this means standard cabins are 
slightly larger than standard accommodations aboard Cunard Sea Goddess and most 
cabins aboard Seven Seas' Song of Flower. They're comparable in size to 
Seabourn's standard suites, which are 277 square feet but don't offer verandas, 
and Radisson Diamond's standard suites, which are 250 square feet with or 
without verandas. The handsome marble bathrooms, however, offer less counter 
and storage space than Seabourn or Royal Viking Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochure prices on the Silver Cloud's cabins without verandas are $599 a day 
per person, double occupancy, in the Mediterranean, $469 in North America, 
while veranda cabins run $685 a day per person, double occupancy, in the 
Mediterranean, $549 in North America. Those prices include round-trip air fare, 
transfers, travel insurance with some trip cancellation coverage, some land 
hotel stays before and/or after the cruise, port taxes, tips and beverages 
aboard, including wine, cocktails and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison, here's a rundown on brochure prices for similar Mediterranean 
cruises this year aboard Silversea's major rivals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seabourn -- $1,032 a day per person, double occupancy, including round-trip 
air fare, tips, complimentary in-cabin bar; lounge drinks and wine with meals 
are extra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal Viking Queen -- $942 a day per person, double occupancy, with air fare 
from the West Coast and tips but not beverages included. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sea Goddess -- $785 a day per person, double occupancy, without air fare but 
with tips and all beverages included. 
</P>
<P>
 * Radisson Diamond -- $783 a day per person, double occupancy, including air 
fare from the West Coast, tips and house wine with meals included; 120 cabins 
with private verandas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Song of Flower -- from $427 to $728 a day per person, double occupancy, with 
tips and all beverages included, air fare extra; latter price is for cabins 
with private veranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Each stateroom on Silver Cloud has a walk-in closet with generous hanging and 
drawer space, personal safe, terry cloth robes and slippers. Cabins have 
sitting area with full-sized sofa and two chairs, a small marble table that can 
be converted into a larger table for en suite dinning, plus a dressing table 
with hair dryer, TV with VCR, a stocked mini-refrigerator, twin beds 
convertible to queen-size bed, bedside tables and good reading lights. A bottle 
of champagne in a silver ice bucket, fresh fruit and a vase of fresh flowers 
(orchids when we were aboard) is in every cabin at embarkation. The marble 
bathrooms all have tubs and extra-large sizes of Caswell-Massey toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 140 vista and veranda cabins, there are eight suites -- four grand 
suites with private verandas that sleep four in two bedrooms and two baths 
measuring 1,085 square feet, three Silver Suites with separate bedroom, big 
living room with dining table and bathroom with spa tub measuring 528 square 
feet, and one owner's suite with two bedrooms and veranda that measures 887 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On our sailing, the fourth week the ship was in service, the service staff was 
still tentative and lacked polish and teamwork, in part because most of them 
were recruited relatively close to sailing. Service did, however, seem to 
improve somewhat as the voyage went on. 
</P>
<P>
 The food, on the other hand, while perfectly acceptable by cruise ship 
standards, was neither exciting nor innovative but bland, more on the order of 
what we'd expect from Cunard's Sagafjord or Royal Cruise Line, ships that serve 
a high proportion of older travelers. Many of the passengers we met on board, 
however, were pre-retirement-age veterans of Seabourn, Sea Goddess, RVL Queen 
and Song of Flower, all ships with outstanding cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast and lunch daily are served in both the dining room and the slightly 
more casual Terrace Cafe, and alternative dining with a set theme menu is 
scheduled in the cafe a couple of nights a week. On our cruise, one menu was 
the Austrian chef's pallid interpretation of Asian cuisine; the other was a 
Greek dinner that was fairly tasty. Advance reservations are required, guests 
are limited to 50, and there is no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakedown plumbing problems plagued the early sailings but corrections were 
expected to be completed by this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment follows a predictable format -- musical shows with two singers 
and four female dancers going through the usual reprise of Broadway hits 
(including the hoary "Fiddler on the Roof") sans scenery but with frequent 
costume changes. Cruise director Ray Solaire presents his charming puppet act 
on one evening, followed by a personable young magician. Perhaps the most 
diverting evening was an impromptu jazz session with five members of the ship's 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The shore excursions program is exceptionally good. On our Greek and Turkish 
itinerary, we had both a Greek and a Turkish hostess on board to accompany 
shore tours and to answer questions for passengers who want to arrange their 
own visits ashore. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At least once each cruise, the line presents what it calls a "Silversea 
Experience." On our sailing it was a free all-day tour through the Turkish 
countryside along the Turquoise Coast on comfortable buses that, according to 
line policy, are filled not more than 60%, so passengers have room to spread 
out. At lunchtime, we stopped at a park and lunched alfresco among the pine 
trees on a traditional wedding feast -- Turkish wines, two dozen cold meze 
(appetizers), six or eight different kinds of kebabs grilled over charcoal and 
a table of desserts and fresh fruits -- catered by the Antalya Sheraton. The 
costumed wedding couple rode through the trees on decorated camels greeting 
guests, and later folk dancers and belly dancers entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of optional shore excursions was offered in each port at prices 
ranging from $24 to $37 dollars for half-day tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Cloud cruises the Baltic on 10-day itineraries from Copenhagen and 
Amsterdam now through the end of August, calling in Stockholm; Tallinn, 
Estonia; St. Petersburg, and Helsinki on most sailings. On Aug. 31 the ship 
leaves London for a Celtic cruise along the Scottish and Irish coasts, then a 
transatlantic crossing from Cork to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-day cruises between New York and Montreal in September celebrate New 
England's autumn color, followed by a southbound sailing leaving New York via 
Colonial America for Nassau Oct. 11. Caribbean, trans-canal and South American 
cruises fill out the rest of the 1994 calendar.

TRAVELER'S JOURNAL: ISTANBUL; TURKISH BATHOS; SHE WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 
CELEBRATED TURKISH BATH EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY LIKE. HERE'S THE NAKED TRUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA BEESON, Beeson is a Toronto free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wealthy Istanbul friend was appalled. "You're not," she demanded, eyebrows 
hoisting to her hairline, "really going to a Turkish bath a la Turque? " I 
admitted that this was my intention. My friend grimly hinted at dire 
consequences ("Would it be clean?" she asked), while strongly urging me to go 
instead to the hamam (Turkish bath) at the fitness center at the Swissotel, to 
which she was driven once a week by her chauffeur. But I couldn't see the 
pristine Swissotel, glassily luxurious on its hill in the smart district of 
Besiktas, providing anything like the ambience for which I was looking. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact I wasn't exactly sure what to expect of a typical Turkish hamam, and 
in an effort to find out, I had read everything I could lay my hands on that 
described the experiences of others, some of them more than a little 
distinguished. But their impressions were bewilderingly different. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Mark Twain, visiting Istanbul in 1869, had no words bad enough 
to describe his experience. "The celebrated Turkish bath," he fulminated in 
"Innocents Abroad," "is a malignant swindle. The man who enjoys it is qualified 
to enjoy anything that is repulsive to sight or sense. It is tedious, and 
wretched, and dismal, and nasty." And of the hamam he visited, he wrote, "The 
place was vast, naked, dreary; its courts a barn, its galleries stalls for 
human horses." He complained that, after he had undressed, "an unclean 
starveling," (his masseur), "wrapped a gaudy tablecloth about his loins, and 
hung a white rag over my shoulders," and of having to rest on "rusty old 
mattresses, indented with impressions left by the forms of nine successive 
generations of men who had reposed on them." 
</P>
<P>
 All distinctly discouraging. However, I fortunately then read the letters of a 
distinguished Englishwoman, remarkable for her courage, intelligence and 
insatiable curiosity. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, wife of the British ambassador 
to the "Sublime Porte of Turkey," in 1717, and perhaps the nearest thing to a 
female investigative reporter the 18th Century produced, saw it all very 
differently. When visiting Sophia, which was at that time within the Turkish 
Empire and famous for its hot baths, she took herself off to the hamam at 10 
o'clock one morning, by which time it was already filled with about 200 women. 
</P>
<P>
 She declared herself "charmed by their civility and beauty" and described the 
scene with keen interest. " 'Tis the women's coffeehouse, where all the news of 
the town is told, scandal invented etc. They generally take this diversion once 
a week and stay there at least four or five hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The hamam consisted of five rooms, some warm, some very hot and sulfurous, and 
two with hot baths. One very large room, paved with marble and containing four 
cool fountains, had two sofas of marble, one above another, running around the 
perimeter. "The first sofas were covered with cushions and rich carpets, on 
which sat the ladies, and on the second their slaves behind 'em, but without 
any distinction of rank by their dress, all being in a state of nature, that is 
in plain English, stark naked." Lady Mary wrote that she would "have been very 
glad to pass more time with them . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of such conflicting evidence, my curiosity was piqued. And so on a 
cool damp day last fall, which was less than ideal for sightseeing, I took 
myself off to the 300-year-old Turkish baths in Cagaloglu, in the old part of 
the city, not far from the great museum-church of St. Sophia. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaflet put out by the baths described it glowingly. "This magnificent 
monument was used only by the Sultans, important people of the palace and high 
class of society" (and to think the Swissotel was open to just anybody!). It 
listed among past visitors King Edward VII, Kaiser Wilhelm, Franz Liszt, 
Florence Nightingale, one of the Rockefellers, Tony Curtis and Rudolf Nureyev. 
How could I go wrong? It was described, rather vaguely, as having been built, 
"it is said" in the early 18th Century, one of the works "it is said" of Sinan 
(whose superb vessels of holy space, the Suleymaniye and Edirne mosques, made 
him the greatest architect in the history of Turkey). Sinan might have been 
surprised at the attribution, particularly as he died in 1588. 
</P>
<P>
 The exterior was less than distinguished, and I entered by a door that said 
"Women Only." I was rather relieved. No Rudys or Rockies allowed in this 
section. Through a narrow entryway I stepped into a large dark room with a high 
domed ceiling, where five women in smocks lounged on seats in the center, 
watching television. Small cubicles with bunk-like beds covered in striped 
fabric opened off the central area, and a second tier of these opened off a 
balcony, above. Each cubicle door had a glass window with designs to obscure 
vision in the lower part ("latticed chicken coops" Twain had described them, 
"more suggestive of the county hospital than anything else.") 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cotton-wrapped women detached herself from the television to attend 
to me and silently held out a card on which were listed the different 
treatments available, with their prices. It wasn't particularly cheap, but I 
told myself that I was paying for the privilege of bathing where the likes of 
Rudy, Rocky and Florence Nightingale had bathed before. 
</P>
<P>
 Yikan , meaning "wash oneself" -- a novel privilege denied most of us -- cost 
about $3.60, and soap was included; "Keselenmek," translated as "body rub with 
a hair glove," cost about $5; Yikama ve Masaj" combined a self-wash and massage 
for $6; or for $7.25, one could have a hair glove rub and massage. Throwing 
caution to the winds I decided on all-out, self-indulgence and opted for the 
"Luks osmanli servisi, " the Luxury Ottoman service, for about $10.75, with 
both soap and shampoo included. (Ooh the depravity of it!) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I paid my money, and another smocked woman heaved herself to her feet, 
selected a large pink towel from a pile, indicated a cubicle and told me to 
take off my shoes and put on the blue rubber sandals at the door. She also 
indicated, by pantomime, that I should take everything off. I did as I was 
told. Then, clad only in sandals and clutching my pink towel about me, I 
followed her as she opened a great arched wooden door on heavy black hinges, 
led the way through a warm, high-domed, gray marble room and opened an 
identical door on the far side. 
</P>
<P>
 A gust of hot air hit me as we went in. This room was much like the first but 
much hotter, very large, with a huge, high dome, pierced by glass-filled stars 
and hexagons and circles, supported by 15 marble columns. Filling the center of 
the floor under the dome was a huge, knee-level, 10-sided marble platform, 
which I recognized as the gobek tasi (or center stone), on which the massage 
took place. Just as in Lady Mary's description, a wide, foot-high platform ran 
around the sides of the room. Rising from it was a low bench that ran between 
each of the basins against the walls. Set at intervals corresponding to the 15 
columns, were marble basins with brass taps. Water overflowing from these 
basins would spill from the side platforms onto the floor around the gobek tasi 
and flow in rivulets to a dark square hole visible under the step of the door 
through which we'd entered. It all seemed very familiar from reading Lady Mary, 
except for one very major difference: Rather than being, as she was, in the 
company of 200 other women, I was the only person there. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendant turned on the taps and removed my pink towel. For a second I 
felt like a limpet that has lost its protective shell -- a self-conscious 
yellow-pink blob. She handed me a pewter bowl and made water-pouring gestures 
over her head by way of encouragement. "Just water," she said, and paddled off, 
leaving me sitting, as Lady Mary would have it, "in a state of nature," on the 
marble bench . . . alone in the large, hot room. 
</P>
<P>
 I sat there a long time, simply pouring very hot water over my head and body. 
It was such a simple exercise, yet I found myself overtaken by a strange and 
wonderful sense of freedom. It was blissful. I began to feel like a warm, 
hedonistic cat, northern inhibitions rinsing away along with superficial dirt. 
The sensuous feelings briefly evaporated as the attendant trudged back in 
bearing a sign that listed Turkish tea or coffee or apple tea. The apple tea 
was brought in a little glass -- delicious, sweet and piping hot. Mark Twain, I 
recollected, had been brought Turkish coffee. "Of all the unchristian beverages 
that ever passed my lips," quoth he, "Turkish coffee is the worst." He said it, 
not I. 
</P>
<P>
 After some time a bizarre creature entered the room: a vast pear-shaped woman, 
with great pear-shaped breasts and black briefs, her hair tied up in a scarf 
and gold earrings dangling from her ears. She had a strange, strong-jawed, 
small-eyed face. I wondered if she were another customer, perhaps a regular, as 
she seemed very much at home. I politely averted my eyes as she drew near but 
she, on the contrary, had no such qualms and I knew that she was staring at me 
boldly as she shuffled past. She then busied herself at a nearby basin with her 
back to me, running the taps and noisily splashing washcloths in the water. I 
concluded that she must be my masseuse. No starveling, she. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big Pear was preoccupied in this fashion when I suddenly noticed, running 
toward me from the direction of the door, a small dark animal scuttling around 
the marble floor surrounding the gobek tasi. Then a second ran after it, and 
for the briefest instant they frolicked. Rats! Oh help! Oh Mary and 200 ladies! 
Where are you now? "OHMYGOD!" I yelled and rose to my feet dripping with water. 
The rats instantly evaporated in the direction from which they'd come, down the 
hole under the door. I stared wildly in the direction of Pear, but there was 
absolutely no reaction from that massive back. My call had been lost in the 
sound of the running, dripping water, and Pear, bent over her task, did not 
notice. Should I create a scene? Would she understand? Or should I save my 
breath and just calm down? What would Florence have done in my place? Probably 
said "Only two?" but reorganized the sewers. I controlled myself and sat down. 
</P>
<P>
 Pear now moved over to the gobek tasi and placed a small black pillow on the 
marble in the middle. She seated herself and indicated to me that I was to lie 
down on the platform beside her. There was something rather dismaying about all 
this. The dismal inhibitions started creeping back, but I meekly did as I was 
told. Then, with a rough luffa-like black glove on her right hand, she 
proceeded to go over my entire body, front and back, rubbing the skin with 
enormous vigor -- the Keselenmek treatment, which Twain described quite 
accurately as "polishing." My feelings of modesty quickly dissipated as I 
realized the years of naked bodies these gimlet eyes must have seen; among all 
the tall, slim beauties and walrus hulks like herself, I would be very 
forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided at this point that I would attempt to tell her about the rats, so I 
pointed over to the water exit hole, made a running motion with one hand, said 
"Squeak, squeak," and held up two fingers. She stopped polishing and the gimlet 
eyes regarded me expressionlessly for a moment. She plainly understood. She 
then said something in Turkish and made two great chopping movements with her 
right arm. Was she telling me I should have killed them both? There was no 
telling, so I let the subject lapse. After this I was directed to return to my 
marble basin and rinse myself thoroughly. I came to notice that each time I 
moved from one area to another Pear would sluice the area I had vacated with a 
container of soapy water and carefully rinse it. It was rather less than 
flattering, but at the same time, reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned to the gobek tasi where Pear lathered me all over with soapsuds and 
massaged me mercilessly with fingers like brutal little rollers, up and down 
and round about, rippling over and into every muscle I ever knew I had and a 
great many I had no idea about, first on one side and then on the other. I am 
perfectly confident that she had never had a lesson in anatomy in her life, but 
each muscle got its moment of punitive attention. Periodically she would stop 
massaging and drum my muscles forcefully with the sides of her great ham-like 
hands. Tenderizing a steak was a comparison that came to my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Again I had to be rinsed off, and the same procedure repeated with a mixture 
of lathering by hand and the rough-textured glove. One at a time she would pick 
up my arms -- which were beginning to resemble limp lengths of rubber tubing -- 
massage them, then put them down, and the same with my legs, and finally my 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While I was lying there, the door opened and another customer was led in, 
draped in a blue towel. She was an attractive small woman with well-cut dark 
hair. Feeling prudish is a pointless exercise in futility, lying spread-eagled 
on your back garbed only in soapsuds while being vigorously massaged. But for a 
moment I wondered whether to just shut my eyes tightly and pretend the newcomer 
wasn't there or to show some sort of recognition. In the end I looked up and 
grinned, and the newcomer -- soapless, so by now even more naked than I -- 
grinned back. She turned out to be French, and as unfamiliar with the routine 
as I. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, rather the worse for my pulverizing, I had to totter over to my 
basin to rinse myself, after which Pear seated herself beside her own basin and 
indicated that I should sit on the low platform in front of her. She produced a 
pumice stone with which she gently pumiced my knees, feet and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomer had been engaged in pouring water over herself since she arrived. 
Now she called over, "How long do I have to do this?" "A good long time," I 
replied. I also warned her about the rats and her eyes opened wide. I suspect 
Pear must have understood because suddenly she grasped my neck in her grip of 
steel, emptied shampoo straight over my head, and began massaging not just my 
scalp, but my face, nose and eyes, too, with her great penetrating fingers. I 
opened my mouth to object and a deluge of rinse water filled it. I was pulled 
upright and led over to my basin for one final rinse, and it was all over. Pear 
wrapped me up in my pink towel, and led me by the hand out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I was meant to rest on the bed in my cubicle, but I didn't wish to, 
although, in contradiction to Mark Twain's description, it was spotlessly 
clean. I dressed, dried my hair with a blower and went out, feeling a great 
deal cleaner though somewhat filleted and wobbly kneed. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the spirited Lady Mary's own impressions of this intimate 
experience? Did it release any hidden libido? And how did she cope, the 
solitary foreigner among 200 Turkish women? Ah, here Lady Mary disappoints. 
Female adventurer she might have been, who loved wandering the streets of 
Istanbul (or Constantinople as it was then) in Turkish disguise, but for this 
remarkably enlightened woman it seems emancipation didn't translate to public 
nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in my traveling habit, which is a riding dress," she related, of her 
arrival among the women at the hamam, "and certainly appeared very 
extraordinary to them . . ." but they "would fain have undressed me for the 
bath . . . I was at last forced to open my skirt and show them my stays, which 
satisfied 'em very well, for I saw they believed I was so locked up in that 
machine that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they 
attributed to my husband."

DESTINATION: CONCORD, MASS.; LOUISA MAY ALCOTT SLEPT HERE; AS DID RALPH WALDO 
EMERSON, HENRY DAVID THOREAU, NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE AND OTHER AMERICAN LITERARY 
LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN McCLURG, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For literature lovers, this lovely historic town about 20 miles northwest of 
Boston offers an embarrassment of riches. Louisa May Alcott; her father, Amos 
Bronson Alcott; Henry David Thoreau; Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Nathaniel 
Hawthorne all lived and wrote and exchanged ideas in Concord, that hotbed of 
19th-Century Transcendentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserved as museums and open to the public are Orchard House, the family home 
of the Alcotts and the setting for Louisa May's children's classic, "Little 
Women"; the Wayside, a rambling house next door that was also home to the 
Alcotts and, later, Hawthorne; Emerson House, the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
and the Old Manse, a magnificent 18th-Century structure where both Emerson and 
Hawthorne lived for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there is Walden Pond, the inspiration for Thoreau's seminal 
work "Walden," which lures thousands of visitors every year to the site where 
the writer lived simply in a cabin from 1845 to 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 Concord has been rocked by the efforts of Don Henley and his musician pals to 
save Walden Woods -- the woodlands surrounding Walden Pond -- from development. 
But for the most part, Concord is remarkably intact as a historic site, 
succumbing neither to touristy kitsch nor to numbing 20th-Century 
overdevelopment and commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Concord's many unspoiled sites is Author's Ridge in Sleepy Hollow 
Cemetery, where the town's literary lights -- Louisa May Alcott, Emerson, 
Thoreau and Hawthorne -- are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a century before Thoreau went to the woods "to live deliberately," 
Concord and nearby Lexington earned estimable places in American history. It 
was at the Old North Bridge in Concord (today a historic site) where the "shot 
heard 'round the world" signaled the start of the American Revolution on April 
19, 1775. 
</P>
<P>
 If the visitor plans carefully, all four literary houses can be toured in a 
day. (Days and hours vary for each. Only Orchard House is open year-round, but 
all of the houses can be visited through the end of October.) 
</P>
<P>
 Louisa May Alcott, who could be less than reverential about Concord, nicknamed 
Orchard House "Apple Slump." Alcott was a grown woman of 26 in 1858, when her 
family moved into the property, two 18th-Century houses her father had joined 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard House served as the setting for Louisa May's most famous and enduring 
work, "Little Women," an idealization of her own family, published in two 
volumes (1868-69). (The four adolescent March daughters were modeled on the 
four Alcott girls, and fiercely independent tomboy Jo -- every little girl's 
favorite March daughter -- was Louisa's fictional rendition of herself.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Alcotts struggled with poverty. Bronson Alcott, a philosopher, writer and 
educator who was considered brilliant by some, a flake by others, was unable to 
support his family. The burden fell on Louisa, and with the great success of 
"Little Women" (which she was reluctant to write) and subsequent volumes such 
as "Little Men," the second-oldest Alcott daughter -- who never married -- 
became famous and financially comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pleasant surprises at Orchard House, furnished with Alcott family 
pieces, is the wealth of artwork by May Alcott, the youngest daughter. Take 
note of the owl she painted on the wall in Louisa's room right above the 
fireplace (also don't miss the writing desk Bronson built for his writer 
daughter). And May's room is charming, decorated as it is by sketches of 
classical scenes the young artist drew right on her bedroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1879, two years after the Alcotts moved out of Orchard House, Bronson 
Alcott founded the Concord School of Philosophy on the hillside behind the 
house. It still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade before Bronson Alcott bought Orchard House, he moved his 
then-young family into a small, circa-1700 farmhouse in Concord that he dubbed 
"Hillside." Alcott enlarged the house, which his family lived in from 1845 to 
1848. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the house is known as the "home of authors," and the informative tour 
leads visitors through several centuries of Concord literary and architectural 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Hawthorne bought the house -- which he renamed "the Wayside," a name 
that stuck -- from Bronson Alcott in 1852. The Hawthornes' chief contribution 
to the house is a bizarre tower study built for the author of "The Scarlet 
Letter." 
</P>
<P>
 The next of the authors to live at the Wayside was Harriet Lothrop, who wrote 
the Five Little Peppers books under the pen name Margaret Sidney. The Lothrop 
family lived in the Wayside from 1883 to 1965, and the house was left to the 
National Park Service with its original furnishings, including some Alcott and 
Hawthorne family pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Waldo Emerson, essayist and poet (including "The Concord Hymn"), was the 
leading spokesman of the Transcendental movement, which believed in the 
mystical unity of nature and emphasized individualism, self-reliance and 
rejection of traditional authority. One of Emerson's disciples was Thoreau, who 
lived in Emerson's home from 1841 to 1843, before spiriting himself away to 
Walden Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alcotts were admirers and friends of Emerson (Bronson being a fellow 
Transcendentalist), and Louisa May idolized him. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson lived in this sturdy white house with his second wife and children 
from 1835 until his death in 1882; it is furnished with Emerson family pieces 
and preserved very much as it was at the time of Emerson's death. (The contents 
and furnishings of Emerson's study are now housed in the Concord Museum across 
the street, but the study in the house has been re-created to look as it did 
when Emerson was alive.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Emerson's personal effects are on display, including his walking 
sticks and gowns he wore on his famous lecture tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The handsome, stately Old Manse is a monument to Concord's dual historical 
legacy -- both Revolutionary and literary. It was built in 1770 by the Rev. 
William Emerson, Ralph Waldo's grandfather. No doubt the inhabitants of the 
house heard the famous shots fired in 1775 at Old North Bridge, just across a 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson lived in the house with his mother from 1834 to 1835, until he married 
Lydia Jackson and moved into a home on the Cambridge Turnpike. (Emerson wrote 
his Transcendentalist essay "Nature" in the Old Manse's study during this 
period.) 
</P>
<P>
 But a much stronger literary association belongs to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who 
rented the Old Manse from then-owner Samuel Ripley for the first three blissful 
years (1842-45) of his marriage to Sophia Peabody. Here Hawthorne wrote "Mosses 
From an Old Manse," and here the happy newlyweds scratched inscriptions (using 
Sophia's diamond) into the windowpanes. Hawthorne enjoyed friendships with 
Emerson and Thoreau while living in Concord. After returning for a time to 
Hawthorne's native Salem, Mass., the Hawthornes moved back to Concord in 1852 
and lived in the Wayside. Hawthorne died in 1864. GUIDEBOOK

HIKING: SOUTH LAKE TAHOE; A HIGH SIERRA SOAK AT GROVER HOT SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grover Hot Springs State Park in the High Sierra likes to pamper hikers. After 
a long day on the park's scenic trails just south of Lake Tahoe, a hot springs 
awaits tired muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect a Baden-Baden-style luxury resort. Grover Hot Springs is your 
basic soak. The effect is rather like a 1950s-vintage back-yard swimming pool. 
Bathers can sit in a hot pool (102 to 105 degrees) fed by six mineral springs 
or in a cool pool. The pools and changing rooms are the extent of the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked in Hot Springs Valley and flanked on three sides by Sierra Nevada 
peaks, Grover Hot Springs' scenery is as soothing as its water. Granite peaks, 
including 10,023-foot Hawkins Peak to the northwest and 9,419-foot Markleeville 
Peak to the southwest, form an inspiring backdrop to an area that's been 
attracting visitors since the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state park, hot springs aficionados can read up on the exact mineral 
content of Grover Hot Springs and find out just how many grams per gallon of 
magnesium carbonate and sodium sulfate the waters hold. Unlike most other hot 
springs, Grover contains almost none of that nose-wrinkling sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors come to this out-of-the-way park for the waters, not the 
walking. That's too bad, because the park and surrounding national forest boast 
some inspiring footpaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy family hikes include a nature trail -- called Transition Walk -- that 
loops around the park's alpine meadow and a three-mile round-trip walk to a 
waterfall on Hot Springs Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 A more ambitious trail for those in good condition is the hike to Burnside 
Lake in adjacent Toiyabe National Forest. Burnside Trail crosses the state 
park, then ascends through a pine forest to the alpine lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From California 89 in Markleeville (a half-hour 
drive from South Lake Tahoe), turn west on Hot Springs Road and travel 3 1/2 
miles to Grover Hot Springs State Park. You can park at the pool, then walk to 
the trail head, or proceed past the park entrance to the overflow parking area 
and the signed trail head at the north end of Quaking Aspen Campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: The path parallels Hot Springs Creek, which flows year-round through 
the park's large meadow. Some of the trout stocked in the creek are caught by 
campers for supper, though more serious anglers head for the nearby Carson 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 The quaking aspen that fringe the meadow are particularly spectacular in 
autumn, when the fluttering leaves turn orange and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 A short mile's walk from the trail head brings you to a signed junction. The 
trail to the waterfall branches left from here, leading along Hot Springs 
Creek. Some minor rock climbing leads to an overlook above the small but 
vigorous falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnside Trail enters the forest and ascends a mile to another junction, this 
one with Charity Valley Trail, which heads south along Charity Valley Creek. 
Soon thereafter, Burnside Trail crosses Burnside Creek and climbs northwest, 
switching up steep slopes cloaked with Jeffrey pine and white fir. Near the 
top, you'll get a grand, over-the-shoulder view of Hot Springs Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The last mile of this hike resembles the first mile -- a walk through meadow 
land. The meadow below Burnside Lake is much wetter than the one in the state 
park, however, so stay on the trail. You'll keep your boots dry and help 
protect the fragile meadow ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulders perched above the shore make fine picnic spots and inspiring places 
from which to contemplate pretty Burnside Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Grover Hot Springs pool entrance fees: $4 for adults, $2 for children under 
18. Hours: 2 to 9 p.m. weekdays, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends. Burnside Trail 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Grover Hot Springs State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrain: Alpine meadows, east side of Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Distance: To waterfall is 3 miles round trip; to Burnside Lake is 10 miles 
round trip with 2,100-foot elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights: Hidden lake, soothing soak in hot springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Degree of difficulty: Moderate to strenuous.

DESTINATION: NEW YORK; A WALK THROUGH AMERICA'S MELTING POT; IMMIGRANTS PAST 
AND PRESENT LEAVE A LEGACY ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In wave after wave, millions of immigrants from throughout the world have 
swept through New York City's Lower East Side for more than a century and a 
half, bequeathing the neighborhood a rich -- make that notorious -- historic 
legacy, wonderful (and inexpensive) ethnic cafes and teeming streets. 
Everywhere, touches of the Old World catch the eye, and yet few places anywhere 
are so fundamental to the all-American story. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the nation becomes embroiled in a heated debate on its immigration 
policies and practices, it is a particularly appropriate time to explore this 
curious, multicultural neighborhood at the southeastern end of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a visit, if only for a few hours, is a powerful reminder that this is a 
nation created mostly by immigrants -- many of whom arrived on these shores 
uneducated and impoverished and began their hope-filled scramble for a new and 
better life in the hurly-burly mix of the Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 You can go to the Lower East Side on your own or under the tutelage of expert 
guides -- I did both -- and what you get is a fascinating history lesson and 
plenty of opportunities for ethnic snacking. Over a long weekend recently, I 
paused for afternoon biscotti and strong espresso in a coffeehouse in Little 
Italy; tried my first-ever hot bialy, a sort of doughy bagel, at a 
flour-on-the-floor bakery in the old Jewish Lower East Side; and shared plates 
of dim sum, the tasty Chinese dumplings, in a crowded little cafe in Chinatown 
-- which today is the most vibrant and colorful area of the Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish markets and vegetable stalls crowd Chinatown's sidewalks in a jumble as 
exotic as Hong Kong. One man garbed in a butcher's apron hurried down Mott 
Street, the heart of Chinatown, carrying what looked like a freshly skinned 
lamb over his shoulder. The scent of incense wafted from the Eastern States 
Buddhist Temple at 64 Mott St., where I paid a dollar to pluck from a basket a 
piece of paper with a fortune printed on it. The probability of my success, it 
said, is "poor." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly restored Ellis Island Immigration Museum, situated just off the 
southern tip of Manhattan, has become a very popular tourist site. Overlooking 
the Statue of Liberty, the engaging history museum details the mighty flood of 
immigrants that entered the United States through the island's famous portals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lower East Side is the sometimes-tragic, often-inspirational sequel -- the 
tale of what happened to the newcomers once they left Ellis Island behind. Both 
places can be visited in a day trip, but stretching it over two days is better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an introduction to the Lower East Side, I sampled three of the several 
two-hour walking tours of the neighborhood offered weekends throughout the year 
by Big Onion Walking Tours. The company is run by Seth Kamil and Ed O'Donnell, 
both Columbia University students and teachers of immigration history who are 
helping to pay for their doctoral studies as tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamil, who is Jewish, concentrates on the Jewish streets of the Lower East 
Side -- once the world's largest Jewish settlement -- and on the mile-long 
Bowery, the neighborhood's once-bawdy, now mostly run-down thoroughfare. 
O'Donnell, who is of Irish descent and a member of the American Irish 
Historical Society, highlights Irish New York, which includes several churches 
and the former sites of Tammany Hall and the old Five Points slum, reputedly 
the roughest and most crowded in the city in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamil and O'Donnell also sweep in and out of Little Italy, Chinatown and the 
other overlapping ethnic pockets that together form the Lower East Side. One of 
their major themes is how the neighborhood continues to be recycled in a 
process of decline and rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 By Big Onion's broad definition -- encompassing Chinatown and Little Italy -- 
the Lower East Side roughly covers an area that is bounded on the north by 14th 
Street, on the south by Chatham Square near City Hall, on the east by the East 
River and on the west by Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowery slices the neighborhood from north to south. Historically, Little 
Ireland and Little Italy predominated west of the Bowery; much of the Jewish 
community was found east of the Bowery. Today, immigrants from many Asian 
nations form Chinatown, which is located mostly west of the Bowery. Latino, 
African and other ethnic groups have replaced most of the former Jewish 
residents to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarly pair does not overlook the harsh side of life in the Lower East 
Side, past and present. Our tour group peered through the window into what 
Kamil described as a modern-day "sweatshop," one of many crowded clothing 
factories where poor immigrants from Southeast Asia are said to labor at piece 
work at below minimum wages. We also stood in front of several $7- and 
$8-a-night so-called "flophouses" on the Bowery, where the homeless with a few 
bucks can rent a room of their own. Kamil's research suggests the Bowery has 
been a sanctuary for the homeless since the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is not new," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On my own, I sought out the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, which is 
restoring two apartments in a six-story brick tenement building at 97 Orchard 
St., a street in the Jewish area lined with inexpensive clothing shops and 
considered one of Manhattan's best bargain-hunting districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1863 to house 22 families, the building lacked heat and offered in 
the way of plumbing only outdoor privies and a water pump. Historian Suzanne 
Wasserman, who leads tours of the building, characterizes the tenement as an 
example of "the worst housing built in America." A plaque outside sadly notes 
that "for millions of immigrants from scores of nations, this tenement and 
others like it was a place of first settlement in America." 
</P>
<P>
 On a cheerier note, the same plaque pays a belated tribute to the tenement 
residents, who undoubtedly suffered economic, racial or religious 
discrimination when they were forced to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We salute them," says the marker, "as our urban pioneers on the municipal 
frontier." As the grandson of a Danish immigrant, I added my own quiet salute 
to the authors of that sentiment. Once the tours were over, I spent hours 
walking the streets of the Lower East Side taking in the unusual sights much as 
I would in a foreign city -- for, to me, the neighborhood seemed as intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Orchard Street in the old Jewish community, shopkeepers hang clothing and 
other merchandise from overhead racks that reach over the sidewalk so thickly 
they form a pedestrian tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Co. at 75 Mott St. in Chinatown, I saw imported 
teas that sell for as much as $130 a pound. A clerk offered up a sample of tart 
plum tea, priced at considerably less. At the Pearl River Mart, a Chinese 
department store at 277 Canal St., I almost bought a giant, papier-mache dragon 
head -- the brightly painted sort one would wear as a dragon in a Chinese New 
Year parade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big Onion's weekend walking tours cost $9 per person, and no reservations are 
needed. You simply show up at the appointed meeting place -- which can be the 
entrance to City Hall, a famous statue or, on Kamil's excursion into "Immigrant 
New York," the entrance to the Olympia Restaurant at Essex and Delancey 
streets. The tour is a multiethnic stroll through the Jewish Lower East Side, 
Chinatown, Little Italy and what used to be called Little Germany, Little 
Africa and Little Ireland. The emphasis is on the contribution the immigrants 
made to New York, and to the nation. This particular tour wraps into a single, 
two-hour package a portion of the itineraries Big Onion covers in more detail 
in some of its other tours, such as "Jewish Lower East Side," "The Bowery" and 
"Irish New York." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Immigrant" tour, which I took in December, whetted my appetite, and on a 
return visit to New York recently I also joined Kamil's "Bowery" tour and 
followed O'Donnell through "Irish New York." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1910s, Essex and Delancey streets formed the heart of the Jewish 
settlement, explained Kamil on the initial tour. More than half a million 
Jewish immigrants from Europe lived in the community. It soon became an 
overcrowded slum with residents packed into dark, unhealthy tenements. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, no more than 11,000 Jews reside in the area. Many of the old tenement 
buildings, like the Tenement Museum, are still standing but are boarded up. But 
a number of Jewish-owed shops remain in business. Undoubtedly, the most famous 
of them is Guss's Pickles at 35 Essex St., which was prominently featured in 
the movie "Crossing Delancey."  
</P>
<P>
 From the Jewish streets, the tour crossed into Chinatown. The first stop, at 
Hester Street and the Bowery, was "The Wall of Respect for the Working People 
of Chinatown." It is a vivid, two-story mural on the wall of a brick building 
that portrays a giant dragon. At its tail are scenes of laborers at work in the 
rice fields of Asia; at its head are depicted the many occupations Asian 
immigrants have tackled in their new homeland -- waiter, cook, seamstress, 
laborer and student, among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Here Kamil paused to offer up a brief history of the Bowery, which is the 
subject of his academic dissertation. In New York's early years, the Bowery was 
the city's finest street. But in the 19th Century, as European immigrants 
poured in, it became a bawdy area of saloons, brothels and inexpensive 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid in the '40s, I was a fan of "The Bowery Boys" movies, which depicted 
the Bowery as lively and exciting. For much of its mile length today, however, 
it is a way-stop for the homeless; Kamil said he has counted 16 flophouses on 
the Bowery. But there also are bright spots to tempt visitors. At the north 
end, Amato Opera at 319 Bowery, a tiny little opera house, is in its 46th 
season, and all seats (weekends only) are just $16. 
</P>
<P>
 At the southern end, near Chatham Square, is the city's "lighting district," a 
couple of blocks where most of the shops sell lamps and chandeliers of all 
types. This was once Little Ireland, and Kamil pointed down Pell Street, as 
O'Donnell does on his Irish tour, to Pell's Dinty, an old Irish saloon that is 
now Chinese owned. On a big sign out front, the original name is printed in 
small letters beneath larger Chinese characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinatown, which is growing, is the largest Chinese-American community in 
America, and in many ways it looks more like the old country than the new. 
Street lamps are topped with pagoda-like caps, and street signs all carry 
Chinese characters beneath the name in English. Mott Street is the main street, 
but adjacent streets are almost as colorful. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grand Street, Chinatown gives way to the remnants of Little Italy, now 
primarily a three-block-long strip of Italian restaurants, coffeehouses, 
bakeries and other food shops along Mulberry Street. Kamil ended our 
"Immigrants" tour at Caffe Roma at Mulberry and Broome streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Onion duo regards this old-fashioned coffeehouse as the best place in 
Little Italy for Italian pastries and cappuccino, and I won't argue with them. 
I've been back three times now. 
</P>
<P>
 I left the Lower East Side with a troubled mind, which I suppose is what the 
Big Onion team and the Tenement Museum hoped would happen. As we debate the 
nation's immigration policy, it is a good thing to be reminded that not so long 
ago millions of impoverished newcomers endured the hardships of the Lower East 
Side and then went on to contribute to the strength of America. Indeed, the 
process continues today. GUIDEBOOK

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; NO MORE SMOKING ON THE ZEPHYR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amtrak has turned on the no-smoking signs on the California Zephyr/Desert 
Wind/Pioneer as part of its expansion of "smoke-free" service. 
</P>
<P>
 Permission to smoke on the Zephyr, which serves Chicago, Oakland, Los Angeles 
and Seattle, was discontinued on May 1, when Amtrak instituted smoke-free 
policies on all short and medium-distance day-time trains and some 
long-distance overnight trains.Amtrak will allow smoking stops at designated 
stations along the route. With this change, 82% of all Amtrak trains will be 
smoke free, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
 "While the majority of our customers are demanding a smoke-free environment, 
we recognize that we may lose valuable customers who will find our new policy 
too restrictive," said Robert E. Gall, vice president of marketing and sales. 
"Unfortunately, providing separate smoking cars . . . is not a feasible option 
given the high cost and shortage of cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is now allowed only in some cars on three trains serving the region: 
the Sunset Limited, which serves L.A., New Orleans and Miami and the Southwest 
Chief and Texas Eagle, both of which operate between L.A. and Chicago. The 
Coast Starlight, which operates between Los Angeles and Seattle, is smoke free.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; VEGETARIAN FARE IN EVERY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Have Sprouts, Will Travel" is your motto, take a taste of the "Vegetarian 
Journal's Guide to Natural Foods Restaurants in the U.S. and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 The 270-page paperback serves up more than 2,000 vegetarian and natural-foods 
restaurants in all 50 states, although you may want to pack a lunch if you're 
bound for Idaho or South Dakota -- according to the guide, each state has only 
one vegetarian establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although vegan and natural foods are the chief bill of fare, the guide also 
lists a variety of ethnic offerings. In the back are lists of vegetarian travel 
services and tours, camps and, if all else fails, people and organizations you 
can contact for more information in 31 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide is available for $13 (including postage and handling) from the 
Vegetarian Resource Group, P.O. Box 1463, Baltimore, Md. 21203. Information: 
(410) 366-8343.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fashion designers, depending on their mood and their era, move waistlines up 
or down or just ignore them.They've been doing this since the 18th Century, 
which is the starting point for "Waist Not," on exhibit at the Costume 
Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Aug. 21. " 'Waist Not' goes 
beyond the traditional costume exhibition to tell a larger story -- that of the 
cultural definition of the body and self-esteem," says curator Richard Martin. 
Two of the styles on display are by Paul Poiret, left, Pauline Trigere, right.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; GAMBLING ABOARD ALASKA CRUISE SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gambling was to have been banned on all cruise ships off Alaska this year, but 
last week a last-minute bill was passed by both of the state's legislative 
houses that would allow the floating casinos to continue operating while in 
coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 At press time Wednesday the bill was headed for the governor's office.The bill 
will go into effect immediately if Gov. Walter J. Hickel signs it within 20 
days of receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska has not allowed gambling since 1978, but some foreign-flagged ships 
(which include most cruise ships) have been ignoring the ban. The U.S. Attorney 
last summer ordered cruise ships to close casinos while in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new legislation would allow shipboard gambling, it imposes 
several restrictions. Casinos could be open on those ships with at least 300 
berths, and those that are primarily involved in sightseeing and provide 
gambling only as an ancillary activity and only to ticketed passengers. They 
would have to close their casinos when in port.  
</P>
<P>
 Cruise ships must receive an exemption from the state to offer gambling at 
fees ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 per ship per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost will be worth it, said Ray Pedersen, president of Princess Tours, a 
division of Princess Cruises which is based in Seattle and handles land 
arrangements for the cruise line. The company worked to have the legislation 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sightseeing is the main reason most travelers cruise to Alaska, 
Pedersen said, gambling is a draw and if it's not available travelers may opt 
for other cruise destinations.

VIDEOS: JOURNEYS TO ARIZONA, YOSEMITE AND GREECE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ARIZONA (International Video Network Video Visits, 55 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 Arizona is a land of contrasts -- vast open deserts, canyons and buttes to 
snow-capped mountains and forests. This video provides dramatic samplings of 
the state's natural wonders and its major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The film tour begins in Phoenix with a stop at its Heard Museum, noted for 
exhibits of Native American relics and art, including kachina dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucson reflects Mexican heritage in its architecture and Old West traditions. 
Stops are made at San Xavier del Bac Mission, Tucson Mountain Park, Saguaro 
National Monument and the Sonoran Desert with its wildflowers, cacti and 
spectacular sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
 In central Arizona, viewers see Prescott and Flagstaff; the ruins of Montezuma 
Castle National Monument; beautiful Oak Creek Canyon and Jerome, a ghost town 
turned artists' colony; Tonto National Monument, and the tribal dances of the 
White Mountain Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera then follows the Colorado River from Lake Powell and Glen Canyon, 
Utah, to the Grand Canyon, then down Arizona's western border through Lake 
Mead, the Hoover Dam, Lake Mohave, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu and Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northeastern part of the state are the 25,000-square-mile Navajo and 
Hopi lands, where viewers see ruins and watch craft demonstrations of rug 
weaving and sand painting. Then it's on to the spectacular monoliths of 
Monument Valley, the cliff dwellings at Canyon de Chelly National Monument, the 
Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest. 
</P>
<P>

 FOUR SEASONS OF YOSEMITE (Finlay-Holiday Films, 45 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 The grandeur of Yosemite National Park is beautifully filmed in this 
four-seasons visit to the valley and Sierra high country.  
</P>
<P>
 The film opens on an ethereal, mist-filled valley; as the mist disperses, the 
sun reveals a dazzling display of spring wildflowers -- poppies, lupine and 
dogwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Up in the high country, the snow lingers, slowly melting and filling the 
streams and rivers that feed the valley's famous waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding the valley are granite cliffs such as Half Dome, El Capitan and 
Cathedral Rock, where hardy rock climbers seek adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 An early morning excursion captures scenes of wildlife and a hiking trip takes 
viewers to two waterfalls not seen from the valley floor, Vernal Falls and 
Nevada Falls. Brilliant scarlet snow plants contrast with grand sequoias in the 
Mariposa Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 There are stunning summertime views from Glacier Point, 3,200 feet above the 
valley floor, and film of hikers, bikers and river rafters. Scenes compare 
waterfalls in spring and summer. High-country scenery includes lakes, the Tioga 
Pass, Tuolumne Meadows, Soda Springs and hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from Finlay-Holiday Film Corp., P.O. Box 610, Whittier, 
Calif. 90608; tel. (800) 345-6707. Price: $29.95 (plus tax and postage).

</P>
<P>
 GREECE (Fodor's Video Guide, 92 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of Fodor's compact travel packages for the travel planner. 
Included are a 65-minute travelogue covering major tourist sights; a narration 
filled with history, mythology, the arts and archeology, and a 27-minute 
segment devoted to travel tips.  
</P>
<P>
 A traveler's handbook provides maps and information on restaurants, hotels, 
currency, night life, culture and customs, and language phrases. Interviews 
with citizens give a personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour of Athens covers many of the traditional tourist sites -- such as the 
Acropolis and the Temple of Athena Nike -- plus street scenes, shops and cafes 
that reflect the historic relationship between Greece and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the Greek islands first visits Crete, where viewers see the immense 
architectural remains of the Palace at Knosos and hear the legend of King 
Minos. 
</P>
<P>
 Other islands include Santorini, which some say is the site of the lost city 
of Atlantis; excavations at Akrotiri, dating back 5,000 years; Corfu, a 
tranquil island resort, and Rhodes, where the ancient and modern combine.  
</P>
<P>

("Walks With Wordsworth," April 3), but missed mention of the splendid guide, 
"Wordsworth and the Lake District," by David McCracken, professor of English at 
the University of Washington. More detailed maps of your walks, for example, 
may be found in McCracken's book (which is out of print in the United States, 
but is available in England and by special order from Oxford University Press, 
New York City).

 Your "expert's" advice in "Travel Insider" ("Dollars Buy More Again in 
Europe," April 17), surprised me since he did not mention the benefits of using 
a credit card when traveling. In 95% of the instances that I have used a credit 
card in Europe, I have "made money" when the bills finally come in to be paid.

 Regarding the complaint by a tourist (who found the horseback ride into Petra 
tough going and said he would have taken a shuttle bus if one had been 
available) ("Letters," March 27): To do so, one would miss the approach to the 
valley along the entranceway below the narrow fissure (through rock formations 
that rise several hundred feet alongsid the original aqueduct) and the view of 
the magnificent carved sandstone Treasury. I will never forget the impact of 
the approaching scene.Nor will I forget the climb, led by a Bedouin, scaling 
cliff walls so high that the people on horseback below looked like toys. Our 
guide, who had toured most of the world and was living happily in a nearby 
village, was so eager for us to see the 2,000-year-old ruins of which he was so 
proud. I am glad I was then physically able to accompany him to share his pride 
in his homeland.

 Trekkers, climbers and rapids-shooters like to know what time it is every bit 
as much as anyone else -- and it is for such hardy sporting types that Timex 
has produced its Expedition Series of sports watches. These are serious 
instruments, outfitted with compasses, chronographs, alarms and more.One of the 
most unusual is the new 73701S, equipped with a ratcheting compass directional 
ring for orienteering (or just finding your way out of the woods), a 24-hour 
chronograph, indicators for three time zones and a 24-hour countdown timer, 
among other things -- everything, it might be said, but a catchy name. The 
watch case and strap (of polypropylene, leather or water-resistant leather) 
come in tan, charcoal, teal or rust. Available at Sports Chalet, Mervyn's, 
Chick's and Robinsons-May stores, as well as individual retail outlets, 
Expedition Series watches start at $39.95, with the 73701S retailing for 
$54.95.Anna Scotti

 Look! Up in the sky! It's. . . . Well, it's a few dozen gas-filled air bags 
with gondolas attached, streaking -- OK, drifting -- across the sky! It's the 
7th annual hot-air balloon race at the Del Mar Fair in Del Mar, held in the 
waning daylight of the Fourth of July. The pre-race action starts at 6 p.m., as 
spectators gather to watch the competing craft being filled to the music of the 
U.S. Navy Band.Launch is at 7:10 p.m., with the race lasting about an hour, 
until sunset. Balloons screech to a halt, as it were, out of sight of the 
audience, but a fireworks display starts up immediately to keep fans 
entertained until the winner can be announced. (The point of a balloon race 
isn't speed, but the accuracy with which the competitors can hit their landing 
spot.) Admission to the race is free with admission to the fair, which is $7 
for adults, $4 for senior citizens, $2 for children 6 to 12, free for 
under-sixers. Sun Surfer, the Del Mar balloon shop that organizes the event, 
also invites fair-goers to join one of the race teams and actually ride along 
in a balloon, for $125 per person. Call (619) 793-5555 for information about 
the Del Mar Fair and for directions to the fairgrounds.Anna Scotti

 Each August, tens of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts from all over America 
descend on Sturgis, South Dakota. For more than 50 years, this small town just 
outside Rapid City has welcomed them, temporarily swelling its population from 
about 5,000 residents to more than 100,000 devotees of the art of the 
motorcycle.Included in this number are everyone from hard-core Hell's Angels to 
bike-loving doctors and schoolteachers -- anyone who likes to ride. Some come 
individually, but most come in droves, shattering the quiet of the Black Hills 
with a roar of engines echoing across the rolling landscape. Everyone has fun, 
and drug use and fights are surprisingly rare. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54th Annual Sturgis Rally & Races will be held this Aug. 7-13. Cyclists 
will enjoy demonstration rides, concerts and what is billed as the world's 
largest motorcycle show. But there are other attractions: Garland Black, 61, of 
Brunswick, Ohio, has been a rider for 30 years. He comes to Sturgis, he says, 
for "lots of noise and excitement." Ronnie Owens, from Wagoner, Okla., and a 
25-year veteran biker (and vocational school director), adds: "It's kind of 
like the Grand Canyon. You can't describe it to people. You have to see it for 
yourself."Gary Friedman

TRAVELING IN STYLE; PATHS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In summer, the sky opens up; it's brighter, and for longer. The road opens up, 
too. No more barriers of bad weather; no more forced detours through 
family-obligation holidays.In summer, you can just get up and go. I remember 
one August when two friends of mine in Rome left on a whim for a vacation on 
the Neapolitan coast, riding on a motor scooter, wearing nothing but their 
bathing suits. The woman of the couple packed for both of them, stuffing little 
more than toothbrushes, suntan lotion and a couple of T-shirts in her purse. 
Now that's summer travel, I remember thinking. Most of us probably need to pack 
a bit more than that when we set off for someplace summery today, and to plan 
ahead a bit more -- but there's no reason why we can't travel with a bit of 
that same just-do-it spirit. If summer is a time for just getting up and going, 
it's also the ideal season for doing something once we get there -- preferably 
something active, and out of doors. We Southern Californians are particularly 
good at such pursuits. It might be something genuinely challenging -- hiking 
and canoeing along the course of an Arctic river, for instance, or cycling 
through the underpopulated hills of northern Scotland. It might be more 
contemplative, like waiting on a riverbank in Maine for that inscrutable salmon 
to bite. It might even be framed in pure self-indulgence: Ride an elephant in 
Thailand in the morning, then shop the afternoon away. The paths of summer can 
lead anywhere at all.Colman Andrews

TRAVELING IN STYLE; HIGHLAND WHEELING; A CYCLING TRIP ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND 
PASSES THROUGH SPECTACULAR COUNTRYSIDE AND UNDER (AND SOMETIMES INTO) STUNNING 
SKIES

<P>
 OUTSIDE KYLE OF TONGUE, MY CYCLING mate, Haddon Curtis, left the road and took 
flight. It looked pretty sensational, really. Having freewheeled down one of 
those hills that make the Scottish Highlands both a pleasure and a struggle to 
cycle, he had reached the bottom, let out his usual manic yell of excitement 
and then, instead of stopping, careened over an embankment. Haddon's Puch 
rocketed one way, Haddon's pannier another and Haddon himself a third. Then 
they all disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the worst, I rushed to the embankment and looked over the edge. A soft 
bog had broken Haddon's fall. He was lying on his back, not hurt at all, and 
laughing wildly. I was quite sure he wanted to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 The only damage, it appeared, was not to Haddon but to his Puch's front wheel. 
This posed a bit of a problem: We were only halfway across the Highlands, in 
the middle of nowhere, with few cars passing and practically no places of 
business in the vicinity -- apart from a fortuitously placed youth hostel. The 
nearest town in which we might get the wheel fixed was Thurso, a day's ride 
behind us. Haddon proposed that he hitchhike back there while I stay at the 
hostel. Tomorrow, he'd return and we'd continue westward. Muddy but otherwise 
intact, he set out with his mangled wheel in hand. I pushed/carried our 
bike-and-a-half to the hostel and checked in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WHY HAD HADDON BEEN JETTISONED so spectacularly from his bicycle? I'm not sure 
-- but it might well have had something to do with the Highland skies. Instead 
of watching the road, he had probably been looking heavenward. The sky around 
here was so magnificent, you just had to look at it. The blues, the whites and 
the silver linings were mixed to perfect effect. Below them lay kyles, lochs, 
muirs or firths, each body of water so still that you could see the sky twice, 
the second time reflected in a surface broken only by an occasional excited 
trout or salmon. Sometimes a single boat would lie, immobile, on these glassy 
surfaces, but no human beings appeared to cast a line or dip an oar. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip had been Haddon's idea. A madcap friend from Dundee, a scientist, 
he'd suggested last summer that we bicycle across the Highlands and then cross 
over to the Outer Hebrides by ferry, and bike and ferry down their length -- a 
journey of about 450 miles in all, fully two-thirds of it on two wheels.  
</P>
<P>
 We took the train north from Dundee, a busy seaport about 60 miles north of 
Edinburgh. Most of the passengers got off at Inverness or -- if they possessed 
a bike, a tent and some energy to climb mountains -- at the resort at Aviemore 
in the Grampian Mountains. By the time we reached Georgemas Junction, where the 
line splits for Wick and Thurso, the train was almost empty. Almost, but not 
quite. Across from me sat two middle-aged women, each with a backpack. One, who 
was wearing sensible shoes but too much lipstick, talked incessantly, while her 
friend looked out the window. It was about the last English I'd easily 
understand for two weeks. If the language spoken by people in these northern 
reaches of Great Britain isn't Gaelic, it might as well be; the accent is that 
thick. Gaelic, of course, is worse. Signs, in that tongue and in English, 
showed me that right away. Tarbert on Harris is Tairbeart. Creagorry on Uist is 
Creagh Ghoraidh. "Failte d'on Ghaidhealtachd" -- a haggis for any non-Scot who 
can pronounce that perfectly -- means "Welcome to the Highlands." 
</P>
<P>
 When we reached Wick, the last station on the line, we retrieved our bicycles 
from the baggage car and set off. Though it was already late in the afternoon, 
we had plenty of time before nightfall. In summer, the sun sets late in 
Scotland, after 10 p.m. -- which, for a cyclist, means at least 16 hours of 
good riding time every day. 
</P>
<P>
 We rode for about 15 miles and then stopped for a dinner of fish and chips in 
John o'Groats, a town less famous for its food than for its position as one of 
the most northerly points in Great Britain. Here, many a cyclist has ended or 
begun a country-long trip from or to Land's End, on England's far southwestern 
tip. We headed north and then west instead, and by sunset we were in Hey. Here 
we found a barn furnished with six-foot-high bales of hay, and, with the 
farmer's permission, unfolded our sleeping bags and passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, the farmer pointed out a castle across the way, where, he 
said, the Queen Mother vacationed in the summer. The weather up here never got 
too hot, he added, but never too cold either. When we pedaled off at 8:30 a.m., 
Hey was still quiet. The only sign of activity was a milkman delivering cartons 
along a hedge. We bought several pints from him and then set off along the road 
for the Bridge of Forss.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see many visitors here," remarked the woman in charge of a shop 
where we stopped for provisions along the way. I found this hard to believe, 
considering the breathtaking scenery. Perhaps, I thought, she meant that few 
people stopped at her shop, which lay well-concealed in an old mill behind some 
trees. But later I realized she meant the entire region. Tourists just don't 
bother to come this far north in the Highlands. Inverness? Definitely. 
Aviemore, the Island of Skye, Plockton and Kyle of Lochalsh? Yes. But the 
Bridge of Forss? Apparently not. We kept thinking that we'd hit the crowds over 
the next hill. But until the 13th day of our 15-day journey, we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars were rare, and cyclists were rarer. When they did pass by, vehicles 
always gave us a wide berth, and then usually honked. At the sound of the horn, 
the sheep that inevitably stood behind fences along the roadside would look up, 
comical expressions on their faces. Their coats were sometimes so long they 
hung to the ground, with their necks daubed in greens, reds and blues, their 
owners' "brands." The closest thing to a traffic jam we encountered was a 
road-blocking flock of sheep being led home. When we asked their owner if we 
could take his picture, he said yes -- but added that he'd been photographed 
"more than John Wayne" already that day.  
</P>
<P>
 The roads were narrow and smooth, winding around hills and into tiny villages. 
Golden fields exploded with purple heather and yellow buttercups. A red postbox 
stood out clearly from miles away because it was so solitary and bright. 
Occasionally, we'd come upon a little post office that doubled as a grocery 
store and pharmacy. Sometimes there were no towns where my A to Z map of 
Britain said they would be: Ardvourlie and Eriboll, for instance, we never 
found. But places like Clashnessie, Stoer and Drumbeg more than made up for the 
ones that weren't there. Each was so wonderful -- narrow lanes lined with 
picture-book cottages, all surrounded by golden fields neatly defined by rock 
walls -- that, more than a few times, I was convinced it couldn't be improved 
upon. But then the next village came along, and I realized that I'd been wrong. 
 
</P>
<P>
 After several days of riding through this countryside, it occurred to me that 
there was one aspect of the landscape that might deter some cyclists from 
traversing the Highlands: the gradient. The hills weren't particularly high, 
but they were plentiful, and the roads up them were long; those with 
underdeveloped calves would invariably end up pushing their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't mind the uphills myself. And Haddon reveled in the descents. Which, 
of course, is how he ended up flying into the bog near the Kyle of Tongue. By 
the following morning, though, he was back, his wheel unmangled, and not long 
after sunrise we were once again pedaling under those wondrous skies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HADDON AND I HAD SETTLED INTO A PATTERN. BY 8 EACH MORNING, WE were already on 
the road. We'd cycle for at least an hour before stopping for breakfast -- 
muesli or a breakfast bar -- always in a field overlooking the sea or a kyle, a 
loch or a muir. Lunch, around 1 p.m., was usually a picnic of bread, cheese and 
ham, once again eaten in a field with a view of water. If we happened to spot a 
place that served tea, either around 11 in the morning or 3 in the afternoon, 
we'd usually stop and order a pot -- with, of course, a plate of shortbread to 
accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
 We always planned our ride so that by 7 or so in the evening, we'd arrive in a 
village with a pub. Here we'd sip Guinness or Tartan Special Bitter and eat 
seafood, usually haddock or scampi. Once fed and warmed by the beer, we would 
ride our last stretch for the evening. Then, with an hour or two of light still 
at our disposal, we'd go in search of a barn for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Over dinner at a pub in Durness, we met a ruddy-faced local who'd just come in 
from a day of fishing. He must have had a good haul, if his jovial air was 
anything to go by. He offered us first a whisky -- "a thumbful of The Famous 
Grouse for the lads," he said to the landlord as he knocked back his own 
tumbler of the stuff -- then some advice: "When you cycle," he said, "you must 
set yourself a goal -- like Seb Coe and Steve Cramm when they run a race. Tell 
yourself you're going to reach Rhiconich or Ullapool -- and then do it." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, we did indeed set Rhiconich as our goal -- and did indeed do it. 
Outside the village, about a mile off the road, we spied a grand manor house, 
the sort of monument to wealth you don't see much of this far north, where 
houses tend to be of modest design. Several Range Rovers were parked near the 
front door, and a sheep dog gamboled nearby in a field. "It looks just like a 
whisky ad," Haddon observed. 
</P>
<P>
 We knocked on the door, imagining that the owners might offer us goose-feather 
mattresses and cotton duvets for the night. But they turned out to be Sloane 
Rangers -- English yuppies -- up from London, and once they saw our disheveled 
state, they pointed to a shack in the distance instead. I slept on the concrete 
floor, and Haddon chose a wooden manger. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, in the fishing port of Ullapool, we took our first 
non-two-wheeled form of transport since the train ride, boarding the Caledonian 
MacBrayne ferry and crossing a channel, with the Dr. Seuss-like name of The 
Minch, to Stornoway, on Lewis, the northernmost island in the Outer Hebrides. 
Our plan was to ride from Lewis to Harris (joined to Lewis by a narrow 
isthmus), catch another ferry to North Uist, cycle down that island and across 
the causeway that connects it to Benbecula, cross Benbecula and the causeway 
connecting it to South Uist and then down that island. From the bottom of South 
Uist, we'd take our last ferry, to the southernmost Hebridean island of Barra. 
Here we wouldn't cycle -- it's too small for much of a ride -- but would 
transfer to another ferry to sail back across The Minch, past the Island of 
Mull, alighting finally at the mainland port of Oban. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WE SET OFF FROM STORNOWAY ON A SATURDAY MORNING, THE ONLY DAY of our journey 
on which we encountered truly miserable weather. In the distance, we could see 
boats being tossed about by gale-force winds. Cyclists hardly fared better. I 
suggested to Haddon that we lay over in Stornoway and wait out the storm. 
However, the challenge of riding in a gale was too much for Haddon to resist. 
And so, wrapped in squall gear, we confronted the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Our destination was a village on the west coast of the island, called Barvas. 
Even though the more direct road to Harris went south, we took the circular 
route so as to see the 5,000-year-old rocks at Callanish, which look just like 
Stonehenge in miniature. For the distance, a full 12 miles, we were accompanied 
by a head-on wind and a persistent fine rain, a combination that left not a 
single part of our bodies or possessions unsodden. When we arrived at last in 
Barvas, we decided to stay at a B&B -- both because barns are scarce on these 
islands and because, frankly, we needed some pampering. Without too much 
trouble, we discovered Mrs. MacDonald's, and before you could say, "Failte d'on 
Ghaidhealtachd," she'd gathered up our wet clothes, put them in front of a peat 
fire in the living room to dry and brought us tea and biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 10 hours, we did nothing but eat and sleep -- especially the 
former. Dinner consisted of lamb and a huge bowl of boiled potatoes, which had 
been freshly dug up that morning. After dinner, there was tea again. For 
breakfast we got porridge, eggs, bacon, sausage and white pudding -- oats and 
offal mixed together, cut in muffin shapes, and then cooked -- it's tastier 
than it sounds. "The weather's looking a lot better today," Mrs. MacDonald 
announced as we ate, in an accent stronger than we'd heard in the Highlands and 
impossible to duplicate on paper. "But I'll hold thumbs for you anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Outer Hebrides are much flatter than the Highlands -- much to Haddon's 
disappointment -- but the skies are still mountainous with clouds, and the 
landscape is marked with fewer intrusions of man. The islands seemed like an 
older world -- one where people might look at you askance if they saw you 
riding your bicycle on the Sabbath, but, if you stopped to talk to them, they 
would smile and greet you like old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The road began to go fast. Not only were there no hills, but there was just 
one main road, a very minor one, which went straight as an arrow, due south. No 
sooner had we set out from the north of an island than we seemed to reach its 
southern tip. Harris turned quickly into North Uist, North Uist into Benbecula, 
Benbecula into South Uist. And suddenly the port of Lochboisdale loomed in 
front of us.  
</P>
<P>
 It began to rain again. The clouds came between us and the sky and stayed 
there until our ferry reached the mainland. When we sailed into the port of 
Oban, the sun came out. Oban itself is pretty, like some coastal resort you've 
been to somewhere in the past, generously speckled with bright sails, aspiring 
artists chalking Da Vincis on the sidewalks, streets full of quaint-looking 
B&Bs. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddon and I didn't hang around. We hopped on our bikes and started pedaling. 
In the next two days, by cycle and by train, we traveled from Oban to Ft. 
William, to Mallaig, and finally from Kyle of Lochalsh to Inverness -- where we 
caught our last train back to Dundee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all very nice, but by this time our spirits were waning. I missed the 
open roads and empty spaces and the multicolored sheep on the roadside 
curiously watching us freewheel past. Haddon said he missed sleeping in mangers 
and flying through the air. But at least we still had the skies above us.

 Getting there: There are no nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Scotland, but 
United Airlines has a daily nonstop to London connecting to a British Midland 
flight to Edinburgh, and British Airways offers two daily nonstops to London 
with connections to Edinburgh. American Airlines has a daily connecting flight 
to Glasgow via Chicago. Another possibility is British Airways' 
five-times-a-week nonstop from Los Angeles to Manchester, with a connection to 
Edinburgh on Manx Air. There is frequent train service from both Scottish 
cities to Dundee and various points in the Scottish Highlands.

<P>
 Getting around: British trains charge about $7.50 to carry each bicycle 
accompanying a paying passenger, though sometimes this fee is waived. Ferries 
depart Ullapool and Mallaig on the mainland regularly for the Outer Hebrides. 
Fares and schedules vary widely, but our own journey from Ullapool to Stornoway 
cost about $35 for two bikes and two cyclists. Details can be obtained from 
Caledonian MacBrayne Ferries, The Ferry Terminal, Gourock PA19 1QP, Scotland; 
telephone (475) 650-100.

 Where to stay: The Scottish countryside's rural inns and manor house hotels 
are famous. While cycling, though, we preferred to camp in warm barns and stay 
at the occasional bed-and-breakfast. The only rule for barns is to ask 
permission of the farmer who owns it before unrolling your sleeping bag. B&Bs 
are ubiquitous, most of them offering accommodations for $20-$30 per person per 
night. Tourist guidebooks listing B&Bs, hotels and other facilities for various 
regions of the Highlands and the Outer Hebrides, as well as for other parts of 
Scotland, are available from the Scottish Tourist Board, 23 Ravelston Terrace, 
Edinburgh EH4 3EU, Scotland; tel. (31) 332-2433.

TRAVELING IN STYLE; FANTASY LAKE; FISH IT, SWIM IT, CRUISE IT OR JUST LOOK AT

 WHEN THE WIND KICKS UP AT LAKE MEAD Marina, The End seems near. Everything 
trembles and rocks. Whitecaps rip the crystalline water, mallards and gulls bob 
crazily on the surface, boats clonk against their moorings. Sightseers, trying 
to feed popcorn to the carp that crowd the sides of the dock, hold onto their 
hats with one hand while the popcorn they proffer is whisked from their 
outstretched fingers by the wind and flies back over their shoulders. This 
wind, fierce and ancient, is the same wind that helped cut the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 This lake is not a lake at all, but a reservoir -- a chain of deep desert 
canyons filled relatively recently with water, stretching along and up from 
Nevada's southeastern border. In its own way, Lake Mead is as artificial as the 
billion-dollar megahotels of Las Vegas, 23 miles to the northwest. Only 58 
years old, the lake was born after Hoover Dam (also known as Boulder Dam) was 
completed in 1935. Although now considered the granddaddy of what 
environmentalists disparagingly call the "cash register dams" (designed to make 
money, with little concern for their effect on its surroundings), Hoover Dam 
was conceived originally as a flood-control project, to prevent the Colorado 
River's periodic inundation of California's Imperial Valley. The need for such 
a dam became dramatically apparent when two years of flooding devastated 
California farmlands early in the century, leaving behind the Salton Sea as a 
calling card. Construction began only when it became clear that a dam project 
could support itself through the sale of water and hydroelectric power to a 
growing Los Angeles. If L.A. didn't exist, Hoover Dam wouldn't either. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam is widely considered to be one of the world's great marvels of civil 
engineering -- and the people who live around Lake Mead are patently proud of 
it. They memorize its statistics as if it were a beloved hometown ball team. 
The girl who sells me a soft pretzel at the Lake Mead Marina is able to tell me 
the dam's height (726 feet) and how thick it is ("about two football fields, I 
think. End to end."). She also reminds me that there is enough concrete in the 
dam to build an 18-foot-wide highway from San Francisco to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals are also proud of the fact that Hoover Dam, built during the Depression 
oh so many low-tech years ago, was nonetheless completed ahead of schedule and 
under budget.  
</P>
<P>
 If a justifiable fuss is made over Hoover Dam, relatively little is said about 
Lake Mead. It's impressive. Twice the size of Rhode Island and shaped roughly 
like a three-armed starfish, the lake has 550 miles of jagged shoreline 
extending from Hoover Dam in the west to the Grand Wash Cliffs in the east, 
where the Grand Canyon National Park begins. It's the largest man-made lake on 
the continent. Yet to many of its 8 million annual visitors, Lake Mead is 
simply a handy recreation area, a place to boat, fish and waterski off-season 
-- Tahoe with better weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the opportunities for recreation are more varied here than you might 
imagine. Sailors and windsurfers savor the desert wind, while anglers claim 
that Lake Mead has some of the best sports fishing in the country. Largemouth 
bass, rainbow trout, channel catfish, bluegill, even the prized striped bass 
are popular and plentiful catches here. Scuba divers and snorkelers are 
attracted to Lake Mead, too. "It's as if someone filled up the Grand Canyon 
with water," one local diving enthusiast tells me. "The rock formations down 
there are incredible." Canoers, hikers, campers, wildflower lovers and amateur 
geologists all find plenty to do, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's more to this place than the "Recreation Bonanza" advertised in 
the tourist brochures. If Lake Mead is as artificial as Las Vegas, it's also as 
improbable, and sometimes nearly as bizarre. In a way, it's an outdoor 
equivalent of that great indoor fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD REMEMBER about Lake Mead is that despite its 
semi-pastoral surroundings it's right in the middle of the desert. People never 
quite seem to believe that -- just like they never quite understand why, when 
they drop a net full of beer and soda over the side of their rented boat, the 
drinks come up warmer rather than cooler. That's because the water in Lake Mead 
maintains an average daytime temperature of 86 degrees in the dead of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they have the right idea with the boats. The only way to see a lot of 
Lake Mead is by water. This is literally true, since Nevada's Highway 167, also 
called the Northshore Scenic Drive, veers away from the coastline after 20 
miles or so, and there are no roads at all along the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a vessel of your own, you can pay $12, as I did, for a 
90-minute cruise on the Desert Princess, a white Mississippi River 
paddle-wheeler berthed at the Lake Mead Marina. As the Desert Princess chugs 
toward Hoover Dam, a taped narrative is broadcast over the loudspeaker. 
Periodically, the roar of passing powerboats blots out the tape. But sitting 
behind me on the upper deck, three couples from South Dakota seem more 
intrigued by their cocktails -- "Hoover Movers," made of vodka, triple sec and 
peach schnapps -- than by the recorded account of the goings-on around here 
during the Paleozoic Era. 
</P>
<P>
 To the port side of the paddle-wheeler we pass a mossy rock, no bigger than a 
football, marked with a white buoy. Rocks appear and disappear with no warning 
here, giving boaters fits. The amount of water in the lake is determined not by 
the size of the nearby snowpack, as it would be in a real lake, but solely by 
the water needs of Southern California. If rainfall is low in Riverside, for 
example, so is the lake. If rainfall is plentiful, the lake is high, because no 
water is released. When no water is released, no electricity is generated -- 
and Boulder City has to buy its power elsewhere. Oh, and occasionally the level 
of the lake will shrink imperceptibly because a town downstream has phoned in 
and asked for a few more inches of water to hold a powerboat race. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Park Service ranger is on board the Desert Princess. I tell her I'm 
writing about Lake Mead and ask what is the largest misconception people have 
about the reservoir. "Misconception?" she replies, her smile dropping as her 
voice rises. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," I continue. "What do people imagine about Lake Mead that turns out 
not to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't answer that, legally," she says. "We're not supposed to. You'll have 
to call our public affairs person." Then she turns her back on me. 
</P>
<P>
 I tap her on the shoulder. "Are people surprised by the extreme heat of the 
desert?" I persist. "Is the lake bigger than they thought?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to ask public affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask the South Dakotans instead. On the basis of their expectations, I'd say 
that the biggest misconception people have about Lake Mead is that the view of 
Hoover Dam from the lake will take their breath away. But when it reveals 
itself at last, this great engineering marvel looks like nothing so much as a 
cinder-block wall -- the kind that might run behind an urban gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the other side of the dam, the outer shell -- the great, curving concrete 
wall -- that most people think of when they imagine its magnificence. There are 
two good ways to get this view: One is by taking the Hoover Dam Tour, which 
sends you down through the center of the dam -- 726 feet, remember -- and out 
onto one of the powerhouse wings on either side of the canyon. The tour is not 
for claustrophobes; it even says so on a sign in the ticket window. They mash 
as many people as possible into the elevators, which take a full two minutes to 
descend to the base of the dam. Other than some immense green generators, I 
have no recollection of what I saw on the tour. I am a claustrophobe, didn't 
notice the warning sign and spent the duration of the tour sweating in 
anticipation of the elevator ride back up. 
</P>
<P>
 A less nerve-racking way to see the dam from the outside is by a motor-driven 
raft trip, which can be organized through a company in Boulder City (see 
Guidebook). The tour originates in a lagoon at the base of the dam, about 500 
feet below the lake, and proceeds 14 miles downstream through Black Canyon to 
Willow Beach in Lake Mojave. This is another local incongruity: Hoover/Boulder 
Dam is not in Boulder Canyon but in neighboring Black Canyon. The name, it 
seems, had already been decided on when geologists recommended the latter 
canyon for the dam site. 
</P>
<P>
 Another name that doesn't quite work is that of the river. The Spanish called 
it colorado , or "colored red," for its red silt. Wags of yore used to describe 
the river as being "too thick to drink and too thin to plow." Today, it's 
emerald green, colored only by minerals and algae. The silt is caught behind 
the dam, in Lake Mead; in time, it will color the whole lake red, and 
eventually fill it up.  
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this doesn't diminish the pleasure of our raft trip, at least while 
we're on the water. The day is warm, not hot, and the wind is at our backs. The 
occasional spray of water that splashes us is cold. We spy some bighorn sheep 
on shore and red-tailed hawks and cormorants overhead. Hazy green stands of 
tamarisk trees huddle near the shoreline. As we drift downriver, we pass the 
mouths of serpentine little canyons that shelter hot springs, a favorite 
destination of canoe enthusiasts, and house-size boulders hurled across the 
canyon by some flash flood during the last Ice Age. Miles-long slabs of rock 
wall block the sun, their singed look -- a 1,000-year-old patina of iron, clay 
and manganese -- gives Black Canyon its name. (The Piutes who once lived here 
pecked at the varnish, exposing the red rocks beneath, creating the pictographs 
we now call petroglyphs.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nevada side of the canyon, there is a gauging station that was used 
during the construction of Hoover Dam for measuring the Colorado's water level 
and flow rate. A dam worker lived here in solitude, measuring the river twice a 
day from a cable car suspended between the walls of the canyon, then creeping 
home to his waterfront cabin along a catwalk nailed into the sheer rock. The 
catwalk is made from L-shaped pieces of rebar, the ribbed steel rods used in 
reinforced concrete, with pine planks laid end to end across them. We all gazed 
up at it, agreeing that it must have been a punishing way to live. Our guide 
turns off the engine. We sway in the current, listening for a moment to the 
water stirring beneath the raft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," says a man from Detroit, breaking the near-silence. "It 
doesn't seem so bad to me. Do you think they get cable down here?" GUIDEBOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are seated on crude wooden benches in a dusty clearing about 100 yards from 
the Mae Ping River in Chiang Dao, 45 minutes north of Chiang Mai, Thailand. It 
is a brilliant morning, with sunshine winking through the tall trees. We are 
surrounded by French tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from their ablutions in the river, 12 changs, or Asian elephants, two of 
them babies, are lined up, ready to begin their elephants-at-work show. Nine 
years ago, I attended a similar show, and it's all flooding back. There are the 
mahouts, attaching the elephants' drag chains to teak logs. There go the 
elephants, first singly, then in pairs and finally in threes, dragging logs to 
the log pile -- where, with the mahouts exhorting them, the changs push each 
log in turn to the top of the pile with their powerful trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's silly work, a crude demonstration of how elephants once helped clear 
Thailand's now mostly vanished teak forests. Still, my children applaud, and 
the French cry, "Bravo!" The elephants do not reveal what they think of it all, 
but their large, intelligent eyes, no more than half-intent on their tasks, 
suggest that they are thinking something. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the show is over, and I'm grateful, because the rest of the morning's 
activities, booked through a tour operator in Chiang Mai, are about to begin: 
an elephant ride through the jungle and a bamboo raft ride down the Mae Ping. 
</P>

<P>
 During our first visit to Southeast Asia in 1985, my wife and I spent five 
months on vacation? in Chiang Mai, not quite 400 miles northwest of Bangkok. We 
had just one child then, a toddler, and all we knew about the city was what a 
friend had told us -- that it was beautiful and that there was a good hospital, 
in case the kid got sick. We arrived in November, in time for the relatively 
cool, dry season that continues through late February, and which brings Chiang 
Mai most of its visitors -- among them Thailand's king and queen, who maintain 
a winter palace on the nearby mountain of Doi Suthep. 
</P>
<P>
 From guidebooks, we learned that Chiang Mai, founded in 1296 by King Mengrai, 
was a sleepy provincial capital, notable for its 600-year-old wats (Buddhist 
temples), for the moat around its old city walls and for what partisans claimed 
was the best handicraft shopping in Asia. Located on a high plateau at the foot 
of the rugged mountains that comprise most of Thailand's northern borders with 
Laos and Burma (now called Myanmar), Chiang Mai was also regularly referred to 
as the "Gateway to the Golden Triangle, and its colorful hill tribes." 
</P>
<P>
 We were not prepared then for how friendly, charming and sophisticated the 
people of Chiang Mai were. Neither were we prepared for the food: Everything we 
ate, from the fried chicken and sticky rice in the market to the satay and kway 
teo (noodle soup) on the street to the curries and seafood in restaurants was 
delicious and inexpensive. We had other pleasant surprises as well. 
</P>
<P>
 We quickly learned our way around the city, renting an ancient 
right-hand-drive Toyota. Most buildings were one or two stories high, with 
shops on the ground floor. The major thoroughfares were an adventure to 
negotiate, because they were shared by cars, trucks, motorcycles and 
bicycle-rickshaws -- four distinct sizes and speeds of vehicles filling two 
lanes in each direction. The smaller streets were quite narrow, often winding 
past aged wats . 
</P>
<P>
 From Chiang Mai, we also drove as far north and west as the Burmese and 
Laotian borders. On one excursion, we danced in the midnight moonlight at a 
hill tribe festival outside Chiang Rai, the only foreigners there. (We also 
learned that the tribes' vibrantly colorful "costumes" were actually their 
daily attire.) We had raw silk suits made in one of the city's tailor shops. On 
a whim, we hung baskets of orchids from the market on the lamyai tree (lamyai 
is a plum-like fruit) in our front yard. We learned firsthand how much Thais 
love children and learned to watch calmly and happily as strangers picked up 
our son and hugged him. We kept extending our visas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then a Thai friend took us to a shop that specialized in hand-embroidered 
cotton pillows, and we became so enamored of them that for several years after 
returning to the States, we ran a small import business, bringing them in -- 
thus maintaining our connection to this city we had loved so well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My son and I ride Bualoi, a bulky, balky 35-year-old female elephant with 
faint pink polka dots on her ears. My wife and daughter follow on Di Mak, a 
40-year-old male. Each chang comes equipped with a carved wooden seat for two 
and a mahout seated between its ears. 
</P>
<P>
 We're about halfway down the line in a 10-elephant caravan, following a muddy 
trail south along the banks of the Mae Ping. The jungle is lush and lovely, 
full of tall trees I don't know the names of, many of them flowering -- but dry 
hillsides rise gradually from both sides of the river valley, reminders that 
this is the second year of a drought in the region. As exotic as it is, I 
realize that there's something about the landscape, the dry air and brilliant 
sunshine that's familiar. Then it comes to me: Change the unfamiliar trees to 
live oak, and we could almost be riding along a horse trail in the Santa Monica 
Mountains -- except, of course, for the fact that we're 15 feet off the ground, 
scraping tree limbs, and that Bualoi's lurching gait is like that of no horse 
I've ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are loving it, and though it's clear that our chang trek is as 
artificial and manufactured as the elephants-at-work show, my wife and I are 
equally enthralled. Then the trail ends, and our elephants begin stepping down 
into the river. The Mae Ping reaches up about four feet, to Bualoi's first leg 
joint, and water laps against her and the other changs as we stroll across the 
river beneath a canopy of tree limbs. Hills rise in the distance. Then the 
elephant in front of us defecates. My son laughs and points and calls to his 
sister as an elephant turd the size of a small green cannonball floats down the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiang Mai we returned to with some trepidation on our trip last fall is 
small and sleepy no more. The city's first five-star hotel, the Chiang Mai 
Westin, is now open, and there are several new golf courses. There's an active 
second-home market here for wealthy residents of Bangkok. The traffic, although 
nothing like the legendary snarls on the streets of the Thai capital, is a 
nuisance at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Because we like being out of the hectic city center, we stayed at the Rincome 
Hotel, on the west side of town. It's a friendly, comfortable place with two 
pools (which our kids love) and a free shuttle to the Night Bazaar -- an 
incredible marketplace, open 365 days a year from about 5 p.m. to midnight, 
covering several square blocks of shops and stalls and selling an amazing array 
of handicrafts and manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, we discovered a fabulous small restaurant just down the road, a place 
with the unlikely name of The Pancake -- which in fact served wonderful, 
inexpensive American-style breakfasts (pancakes included) as well as some of 
the best Thai curries we've ever eaten, at any price. However else Chiang Mai 
may have changed, the food remains as complex and delicious as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the Rincome is one of our favorite shops, Nandakwang, 
where the proprietor creates a wide range of clothing and interior design items 
-- place mats and napkins, materials for curtains and furniture covers and the 
like -- from hand-loomed cotton. This is simply one of the world's great 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang Mai is a fabulous place to shop. Both in the city and in the 
surrounding area, businesses of every sort, from full-scale stores to tiny 
stands, sell high-quality goods of every kind, in a variety that defies 
description. There is certainly schlock to be had, and if you don't bargain you 
can pay considerably more than you should -- but to us (and to a multitude of 
others, both foreigners and Thais), Chiang Mai and vicinity is to shopping what 
Brooklyn is to pizza or Hollywood to movies. Both quantity and quality abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Just east of Chiang Mai, on the San Kampaeng Road, are two handicraft villages 
-- Bor Sang, which specializes in hand-painted silk umbrellas, and San 
Kampeang, known for silk products. Taxi drivers and tuk-tuk operators (tuk-tuks 
are a sort of open-air tourist torture -- motorcycles with a roof and seats on 
the back for passengers) are eager to ferry travelers out to San Kampeang from 
Chiang Mai because they receive a commission from the stores. For the most 
part, though, we avoid shopping there. There are undeniably fine goods to be 
had there, but we find it too large and impersonal. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we prefer Hang Dong, a new shopping mecca as yet undiscovered by most 
tourists. About eight or nine miles southwest of Chiang Mai on a good road, 
Hang Dong specializes in carved wooden wall decorations and furniture. Hang 
Dong has become such a hot spot in recent years that it now has its own upscale 
restaurant and hotel, the Village Inn, just past the turnoff from the main 
Chiang Mai-Hang Dong road to the street with all the woodwork galleries. At the 
open-air Village Inn restaurant, we ate perhaps the best food we have had in 
Chiang Mai -- the shrimp with basil and chiles and the fish cakes are sublime 
-- while waiting for the shipper we had engaged to pick up the hand-carved 
furniture we'd just bought. (The shipping cost more than the pieces themselves, 
but were still a bargain.)

 At the end of our long elephant-filled morning in Chiang Dao, we are floating 
down the Mai Ping on a bamboo raft, propelled by the lazy current and by 
Satiam, our boatman. After the elephant ride, we waited for the French tourists 
and their loud "Bravos" to depart first. Now we have the river to ourselves, 
and we drift quietly past dry rice paddies and low hills. Satiam, who, of 
course, loves kids, encourages our son to help pole the raft. The next thing we 
know, both kids are in the river in their underwear, holding onto the raft and 
swimming along beside us. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, we've got nothing to do but enjoy the sun and the view of the hills 
and the sight of our children having the time of their lives. Later, we'll 
drive back to Chiang Mai for a late lunch and perhaps -- what else? -- a little 
shopping before dinner. GUIDEBOOK

SUMMER SNEAKS '94; THESE GUYS BLOW US AWAY; WITH EXPENSIVE BLOW-'EM-UPS RUNNING 
OUT OF NEW TRICKS, SOME MOVIE MAKERS FEAR THE GENRE FACES A TRAGIC ENDING 
</P>

 Renny Harlin, director of such adventure films as "Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 
2: Die Harder," has less than encouraging words for his line of work. "Action 
movies are sort of the bastard child of Hollywood," he says. "All the studios 
want them, yet somehow they appear to be somewhat disrespectful of them. 
Serious writers won't seem to touch them." 
</P>
<P>
 Harlin's words are delivered without anger or bitterness; he just speaks 
matter-of-factly, because, truth be told, he shares that ambivalence. "It was a 
lot of fun to make, and it was exciting," Harlin says of last summer's hit 
"Cliffhanger," "but, ultimately, it's not a very satisfying way to live my life 
and my career." Perhaps surprisingly, that disdain for big-budget blow-'em-ups 
is shared by many of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be a pivotal year in the evolution of the action film. The Times 
spoke to five leading action directors and one producer about the art of making 
action movies and other attendant issues, and all agree: The mega-budgeted, 
mega-noisy, mega-violent action film is about to meet an ending as tragic and 
predictable as that of a sidekick cop who loves his family and is mere days 
from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the same movie has been made dozens of times: Brawny, laconic 
hero, quick with a quip but likely haunted by some past tragedy, must fight 
villain(s) with an arsenal rivaling North Korea's, an ethnically diverse army 
of ne'er-do-wells, a prescient knowledge of hero's Achilles' heel and a female 
hostage of psychological importance to hero. Things get blown up for 105 
minutes; evil is vanquished as the chief villain is disposed of in a 
particularly ghastly yet cathartic manner; a chaste kiss from the woman is the 
hero's reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Action films travel to foreign countries well," explains Andrew Davis ("The 
Fugitive," "Under Siege"), "because you don't have a problem with translating 
the humor, you know, the dumb one-liners they try to put in these things; there 
are no problems with nuance (imitating an average moviegoer): 'Someone's 
scared, someone's bad, someone's good -- got it!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the formula appears to be wearing thin. Last summer's high-profile and 
perhaps presciently titled "Last Action Hero" did a high-profile belly-flop at 
the box office, and four action movies released this year -- "On Deadly 
Ground," "The Getaway," "The Chase" and "No Escape" -- have all performed well 
below expectations. Meanwhile, Davis' "The Fugitive" and Wolfgang Petersen's 
"In the Line of Fire," action films driven more by character and plot than by 
special effects and stunt work, were among 1993's biggest critical and 
financial successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by some of the action releases due this summer, filmmakers are trying 
to put a spin on familiar material. A strong female character, played by Susan 
Sarandon, will take on the bad guys in the thriller "The Client," and Jamie Lee 
Curtis will battle evil side-by-side with Arnold Schwarzenegger in "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer films by two first-time directors hope to evoke two of the best action 
films of the '80s: Alex Proyas' "The Crow," opening this week, is perhaps the 
most stylishly nihilistic thriller since 1982's "Blade Runner," while Jan 
DeBont's "Speed" will endeavor to mount the longest sustained kinetic sequence 
since 1981's "The Road Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the typical boy's club adventure movies are aiming for something 
beyond the thrills. Richard Donner's "Maverick," starring Mel Gibson, Jodie 
Foster and Jim Garner, offers more comedy than choas; "Clear and Present 
Danger" with Harrison Ford continues the sophisticated series of Jack Ryan 
films; "Blown Away," starring Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, aims for some 
of the same character-driven cat-and-mouse appeal of "The Fugitive." 
</P>
<P>
 James Cameron's "True Lies" is also expected to capitalize -- like Steven 
Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and Cameron's "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" before 
it -- on the advent of computer technology so sophisticated that literally 
anything can be brought to the screen. But none of this comes cheaply, and with 
budgets for these films typically weighing in at $60 million to $70 million, 
before marketing and distribution -- "True Lies" is expected to weigh in at 
about $100 million -- they're no longer the sure-fire money machines that, say, 
"Last Action Hero" was touted as being. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that while the studios want and need them, it's different 
today," says producer Mace Neufeld ("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger" 
and "Beverly Hills Cop III"). "You have to face the actual costs of making 
them. We're constantly engaged in dialogues with the studio and the budget 
department on how to effectively control the costs in big-action sequences." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, arsenals in action flicks have grown increasingly 
larger and more sophisticated, explosions have erupted in an 
ever-more-extravagant fashion and, thanks to the improved clarity of 
Dolby-stereo sound systems, all the mayhem has become ear-piercingly louder. 
But there's something called the law of diminishing returns, which states that 
there is a point at which bigger and noisier simply won't mean better, and 
filmmakers feel that point has not just been reached but long passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it," states Donner ("Superman," the "Lethal Weapon" series) flatly 
about the trend of effects one-upmanship. "If it's gonna go on, it's gonna go 
on without me." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis wryly suggests that the end result of the competitive trend should be a 
James Cameron-meets-William Castle scenario: "The ultimate would be, the 
theater in which you watch the movie blows up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a cap on violent movies," he adds, growing serious, "and I don't want 
to be a part of it personally. How many car chases can you have? I don't think 
it's a growth industry, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Harlin: "Big effects and stunts are not the thing. That makes movies more 
exciting, but audiences have seen it all. In the future, story and characters 
are going to be the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s action movies, characters were very complicated," Harlin 
continues. "In the '80s, though, things got out of hand. It was all 
super-heroes, all muscle and gun power. There were loads of super-heroes. The 
Reaganite period created that, but that's dead now." 
</P>
<P>
 Donner offers a metaphor to explain the action movie's own recent story arc. 
"Years ago, stuntmen started to organize (into unions) and rightly so," 
explains Donner. "They organized into two guilds, the Stuntman's Association 
and Stunts Unlimited. They vied against one another by being more daring, to 
the point where they did stupid things. People were hurt, and the situation 
mellowed out. In a strange way, that's what's happening with action pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Directors best known for their action films prefer not to think of themselves 
in that fashion, nor to speak much about their peers. Few, for example, wanted 
to share their impressions of "Jurassic Park," preferring instead to discuss 
Stanley Kubrick or Federico Fellini (Davis admits to having seen only one 
"Indiana Jones" movie). But they will discuss what they consider the most 
historically influential action sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chariot race in 'Ben-Hur' uses an enormous amount of shots -- it's 
extremely artistic, there's competent editing, there's a very precise feeling," 
says Paul Verhoeven ("Robocop," "Total Recall," "Basic Instinct"). "That scene 
is one of the most fascinating ever made, one of the most musical -- though 
there's no music, with its rhythms, it's more like music than drama." 
</P>
<P>
 Verhoeven and Davis also cite the car-and-subway chase sequence from "The 
French Connection." " 'French Connection' was an important film for me," says 
Davis. "I think Bill Friedkin was a gifted young director to make that movie at 
that time. It set a standard for reality in action films." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to work with rhythm that way in 'Basic Instinct,' says Verhoeven, 
"when the cars were following each other on the curvy road. It's not that 
spectacular if you analyze the shots, but what I was doing was bringing in a 
certain kind of rhythm, getting the audience used to that rhythm, and then 40 
seconds into the sequence, the autobus comes in, and the rhythm changes 
abruptly. That's what makes good action films effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers concede that at this point, Cameron (who also has "Aliens," and 
the "Terminator" movies to his credit) has set the standard in combining 
computer technology with breathless action and that "T2" represents a pinnacle 
in action films that will be very difficult to surpass. Says Donner, "James 
Cameron is brilliant. I wouldn't compete with him in a million years. He's a 
provocateur in this industry, designing computer programs I can't even 
comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
 Several also offer accolades to John Woo, whose Hong Kong films "Hard-Boiled" 
and "A Better Tomorrow" are considered classics of the genre, and whose first 
Hollywood project, "Hard Target," met with modest success. "John Woo's movies 
have become a genre unto themselves -- the audience escapes into seeing 
over-the-top action," says Neufeld. "Then, the gloves are off, you can do 
anything you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, all who spoke had nothing but awe and respect for Davis' 
exhilarating work in "The Fugitive," particularly its spectacular train wreck. 
"I'll never do a train stunt," says Donner. "It'll invariably be compared to 
Andrew." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is clearly the man whose star rose the most in 1993. He made a name for 
himself by converting 1992's "Under Siege" from a typical Steven Seagal vehicle 
into a stylish and witty thriller, and followed that with "The Fugitive," the 
second highest grossing film in the history of Warner Bros. (following 1989's 
"Batman"). The film received seven Oscar nominations, including best picture, 
and Tommy Lee Jones won the trophy for best supporting actor (another 
impressive feat -- action films rarely reap such rewards). Davis parlayed that 
film's success into a financially and artistically rewarding exclusive deal 
with Savoy Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a close friend of Davis' who has appeared in several of his films, 
says: "A great virtue is his versatility. He'll have scenes that have been 
planned for months, with a 15-camera setup, as smooth and as organized as any 
military operation. The next day, he'll kick you out on the street in the 
middle of the St. Patrick's Day parade with a Steadicam, and say, 'See you 
later, boys.' It's a very energetic approach, and that's good for cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis says such flexibility is the key to making exciting action movies. 
Despite the precise conditions under which "The Fugitive's" memorable train 
wreck was shot, he says, "You still leave a certain amount of room there. If 
something gets a little out of control there, which will create some 
spontaneity, it's important to be able to improvise. That's what gives it an 
energy and a freshness, because it doesn't seem so perfectly planned. If you 
storyboard a film and shoot just the storyboard, it'll feel that way. It'll 
feel too tailored and not spontaneous. Especially if things are supposed to be 
out of control, you don't want things to feel too in-control." 
</P>
<P>
 Working as a cinematographer on documentaries in the late '60s and early '70s 
helped to imbue Davis' work with an edge of gritty reality. "Several times now, 
I've taken real events like the St. Patrick's Day parade (which wasn't in the 
original script) and put them into movies as part of the story," Davis says. 
"Because you can't buy that stuff, you can't re-create it, you can't capture 
it. I figured if we could get our two characters lost in the fabric of Chicago, 
it would really feel like this guy was being hunted, and the frustration, the 
cat-and-mouse game would be that much more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, smashing up a real live train -- or even crashing a parade -- 
doesn't come cheap; few things do when it comes to the blockbuster action 
movie. And while the filmmakers are unapologetic about the bloated budgets, 
they acknowledge some belt-tightening is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an event action movie, it's important to have a big enough budget to do 
things the right way," says Harlin, whose "Cliffhanger" is said to have cost 
more than $70 million. "The audience is quite sophisticated these days, they've 
seen pretty much everything. So, to impress them, things have to be bigger, 
better and more surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, big budgets are often the function of big stars -- they're the ones who 
help make the tent-pole, or event, movies. Stars are extremely expensive, and 
machinery comes with those stars, and that machine doesn't work without a 
high-octane fuel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine there was a huge conversation over the train crash," Neufeld says 
of "The Fugitive." "It was likely bid out 10 different ways. Had they decided 
it was too expensive, they might have said, 'So, let's not do the sequence.' 
And that decision would have meant that there wouldn't have been a point in the 
movie at which the audience breaks out in spontaneous applause and walked out 
of the movie saying, 'Wow.' It's that bite-the-bullet, let's-do-it sort of 
decision that can make or break movies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Verhoeven says studios have become cost-conscious and may balk at certain 
extravagances. "Jim (Cameron) reached the last possible balance (on "T2") -- 
spending a lot of money but making more back. If you want to do something as 
good, it would be extremely expensive to the point of being economically 
inconceivable. The motorcycle-and-truck chase in that film, the shots are so 
fantastic, and they're not done in an easy way; it's very complicated. The time 
to set them up and to get so many of them -- it's one difficult shot after 
another. In economic terms, if you were able to surpass that sequence if you 
spent another $10 million on top of your budget, you would not be allowed to 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld recalls a similar occasion when the price indeed was too high: "We 
were on a very fast track to do 'Beverly Hills Cop III' a year ago. The budget 
was a horrendous number. We came in, looked at the budget, the screenplay and 
the release date and decided this was not a script we wanted to do. Sherry 
Lansing (head of Paramount) had just come in, and we had lunch with her, and 
said, 'We'll do this, but we don't think the franchise or Paramount would be 
best-served by trying to shoot a release date rather than a film.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The film was postponed. "There was no margin for error," Neufeld explains. 
"There was a lot of action, a lot of night shooting, on a tight schedule. One 
misstep could have turned it into a major disaster. Movie making and budget 
making are nowhere near an exact science. You have to give yourself breathing 
room, thinking room. Invariably, preparation and adequate post-production time 
make better movies and save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld suggests that the cost of special effects is becoming 
cost-prohibitive, but those vast expenses are necessary today to bring down 
computer animation costs in the future. "We cost out an action sequence both 
ways," Neufeld says. "It's still very expensive. Are we really going to blow up 
a house? A miniature is not really satisfactory. A computer can do it very 
efficiently, but it's not cost-effective yet. But that could signify a 
renaissance of fantastic action, which is exciting in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Harlin warns, "We've had the breakthrough with technology. We're being 
able to create things in computers. I think now, audiences get the gimmick -- 
anything can be done in a computer. You have the guy changing shapes in 'T2,' 
you have dinosaurs, you have (Sylvester) Stallone hanging off a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know almost anything is possible, things can get less interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 A key aspect that can dictate the success or failure of an action film is the 
degree and tone of its violence. Each director has his own opinion regarding 
violence (Donner, in particular, says, "I hate those movies where you see gore 
and dismemberment"), but even though Hollywood is now in an era when violence 
in entertainment is coming under fire from Washington, each agrees that the 
director should have the freedom to create as bloody or as sanitary a film as 
he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "(When I'm working), I'm not thinking about the violence offending or 
upsetting them, or causing copycats, like the Disney case (in which revised 
versions of the the film "The Program" deleted a scene that had inspired fatal 
copycat incidents)," says Verhoeven. "The moment we say we can't do this in a 
movie, because someone might copy it, then we have failed as filmmakers. We 
should not engage in self-censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tone (for the violence) usually comes with the star, and what works best 
for them," says Harlin. "With Bruce Willis, the best movie winks at you. For 
Stallone, it's better if you're more serious, truly emotional. Action stars 
seem to have an aura, or an image, that the movie consequently inherits." 
</P>
<P>
 Harlin says finding the right degree of blood and guts can be a crap shoot. 
"I've had interesting results at test screenings. We interviewed a core group 
after a 'Cliffhanger' screening, and asked them who thought it was too violent, 
and about half the group raised their hands. Then we asked who thought it 
wasn't violent enough, and the other half of the group raised their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Two directors from foreign soil, the Netherlands' Verhoeven and Hong Kong's 
Woo, have found that unique sensibilities that serve them well in their 
homelands can get them into trouble with the Motion Picture Assn. of America, 
which has slapped several of their films with Xs or NC-17s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating; they don't care what the real purpose of your film is," 
says Woo. "They look at everybody all the same. We fought so hard for an R. My 
kind of action -- that cartoon, comic-book violence -- amuses and appeases 
audiences. You try to make them understand that my kind of action is pretty 
artistic, like dancing. But they just don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a horrible process; no director would like to go through it," agrees 
Verhoeven. And even though his films "Total Recall" and "Basic Instinct" pushed 
the MPAA's R rating to its absolute limits with their violence and sexual 
material, he insists, "I haven't been trying to test the MPAA's boundaries, 
this just started when I began working in the American market. I just shoot it, 
and that's what I get. My European upbringing gives me a certain sensibility 
regarding sex and violence that simply is not corresponding with the MPAA's 
guidelines on movie content. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think I'm pushing the envelope on purpose, but, really, it's by 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Woo admits, however, that he doesn't consider the tone of a violent sequence 
when shooting it. "They're based on feeling, like a painter. I usually put 
myself into the character's mood, walk through it like the character would, and 
choreograph it myself. If, in a scene, the character is fighting for his life, 
he will fight very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned with beauty, the camera movement, the body movement, the 
editing and the rhythm. If I feel the whole scene, in perfect timing, when I 
feel right, I go for it. There's so much to think about -- I see myself like a 
wild horse running here and there, out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Showing a poster in his office, signed by fans at a premiere of one of his 
films (one of the messages reads, "I never saw a film w/ so many people getting 
killed!"), Woo admits that his hard-core fans are afraid that the one-two punch 
of Hollywood and the MPAA may dilute his -- or any filmmaker's -- style. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo says, "In Hong Kong, I wrote my own scripts and put my own feelings into 
them. In Hollywood, in 'Hard Target,' it wasn't my script. It's complicated -- 
the original script was good, but so many people at the studio got involved, 
and the script was changing, changing, changing. (The end result) wasn't as 
good as it was originally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be more patient," Woo admits. "The system won't change, and the 
studio invests a lot of money in these projects, so they must be careful. So, 
so many people try to control the proceedings. But in the meantime, you waste a 
lot of time and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 The degree of violence, it should never be forgotten, is also dictated by the 
viability of the stunts described in the script. Safety on the set, tragically, 
again became an issue last year when Brandon Lee was killed by a prop gun while 
performing what should have been a routine stunt in "The Crow." 
</P>
<P>
 Scripts can become problematic with their lurid descriptions of action, 
according to Neufeld. "The writer is basically trying to please the producer 
and the studio. He's making what's on the page exciting and will most often 
describe action that's virtually impossible or foolhardy to execute." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stunt people don't like me," says Donner. "I think we're 
illusionists, I like to create the magic steeped in total safety and trickery. 
I pull (stunt people) back. I don't believe in hurting animals or people for a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Action films are more about disciplining other people more than yourself. On 
'(Lethal Weapon) 3,' on the very first shot, there was a lack of communication 
between two stunt men in the car chase, and I heard this terrible (expletive) 
explosion," Donner recalls. "Two cars hit one another head-on, right at the 
beginning. Thank God no one was hurt; there was a sprained ankle. But that was 
lucky -- lucky not because of the accident, but because it set the tone for the 
movie immediately. Once I saw everyone was OK, I went ballistic. That changed 
the attitude for the whole film. It was important, because they all knew if 
something else happened, I'd kill 'em if they didn't do it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Woo likes testing the boundaries of his performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, in 'Hard-Boiled,' Chow Yun-Fat is holding a baby and running 
through a narrow corridor in the final sequence, and there are seven, eight 
bombs going off beside and behind him. He's running toward the camera. On the 
first take, the stunt coordinator tried to stop me -- he didn't want the actor 
to get hurt. But I thought if it happened close to the actor, it would be more 
exciting, the audience would feel the danger more. The special effects guy 
said, 'No, it's too dangerous.' 
</P>

 "But I prevailed, and I cued the special effects guy when to set off the 
explosions, and the actor didn't know that they were going to be so close," Woo 
recalls. "His hair got a little singed, it looked like he was really running 
for his life in that situation. It looked realistic, and that's important to 
get the audience to feel the same way, to worry about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Jesus!' afterward, because of his hair, but he wasn't mad at me. He 
just asked, 'Was the shot OK?' " 
</P>

 "Generally, our action has got to be motivated by the story," Neufeld says. 
"We're currently in the middle of discussions over whether to eliminate or 
include an action sequence in 'Clear and Present Danger.' We're asking 
ourselves, 'Does it push the story forward? Can we do it in a way that has not 
been done or seen before? And if not, why do it?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous thing when developing a script is to look at it and say, 
'There haven't been any action sequences for 20 pages,' and then go plunk one 
in," Neufeld concludes. "Action should be the icing on the cake rather than the 
heart and soul of the movie. Because if that icing turns sour, it ruins the 
whole cake." 
</P>
<P>
 All agree that what making quality action flicks boils down to is -- surprise 
-- finding decent scripts with interesting characters. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer's schedule suggests that, in some areas, it's testosterone-laced 
business as usual: Jeff Bridges will hunt down mad bomber Tommy Lee Jones in 
"Blown Away" (which is also the plot for the upcoming "Die Hard 3"); at least 
two action flicks will concern themselves with vengeful sky diving ("Terminal 
Velocity" and "Drop Zone"), and Eddie Murphy is back in a "Die 
Hard"-in-an-amusement-park scenario with "Beverly Hills Cop III." 
</P>
<P>
 Harlin says he turned down "Cliffhanger" twice before finally relenting and 
doing the picture. "The script was originally very simple -- the dialogue was 
all along the lines of 'Let's go!' and 'Look out!' " he says. "It's frustrating 
when you have the tools and money to make a movie -- and if you just had the 
material, it could be really great." 
</P>
<P>
 (Harlin's dissatisfaction with the action genre seems sincere -- the only 
movie poster up in his office is for "Rambling Rose," which he produced -- but 
days after he was interviewed, it was announced that his next project would be 
producing "American Gladiators: The Movie.") 
</P>
<P>
 Donner says, "With the first 'Lethal,' the relationship was what the movie was 
all about. With the second, the buddy/action movie had all been done before, so 
we gave it a wild sense of humor, we decided to have fun with it. . . . Any 
action has to surround Mel and Danny (Glover), it has to complement them. If 
you do lots of action, you're ignoring them, you're not using them to their 
greatest advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how imaginative you are with the action, if you're not invested 
with the characters and the stories, it doesn't mean anything," Davis concurs. 
"There's probably some incredible sequences that you have never seen in 
B-action movies that are really good, the explosions, the danger, but no one 
talks about them because the rest of the movie is junk." 
</P>
<P>
 "Excitement doesn't come from money, it comes from an idea, emotions and 
feeling," says Woo. "Sometimes you'll put a lot of money into an action scene, 
but the audience feels nothing -- 'Oh, another car blew up. Hmm.' You sort of 
get numb to it. And I won't do that. It's not worth it. Action films need to 
emphasize character, heart and soul." Fast Action Heroes

TRAVELING IN STYLE; THE RIVER FROM DEEP WITHIN; CANOEING DOWN AND HIKING ALONG 
THE NOATAK RIVER IN ARCTIC ALASKA IS AN EXPERIENCE BOTH MYSTERIOUS AND 
ENLIGHTENING

<P>
 THE FIRST THING I SEE IS A FOREST OF ANTLERS ABOVE THE NEXT BEND. As we drift 
downstream, tracking from right to left in the current, the plane of view that 
contains the caribou shifts above the shoreline, bringing their bodies into 
sight. There are about a dozen -- brown with blunt snouts and white throats and 
rumps, each head equipped with an enormous rack. Some of the antlers are 
bleeding -- the natural result of shedding their velvet, which is hanging off 
in strips. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals freeze for a few seconds, looking at us. Then they take off 
running, hooves swishing in the sand and gravel, the sound augmented by a 
curious clicking of their heel tendons. In a great cacophony, the group 
splashes into the river and ferries en masse to the other side, heads and backs 
above the water. When they reach shore, they explode in spray and bound up over 
the bank into the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
 The river is the Noatak, in northwestern Alaska. Four hundred miles long, and 
draining most of the central Brooks Range north of the Arctic Circle, it is the 
main artery of the largest undisturbed riparian system in America. Dividing the 
spruce forests of the Alaskan interior from the North Slope tundra, the Brooks 
Range is the last great wilderness in North America. The river's source is in 
the very heart of the region, on Mt. Igikpak in Gates of the Arctic National 
Park. The name Noatak, appropriately enough, means "from deep within" in the 
local Inupiat language. 
</P>
<P>
 My previous experience of Alaska had been limited to the southeastern part of 
the state, which -- being largely defined by glaciers -- is confined by snow 
and ice even in late summer. North of the Arctic Circle, surprisingly, the land 
remains free of both until early fall. It is thus good country for hiking and 
canoeing, which is why I'm here. And it has the added attraction of migrating 
caribou, one of the great spectacles in the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 The caribou -- Rangifer tarandus granti , the New World version of reindeer -- 
is the most common large herbivorous mammal in northern Alaska. Like the 
grizzly bear and the wolf, it was once abundant throughout North America -- 
even as far south as Nevada and New Mexico -- but retreated before the advance 
of civilization. About 30 subgroups of the species now inhabit the Arctic, with 
the largest concentration, about 300,000 animals, in the western-central 
portion of the region. They winter on the fringes of forests in the southern 
valleys of the Brooks Range and travel north in spring to their calving grounds 
on the tundra, moving in immense herds of thousands that have been likened to 
invading armies or encroaching weather fronts. They summer on the North Slope 
and begin moving south again in August, just before the return of winter. No 
one can predict which routes the animals will follow from year to year. The 
Noatak is, however, one of the rivers the caribou most often cross.  
</P>
<P>
 I VISITED THE NOATAK LAST AUGUST IN A GROUP OF ABOUT 15, ORGANIZED by a 
California-based outfitter specializing in such expeditions. Our embarkation 
point was the town of Bettles (population 51), about 150 miles northwest of 
Fairbanks. From Bettles we took a floatplane into the Noatak basin. As we 
approached the river's headwaters, we saw snow on the higher peaks. The 
landscape below was green and yellow, though that would change before the end 
of our two-week trip. Late August is fall in the Brooks Range, the one window 
of climatic serenity in the Arctic year. 
</P>
<P>
 From November through February, of course, the Arctic is lightless and covered 
with snow. Temperatures reach as low as 50 degrees below zero. Spring and 
summer, on the other hand, are insect hell. Humans worry about mosquitoes, but 
caribou are more concerned with flies, two types in particular -- the 
bumblebee-like warble fly and the nostril fly (so named because it leaves its 
larvae in the caribou's nose). In July, the height of the fly season, caribou 
basically go berserk. They shake their heads, stamp their feet, bury their 
noses, plunge into lakes and stampede across mountains, seeking out wind-swept 
spots where bugs have a hard time flying. By mid-August, when shortening days 
bring falling temperatures, along with the first frosts and snows, the insects 
disappear. And this was when we humans appeared with our tents and canoes. 
</P>
<P>
 On our first day, however, we didn't paddle at all. We set out on foot across 
the tundra, that unique Arctic ecosystem whose name derives from a Lappish word 
meaning treeless plain. There is little precipitation here and the growing 
season is brief. Permafrost, frozen earth underlying the shallow topsoil, 
blocks the seepage of water into the soil below, preventing plants from growing 
deep roots and turning the Arctic into one vast bog. Plants on the tundra 
rarely grow higher than one's knee. A spruce takes 30 years to reach shoulder 
level; a miniature willow may be a century old.  
</P>
<P>
 We made our way in rubber boots through yellow net-leaf willow, white reindeer 
lichen, low-bush cranberries with red leaves, and tiny, semisweet blueberries, 
their sugars concentrated by recent frosts. Mushrooms sprouted among 
microcosmic bonsai arrangements, many of whose plants were hairy or waxy, to 
retain heat and retard evaporation. The turf underfoot was mossy -- soft and 
springy, yielding and benevolent.  
</P>
<P>
 We came to a cliff and continued to climb, hand-over-hand, up a rocky 
watercourse, pulling ourselves up by way of willow branches. At the top we 
found trails worn smooth by Dall sheep, which we could see as distant white 
dots making their way across nearby slopes. Closer at hand, alpine lichens 
clung to the rocks, growing at their deliberate pace of a 16th of an inch per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 From the cliff, we could look out over the immense Noatak basin and the 
shining river snaking west.The permafrost in the tundra appeared as a honeycomb 
pattern -- a kind of terrestrial drainage diagram reaching toward the river. 
Behind us, scores of unnamed peaks receded to infinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it was only midday, the landscape was bathed in late-afternoon 
light. August days are long in the Arctic, but the sun is never very far from 
the horizon. The actual sunset, occurring at about 11 p.m., seems to last 
forever. By the time the sun did go down, of course, we were back in camp, 
tottering around on legs punished by the strain of the descent.  
</P>
<P>
 THE NEXT MORNING, WE LOADED OUR BOATS AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE river. The 
Noatak is eminently navigable by canoe, as almost nothing resembling a rapid 
exists along its length. The river was green in its deeper sections, gray in 
its frequent shallows; in many places, the water wasn't even waist-high. 
Frequently an aluminum hull would hit bottom, detonating a dynamite-like boom, 
at which point the occupants of the craft in question had to get out and push. 
Other than the boom, and the faint sound of an occasional bush plane or gust of 
wind, calm ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, streams would meet the Noatak from the side, their progress 
downhill observable on the surrounding slopes. Distant, Y-shaped, willow-choked 
watercourses streamed down the dark green mountainsides like sets of light 
green antlers; a succession of tiny creeks tinkled over the banks, bearing 
cheerful tidings. By contrast, bigger streams -- those that emerged from major 
drainages, qualifying as rivers in their own right -- carried urgent news. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not just being metaphorical here. Descending an Alaskan river, one 
repeatedly passes tributary valleys that have rarely, if ever, been explored. 
These realms of terra incognita are intoxicating in their mystery, and water 
emerging from their mouths seems filled with wild energy, like some cryptic 
messenger from a savage kingdom. At every confluence, the river widens and the 
current quickens, racing over gravel bars and riffling in the breeze. James 
Katz, our guide and nature guru, told us that in India, altars are often 
stationed at such river intersections, marking the merger of two spirits. If 
one could only decipher the terms of the arrangement in the Arctic! But a 
wilderness on the order of the Brooks Range is no quick study; the way to 
approach it is on foot, penetrating its secret canyons at a pilgrim's -- that 
is, a snail's -- pace. Visitors from modern civilization, we didn't have that 
kind of time. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, we did have ample opportunity to -- as Katz described it -- 
"lick around its edges." One rainy evening at dusk, I hiked along a tributary 
away from the main river. I hadn't meant to go very far, but the water kept 
drawing me on. It soon divided into several branches, and with each diminution 
in stream size, the world grew quieter. After a while I wandered away from the 
water, passing holes dug by grizzly bears in search of burrowing rodents. Vole 
mounds and moose and caribou tracks were everywhere among the shrubs and 
grasses. I glimpsed something like a cross between a cat and a dog trotting 
across the tundra; suddenly it broke into a run and disappeared behind a bush. 
I heard a squeal and it reappeared -- a fox with a ground squirrel in its jaws. 
A little while later I heard a loon. Aside from these isolated cries, the 
tundra was hushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska is rare -- by which I mean raw, or at least minimally heated and hence 
underdone. The place has only recently emerged from under ice, so its 
geographic character is still being formed. Watching a glacial river tear at 
its own banks, you realize that its present location isn't etched in stone -- 
that within a few years it may have forged a new course. Vegetation is just 
being established, so plants are pioneers. Even animals are in a state of flux, 
their populations booming and crashing, seeking evolutionary balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coming and going of the animals during the short summer gives the Arctic 
a unique rhythmic shape," writes Barry Lopez in his book "Arctic Dreams." He 
also notes "the serene Arctic light that (comes) down over the land like 
breath, like breathing." And indeed, the Arctic does exude a sense of 
respiration. Winter might be thought of as a period of suffocation, whereas 
spring is literally "inspiring" -- drawing warm air and animals to the land. 
Summer is a briefly held gasp, a moment of life-extending agitation; following 
that, fall comes as a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was now fall. As we floated down the river, the landscape steadily grew 
more autumnal. What had been green and yellow when we arrived became red, pink, 
maroon, crimson, copper, ocher and vermilion. The change was imperceptible day 
by day, but by the time the bush planes picked us up, it was all-encompassing: 
Entire mountains had been painted scarlet; the veins of their watercourses were 
gleaming gold. Within a few weeks it would all be white. This is a cycle we 
undergo every second of every season. But in the Brooks Range, where change is 
both protracted and abrupt, it seems to be illustrated in an enormous book with 
vivid colors. It's a volume available only in Alaska, legible in the long light 
of an Arctic autumn. GUIDEBOOK

 IT'S A FOUR-HOUR BUS RIDE NORTHWEST FROM MEXICO CITY to San Miguel de Allende, 
a trip that takes the traveler far from streets choking with smog, factories 
belching smoke, body shops engulfed in clouds of paint fumes -- far from 
people, people, people. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Miguel in the middle of a fiesta is not much of a refuge. My wife and 
I arrived there recently for Easter weekend to find ourselves in the middle of 
the Mexican version of Spring Break. Hordes of drunken day-trippers from Mexico 
City packed every bar and restaurant and roamed the downtown streets whooping, 
crowing and belting off-key serenades. Walking up to the church of the Oratorio 
de San Felipe Neri, I was met by an army of street sweepers in orange jumpsuits 
busily cleaning up the refuse from the day's Good Friday procession. Billows of 
dust and manzanillo petals swirled in the air, mingling with the diesel exhaust 
of buses disgorging an endless stream of new arrivals ready to party. That 
night, as I tossed and turned, there was a constant clamoring of church bells 
that sounded neither romantic nor exotic -- more like a John Cage composition 
of sheet metal percussion playing an endless loop in my brain. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never considered myself a cranky traveler, but this was too much. Even my 
wife was muttering about finding some over-the-counter Valium. But the next 
day, someone suggested that we flee the city and take a stroll through the 
region's newest and most un-resortlike attraction -- the botanical preserve 
called El Charco del Ingenio, The Pool of the Ingenious One. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charco, which draws its name from its series of rock pools and from the 
fact that the term ingenio was traditionally applied in colonial America to 
those who constructed waterworks, covers more than 160 acres on the plateau 
above San Miguel. Although only 15 minutes from the center of town by taxi, it 
is so far off the beaten tourist track that even my cabdriver didn't know where 
it was. I had him drop me at Gigante, the huge, ugly, orange-and-pink neo-deco 
supermarket that sits coincidentally close to the new prison. I trudged over 
the dusty plain, through a local dump decorated with what looked like the 
remains of a love gone sour -- underwear, rebozos and shoes tossed angrily 
among burnt cans and broken rum bottles -- and followed a dirt road that led to 
a wide wooden gate. Here was El Charco del Ingenio. And for five pesos, peace 
was mine. 
</P>
<P>
 I had plenty of room to indulge my desire for solitude: Thirty of the 160 
acres are laced with nearly five miles of well-marked pathways leading to a 
domed conservatory, as yet unfinished, containing hundreds of species from a 
dozen Mexican states, then down along the shore of La Presa de las Colonias (a 
large reservoir that supplies water to the towns north of San Miguel) and along 
the edge of a dramatic steep ravine. The ravine, called the Landeta Arroyo, is 
dotted with a series of descending rocky pools, shrouded by pepper trees, 
willows and giant garambullo cacti. Down in the green waters of the deepest 
pool, nestled in the sheer granite walls of the arroyo, it is said, lives Chan, 
the local Chichimecas' god of water. 
</P>
<P>
 The botanical gardens and the 130 acres of ecological reserve on the far side 
of the arroyo retain a strong connection to the indigenous Toltec-Chichimeca 
peoples. All the stone border pathways, mosaics and the four large plazas of 
the garden were designed and built by Chichimeca stone masons and ironworkers, 
contributors to a lasting landmark to the culture that inhabited the area 
before the arrival of the Spanish 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Plaza of the Four Winds, roughly in the center of the park, stands a 
large red stone cross on a pyramid of stones and flowering plants. The cross is 
left purposefully rough on one side and is overlaid by another cross made of 
cane. Here is where the Spanish and Chichimeca intersect, for the cross is a 
symbol sacred to both cultures. The pyramid was completed and purified by 
Chichimeca elders when the garden was dedicated, at precisely the moment of the 
total eclipse of the sun visible in San Miguel on July 11, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza is the centerpiece of the garden, offering the best view not only of 
the preserve but also of the surrounding countryside to the Chichimecas' four 
cardinal points, the four distant mountain ranges, the four winds of life. 
There are four circles marking these points on the inlaid stone floor, each 
with a mosaic highlighting the Chichimeca world view: To the north is a brown 
pyramid, the color of earth; to the south in green and blue is a swirling 
spring, signifying water; to the west, colored red, is a coyote, representing 
the animal kingdom, and to the east is a yellow maguey plant, the most 
important member of the plant world in this semi-arid land.  
</P>
<P>
 I walked west toward the far end of the garden, to Sunset Point, where the 
path curves around onto the edge of a steep precipice. This is where the 
arroyo's mouth widens and marches to the north to the Mountain of Dangerous 
Water. Directly in front, it falls away into another reservoir, where the ruins 
of an old mill stand decaying. A section of an aqueduct dating from colonial 
times rises from the water. And to the south rise the spires of the churches of 
San Miguel. The gothic needles of the main church, the Parrochia, are most 
prominent, and are elegantly offset by the silver and gold dome of the Oratorio 
church. From here the context of the town is fulfilled, its relation to the 
land revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Crows came cawing up the arroyo, while to my left, I could hear the scream of 
a peacock in Atascadero, the complex of condominiums and mansions, complete 
with lap pools and 40-foot-high living rooms, where much of San Miguel's 
wealthy expatriate population lives. The view from Atascadero is much the same 
as the one I was enjoying at the moment -- but I couldn't help feeling that 
these visual riches were mine alone. 
</P>
<P>
 MY CRANKY MOOD DISSIPATED AS I slipped into the rhythm of the countryside. The 
ragged sound of an out-of-tune, out-of-sync brass band floated up in the wind, 
mixing with the brays of burros, the barking of dogs, the plaintive bleat of a 
herd of goats nibbling at the edge of the lower reservoir. A pair of snow-white 
ibises meandered through the muck at the edge of a pool hundreds of feet below 
me, probing repeatedly in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nearing dusk as I finally headed back to the main entrance. Along the 
way, I passed a field of golden barrel cacti, a few of them an astounding four 
feet high. Their tops were bright gold and as the spines tapered down along the 
ribbed sides, they softened into yellow, ochre and pale white. It's reassuring 
to see them because they are a rare species in the Mexican wild, where 90% of 
their natural habitat has disappeared in recent years. Beyond them I could see 
the border of the garden, now railway ties and wire, but growing slowly in an 
even line was the fence of the future: the stubby deep green pillars of organ 
cactus.  
</P>
<P>
 To beat the twilight closing, I raced along the water-side trail of the Presa 
de las Colonias, dodging overhanging mesquite and garambullo. I wanted to visit 
the conservatory, which is dedicated largely to succulents. In this pipe-frame 
structure, the variety of specimens is enormous, ranging from globular mounds 
that look like brightly speckled eggs to fuzzy, wispy brushes to tall and 
twisty pipe shapes to earth-hugging dollops that are more mineral than 
vegetable in look. Many are ringed in tiny flowers, tiaras of ruby and emerald 
and yellow gold and sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the entrance, in a covered shed, hundreds of smaller cacti were lined up 
in tiny posts, selling for $1 to $5, depending on the rarity. The retail stall 
is a fairly new addition to the park, part of the plan to make the project 
self-supporting and to foster among locals an economic respect for the 
environment. As I inspected the plants, I heard a bicycle on the dirt trail 
behind me. It was a guard, making his round through the park. Another guard 
lives in a small cottage across the presa , he told me, who conducts his daily 
circuit on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicyclist stopped to peer through a pair of binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you see?" I asked, expecting him to point out one of the scores of 
migratory birds that use the lake as a stopping-off point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," he said, handing me the glasses. "See the people?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the far side of the lake, near the ruins of an old hacienda, I spotted a 
pair of kids jumping the fence. No collecting of anything is allowed in the 
reserve -- no firewood, no nopales, no cacti fruit. Without another word, he 
set off on his bike, pedaling furiously. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEXT DAY I WALKED OVER TO the headquarters for Cante, the private 
nonprofit foundation that is the organizing force behind the botanical gardens. 
My host was Federico Gama, a former sociologist and co-founder of Cante -- a 
Chichimecan word meaning "water that gives life." Construction of the garden 
began four years ago but as Gama quickly told me, "a botanical garden never 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Gama, middle-aged, born and educated in Mexico City, formed Cante in 1987 -- a 
nonprofit concept centered on rural development projects with an ecologically 
Mexican bent, mixing art and cultural preservation with conservation and 
self-help communal associations. Cante developed slowly, but then Gama met 
Charles Glass, one of the world's foremost experts on cacti. Glass had just 
returned to Mexico from his home in Arizona to resume research he had started 
decades earlier. Concerned that urban growth and expanded agriculture were 
threatening the Mexican cactus population, Glass was investigating means of 
artificially propagating these species. He was immediately attracted to Gama's 
multipart plan for a large natural garden dedicated to the arid and semi-arid 
lands of the high plateau, a nature preserve for endangered species from all 
over Mexico and a reforestation project in the mountains to the southeast. The 
two began collaborating, and the seeds for El Charco del Ingenio were sown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible to make an experience like this self-sustained, without 
destroying nature," Gama said. "It's an attempt to fight modernization, in 
which progress means changing everything in a way that harms nature. It's hard 
to explain to people. Many see us as ecology freaks who are doing something 
very nice. My feeling is we are doing what has to be the future of nature." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him why he even bothered trying to educate a population largely 
dependent on tourist dollars -- a population whose roots in the campo are 
growing ever weaker. He shrugged and shook his head. "Why not?" he answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 I ENLISTED MY WIFE AS Awalking partner the next morning, and we set off to 
visit the pool where Chan, the water god, lives. We headed up the ravine, 
walking under the shade of pepper trees and willows. At the first pool, the 
path we had been following faded into nothing and we wandered lost for a few 
minutes. I crawled out of the brush and heard the thick drone of a beehive 
thrumming busily in the rock face above me. This wasn't the way -- or at least 
not our way. 
</P>
<P>
 At the second pool, we came upon a pair of lovers entwined in a desperate 
embrace. Coughing loudly to announce our approach, we said our good days and 
asked where the trail to the water god's pool was. The young man smiled 
awkwardly and pointed over his shoulder at the opposite side of the ravine. 
"It's over there," he said. "Turn right at the garambullo." His girlfriend kept 
her head discreetly buried in the crook of his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail hugged the side of the arroyo, just above where the high-water mark 
would be in rainy season, and as we scrambled through the bushes and over the 
dried lichen of rocks, we regretted our Gap shorts and our walking shoes 
designed more for concrete than an uneven, dried riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 One pool led to another and as we progressed up the arroyo, the walls closed 
in on us. Looking up we could see the nests of birds and scores of garambullos 
and other cacti clinging to small ledges in the granite. The view from here was 
far more intimate than that afforded from the garden above. The trail petered 
out against a solid stone wall and we angled back in to the riverbed, climbing 
over huge rocks.  
</P>
<P>
 After another hour of scrambling over rocks, we eventually came to the end of 
our journey, the still, deep pool of Chan. Far above us, the stone walkways of 
the garden were clearly visible as they zigzagged along the walls of the 
arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
 This was as far as we could go and it was just as well. My feet were killing 
me and we had run out of water a half-hour earlier. But I wasn't sorry we had 
come. While the view from the garden had opened my eyes to the country, making 
the trek to the pool of Chan was the closest I had come to the home of a god.

 The Gardens of San Miguel 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone and prices: The country code for Mexico is 52 and the area code for 
San Miguel de Allende is 465. Prices are approximate and are computed at the 
rate of 3.3 new pesos to the dollar. Hotel prices are for a double room for one 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: There is no commercial air service to San Miguel de Allende. 
The nearest major airport is that of Mexico City, about 150 miles away; smaller 
airports are those of Leon and Queretaro, approximately 110 and 60 miles away, 
respectively. Numerous carriers fly daily nonstops from Los Angeles to Mexico 
City, including Mexicana, Aeromexico, United and Delta. Alaska Airlines has one 
daily nonstop from Ontario. There are also many connecting flights. Aeromexico 
offers one daily flight from LAX to Leon, via Puerto Vallarta. Mexicana has 
connecting flights to Queretaro via Mexico City or Guadalajara. From Mexico 
City, take a rental car or the four-hour nonstop first-class bus from the 
city's Terminal de Autobus del Norte, or Northern Bus Terminal, about $12. 
Unless you have a rental car, the best transportation to San Miguel from Leon 
or Queretaro is by taxi. Figure about 90 minutes and $100 from the former, a 
bit less than an hour and $35-$40 from the latter -- though it may be possible 
to bargain these prices down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: San Miguel is full of good hotels. Particularly recommended 
are: Casa de Sierra Nevada, Hospicio 35, telephone 204-15, fax 223-37. A small, 
nicely furnished inn with a pool and some fireplaces available. Rates: 
$75-$180. Hacienda de las Flores, Hospicio 16, tel. 218-08, fax 218-59. In a 
colonial-style hacienda, with a good restaurant attached. Rates: $87-$126. 
Hotel Villa Jacaranda, Aldama 53, tel. 210-15, fax, 208-83. An attractive hotel 
with fireplaces and some private patios. Rates: $78-$96. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the gardens: El Charco del Ingenio is a 15-minute taxi ride from the 
center of San Miguel; fare, approximately $4. You can also approach the park 
from its western entrance at the top end of the Balcones housing area. To 
ascend the arroyo from its base, take a cab to the Presa del Obraje (about $2) 
and follow any of the paths up the arroyo. At the first pool, walk toward the 
right-hand wall of the arroyo and follow the stone path to its end. Admission 
to the park is about $1.75.

<TEXT>
<P>
 IF AS JORGE LUIS BORGES ONCE WROTE, "EVERYTHING having to do with water is 
poetic," then the state of Maine must stand as a major emotional, as well as 
hydraulic, watershed.  
</P>
<P>
 If a river ever ran through any place, it runs through Maine. It is called the 
Penobscot -- 350 miles of rushing water, draining nearly 9,000 square miles of 
down east landscape. And the Penobscot is hardly the state's only river. 
There's the St. Croix on the Canadian border, the Dennys, the Pleasant, the 
East Machias, the Machias, the Narraguagus, the Union, the Sheepscot and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Water, in fact -- whether fresh, brackish or salt -- is almost certainly the 
most seductive element of Maine's many charms. The rivers range from 
crystal-clear to tea-colored, tinted with tannin from the northern woodlands in 
which they arise. They range from black glass slides to white-water rapids, 
down which rafters and kayakers hurtle through rocky chutes. Some rivers and 
ponds are close by major roadways; others are strictly fly-in spots, wild 
enough to engender the suspicion that no mortal soul has ever before set foot 
in their precincts (though plenty probably have). From the North Maine Woods to 
the state's central highlands to its 3,000-plus miles of tortuous coastline, 
water defines and illuminates the place. It courses through the stunning 
scenery, veins the habitats of moose, bears, deer, hawks and eagles, offers 
endless opportunities for sailing and cruising and clambering along -- and, 
above all, offers anglers some of the best fly-fishing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 I say "above all" because I know Maine's waters most of all as repositories of 
fish. It certainly isn't necessary to fish to encounter the state's aqueous 
wonders up close -- boaters, hikers and even just casual strollers can enjoy 
its lakes and rivers readily -- but fly-fishing ineluctably draws those of us 
who love it to the very origins of water, and thus into some of Maine's most 
pristine wildernesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly-fishing in Maine falls into three technical, tactical, moral/metaphysical 
planes, known as brook trout, landlocked salmon and Atlantic salmon. The 
perfection with which these three Salmonidae complement and complete each other 
suggests, perhaps as much as anything, the hand of a Supreme Being at work. 
Brook trout feed the body and respond to logic; Atlantic salmon feed the spirit 
and confirm that human reason falls well short of solving the great mysteries 
of the universe; landlocked salmon are an intermediary step. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal progression for a fishing life in Maine is to begin with brook 
trout soon after one learns to walk, and to cast a fly and to end up on 
Atlantics after becoming old and philosophically resigned to the greater beauty 
and futility of all things. In between, the landlockeds guide the adventurous 
angler into some of the state's most beautiful wilderness and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a particularly egalitarian, democratic quality to fly-fishing in 
Maine. In the first place, there is no private water in the state. All rivers, 
ponds and lakes are open to the public, their fish available to anyone with a 
fishing license. Secondly, the fish themselves are enthusiastic and aggressive 
fly-batterers -- reckless creatures with a weakness for any fly that shines or 
sparkles or moves (unlike the more selective European brown trout, well-known 
as gourmets and holders of advanced degrees in entomology). 
</P>
<P>
 My earliest fishing-related memory -- possibly my earliest memory at all -- is 
of being whacked in the face by pine branches as my father carried me on his 
shoulders through the forests and swamplands of Hancock County on our way to 
distant streams or brooks. Brook trout were everywhere, and these miniature 
beauties were voracious feeders, happy to take nearly any fly we could get into 
the water. The farther away from civilization we'd get, the more abundant and 
cooperative were the trout. As the summer deepened and the temperature rose, 
they would make things even easier, collecting around the icy feeder streams 
that, to my father, were like private resources. These he managed 
parsimoniously, never over-plundering any one trove of trout, but harvesting 
one here, one there, releasing the larger seed fish, killing only selected 
pan-sized candidates. The landlocked salmon, Salmo sebago , was originally, a 
million years ago or so, a sea-run salmon cut off from the Atlantic. First 
identified in Maine's Sebago Lake, they are among the state's proudest 
inventions. At their best -- in the late summer and early fall when they 
migrate up rivers and streams to spawn -- landlocked salmon are plump and hard, 
silver-sided, spattered with dark freckles along their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Branch of the Penobscot, especially the stretch below Ripogenus Dam, 
is fabled landlocked salmon water. The Rapid River at Middle Dam on Richardson 
Lake, the Roach River at Kokadjo near Greenville, the Kennebec River at its 
West Outlet from Moosehead Lake and the Grand Lake Stream in Washington County 
complete a royal flush of salmon streams. The Kennebago River near Lower 
Cupsuptic Township is another fine fishing ground for landlocked salmon (though 
there are also trout aplenty). Sebago Lake is famous not only as the birthplace 
of the landlocked salmon, but also as the site of the record landlocked catch, 
a 22 1/2-pounder taken in 1907 -- and there are landlockeds, too, in the 
Rangeley Lakes, Moosehead Lake (Maine's largest) and West Grand Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursuit of the landlocked salmon is a step away from the simple beauty and 
logical perfection of brook-trouting. Like the Atlantic salmon, the landlocked 
takes a fly for reasons other than sheer misguided hunger. Known to stop 
feeding during the spawning run, both species are believed to attack flies for 
similar primal motives -- among them, habit or the memory of feeding practices, 
curiosity, playfulness, natural aggressiveness, territoriality and irritation, 
even some salmonoid form of erotic Angst .  
</P>
<P>
 I fell in love with the first landlocked salmon who was nice to me, a 
three-pound 20-incher who took my tiny 14 bivisible spider dry fly going up, 
and simply popped up into the air, spotlighted by the midmorning sun that had 
come over Mt. Katahdin. There he was, shining sleekly and wet and silver, a 
foot or two above the fast-flowing black glass surface of the West Branch of 
the Penobscot, the mountain looming in the background. And there I was, 
understandably, I think, dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 FLY-FISHING FOR ATLANTIC SALMon is, in a sense, graduate school. The trout 
fisher arrives at this level having learned a number of skills that prove to be 
nearly useless in this new pursuit. Salmon lie in different spots in the river 
and take flies for almost none of the reasons trout do. Salmon fishing is 
humbling; logic goes out the window. Known as "the fish of a thousand casts," 
the Atlantic salmon sometimes takes a fly of a certain size and pattern, moving 
in a certain manner, at a certain speed in water of a certain temperature -- 
and sometimes doesn't.  
</P>
<P>
 Maine presently offers the only Atlantic salmon fishing in the United States. 
The season opens on the first of May with a ritual event: Beginning at 4 in the 
morning, the Veazie Salmon Club serves a breakfast of bacon and eggs, sausages, 
baked beans, biscuits and all the coffee you can drink as insulation against 
what is often a bitterly cold dawn. By the time everyone is finished, bright 
new fish just back from gorging themselves on Greenland krill -- tiny 
shrimplike crustaceans the salmon seek at sea -- have usually entered the 
Penobscot. The legal Atlantic salmon limit is one per year per angler. By 
tradition, the first fish taken each season is sent to the President of the 
United States, while the lucky fisherman who caught it is permitted to snag a 
second one for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when salmon fishing seemed to me like some elaborate hoax, or 
like some riddle that I was destined never to decipher. Did anyone really catch 
these things? I wondered. Then I found out. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started on the Narraguagus up in Cherryfield, when I helped David 
Livingstone land his 12-pound salmon. We were the only fishermen at the famous 
Cable Pool when David hooked up; I ran for the net in the back of his truck and 
nervously scooped his fish out of the water. He was so grateful that he snipped 
off the triumphant fly, a green and yellow and white creation known as a 
Cosseboom, and gave it to me for luck. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, after a fishless day on the Penobscot, I found myself, 
through some miscalculation, on an errand in the town of Ellsworth, where there 
was a minor salmon river, the Union, from which a fish or two were known to be 
taken annually. I decided to have a look. 
</P>
<P>
 As I arrived at the river, a fish splashed over a downstream ledge and into a 
pool. I couldn't resist. Moments later, David Livingstone's Cosseboom swung 
past the fish's snout and he took it as if he had been waiting for it all his 
life. It was just after 7 in the evening in late June, and there would be light 
until nearly 10 -- plenty of time to bring it in. Using proper gear and correct 
salmon-fighting technique, it is supposed to take about a minute a pound to 
land an Atlantic salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, my rod was on the light side, and I was not overly confident 
about my knots and the strength of my nylon leader. Besides, my soft-handed 
trout-fishing techniques (trout fishermen are used to light gear, which must be 
handled delicately) allowed the salmon to recover between rounds, and the 
battle seemed to drag on forever. I simply couldn't land him. He took me out of 
one pool, downstream into the next pool and then decided to head for open 
ocean. Without the power to turn him, I had to let him run, following him 
nearly half a mile downstream to the bridge in downtown Ellsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost dark when a silver-haired gentleman fishing on the other side of 
the stream with his wife called out, "Hang on there. I'll go see if I can get a 
net." I endeavored to remain connected to my fish while the couple disappeared 
into the gloom. Twenty minutes later, they clambered down the bank on my side, 
like descending angels, equipped with flashlight and landing net. 
</P>
<P>
 It was over in seconds. I held my breath as the man's hand felt its way down 
my leader and the net slid under the fish -- a 12-pounder so bright, so fresh 
from the sea, that there was a pinkish glow through the nearly transparent 
white-silver skin on his gleaming sides. I thanked them both again and again, 
clipped off David Livingstone's lucky Cosseboom and passed it along to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, after years of trying, this longtime Union River angler landed 
his first Atlantic salmon using that very fly.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been other fish since that one, but none so bright, and none so 
lucky. I haven't been to the Union many times since then, but when I go, I look 
for my white-haired savior at his spot along the narrowest part of the channel 
on the far bank. Sometimes he's there, and he concedes me a small, understated 
downeast wave. GUIDEBOOK

By Jack London, John (Jack) Griffith London (1876-1916) was illegitimate, a 
onetime hobo, an adventurer, both socialist and racist, an alcoholic, 
ultimately a suicide. He was also a prolific, often surprising writersaid to 
have been the highest-paid author in America at the height of his career. 
Besides his well-known Alaskan canine adventure tales, The Call of the Wild and 
White Fang, and his Nietzschean sea saga, The Sea-Wolf, he wrote nearly 50 
books from 1900 to his death 16 years laterworks of fantasy (The Star Rover, 
Before Adam, The Iron Heel), existential short fiction (When God Laughs, The 
Game), a semi-autobiographical temperance tract (John Barleycorn)even a sort of 
travel book, The Cruise of the Snark, based on his wanderings in the Pacific 
aboard his ketch of that name. From that volume, published in 1911, comes this 
edited account of London's stay on the sands of a long-vanished Waikiki and his 
encounter with the then-little-known (beyond Hawaii) sport of surf-riding, in 
the days before sun block.

 The grass grows right down to the water at Waikiki Beach, and within 50 feet 
of the everlasting sea. The trees also grow down to the salty edge of things, 
and one sits in their shade and looks seaward at a majestic surf thundering in 
on the beach to one's very feet. Half a mile out, where is the reef, the 
white-headed combers thrust suddenly skyward out of the placid turquoise blue 
and come rolling in to shore. One after another they come, a mile long, with 
smoking crests, the white battalions of the infinite army of the sea. And one 
sits and listens to the perpetual roar, and feels tiny and fragile before this 
tremendous force expressing itself in fury and foam and sound. Indeed, one 
feels microscopically small, and the thought that one may wrestle with this sea 
raises in one's imagination a thrill of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 The water that rolls in on Waikiki Beach is just the same as the water that 
laves the shores of all the Hawaiian Islands; and in ways, especially from the 
swimmer's standpoint, it is wonderful water. It is cool enough to be 
comfortable, while it is warm enough to permit a swimmer to stay in all day 
without experiencing a chill. Under the sun or the stars, at high noon or at 
midnight, in midwinter or in midsummer, it does not matter when, it is always 
the same temperature. It is wonderful water, salt as old ocean itself, pure and 
crystal-clear. When the nature of the water is considered, it is not so 
remarkable after all that the Kanakas (Hawaiians) are one of the most expert of 
swimming races.

 The man who wants to learn surf-riding must be a strong swimmer, and he must 
be used to going under the water. After that, fair strength and common sense 
are all that is required. One slides down the face of a breaker on his 
surfboard, but he has to get started to sliding. Board and rider must be moving 
shoreward at a good rate before the wave overtakes them. When you see the wave 
coming that you want to ride in, you turn tail to it and paddle shoreward with 
all your strength, using what is called the windmill stroke. This is a sort of 
spurt performed immediately in front of the wave. If the board is going fast 
enough, the wave accelerates it, and the board begins its quarter-of-a-mile 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
 I shall never forget the first big wave I caught out there in the deep water. 
I saw it coming, turned my back on it and paddled for dear life. Faster and 
faster my board went, till it seemed my arms would drop off. What was happening 
behind me I could not tell. One cannot look behind and paddle the windmill 
stroke. I heard the crest of the wave hissing and churning, and then my board 
was lifted and flung forward. I scarcely knew what happened the first 
half-minute. Though I kept my eyes open, I could not see anything, for I was 
buried in the rushing white of the crest. But I did not mind. I was chiefly 
conscious of ecstatic bliss at having caught the wave. At the end of the 
half-minute, however, I began to see things, and to breathe. I saw that three 
feet of the nose of my board was clear out of water and riding on air. I 
shifted my weight forward, and made the nose come down. Then I lay, quite at 
rest in the midst of the wild movement, and watched the shore and the bathers 
on the beach grow distinct. It was my second day of surf-riding, and I was 
quite proud of myself. I stayed out there four hours. 
</P>

 On the morrow I was in bed. I was not sick, but I was very unhappy. When 
describing the wonderful water of Hawaii, I forgot to describe the wonderful 
sun of Hawaii. It is a tropic sun and, furthermore, in the first part of June, 
it is an overhead sun. It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. For the first 
time in my life I was sunburned unawares. My arms, shoulders and back had been 
burned many times in the past and were tough; but not so my legs. And for four 
hours I had exposed the tender backs of my legs, at right-angles, to that 
perpendicular Hawaiian sun. Sunburn at first is merely warm; after that it 
grows intense and the blisters come out. Also, the joints, where the skin 
wrinkles, refuse to bend. That is why I spent the next day in bed. I couldn't 
walk. And that is why, today, I am writing this in bed. But tomorrow, ah, 
tomorrow, I shall be out in that wonderful water, and I shall come in standing 
up.
