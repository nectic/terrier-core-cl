 3 STRIKES AND YOU'RE WHERE? DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Policy-making fueled as much by frustration and anger as by careful thought 
is, too often, policy-making that does not achieve its objectives. Despite the 
best of intentions, the many bills pending in the Legislature and an initiative 
on the November ballot that would impose life sentences on repeat felons may be 
an object lesson. "Three strikes and you're out" is a good idea that could well 
be undermined by poor execution and the failure of proponents to answer obvious 
questions and plan for implementation.  
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial Sunday, we addressed the first-order questions that these 
three-strikes proposals raise: Do some of these measures cast too broad a net 
when they define serious, but not necessarily violent, felonies as a "strike"? 
We think they do. Do California prisons have the room to incarcerate three-time 
felons for life? The state correctional system is already severely overcrowded 
and despite its ongoing building program prisons will be at more than 200% of 
capacity by 1999 even if none of the three-strikes proposals become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we focus on the second-order implications of these highly popular 
proposals: their cost and the extent to which California prisons can 
accommodate repeat felons serving life terms by changing the existing mix of 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of the three-strikes proposals certainly would place enormous additional 
pressure on the prison system and therefore on the state's already 
barer-than-bare-bones budget. But how many more beds would be needed and how 
much more money would it cost to incarcerate for life the thousands of repeat 
felons that proponents estimate would be convicted each year? Only 1% of state 
prisoners currently are serving sentences of life without the possibility of 
parole. Even a small increase in some inmates' sentences can produce a big need 
for additional space. When the average sentence of male felons recently 
increased by just nine days, state prison officials found they suddenly needed 
500 new beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative analyst estimates that housing felons under the broadest 
of these proposals would entail several billion dollars in prison construction 
plus additional costs of incarceration that could reach more than $1 billion 
annually. The Department of Finance has yet to release its own estimate, but 
the Legislature and the governor seem bent on approving these proposals, 
despite their onerous cost potential. That's not smart.  
</P>
<P>
 Can we make better use of the prison space we already have? Like some other 
states and the federal government, California has conducted a high-profile drug 
war in recent years. The percentage of state prisoners incarcerated for drug 
offenses has risen while that of violent criminals has dropped -- from 60% to 
43%. Nearly one in four state prisoners are behind bars for drug possession, 
manufacture or sale. The state might be able to make some room for three-time 
losers by rehabilitating more drug offenders and incarcerating fewer of them. 
But not much room, since these individuals generally receive much shorter terms 
than do murderers or child molesters.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if we could house all the three-time losers, would Californians be safer? 
It's not clear. Before they were locked up for life, these repeat felons would 
have committed at least three major crimes -- leaving at least three victims in 
their wake. Moreover, as the rate of incarceration has risen in California -- 
by 300% since 1971 -- the crime rate has remained relatively flat. Some 
researchers believe that incarcerating more prisoners has helped keep the crime 
rate stable; others believe incarceration has had no impact on crime. Whatever 
the reason, crime in California has not dropped dramatically with more 
criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a better way to fight crime in California?  
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to incarcerate repeat felons for life make sense only if targeted on 
those who have committed repeat violent crimes. Such proposals would ensure 
that at least those individuals would not strike again. 
</P>
<P>
 But since criminals over 40 have a much reduced propensity for violence, why 
not just incarcerate violent felons until they are middle-aged rather than for 
life? Or spend the money we might otherwise use in keeping these aging felons 
in prison for life to educate them or teach them a useful skill? That might 
well be more cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly our current approach to crime control isn't working. But despite the 
obvious visceral appeal of "three strikes," there is no quick fix in the war on 
violent crime. Three-strikes laws may prove to be only the latest in a long 
line of criminal justice fads to capture the public's fancy, including harsh 
mandatory prison terms for minor drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-strikes laws may indeed prove helpful, but only if they are narrowly 
targeted and carefully implemented. And even then, they are not "the answer" 
but rather only one part of a broader, more comprehensive approach to crime 
that focuses as much on crime prevention as on punishment. And that means 
strict limits on the private possession of handguns and assault weapons, limits 
that can help prevent the most troubled among us from becoming three-time 
losers.

MUSCLES FOR FREEWAYS; NO ONE'S LAUGHING AT RETROFITTING ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the terrible damage the Northridge earthquake caused, nothing 
illustrated the sheer destructive power of a big quake more than the failure of 
parts of the Santa Monica, San Fernando-Simi Valley and Golden State freeways. 
In fact, outside California those fallen freeways have become symbols of the 
quake, shown again and again on television and in the print media. However, 
it's easy to forget, while shuddering at the awesome sight of tons of torn 
steel and concrete and pondering what it all will cost to repair, that only 
eight freeway bridges collapsed while dozens of others withstood the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bridges that held up, according to a formal report completed last 
week by a special Post Earthquake Investigation Team of the California 
Department of Transportation engineers, were those that had been retrofitted 
under an accelerated construction program begun by Caltrans after the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake. That shows that even if earthquake damage to the vital 
infrastructure can't be prevented, it at least can be mitigated. Or, as the 
chief of Caltrans' office of earthquake engineering succinctly put it, it shows 
"what we were doing is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Caltrans retrofitting program should have moved along faster. 
It has been critically noted on this page that blame for the unfortunate delays 
must be shared. The union representing Caltrans' engineers fought way too long 
against giving out design contracts to private engineering firms. And Caltrans 
let the union's opposition weaken the momentum of the retrofitting program, 
which began after the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland in the 1989 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the time for blaming is past. The Northridge earthquake has renewed the 
sense of urgency in strengthening all of California's quake-vulnerable bridges 
and highway overpasses. And this time no delays must be brooked or no 
reasonable expense spared. For better or worse, freeways and other highways are 
the backbone of California's transportation system. That's why they are such 
powerful symbols on the rare occasions that they fail.

 The Feb. 1 story of the clock that started ticking after the recent earthquake 
struck home.I have a chime clock hanging on my office wall that had not been 
working for over two years. I thought of discarding it on many occasions but 
never got around to it. Lo and behold on the day of the quake I arrived in my 
office and the damned thing was ticking away and chiming! My office is in a 
hospital built like a fortress, but somehow the earthquake managed to revive 
this dormant timepiece.

ANNIVERSARY OF A FATWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today marks the fifth anniversary of the fatwa, or decree of death, issued by 
Iran against Salman Rushdie for his novel "The Satanic Verses." The anniversary 
is not going unnoticed.The Rushdie Defense Committee USA, made up of a dozen 
major American literary organizations, including the Assn. of American 
Publishers, the American Booksellers Assn., the American Library Assn., and PEN 
Center USA West, is distributing half a million pro-Rushdie book inserts. 
Anyone buying or borrowing a book this week is likely to be reminded that 
Rushdie still lives and Iran still wants him dead.  
</P>
<P>
 Will it all have any effect? Salman Rushdie may be doing better on his own 
terms, just now, than the fanatic government installed in Tehran by the Islamic 
revolution is doing on its. Among the revolution's "successes" are attacks on 
three Rushdie translators and the murder of one, the Japanese translator 
Hitoshi Igarashi. But those attacks are dwarfed by the size and strength of the 
international consensus that the fatwa has called into being. The fatwa has 
become a standing reminder that reading in our day is often an international as 
well as interpersonal activity and that a threat anywhere becomes, potentially, 
a threat everywhere. Reading, in a word, is as international as terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Rushdie Defense Committee USA, we hope that Rushdie will live, 
thrive and continue to mine his multicultural literary talent. But he has 
already given the international literary world more than it falls to most 
writers to give. He has reminded all readers of the link, in any serious 
writer's work, between courage and truth.

 I enjoyed reading your new feature, Jane Spiller's "Favorite Places," in 
Voices, Jan. 24.The concept is refreshing and entertaining, particularly with 
the rebuilding challenges we all will be facing in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 It is nice to read about nearby places we can enjoy without a two-hour drive, 
$50 admission and mind-numbing crowds. Thanks for the break.

SEISMIC UPGRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Seismic Experts See College Buildings as Potential Deathtraps" 
(Feb. 1) neglected to mention that in the last seven years the University of 
California has completed or begun work on its nine campuses to reinforce over 
100 older campus facilities against seismic risks. 
</P>
<P>
 As your story noted, plans call for completing work on 87 other facilities 
identified as needing seismic upgrading by the year 2001.We are now looking for 
ways to complete that work even faster.The health and safety of our students, 
faculty and staff are our top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the university's older residence halls have been reinforced and the 
buildings identified as having the greatest risk are being retrofitted in 
priority order as funding and scheduling permits. It was not until 1985 that 
the state began providing significant amounts of funds for seismic 
retrofitting. After the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, the university took out its own 
$50 million loan to help speed up the work.

MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one is more interested or concerned in ridding Riverside County of the 
Medfly than farmers and ranchers. The Medfly is not only a threat to farms and 
our food supply, it is a clear and present danger to our state's economy. It is 
evident that some residents do not fully understand all of the risks if 
eradication is not achieved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have expressed concern about helicopters flying over urban 
neighborhoods. They are confused and frightened. Opportunists and others have 
been quick to grab the headlines and notoriety by feeding on those fears. They 
have rejected a mountain of scientific study that shows malathion bait to be a 
safe and effective eradication tool. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most needed at this stage is a healthy dose of factual information to 
eradicate fears about malathion and the Medfly. The aerial bait program 
consists of applying a mixture of protein bait and 1.2 ounces of malathion per 
acre, about one-sixth of an ounce of malathion on an average city lot of 60 by 
100 feet. This amount of malathion is half the amount used in the last bait 
spray program in Los Angeles. The malathion bait is applied in particles that 
are sticky and that people cannot inhale. As with any chemical, safety depends 
on the amount and manner in which it is used. Compelling evidence shows that 
the aerial malathion bait program is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the concern about the Medfly eradication program has been grounded in 
the perceived risks associated with malathion bait. But what are the risk if we 
don't use the proven effective and safe eradication tool? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is the amount of malathion being used in the current eradication 
effort is minuscule compared to the amount of pesticides that would be applied 
each year to combat the Medfly statewide if eradication efforts do not proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Back-yard gardens would have to be treated to keep produce free of maggots. 
Integrated pest management programs designated to reduce pesticide use on farms 
would suffer severe setbacks. The threatened embargo of all California produce 
by Japan would be the first of many dominoes to fall on the state's economy. 
Other countries and other states would likely close their doors to our produce. 
That would hurt not just farmers, but the estimated 10% of the state's total 
jobs that depend on agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot lose sight of the fact that the Medfly is not solely an agricultural 
threat, it is a threat to our way of life in California. 
</P>
<P>
 We are in this fight together, farmers and non-farmers. Malathion bait 
spraying is not for the benefit of California farmers at the expense of urban 
residents in Riverside County. It must be continued for the environment, public 
health and the economic good of the entire state.

FARRAKHAN AND ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Wilkins has it wrong (Opinion, Feb. 6). The paradox is not Louis 
Farrakhan. The paradox is mainstream black leadership. They did not embrace 
Farrakhan because they liked him or agreed with his message. They embraced him 
because large segments of black America did. If Farrakhan seized the leadership 
high ground, it was because mainstream black leaders fumbled the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s and 1980s, the NAACP, Urban League and the Congressional 
Black Caucus crafted a myopic agenda that appealed to upwardly mobile black 
business people and professionals, while excluding the black poor. Affirmative 
action, economic parity, professional advancement and busing replaced poverty, 
unemployment, quality education and political empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 The schism between the black poor and the black middle class grew deeper. It 
was especially damaging to young blacks. Stripped of credible leadership role 
models, and with dwindling job and educational opportunities, many turned to 
gangs, guns and drugs. Farrakhan stepped into the breech. He talked tough to 
"whitey" and seemed to have practical answers for ghetto problems. The attacks 
by mainstream black leaders, the media and Jewish groups made him even more 
appealing to many blacks who saw him as both rebel and martyr.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins deludes himself when he asserts that mainstream black leaders are back 
in control. They aren't. Farrakhan will again turn the "isolation" and 
ostracism by mainstream black leaders to his advantage and likely gain even 
more converts. 
</P>

<P>
 The Times has done record-breaking moral gymnastics to avoid unambiguously 
condemning Farrakhan (editorial, Feb. 4). Your solicitude for this bigot is 
difficult to comprehend. Your describe him as "an unrepentant hatemonger at 
times." What, then, is a full-time hatemonger like? It is as if the hate can be 
parsed from the hater.  
</P>
<P>
 You are waiting for him to unambiguously separate himself from his national 
spokesman Khallid Abdul Muhammad's remarks attacking Jews, gays, Catholics and 
whites. Farrakhan didn't and he won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's and the Nation of Islam's ideology is suffused with hate and 
division. But you don't have to take the Anti-Defamation League's word for it 
-- Henry Louis Gates, chairman of the Black Studies Department at Harvard 
University, has written: "The strategy of these apostles of hate (the Nation of 
Islam), I believe, is best understood as ethnic isolationism -- they know that 
the more isolated Black America becomes, the greater their power. What's the 
most efficient way to begin to sever Black America from its allies? Bash the 
Jews, these demagogues apparently calculate, and you're halfway there." 
</P>
<P>
 What The Times so glaringly fails to understand is that racial isolationism, 
anti-Semitism and anti-white racism are not incidental to the Nation of Islam's 
agenda, but at the very heart of it.

 I am very disheartened by all of the comments both pro and con regarding the 
recent events involving Farrakhan. Decades ago Malcolm X said, "What needs to 
happen is for the white man and the black man to sit down at a table together. 
The white man should tell the black man his feelings with a concern for the 
black man's feelings, and the black man should tell the white man his feelings 
with a concern for the white man's feelings. Then all of this stuff that's 
under the table can be placed on top of it, and we can all start dealing with 
it." Malcolm X was portrayed as a militant. In this age of reason, we could use 
more militants.

<P>
 Yes, black racism is as intrinsically sinful and evil as white racism. But the 
issue is power, of which black racism has very little attached. White racism 
toward African Americans is backed with the necessary economic and social power 
which results in the vicious discrimination that plagues the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad's remarks were repulsive and Farrakhan's rebuke seemed calculated and 
halfhearted. But each day in the corridors and communities of white power I 
hear the whispers and more subtly see the tools of white racism perpetuate a 
far more effective and hence destructive discriminatory force.  
</P>
<P>
 I will save my outrage until the playing field is equal between African 
Americans and whites and the power equation balanced. We should all work to 
that goal of justice rather than perpetuate the status quo while wasting time 
wondering about the sincerity of Louis Farrakhan's rebuke.

 As a member of the black community, I appreciate the fact that the media have 
made it clear that the racist views espoused by Farrakhan and his 
representatives of the Nation of Islam do not represent attitudes of the entire 
black community. Not all of us are so easily beguiled. CHRISTINE McGILL

SALMAN RUSHDIE, ST. VALENTINE AND THE BIRDS; THE HOLY EXECUTIONERS TWINNED LOVE 
AND DEATH ON THIS DAY, BUT THE SPARROWS STILL CHOOSE MATES AND TREAT SAINT AND 
KILLER ALIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT COOVER, Robert Coover's most recent novels are Pinocchio in Venice 
and A Night at the Movies (Simon and Schuster). He teaches writing at Brown 
University in Rhode Island. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, long, long ago, this was a day for love and lover, the 
erotic festival in the middle of the month of Februta Juno, goddess of the 
"Fever of Love." If the chooser hesitated, lots were cast and "Be mine" meant 
simply, "Let's do as the birds do, my love." For the 14th of February was also 
in ancient times held to be the day, as Chaucer tells us, "When ev'ry fowl 
cometh to choose her mate," and it still is, or is said to be. (Watch the 
bird-feeder for the latest news.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not so among human populations, however, for in more modern times, over the 
last 17 or 18 centuries, say, it has become a day of executions, the 
overwhelming of profane passions by holy ones being a distinguishing mark of 
the higher civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 This marriage of Death and Eros began with the execution of St. Valentine 
himself, a miracle-working priest of the Christian cult in Rome -- this one 
rumored have a special gift for helping physically handicapped young girls, but 
not for that reason alone condemned to die on the 14th of February in 270 A.D. 
by Claudius II, also known as Claudius the Goth. "Be mine," said Claudius, 
uttering the traditional mating call on this traditional day of lovers, as he 
saw to it that Valentine was, with Gothic love, clubbed to a pulp and then 
beheaded, thereby linking forever the saint-elect's suffering to the lovemaking 
of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon more Valentines appeared -- and Valentinas, too, and were in due 
course lovingly dispatched to sacred realms, leaving their bodily parts behind 
to become collectors' items, not least their sacrificed hearts, giving rise to 
the phrase, first as liturgy among the holy executioners then spreading more 
generally to the population, "Be my Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
 A beautiful phrase, stamped still on transfixed and martyred hearts passed 
about as gifts on this day, some meant to be eaten, others to be hung about the 
neck or ankle, and if it were not for the continuing incivility of the birds, 
seen by some as downright satanic, "Be My Valentine" might well have achieved 
that purity of phrase so sought after by the gods' chosen ones in their sacred 
verses. But, as it is, this ritual love call of the holy executioners to their 
beloved victims has, by association with the birds, become tainted with, at 
best, chirpy frivolity and, at worst, the aura of dirty joke, one bordering on 
necrophilia. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, over the years, St. Valentines have come and gone, mostly gone, and 
their impassioned antagonists, the executioners, with them (though more 
handsomely entombed, their bodily remains having little or no market value 
among the relic merchants). 
</P>
<P>
 The birds meanwhile have carried on as usual, punctuating their sacrilege with 
their decorative droppings on the grand tombs of the executioners, comic 
Valentines of a sort, and on all the lesser tombs as well, birds on the whole 
taking little notice of the finer points of human history, especially when 
consumed with sexual ardor, nor distinguishing clearly between lovers and 
haters. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not at all surprising, then, that on such a day of love, death and bird 
droppings, it is the comic Valentine that has become in our time the most 
popular and appropriate form of sentimental exchange, perhaps as an attempt to 
ward off the direr consequences of this day by denying the sweeter one, an 
ancient form of religious magic, alas, long since discredited, especially as 
not all recipients share the same sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 This unhappy principle of the human condition was grimly reaffirmed just a 
half-decade ago today, when, in response to the writer Salman Rushdie's witty 
comic Valentine, sent to the world in love, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
replied, in holy loathing, with a more traditional one of his own. "Be mine," 
said his Valentine's Day fatwa, and legions of sacred executioners were let 
loose upon the world, where they roam, their hearts pierced by the barbed love 
of death, to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the writer's would-be executioner is himself today entombed and 
suffering the desecrations of the irreverent and lusty birds, while the writer, 
though not free from the dead man's wrath, has gratefully not yet been 
sanctified (It is a dreadful thing to be a saint, as all Valentines have come 
to know.) and indeed enjoys a life enriched by love and worldwide admiration 
for his delicious comic Valentines, still in his power to compose. 
</P>
<P>
 So let us celebrate this Valentine's Day of 1994, then, in such comic and 
loving spirit, and in the spirit of the enraptured birds, and of the birds' 
love-billets, dropped in their excitement on the tombs of the world's 
executioners; in short, dearly beloved, let us today, as the birds do, do.

WE NEED TO RED-LIGHT THOSE RED TAGS ON REPAIRABLE BUILDINGS; QUAKE AFTERMATH: 
TO PROTECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CAUTION IS ESSENTIAL. THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR HAS 
A PROVEN TRACK RECORD IN REHABILITATING LOW-INCOME UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. SANBORN, Robert A. Sanborn is the executive director of A 
Community of Friends, which builds housing in which the mentally disabled live 
independent, non-institutional lives. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, buildings are being "red-tagged" as uninhabitable. We 
seem to assume that demolition is a given, a matter of post-earthquake fact. 
But these red-tagged structures are not just buildings, they are the heart and 
soul of neighborhoods. And in most of those neighborhoods, they are the only 
source of affordable housing stock.  
</P>
<P>
 We must find every conceivable way to save these buildings. Prudent economic 
policy demands it. If landlords tear down these buildings and get the financing 
to rebuild, the new codes demand, among other things, that a specific number of 
parking spaces be provided on the property; for efficient use of space, this 
usually means parking spaces within the building, which adds at least 30% to 
the cost. This makes new construction, at approximately $60 per square foot, 
almost twice the typical cost of rehabilitation. Landlords have no choice but 
to translate those costs directly into higher rents, which most of the 
displaced tenants will be unable to afford. That leads to the worst possible 
outcome of this disaster: Besides destroying communities, we may too easily 
create the next contingent of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Jan. 17, Los Angeles was seriously deficient in affordable 
housing. A recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in 
Washington found that more people pay a higher percentage of their income for 
rent in Los Angeles than in any other city in the nation. And that stark 
assessment did not fully account for the thousands of "pirate homes" in Los 
Angeles -- garages and shacks and truncated houses and apartments -- that are 
grossly inadequate as housing but very expensive, relative to their tenants' 
income.  
</P>
<P>
 Surely, we don't want to add to this problem by razing affordable apartments. 
There is an economical, efficient alternative: Renovate those buildings that 
remain structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must be certain that the red tag really means that the building is 
structurally beyond repair. In the time and pressure crunch after the 
earthquake, too few inspectors were forced to make too many judgments too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In one week, for example, we went from the virtual certainty that the Los 
Angeles Coliseum would have to be destroyed to the likelihood that 
rehabilitation construction efforts will save that venerable landmark. We must 
be sure that every red-tagged building in the city gets the same respect that 
the Coliseum received. We must be certain that the only alternative left to 
landlords is demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Once this assessment is made, it may be that for many of the severely damaged 
but structurally repairable buildings, renovation is not feasible for the 
owner. This is where the public sector comes in, alongside the public interest: 
Make the property available to nonprofit developers. Many of us have an 
excellent record, despite limited funding and limited government support in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dramatic advantages flow from the work of nonprofit developers. We can 
create financing packages that exchange a commitment to long-term, affordable 
housing for more attractive terms, so the cost is lower. And we are not seeking 
quick profits; our longer-term financing compels us to invest in the structural 
integrity of our properties, so they serve the community long and well. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when we need to move quickly to provide shelter for those who need 
it, the repairable red-tagged buildings offer the speediest solution. A typical 
rehab requires less than one year to complete. On the fastest possible track -- 
that is, without a single zoning hearing or planning commission review or 
neighborhood dispute -- new construction projects take at least 1 1/2 to 2 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who will rehabilitate the neighborhoods, government must 
become our ally and make the process more efficient. Resources from the federal 
Housing and Urban Development agency must be channeled into a one-stop 
clearinghouse. Ordinarily, we go through many layers of financing to achieve 
housing contracts. That won't do in this emergency.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Housing Department and the Community Redevelopment Agency also 
have responsibility to help ease the process. They must join their immense 
resources to HUD's.  
</P>
<P>
 The private sector can help as well. Financial institutions should participate 
to the greatest extent possible. It would be ideal if, at last, they create for 
Los Angeles a true coordinating council for affordable housing, a 
public/private oversight body that can assess housing need and supply, 
coordinate finance and development efforts and pressure other financial 
institutions to pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us must recognize that a citywide effort to preserve the affordable 
housing stock would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps more. The 
alternative, however, would be far more costly. Tearing down red-tagged 
apartments does not ensure that they will be rebuilt, and we cannot afford to 
risk their permanent loss. Displacing the people who called these buildings 
home will fragment a city that is already despairingly Balkanized and bring us 
another kind of disaster from which there is no recovery.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; PLANS FOR FLEXIBLE TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES ARE MOVING 
RIGHT ALONG; COMMUTING: NEXT MONTH, O.C. COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM WILL ZIP INTO 
L.A. TRANSIT WAYS, EXPRESS BUSES AND FEEDER BUS SYSTEMS WILL BE COMING SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH L. CATZ, Sarah L. Catz is a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, the Southern California Regional Rail 
Authority (Metrolink), and Commuter Transportation Service Inc. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dramatic increase in ridership on the Metrolink commuter rail system 
during the weeks after the Northridge earthquake is proof positive that every 
cloud has a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, our entire nation is talking about Metrolink. 
Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena has continually praised the Metrolink 
system, stating that Metrolink is the perfect example of what works well in the 
time of a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he applauded Metrolink's successful efforts in opening up three 
new stations in one week's time to accommodate all the people who work in the 
Burbank, Glendale and downtown Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Orange County residents, on March 28, Orange County's commuter 
rail service will join the Metrolink system with three daily round-trip train 
trips from Oceanside to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains will stop at San Juan Capistrano, Irvine, Orange, Santa Ana, Anaheim, 
Fullerton and the City of Commerce before arriving in Los Angeles. Five more 
stations will open throughout the next two years. These future stations will be 
located in San Clemente, Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo, Tustin, Buena Park and 
Norwalk. Additionally, the Orange County Transportation Authority is working on 
implementing commuter rail from Riverside to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink predicts that about 2,000 riders from Orange County will use the new 
service when it opens in March. Like riders on other Metrolink routes, Orange 
County passengers may transfer free to a variety of other transit systems, 
including the Metro Red Line subway in downtown Los Angeles. The Orange County 
Transportation Authority is rerouting commuter buses to serve the Metrolink 
stations along the route within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's earthquake definitively demonstrated that Metrolink needs to be 
one of the many options available to Orange County commuters. In addition to a 
comprehensive commuter rail system, transit ways, express buses and feeder bus 
systems will be implemented soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation demand management strategies such as alternative work hours and 
telecommuting (using telecommunications technology to connect workers to the 
main office from their home or from a satellite office close to their home) 
also need to be employed to augment existing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban rail, as opposed to the Metrolink commuter rail system, provides local 
transit service throughout the day at frequent intervals with trains stopping 
at stations spaced a mile apart. Urban rail may be a good long-term solution to 
Orange County's transportation needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board of directors is being appropriately cautious, however, because 
there is a limited amount of funds available for urban rail. Furthermore, a 
determination must be made as to whether there will be sufficient ridership to 
support an urban rail system. Still, an increasing concentration of jobs and 
higher residential densities within the county's urban core -- coupled with 
high volumes of traffic along the connecting corridors -- indicate that urban 
rail may be an appropriate long-term solution to traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 We also must not forget those residents of Orange County who depend on public 
transit for their transportation. For the past 20 years, a fixed-route bus 
service has been the foundation of Orange County's transit system. As county 
demographic patterns shift over the next 30 years, and as solo driving becomes 
more difficult and expensive, bus ridership is expected to go up. One way to 
meet that increasing demand would be to gradually increase the amount of local 
bus service the Orange County Transportation Authority offers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the voters of Orange County approved Measure M, the half-cent sales tax, 
they called for a comprehensive transportation plan to guide the county through 
today's transportation problems and to provide a balanced multimodal 
transportation network that we can now build on for the future. The aftermath 
of the earthquake underscores the importance of this comprehensive plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath also underscores the importance of a transportation plan that is 
so sufficiently comprehensive that it can reroute commuters around severed 
links in case part of the system fails. 
</P>
<P>
 To guarantee mobility before, during and after a crisis, we have to refocus 
our policy on the safe and efficient movement of people, not just vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's economic and environmental health are closely tied to its 
transportation infrastructure. By creating systems that are flexible and 
efficiently move people, goods, information and services, we can maximize the 
area's productivity and quality of life, and minimize environmental 
deterioration.

BOOK REVIEW: FOOD; CELEBRATING THE JOYS OF EATING WITH YOUR SWEETHEART;

<P>
 Yes, we went out to plenty of restaurants; that was what folks in love did in 
the '80s. But now it's all a blur of credit card slips and heavy silverware, of 
high-concept pastas and naughty desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 The one meal that sticks in my mind, from the days of our courtship, is the 
first one my now-husband cooked for me (OK, one of the only ones he cooked for 
me, since he figured the best thing for a noncook to do was blind his prey with 
a single fabulous dish and hope she'd be too sated to notice there was no 
follow-up): a caviar omelet.  
</P>
<P>
 Forget scrambled with a dollop atop. This was an architectural masterpiece: 
slim, symmetrical, slightly runny inside and just done outside, fertile with 
fish eggs. I was a goner -- and, since we weren't in a restaurant, I could 
express my appreciation in a lavish fashion. Yes, you have to wash the dishes 
and put away the leftovers, but trust me, there are advantages to taking one's 
meals at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Shacochis knows it, and has tried, over the past few years, to convince 
the readers of his "Dining In" column in GQ magazine. "Domesticity" -- rightly 
subtitled "A Gastronomic Interpretation of Love" -- is about the voluptuous 
pleasures of cooking for, and eating with, someone you love, about making meals 
a participatory rather than spectator sport. It is about excess and obsession.  
</P>
<P>
 In an era that promises interactive cable television grocery-shopping and 
hormone-driven milk cows, Shacochis wants to get back to the earth, or, in his 
particular case, the sea, establish an intimate relationship with whatever's 
freshest or indigenous to the region, and then devour it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our most damning crime against nature," he writes, "is not progress but 
disassociation." He intends to reinvent our relationship to food -- in much the 
same way that he has worked, over 17 years, to reinvent the notion of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the divine Miss F. (as he calls her in print), with whom he has 
cohabited for 17 years, are stuck to each other like two chummy grains of 
risotto. He wants to see food new too, to refresh the way we nourish ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Each column comes complete with recipes, and while Shacochis' idiosyncrasies 
and mine rarely intersect, I found that I read every one; they were vivid 
enough to taste. I think he's wrong about bacon in the carbonara, but maybe he 
doesn't live near a store that sells pancetta, bacon's sophisticated Italian 
cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that most working folks lack the time to hunt down some of the 
ingredients he calls for, let alone to cook the dishes. But who cares? The 
recipes, to my mind, are a nice little sidelight. What lingers is what 
Shacochis has to say about eating. He makes it a passionate endeavor: Damn the 
food pyramid; and who cares about what's in foodie fashion? 
</P>
<P>
 The one essential ingredient he calls for is someone to share his food with. 
Remember the tree in Philosophy 101, the one that either did or didn't make a 
sound if there was no one around to hear it? Shacochis believes that its 
collapse is silent. When Miss F. isn't around to eat with him, he loses all 
interest in ingestibles. The magic is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm alone," he writes, "the place food occupies in my life is very 
compressed and functional. It is simply base fuel, primitive, and it never 
satisfies as it does in company because the hunger it suppresses lacks, I 
suppose -- or has forgotten -- its own eloquence. It expresses little of what I 
need it to express, those essential desires. Home. Love. Passion." 
</P>
<P>
 A recently wed long-time bachelor friend would disagree. He always cooked 
himself solitary meals as a measure of his self-respect -- after all, he 
considered himself as worthy a human being alone as with company, so why not 
feed himself as well, even when it was dinner for one? But I prefer Shacochis' 
social analysis: We are not only what we eat, but whom we eat it with. It isn't 
always easy -- one of the funniest columns, surely familiar to anyone who loves 
to cook, is about the territorial battles he and Miss F. engage in, in the 
kitchen. But they always seem to end up happy at the end of a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 I imagine he and Miss F. are having a lovely Valentine's Day. I only wish that 
the semi-cook and I had been invited to eat whatever they're dishing up.

MUSIC REVIEW; TATE, PHILHARMONIC EXAMINE TWO FACES OF ROMANTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity the poor guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 He -- or, all-too-occasionally, she -- pops into town for a one-week stand 
with an unfamiliar, probably tired, possibly blase orchestra marking time until 
the regular boss comes home. The first challenge is to turn two or three meager 
rehearsals into something more than get-acquainted sessions. Then come the 
concerts, and just as some sort of rapport begins to loom on the aesthetic 
horizon, it is time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Tate, the celebrated British maestro, is the latest potential casualty 
of this hit-and-run system. Unlike some of his predecessors in the too-long 
passing parade at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he is a discerning technician 
and, even more welcome, an artist prone to interpretive insight. He doesn't 
just wave a stick at the orchestra and pray that everyone will reach the same 
cadence at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 For his Los Angeles Philharmonic program on Friday, he chose to contrast two 
extremes of romanticism: the heroic rhapsody and lofty pathos of Brahms' Second 
Piano Concerto (1881) versus the overwrought churning and reheated passions of 
William Walton's First Symphony (1935). 
</P>
<P>
 The first is a masterpiece, without question. The second raises a number of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate encountered trouble with the wonderful Brahms yet made a many-splendored 
thing of the dubious Walton. The ironies never cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem in the massive Germanic concerto could be attributed to 
the soloist, Peter Frankl, who seemed more interested in generalities than 
specifics. He traversed the notes decently enough, and tastefully, too. He 
steadfastly avoided the traps of exaggeration. Give him that. 
</P>
<P>
 But he took no chances. He played blandly, achieving neither the granitic 
force that justifies an extrovert interpretation nor the lyrical finesse that 
validates an introspective one. For the most part, he gave us safe, dull and 
dutiful Brahms, and it was made all the more prosaic by the lethargic, often 
ponderous, sometimes even sluggish responses Tate drew from the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just one saving grace here, both literal and figurative. Ronald 
Leonard, the principal cellist, brought extraordinarily mellow tone and 
sensitive inflection to his cantabile solo in the Andante. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came the Walton symphony -- painfully convoluted, more 
concerned with agonizing pomp than with elevating circumstance, an endless 
essay in muscular busy-music embellished with contrapuntal frenzy. Tate and the 
orchestra played it magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
 They almost made this gasping relic of a romanticism in bloated decay sound 
like important music. The conductor resolutely maintained tension amid the 
sprawl and sustained urgency even when the score tended to contradict it. He 
knew exactly when to surge onward and when to stall, and he distinguished 
knowingly between the bona-fide climaxes and the all-too-frequent anticlimaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The strings shimmered, but lost no intensity in the process. The brass blared 
but didn't blast. The winds managed to fuse sweetness with strength. Ardor 
never impeded accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was terrific. And it was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 The program opened with an eloquent tribute to Witold Luto- slawski, the 
Polish pioneer who died a week ago at 81. Ronald Leonard and Peter Frankl 
performed the composer's elegiac "Grave." The ever-exuberant Friday-night 
subscribers ignored the management's request for silent appreciation, and, in 
fact, went on to disrupt continuity with applause during every Luftpause as the 
concert progressed.

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW; APOCALYPSE ADRIFT; RACHEL ROSENTHAL'S 'ZONE' A FLAT, 
PREDICTABLE SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy-five years after their murder at Ekaterinburg, the last of the 
Romanovs are still a royal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Portrayed by Rachel Rosenthal and company at the Wadsworth Theater on Friday, 
the self-destructive Czar and his doomed family wear clown-white makeup, 
endlessly flaunt their power and speak nonstop platitudes using the maddeningly 
arch tone of voice that performance artists reserve for the uncomprehending 
ruling class. As they relentlessly declare for a very long 105 minutes, they're 
unredeemably bad, bad, bad, and their pal Rasputin is even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Rosenthal's apocalyptic spectacle "Zone" makes you feel the Romanovs 
deserved to be killed for boring everyone to death -- and her infatuation with 
them represents a fatal miscalculation. She wants the clan of Nicholas II to 
symbolize all the evils of a heedless, suicidal patriarchy that continues to 
bedevil the planet. But her satire quickly grows flatly predictable, and, 
anyway, the metaphor doesn't hold.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many of our leaders, the last Romanovs ricocheted between law-and-order 
brutality and gutless, ineffective social reforms, but Rosenthal makes them 
nothing but pampered, bejeweled oppressors mouthing a specious world view. It's 
impossible to identify with these cartoon tyrants, yet that's exactly the 
connection she insists upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dynamics at work at the beginning of this century are sadly echoed in our 
own times," she writes in her program notes. "A ruling class oppress (sic) with 
impunity and doesn't 'get it.' We still don't quite 'get it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds right, but the failure of "Zone" is that it never makes us feel or 
believe that "we." We remain unimplicated. For instance, Rosenthal's Romanovs 
are shown as maniacally manipulative and controlling, but when was the last 
time any of us felt we had the power to make anything but severely limited 
choices about our lives?  
</P>
<P>
 No, the image in "Zone" that resonates the strongest is a comparatively 
undeveloped one borrowed from an epoch-defining Romantic canvas by Theodore 
Gericault: people adrift on a raft in dangerous waters. Desperate for rescue, 
they cling to one another and know that at every moment the smallest action 
could bring destruction or enhance chances for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of restricted options within a maelstrom not only connects with the 
evolving Southern California Gotterdammerung but brings us deep within the 
chaos theory that informs "Zone." It also allows Rosenthal to work persuasively 
at an imposing theatrical scale -- something the Romanov scenes fail to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is her misuse of theater technology: adopting an 
obnoxiously obvious acting style for the royal family and then making the 
performers project that into microphones. The result quickly achieves a level 
of overkill approaching Nicholas' own excesses on "Bloody Sunday." Similarly, 
all the grandiose smoke effects seem a mite ingenuous in a piece with 
preserving-the-environment as a major theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zone," which was also performed Saturday, boasts resourceful choreography by 
Mehmet Sander, atmospheric music by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev (both uncredited) 
and Amy Knoles -- plus spectacular lighting by Kevin Adams that re-creates some 
of the more celebrated images from Hal Prince musicals. (There's the 
ghosts-in-a-void look from "Follies," the glare-curtain from "Cabaret," the 
masses-on-the-march floods from "Evita," etc.) Three dozen multicultural 
volunteers symbolize the proletariat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, the evening's indelible moments are intimate and personal 
exceptions to the emphasis on overblown rhetoric and pageantry: Angie Bray's 
horrifying description of a horse's death and, better still, Rosenthal's vivid, 
troubled memories of Yosemite and Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
 Here we marvel again at the inimitable, bittersweet master of mood and insight 
that created "L.O.W. in Gaia," instead of enduring the High-in-Concept dowager 
empress of the avant garde who hectors throughout "Zone."

COUNTERPUNCH LETTER; FOUNDERS EARNED THE ROOM THEY BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having worked as master of properties on some of David Hockney's productions 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, I have a great deal of respect for his 
outstanding talent. With regard to his recent Music Center attack, he needs to 
get his facts straight ("Music Center: Heal Thyself," Feb. 7). 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to remind him that the taxpayers voted down the building of the 
complex on three occasions and that it finally became a reality because Dorothy 
Chandler went to the private sector -- businesses and individuals -- who 
contributed the funds to give the people of Los Angeles a center they can be 
proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who gave then and continue to give today are the Founders. The Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson at the Doolittle, Los Angeles 
Opera and Los Angeles Master Chorale are companies that depend on the Founders. 
For all the Founders have done and continue to do, it is fitting that they 
should have a room into which they can take their friends and guests. And it is 
their dues that support the operation of the Founders' Room, not the 
taxpayers'. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you to Dorothy Chandler and the generous Founders for having given Los 
Angeles this elegant and beautiful complex that I am fortunate to have been a 
part of since September, 1964.

OPERA; 'RIGOLETTO': VITAL VERDI IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Verdi's "Rigoletto" is so melodious, so theatrical, so accessible and so 
familiar, some companies perform it on automatic pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera did something like that in a somnolent yet pretentious 
effort last season, conducted by Placido Domingo and staged, after a fashion, 
by his wife Marta. Now the San Diego Opera is having its way with Verdi's 
primitive masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's way is better. Much better. 
</P>
<P>
 There are surface similarities between the two versions. Both borrow the 
old-fashioned, lavishly literal, undeniably imposing decors designed by Zack 
Brown for the Washington Opera. Both are essentially conservative in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 But, where Los Angeles settled for easy cliches and hand-me-down traditions, 
San Diego tried a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night at the Civic Theatre, the advantages began in the pit, where 
Elio Boncompagni was making an auspicious local debut. The Italian conductor 
demonstrated daring fidelity to the law, if not the letter, of the recent 
critical edition prepared by Martin Chusid. 
</P>
<P>
 This meant opening virtually all the standard, unkind cuts (the only 
concession to practicality involved limiting the ducal tenor to one agitated 
verse of "Possente amor"). We heard the Rigoletto-Gilda duet, "Veglia, o 
donna," fully developed for a welcome change, and the love music of "E il sol 
dell'anima" was enhanced at last with its delirious, extended double-cadenza. 
In the last act, the lascivious tenor was allowed to ask the evil but honorable 
Sparafucile for "tua sorella e del vino" -- your sister and some wine -- a 
simple request denied by the sanctimonious censors of 1851. 
</P>
<P>
 Boncompagni paid as much attention to the composer's original instructions 
regarding phrasing and dynamics as the technical limitations and aesthetic 
inclinations of his cast would allow. He never confused scholarship with 
pedantry, however, and proved himself permissive -- perhaps a bit too 
permissive -- when it came to the interpolation of narcissistic high notes. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the conductor's concern for stylistic fidelity would have meant much, 
of course, if it precluded a vital performance. But Boncompagni revealed a keen 
appreciation of the inherent dramatic pulse. He kept the rhythms crisp, the 
textures transparent, the momentum propulsive, and he always accompanied his 
singers with supportive energy. The San Diego orchestra -- not exactly a 
virtuoso ensemble -- has seldom sounded so alert. The chorus has seldom sounded 
so elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was dominated, as it must be in any successful "Rigoletto," by the 
singing-actor in the title role. Haijing Fu, the Chinese baritone, was 
venturing this arduous challenge for the first time and, despite a few rough 
edges, served notice of a world-class talent. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not command a huge, dark, roof-rattling voice. His tone recalls the 
lyrical De Luca, perhaps, more than the dramatic Warren. No matter. It is a 
very beautiful tone: warm, open, even, well modulated and wide ranging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fu seldom forces for impact, and he knows how to make the words count, knows 
how to pace himself in the great monologues, knows how to sing softly and 
caress a long legato line. He has studied in America with Phyllis Curtin; the 
taste, honesty and valor of his performance suggest that he has learned his 
lessons well. 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor, he savors the value of restraint, which lends dignity to the 
hunchbacked jester's tragic pathos. Remember the name. Hai-jing Fu. 
</P>
<P>
 The local publicity blurbs claimed, by the way, that he came to San Diego 
"straight from the Metropolitan Opera." That company could certainly use his 
services these days, but Fu isn't even on the New York roster this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast was uneven. Sheryl Woods brought rare dramatic 
sensitivity to the plight of Gilda, even when her bright and pretty soprano 
became edgy under pressure. Fernando de la Mora strained for top notes that 
invariably turned sharp, and he conveyed little sensual charm as the Duke of 
Mantua. Still, his vocal ardor often provided disarming compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanna Guzman managed to make Maddalena alluring without resorting to vamp 
attitudes, and Martha Jane Weaver offered a telling cameo as an unusually venal 
Giovanna. The others were weak: Valentin Peytchinov introduced a dull buzz-saw 
basso as Sparafucile, and Monterone's mighty curse seemed all too puny as 
mouthed by James Scott Sikon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfgang Weber focused the drama appreciatively and moved the figures around 
Brown's ornate sets with picturesque skill. He succumbed to gimmickry only with 
some fussy-business for Monterone's violated daughter in the opening scene, 
accentuating the obvious with cheap images that previewed Gilda's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmospheric lighting scheme was designed by Richard Winkler. The late Jim 
Pringle was credited with the splendid lightning that flashed through the 
stormy finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera was performed, not incidentally, with four short acts and three long 
intermissions. There has to be a better way.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'NEW CHINESE CINEMA' FOCUSES ON REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among this week's films in the UCLA Film Archive's "New Chinese Cinema" series 
in Melnitz Theater are two set against the Cultural Revolution, Xhang Nuanxin's 
1985 "Sacrificed Youth" (Tuesday, following the 7:30 p.m. screening of "Bloody 
Morning") and Zhang Zemin's 1986 "Swan Song" (Sunday at 2 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 A gentle, beautiful film of much poignancy, "Sacrificed Youth" is misleadingly 
titled, for when its young heroine (Li Fengxu) is sent to live and work in a 
remote village of the Dai, an ancient tribal people in Western China, she 
discovers an idyllic way of life in a Garden of Eden setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swan Song" has similarly ethnographic concerns, for it deals with an elderly 
composer (Kong Xianzhu) of the Cantonese Opera, a folk musician intent on 
preserving the music of the Guangdong Province in Southern China yet 
effectively silenced by the Red Guard. A bon vivant who became a father well 
into middle age, he and his rich, plaintive music are not appreciated by his 
son (Chen Rui) until after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swan Song" is followed by Chen Kaige's highly stylized, awesomely beautiful 
1991 "Life on a String," a parable on what is here quite literally blind faith; 
its hero (Liu Zhongyuan) is the sightless master of the sanxian , the classical 
three-string Chinese banjo, who believes that once he has broken 1,000 strings, 
a compartment in his instrument will open that contains the secret that will 
bring him sight.

 Filmforum Offerings: Also screening Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the Central Library 
as part of Filmforum's "Scratching the Belly of the Beast" alternative L.A. 
cinema survey is Kent MacKenzie's "The Exiles" (1961), an unforgettable 
cinema-verite portrait of a group of impoverished Native Americans living in 
the faded, now-demolished Victorian neighborhood of Bunker Hill; playing with 
it is Arlene Bowman's unsparingly honest 40-minute "Navajo Talking Picture" 
(1986) in which Bowman reveals how little she knows or understands of her 
ancestral culture when she attempts to film her Navajo grandmother.

 Forgotten Story: Two years before the landmark "Ben-Hur" (1926), its director, 
Fred Niblo, and its star, Ramon Novarro, teamed with "Thy Name Is Woman" (at 
the Silent Movie Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.), a film as forgotten as 
"Ben-Hur" is enduringly famous. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dragged-out stage-bound, way-over-the-top melodrama, the kind of 
emotionally extravagant silent movie that's easily parodied, yet it offers a 
rare opportunity to see in a major role its legendary leading lady, the 
ill-fated Barbara La Marr, a great beauty of genuine talent whose 
scandal-ridden life ended with a drug overdose at the age of 29 in 1926. (The 
film's producer, Louis B. Mayer, appropriated La Marr's last name for his later 
Viennese import, Hedy Kiesler; La Marr herself was born Rheatha Watson.) 
</P>
<P>
 The film is being shown in a pristine print, which shows to best advantage the 
contributions of cameraman Victor Milner and art director Ben Carre, the man 
who invented his craft. 
</P>
<P>
 La Marr plays the unhappy wife of an impotent old smuggler (the appropriately 
dastardly William V. Mong), headquartered on a remote parapet in the Pyrenees 
overlooking a pass along Spain's border with France. For five years, Mong has 
been promising her that they will soon be living comfortably in Seville. 
Presently, he orders her to divert Novarro's naive, wet-behind-the-ears 
frontier guard while he and his henchman clear the cellar of contraband. As 
seductive as La Marr is, she does not come on to Novarro as an ordinary vamp, 
for he quickly perceives her misery. Just as quickly, however, they fall in 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thy Name Is Woman" is one of those films that seem to reverberate with its 
stars' private lives. You feel the emotion between the wife and the guard is 
genuine, yet you don't sense any chemistry. The world weariness, the pervasive 
sadness that La Marr brings to her role seems palpably real, especially in her 
single, startlingly revealing close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the shyness and reserve of Novarro's virginal caribinero 
seems equally authentic; on screen, Novarro was a popular Latin lover, but in 
private life he was gay; decades later he was murdered by a pair of hustlers. 
You have to wonder what he thought when he read the intertitle in which his 
guard proclaims, "I have never had anything to do with women."

STREET SMART / NORA ZAMICHOW: PALMDALE RESIDENT MASTERS THE ART OF THE DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours before dawn, Beverly Bell is readying for The Trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge quake, it has taken her as long as four hours to wend her 
way from Palmdale to her job Downtown, a 60-mile journey that once required no 
more than 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her choice is clear. With portions of her freeways snapped like bread sticks, 
she either rises at 4 a.m. and beats every other motorist to those precious few 
moving stretches of roadway or sleeps in and gets stuck. The issue is no longer 
quality of life, it's quality of drive. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bell, 53, sets two clocks, an old-fashioned battery-operated one and a 
clock radio.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to dodge traffic, she leaves her home at 5:15 a.m. and stays at 
work longer than she has to, until about 7 p.m. This gives her an hour or so at 
home before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather sit at work than sit in freeway traffic," says Bell, a secretary 
with the Automobile Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grown sons do worry. She is hardly ever home anymore. It's OK, really, she 
insists. After all, she lives alone and she does not like to watch TV except 
for the Saturday night soap opera, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," and the Rev. 
Robert Schuller's "Hour of Power" on Sunday mornings. It's not too bad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bell follows certain rituals on these cold, dark mornings. She bought a used 
car last week and reread the owner's manual to make sure there would be no 
fumbling to find the headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 She packs snacks: a can of juice and a washed apple, encased in a paper towel 
and a plastic bag. Aware that each drive is for an unknown duration, she 
dresses in layered clothing. For entertainment she brings tapes but prepares to 
switch to the radio once she reaches the 210 Freeway, in case there is a 
traffic report that could save her anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day it is 5:12 a.m. when she pulls out of her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This early in the morning, I avoid traffic," she says. "In another half-hour, 
you can't get on the freeway."  
</P>
<P>
 She makes a caffeine stop at a particular fast-food restaurant because a 
competing franchise's coffee tastes soapy. This is what it's about, she 
explains as the drive progresses: Know your options. Understand the 
consequences of your actions. Take Interstate 5 and realize you have 
consciously selected a route with potholes and rude drivers. Take Sand Canyon 
Road and recognize that you have picked a twisty-turny road occasionally pelted 
by beachball-size boulders. Take the 210 southbound instead of Interstate 5 
even though the 5 is a straight shot, because the 210 -- although five miles 
longer -- is 20 minutes faster southbound at rush hour and the drivers let you 
change lanes. ( Must you print that secret? she asks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bell is strictly a speed limit driver. She knows there are only seven Highway 
Patrol officers in her area, and she even has a pretty good hunch about where 
they park. But even at the rare momentary discovery of a completely empty 
freeway she travels 55 m.p.h., no more, no less, her shoulders slightly 
rounded, two hands squarely on the wheel, usually in the slow lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate. I watch brake lights three cars ahead," she says. "So if I have 
to stop quickly I am not going to eat the next guy's bumper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Open Bell's trunk and you will find an extra pair of shoes, a flare, a 
first-aid kit, bottles of water, extra motor oil and antifreeze, a spare 
headlight, a new set of windshield wipers, a roll of paper towels, an address 
book and a radio.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all her preparation, traffic patterns remain maddeningly random, a 
function of tens of thousands of drivers still searching for that magic route. 
It is like hunting squirrels. Sometimes, the cars are there, sometimes not, and 
you do not always understand why. Bell figures Mondays are usually pretty heavy 
but not as bad as Thursdays; Tuesdays and Wednesdays, on the other hand, are 
much worse than Fridays, which is pretty easy. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a Wednesday, the traffic is surprisingly light. A steady stream of 
lights ahead but all moving. As she drives, she sizes it up with the relish of 
an aficionado, a player. "I can't believe it's so deserted," she sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a national holiday? Ash Wednesday? Where is everyone? There is no need 
for the standard alternatives. (Even though Bell is carrying a passenger today 
she is honor-bound to duplicate her usual drive, so she is staying out of the 
car-pool lane.) Although tempted, she maintains the proper 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean she will be able to leave later for work the next morning? For 
the first time, Bell giggles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that it will happen two days in a row," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:50 a.m., she and her rider pull into the parking lot of Bell's office at 
Adams Boulevard and Figueroa Street. They are an hour earlier than Bell had 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy driving, I really do. I've always loved to drive," she says to her 
passenger. "Let me drive you to your office."

GEORGE RAMOS: JUDICIAL NOMINEE GETS THINGS DONE WITHOUT FANFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Paz proved once again last week why he'll be a great federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 With his help, the parents of Arturo (Smokey) Jimenez got a $450,000 
out-of-court settlement resulting from a 1991 wrongful death suit they filed 
after a sheriff's deputy fatally shot their 19-year-old son in the Ramona 
Gardens housing project in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough case because the deputy involved in the shooting, Jason Mann, 
had been cleared of wrongdoing by the district attorney's office and the county 
grand jury. Also, an internal Sheriff's Department investigation concluded that 
Mann and his partner, Dana Ellison, had acted within department guidelines for 
the use of deadly force during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paz, who has handled hundreds of such cases, has seen it all before. The 
controversial Jimenez shooting, which prompted protests from Chicano community 
leaders and activists and an investigation into the Sheriff's Department, was 
to him another example of unjustified police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes back to growing up in a Chicano family," he says. "Inside the home, 
you're treated as an equal. But outside the front door, reality slaps you in 
the face. You find out, 'Hey, you're not equal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When one of California's U.S. senators, Barbara Boxer, announced last August 
that she had recommended Paz, 50, for a U.S. District Court judgeship in Los 
Angeles, the choice was praised in many quarters. Many Chicanos were overjoyed 
because if confirmed, Paz and Boxer's other nominee, Los Angeles Municipal 
Judge Richard Paez, would be the first Mexican Americans to sit on the federal 
bench in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's friends and foes say he deserves the nomination because he is a 
fair-minded lawyer who plays by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't a headline-grabbing radical out to convict cops. He's a meticulous 
yet cautious man who isn't afraid to praise law enforcement authorities when 
they do right and criticize them when they do wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never retreated from his commitment of representing our community in 
police abuse cases," says Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel of 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "He's made a living 
out of a field most lawyers would shy away from." 
</P>
<P>
 One ranking law enforcement official in Los Angeles, who asked that his name 
not be used, says: "I hate what the man does to us in court, but I respect his 
work very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's involvement in police abuse cases is substantial. In 1991, a jury 
awarded $8.9 million to one of his clients, a groundskeeper, who was left 
paralyzed after being shot by a Los Angeles police officer. That is one of the 
largest awards ever rendered by a jury in such a case. The City Council later 
settled the case for $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, Paz negotiated a $400,000 settlement for the widow of a 
49-year-old Northridge man, Carl Bruaw, who died of an embolism in the County 
Jail infirmary after being strapped to a cot for six days. 
</P>
<P>
 His expertise in police abuse cases led to his appointment to a Latino 
advisory group to the Los Angeles Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz was about to score his latest victory when I caught up with him last 
Monday in the Los Angeles courtroom of Superior Court Judge Joseph R. Kalin. I 
went to see the would-be judge in action, and I could tell quickly he had the 
opposing side in the Jimenez case on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Ellison, the deputy who was with Mann on the night of the 
shooting, contradicts Mann's version of the incident -- undermining the defense 
contention that the shooting of Jimenez was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz doesn't gloat. He waits patiently while defense attorneys leave to talk 
about a possible settlement. He explains things to Elva Jimenez, the dead boy's 
mother, and she nods in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd better be prepared to continue this case if they don't offer us 
anything," he says to a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't happen. The opponents return with a $450,000 offer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once it's accepted and the Jimenez jury is dismissed, Paz begins to gather up 
his papers to leave. But the courtroom's clerk, bailiff and court stenographer 
know a good lawyer when they see one and half-jokingly beg him to stay. "Don't 
you have another case here?" they ask. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs, and leaves without fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he tells a reporter he doesn't really want to talk about the judgeship. 
"Can't you write about it later?" he gently asks. "This just isn't done." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right, of course.

 I was a child of the '60s. I wore flowers in my hair, flashed the peace sign 
to strangers, and believed, along with the Beatles, that all we needed to make 
our world a better place was love. I had no interest in social policies, reform 
of the judicial system, or responsibility of the media. I was 19 and certain 
that if everyone just hugged more and expressed their feelings of love to one 
another, everything would be "groovy." 
</P>
<P>
 This truth seemed so self-evident to me and my contemporaries, and I felt sad 
for those "straight" adults, those members of the Establishment, who were so 
caught up in the system that they couldn't see the light. 
</P>
<P>
 That was back in 1969. Now, 25 years later, I have become part of the 
Establishment I used to discount. I no longer see things with the black and 
white vision of youth but colored with shades of often confusing grays. And I 
have learned enough to know that there are many areas of our government and 
it's programs that desperately need reform. Much about what I used to believe 
back in the '60s has changed, except for one thing: I still believe that what 
we need is more love. 
</P>
<P>
 As strange as it may sound, we have become a society that does not know how to 
love. We do not know how to love our ill or disadvantaged; we mourn the 
unfortunate deaths of strangers killed in a train wreck or natural disaster, 
yet ignore the tens of thousands who have been dying painfully and often alone 
of AIDS. We aren't even sure how to love ourselves. There are times, however, 
when, for just a moment, we open our hearts and share the best of ourselves. 
Last year's Midwest floods, the kidnaping of Polly Klass, the California fires, 
and, most recently, the earthquake -- these tragedies witnessed tremendous acts 
of human kindness, compassion and courage. Three weeks ago I stood trembling 
outside my house. Neighbors in bathrobes offered one another food, comfort and 
extra batteries; it reminded me of Woodstock. For a few days, we of so many 
races and dialects in Los Angeles were one family. And then the intensity of 
the crisis was over. And the love went away. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it take tragedy to bring us back to love? Why do we need nature's 
close calls to make us realize how much we love our mates, our children, our 
friends? Why do we forget to love until it is too late? How much pain and 
destruction will it take for us to remember? 
</P>
<P>
 Each year on Feb. 14, Americans spend tens of millions of dollars on Valentine 
cards, candy and flowers in an attempt to show the feelings and say the words 
we should be expressing every day. It's sad that more "I love you's" are shared 
on that day than during any other day of the year. Each day should be a 
celebration of the love we are blessed to have in our life. 
</P>
<P>
 Loving more is not as difficult as we think. I have a simple "formula" that's 
easy to remember. It's called the Three A's: Attention, Affection, 
Appreciation. Pay attention to the people you love; give them affection and 
express your appreciation.  
</P>
<P>
 Paying attention means spending even a few minutes a day with your partner or 
children when you aren't focused on anything else but finding out what they 
need and giving it to them. It means asking "How are you?" and really listening 
to the answer. It means asking "How can I love you more?" and acting on what 
they tell you. Giving affection means more hugs and holding, not just for 
hellos and good-byes and Saturday nights when the kids are asleep, but for no 
other reason than to show your love. And expressing appreciation means telling 
your children and your employees what they did right, not just what they did 
wrong. It means telling your partner why you love her or him. It means saying 
"I need you," and sharing why. 
</P>
<P>
 So on this Valentine's Day, my wish is that we love more. I don't believe, as 
I did in 1969, that all we need it love. Love may not be the only answer, but 
it's a big part of it.

 Although banned in California's public schools, other states do allow students 
to be physically disciplined. Voices asked some Southern California residents 
whether the practice is an answer to behavior problems or outmoded and 
improper. JOHN O'LOONEY 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher of visually impaired children in the Oxnard Elementary School District 
and a representative of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to do is teach conflict management and behavior management 
starting in kindergarten and preschool. If the emphasis is put on that, we 
don't need to be swatting people and knocking them upside the head. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have severely emotionally disturbed children, when you have children 
with attention deficit disorders, when you have children with emotional 
problems and they're being bounced around at home and then we deck them at 
school, legally and with due process, what we're saying is that we're bigger 
and stronger than you are. We have a society that says violence answers things. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Special Ed teacher, I have a chance to be in many teachers' classrooms, 
from preschool all the way through high school. What I have seen as an 
effective teacher's management is a very consistent, gentle, thorough process. 
</P>
<P>
 Have I used physical force breaking up fights in junior high? Yes, I have. And 
have I been swung upon? Yes, I have. And I have I had to subdue children? Yes, 
I have for their own protection. But me going out there swinging a 4-by-4, I 
don't think would help. Sister MARY MENEGATTI

 The time is long past for corporal punishment to be an acceptable form of 
punishment in any school forum. I think in years past, in both the public and 
private sectors, corporal punishment was acceptable, but you're talking back 40 
or 50 years ago. What has changed is a greater understanding of discipline 
methods, of what works better. At St. Catherine's, we stress self-discipline, 
taking time to calm down and to re-evaluate reactions. Self-discipline is 
needed not just in school, but in the home, with limitations coming from 
parents and from school. I don't think we can expect the school system to 
rectify all the problems of society. We need limits, certainly, from all of 
society. BARBARA TYE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The violence in the schools isn't in the schools. It's the reflection of a 
violent society. And cracking down on kids is like closing the barn door after 
the horses have all run away. It's after the fact. What this society needs to 
be doing is attending to the needs of children. With one out of every four 
living in poverty, what kind of a life is that? They come to school without the 
skills they need to be successful. Put those children in Headstart from coast 
to coast, and if they have the other services they need -- the medical care, 
the dental care and the tender loving care from parents who know what they're 
doing -- children are not going to be violent when they reach school. They're 
not going to need corporal punishment. BILL PRICER

</P>
<P>
 I would like to see it back in a limited form. There are always extremes, but 
I think with parental permission and guidelines, it is acceptable. I was 
talking with parents recently who are very wishful that the school had more 
authority in this area. As a child, I experienced it. It has a deterrent effect 
because more strongly felt than the pain is the embarrassment. You don't want 
to go through it again. We grew up with this form of punishment as a nation and 
I think there's something to it. It does have value if closely overseen, with a 
witness and parental permission. There might be an uprising among some parents, 
but, for many, it would be a welcome form of correction. IDA MAE CARTER 
</P>
<P>
 President of the Parent Teacher Assn., Compton Unified School District 
</P>
<P>
 Some students get quite a bit of corporal punishment in the home, so I think 
we need to find other techniques. We need to be able to approach students in a 
more respectful way. We should talk to the students and give them guidance. 
They need self-esteem classes and tools necessary to become responsible for 
their actions. There should be standards in the schools for students to abide 
by if they are to get an effective education. Conferences with parents and 
students should be a priority to solve problems. SARA DEVITO HARDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 State director of the Christian Coalition of California 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely has a place in schools if it's corporal punishment that isn't as 
ominous as corporal punishment sounds, but just a slap on the leg or the hand 
with a ruler. Our kids in our schools are out of hand. There's no discipline. 
It used to be that the worst thing 30 years ago that the teachers said were a 
problem were throwing spitballs, talking in class or chewing gum. Now it's 
abortion, murder, carrying guns and all that sort of thing. Obviously, any 
thinking person would have to say it's because of lack of discipline. Corporal 
punishment should help solve some of the problems, though obviously not 100%.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A place to shop and learn? That's not how we usually think of malls. But that 
might be about to change. As school overcrowding increases up and down 
California, the state hopes a new "space-saver" concept will become a model 
that will ease the problem and save money at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are built vertically, with several stories instead of taking up 
large areas with single-floor buildings. According to education officials, the 
idea behind them is to add schools without condemning private property in 
densely populated cities.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the school board in Santa Ana will vote on whether to give the 
go-ahead with construction of a new "space-saver" intermediate school to be 
located at Bristol Market Place mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has earmarked $23 million to buy the Santa Ana property and has 
promised $20 million more to build the school and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet R. Beales of the Reason Foundation says in Community Essay that Santa 
Ana is just one of several school districts in a number of states that have 
found innovative ways to relieve their infrastructure shortage (putting 
classrooms in office buildings and business parks) without capital costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The space-saver school model has strong backing from parents, teachers and 
educators in Santa Ana. But some businesses in the mall fear the students will 
be disruptive. And some residents of the area worry about the impact it will 
have on their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Hall-Kessler, president of Santa Ana Educators Assn., says, "I imagine 
that they are afraid the children will take off at lunch time and interfere 
with the shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're going to make very sure that the children are on campus and can't 
leave the campus as we do at all of our schools. We don't have children running 
around the neighborhood during school hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing Santa Ana district is badly in need of new classrooms, officials 
say. And another benefit of the space-saver school, says Hall-Kessler, is that 
it could be built in a short period of time rather than waiting "five or six 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say that building the school in this particular mall would 
deny the city a huge source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Says City Councilwoman Lisa Mills: "I support the space-saver concept. It's a 
good opportunity for the schools to receive some funds to build much-needed 
schools in Santa Ana. I don't support the particular location they've 
selected." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills says the mall is the second-largest commercial property in the city of 
Santa Ana, and "I think it's the second-highest revenue generating property for 
city government." 
</P>
<P>
 She says that since no other district has come up with a plan that would meet 
state requirements, Santa Ana still has time to come up with alternative sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to do is sit down and work with the school district to explore 
another site that would not cost as much." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the overcrowding continues.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT CHINESE IN AMERICA; 'THEY DON'T THINK THEY NEED TO CHANGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Jinn, 37, arrived in America nine years ago and for the past four years 
has been a popular anchor of the Chinese - language news show on cable station 
KCSI. He was fired late last month in a dispute over his reporting of the visit 
to Los Angeles by Taiwan 's premier , Chan Lien.  
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California we have around 500,000 to 600,000 overseas Chinese that 
are from Taiwan. People tell me that at least another 100,000 have come 
directly from the mainland. This is a big community. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is so close. From Los Angeles to Taiwan, it's 15 hours. And because the 
interaction is so frequent, the Southern Californian Chinese community cannot 
just say, "We are Chinese, we need to do some assimilation . . ." Assimilation 
is very, very hard, because so many -- 60% -- are new immigrants. They have 
money, they have businesses, they are a really big community. If you've been to 
San Gabriel you know. They don't need to speak English, really; they don't need 
to go to the American supermarket.  
</P>
<P>
 They're bringing over a lot of habits from Taiwan. They don't have to adapt. 
People can live their life well here; they can have their Chinese life. Last 
week was the Chinese New Year; you could go to Monterey Park and San Gabriel 
and celebrate the Chinese New Year in your own way. They don't want to change; 
they don't think they need to change.  
</P>
<P>
 A phenomenal thing is that even when the economic situation is so bad in the 
whole nation, the Chinese community here is not affected. Because they can 
sustain themselves so well. They buy things from the Chinese-owned market. They 
sell things to Taiwan and to mainland China. They bring in money from Taiwan.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people still have family in Taiwan, they still have businesses in 
Taiwan. They buy and sell stocks in Taiwan, get rich and come to the United 
States and buy a house here and stay here, and then fly back to Taiwan and make 
some money and come back. It's a common practice. So even when the economy is 
so bad here, the Chinese community is never affected. You see how many 
Mercedes-Benz are being driven around (by Chinese people)? 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the Chinese American community has become more complex than 
ever before. The Southern California Chinese community is a miniature model of 
Taiwan; it is an extension of Taiwan's political struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949 the Kuomintang government fled mainland China to Taiwan and many 
people from mainland China were expatriated to Taiwan. Conflict between these 
expatriates and the original Taiwanese who were born there has grown bigger and 
bigger ever since. Some people from Taiwan are pro-Taiwanese independence, for 
example, (as opposed to reunification with mainland China), and these tensions 
are carried over into Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 And so the handling of the news, especially in the Chinese community, requires 
special sensitivity in regards to the story itself -- the way you report.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm Chinese, I know how and what I should write about, what I should report 
about, the way I should handle the news. I know the nuances, the differences, 
and I know how to handle them correctly. However, the station, the American 
boss -- KSCI is owned by Citicorp -- sometimes they don't appreciate that 
sensitivity.  
</P>
<P>
 Like in my situation. I did a report that didn't please certain parties. I did 
a report about the Jan. 24 reception for Taiwanese Premier Chan Lien and I was 
a bit critical, a little sarcastic. I said the tables at the party were not 
fully filled, and I said the premier was received by former President Reagan -- 
and I also noted that, actually, Reagan is not that difficult to visit! I said 
that because the relationship between Taiwan and the United States is so subtle 
-- there is no formal diplomatic relationship -- Premier Lien's visit to L.A. 
was very difficult and so it was played it low-key.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the station got a complaint, just a partial complaint from a very 
small section of the Chinese community, I was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The station thought that complaint represented a whole segment of the Chinese 
community's opinion. That's totally wrong. In the Chinese community, you just 
cannot write anything that will be totally accepted by all sides, because of 
that complexity I just told you about. 
</P>
<P>
 The major media in the Chinese community have a tendency to be friendly to the 
Taiwanese government. They are influenced by certain (economic powers) from 
Taiwan, some political interests from Taiwan. That's why the people here always 
complain they cannot get candid reports from the Chinese media.  
</P>
<P>
 As a reporter, I've been trying very hard to do that. To balance that. That's 
why I got viewer support not only from people from Taiwan, but also people from 
mainland China. And this is very difficult. I'm very appreciative of their 
support, I'm very proud of it, because the rule here is if you work for a media 
(outlet) which is pro-Taiwan government, it is very hard to get the support or 
recognition of readers from mainland China, and vice versa. And I did that.  
</P>
<P>
 My dismissal will have a chilling effect on the future of unbiased, 
independent, candid reporting in the Chinese community. I was kind of naive, 
thinking, "I'm employed by an American TV station, so this can be an example; 
we can do independent news reporting here. However, 90% of the show's sponsors 
were Taiwanese businesses, so you still felt a lot of influence out there. 
That's why things happened the way they did. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a big community. And how to serve the community, how to inform them 
takes a lot of courage, a lot of determination. We have a long way to 
go.THEODORA LITSIOS / For The Times

 Karina, a young woman, has just arrived in the U.S. from Mexico. She is going 
to study English and visit her mom, who works in a sewing factory. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Karina's mom telephones from work, asking Karina to bring her lunch. 
The dutiful daughter hops a bus bound for the factory, located in Chinatown. As 
soon as she arrives, her mom's Chinese boss walks up and hands her a small red 
envelope. When she looks inside and discovers $20, she becomes indignant and 
thrusts it back at him. The boss stares at her in stunned disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Being a newcomer, Karina didn't know it was Chinese New Year (which began last 
week). According to Chinese custom, during this holiday older people give red 
envelopes with money inside to unmarried children for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The boss intended to wish Karina good fortune. Her refusal was an affront he 
could not comprehend: Why would anyone reject money and good luck? 
</P>
<P>
 From Karina's point of view, the boss was an older man she had never met 
before. When he handed her the money-filled envelope, she thought he was making 
an offer for sexual favors. Consequently, she was offended and angrily returned 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Karina learned of the boss' true intentions, she accepted the 
gift. Since then, she happily receives the red envelope each Chinese New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: To the Chinese, red envelopes filled with money express two positive 
things: Red signifies good luck, while money signifies prosperity.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; RAFU SHIMPO; IN AGE OF EMPTY PROMISES, NEED FOR CHANTO GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a column by Naomi Hirahara, English editor of Rafu Shimpo, a Japanese 
daily newspaper published in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When referring to the philosophies of the Issei in the U.S., Japanese 
Americans use such terms as gaman (perseverance) and enryo (reserve). 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to offer another one -- chanto . 
</P>
<P>
 Chanto is one of these Japanese colloquialisms that doesn't have an exact 
English equivalent. Literally, it means "in good order," "thoroughly" and 
"properly," but in practice, it covers much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody raised by a Japanese-influenced parent or grandparent has heard the 
phrase " chanto shinasai ," or "be chanto ." It can be said in reference to an 
upturned shirt collar, talking too loud, arriving to an appointment late, 
improperly folding origami cranes, chewing gum at a funeral or paying bills 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 I, myself, am a chanto rebel. My natural inclination is toward the intangibles 
-- feelings, principles, spirituality -- not the tangible. Rules, they're meant 
to be broken. Ask me my thoughts about any controversy and I'll comply. But ask 
me about where I left my coffee cup that morning and I'd probably be stumped. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing to do with my upbringing -- my mother is the master of chanto . 
But ever since childhood, I was always losing my sweater or laughing too loud. 
Definitely a chanto mother's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But the older I get and the more I observe the Japanese American community, I 
see the value of chanto . A yes means yes, and no means no. It's very simple, 
but so rare in this fast-paced society of empty promises: 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get together sometime."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have it ready by the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The check is in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 We've all said and heard these things, but have we always followed through?  
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, today's society is so high-pressured; we can literally drive 
ourselves crazy about being anal retentive and detail oriented. And to 
demonstrate ritual without heart is worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something to be said about being chanto in this day and age. With 
the Issei and Nisei populations fading away, this is one principle that needs 
to go on.

 As repair crews make the rounds of nearly 150 quake-damaged schools, parents 
and teachers are wondering when, and even more significantly how, schools can 
get back to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate school repairs from this latest disaster could take two 
years and cost $700 million -- about a fifth of the school district's annual 
budget. But even before the quake, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
faced an infrastructure crisis. Overcrowding is severe problem, and the 
district is in a precarious financial position. 
</P>
<P>
 While government bureaucrats divvy up rebuilding aid, many fear the schools 
will get short shrift. But a simple solution lies as close at hand as the 
nearest shopping mall or office building.  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the school board will vote Wednesday on whether to give the 
go-ahead for construction of a new "space-saver" intermediate school to be 
located at Bristol Market Place mall. Space-saver schools are intended to 
economize on scarce urban property by sharing room with existing developments. 
Often using multi-level construction, space savers are also time savers, 
getting speedier approval for state funding, say school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful way to get a school that we desperately need, and we're 
not having to condemn homes or business property to do it," says Diane Thomas, 
spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana is not the only district seeking alternatives. Joining with local 
businesses, school districts in four states have found an innovative way to 
relieve their infrastructure shortage without capital costs. These districts 
are establishing public-private partnerships that put classrooms at the 
workplace. Students, primarily at elementary levels, go to classes in office 
buildings, shopping malls and business parks. The district continues to provide 
the teachers, the administration, school supplies and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these experiments is taking place in Dade County, Fla., in areas hit 
hard by Hurricane Andrew. There, Patrick Dunn appreciated having his 5-year-old 
son Cory in a school at the airport where he worked so the two could be closer 
together after the fright of the hurricane. Recalls Dunn, "He was like Velcro 
to me. I would tell him, 'Look, I'm just on the other side of the hill.' It 
sort of eased the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County school administrators estimate that the district saved about 
$250,000 for every classroom it has not had to build -- about 15 in all. 
Partnerships between the district and several businesses mean the work-site 
schools are built at private, not public, expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Hewlett-Packard Corp. became California's first private company 
to house a public school, at its Santa Rosa plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has plenty of room for work-site schools. The National Assn. of 
Realtors reports office-vacancy rates of about 20% for metropolitan Los 
Angeles. Provided these buildings pass muster with seismic-safety inspectors, 
their halls could echo with the sounds of children instead of the sounds of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses already hosting a public school have reported a drop in absenteeism 
and turnover rates among employees with children enrolled in the on-site 
school. Other businesses claim they now have a happier, more productive, work 
force. Public schools located at or near work-sites may also get greater 
corporate support. At one school, a nearby hospital donates some basic health 
services to students. Other businesses have provided start-up grants to help 
remodel office suites into classrooms or buy portable classrooms to put on 
company grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent involvement is one reason Santa Rosa school superintendent Lew 
Alsobrook initiated a school site at Hewlett-Packard. "If you can't bring the 
parent to the school, then bring the school to the parent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the very legislation that was supposed to protect schools -- and 
the children inside them -- from seismic destruction now threatens to block 
educators at incapacitated schools from finding alternative facilities. The 
Field Act, passed in 1933 shortly after a devastating Long Beach earthquake, 
created a separate, more rigorous, building code for public school buildings. 
Over time, this act and the statewide Uniform Building Code, which governs most 
commercial and residential buildings, have grown closer together. Even so, 
commercial buildings cannot be used to house public schools. So while students 
and educators search for safe alternatives to quake-weakened schools or 
overcrowded classrooms, vacant office and commercial space goes begging. 
Legislators in Sacramento could do much to alleviate the current classroom 
crunch by granting a temporary Field Act waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 With businesses and schools working together, the task of rebuilding could be 
made a good deal easier.

PIPPEN IS PIPING HOT FOR EAST; PRO BASKETBALL: BULL FORWARD SCORES 29 POINTS IN 
127-118 VICTORY IN NBA ALL-STAR GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scottie Pippen, in the shadow of Michael Jordan's spotlight for the first six 
years of his career, knew it was time to grab it himself in the NBA All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Michael on our club really overshadowed guys like Horace Grant, B.J. 
Armstrong and myself," Pippen said Sunday after leading the East to a 127-118 
victory. "It was time for us to step up as All-Stars a little more. I had my 
mind set to play much better than I played in past All-Star games." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, making his fourth All-Star appearance but his first since his 
superstar teammate on the Chicago Bulls retired last October, scored 29 points 
on nine-for-15 shooting and grabbed 11 rebounds to win MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to assert myself a little more," Pippen said. "My skills are able to 
put me up among the elite players. I don't think I needed to go out today and 
prove anything to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, wearing fire-engine red shoes, had averaged 9.3 points in his first 
three All-Star games. Despite his 29 points, he only scored two in the fourth 
quarter, but they were big -- a baseline jumper with 2:10 left after the West 
pulled within two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the shoes," Pippen joked about his performance. "Everybody was looking 
at my feet too much. I was shooting well and I just continued to let my shot 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 The East took its largest lead, 103-90, in the first minutes of the fourth 
quarter, but the West rallied with a 17-5 run, closing to 108-107 with 7:17 
left. Gary Payton's six points and David Robinson's five keyed the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 But the East regained control as New York teammates Patrick Ewing and John 
Starks combined to score the next nine East points for a 117-110 lead. The run 
of points by regular-season teammates continued a pattern that the East 
followed the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 A basket by Clifford Robinson and a three-pointer by John Stockton made it 
117-115 before Pippen, after missing two free throws, connected on his baseline 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of him like Lawrence Taylor, the way he came into the NFL," Stockton 
said of Pippen. "He's a new wave. The things he can do, he just changes the 
game by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon shared scoring honors with 19 points each 
for the West, which trails the All-Star series 28-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing scored 12 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and Mark Price also had 
20 for the East, which had 10 three-pointers to one for the West. Pippen was 
five for nine from that range. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a zone," West coach George Karl said. "It's difficult when you're 
substituting a great deal to keep the same guy on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer this season, had a miserable day 
for the East, missing 10 of 12 shots and seven of 11 free throws to finish with 
eight points. But he managed 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were quadruple-teaming me, triple-teaming me," O'Neal said. "I thought 
somebody was going to play me straight up, but it didn't happen. It means 
somebody respects me if they had to put four guys on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The West, down by 12 in the first half and by eight at halftime, rallied in 
the third quarter, closing within four twice before Price hit a jumper and a 
three-pointer in a span of 37 seconds, helping the East rebuild the margin to 
101-90 going into the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, East coach Lenny Wilkens made good use of players who are 
used to being on the court together. 
</P>
<P>
 The West led 25-23 late in the first period before Price, three Knicks and two 
Atlanta Hawks scored all but two of the East's points in a 36-22 burst that 
made it 59-47 with 4:59 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins scored 10 points, Price nine, Mookie Blaylock five and Ewing, Starks 
and Charles Oakley combined for 10 more in the run that gave the East its 
largest lead of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, Grant and Armstrong then combined for the East's next 10 points for a 
72-64 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen and Armstrong scored the East's first 15 points, with Armstrong hitting 
a jumper and Pippen following with 10 points in less than two minutes, 
including two three-pointers.

PUNCHLESS NORTHRIDGE SALVAGES SPLIT; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: CSUN WINS SECOND GAME, 
4-0, IN 13 AFTER 1-0 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Because of the deadliness of the recent earthquake, Cal State Northridge Coach 
Gary Torgeson has a new perspective on winning: If the Matadors win, great. If 
they lose, no big deal. The Matadors are just thankful to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the way Northridge played its opener against Cal State Fullerton on 
Sunday -- and its ho-hum reactions to a doubleheader split -- the Matadors must 
feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not gonna be upset if we go 25-25 and make it to the (Women's College) 
World Series," Torgeson said. "They just lived through the biggest crunchers of 
their lives. If we had lost both of them, I would have gone on to the next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, rated between third and sixth in preseason polls, could easily 
have lost both games to the 16th-ranked Titans, but pulled out a 4-0 victory in 
the 13th inning of Game 2 on the strength of Amy Windmiller's sensational 
pitching and Fullerton's defensive breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the opener, 1-0, Northridge continued its scoring drought for 
another 12 innings. After 19 2/3 innings and 5 1/2 hours of softball, the 
Matadors, who ripped an NCAA-record 40 home runs last season, finally scored. 
With two out, Fullerton committed four fielding errors in the 13th. Each time a 
Titan commited an error, a Northridge runner scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, a former resident of the Northridge Meadows Apartments where 16 
people died, had a career-high 17 strikeouts and gave up four singles in a 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we would score," Windmiller said. "I didn't know when, but I knew we 
would. Our defense was so good tonight. I knew they wouldn't let a run score." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors commited three errors on the day. One contributed to their loss 
and the other two helped Fullerton load the bases in the final inning of the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost the opener on a throwing error in the fifth inning by third 
baseman Shannon Jones. Pinch-hitter Tracie Noggle slapped a single off 
right-hander Kathy Blake to lead off the inning. Noggle stole second and went 
to third on a sacrifice. Jstone Vines slapped a chopper down the line at Jones, 
who made a backhand stab. After Jones looked Noggle back to third, she turned 
and misfired to first and Noggle scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked the runner back too long," said Jones, who was Windmiller's roommate 
at Northridge Meadows. "I didn't set myself before I threw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Save her throwing error, Jones played exceptionally. The senior accounted for 
five of the Matadors' 16 hits on the day.

CSUN MOWS DOWN UCLA IN 11; COLLEGE BASEBALL: HOWARD AND THORNHILL ARE 
NORTHRIDGE'S BIG PRODUCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Fresno is located in the land of green acres, in one of the nation's richest 
agricultural counties. Some nights, when it's quiet outside, you can 
practically hear the corn grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at UCLA, two products from Fresno City College took root for Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kevin Howard and Chad Thornhill were a bountiful cash crop. Produce? 
You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball looked like a watermelon," said Thornhill, a junior shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally earned my paycheck," said Howard, a junior outfielder who planted a 
ball over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The California heartlanders were the heart of the offense as Northridge 
knocked off UCLA, 10-7, in an 11-inning thriller at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill entered the weekend batting all of .077, which in Fresno or anywhere 
else is the equivalent of a locust invasion. In the past two games, however, he 
banged out six hits. After being moved from ninth to sixth in the lineup 
Sunday, Thornhill had four hits to raise his average to .350, best on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen him like this," said Howard, who ought to know because the 
two played together at Fresno's Bullard High before joining the junior college 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (3-3) has been waiting for Howard to play like this since the 
opening bell. Howard has hit safely in all six games, but he is expected to 
supply the long ball. Sunday, Howard did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 7-7, in the top of the 11th, Howard hit a monstrous 
three-run homer to dead center, a 400-foot shot. On at least four other 
occasions this season, Howard launched wind-chilled blasts that went in the 
scorebook as just another warning-track putout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting to see that from him," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
"Finally, the wind wasn't blowing 100 miles an hour in his face." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (1-4) had scored three runs in the seventh to take a 6-4 lead, but 
Northridge rolled a three of its own in its next at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman designated hitter Eric Gillespie led off with a double -- his second 
of three hits -- and scored on a single by Keyaan Cook, ending an 0-for-16 
skid. Howard and Thornhill also contributed singles to help hand Northridge a 
7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't last long. Keven Kempton walked Gar Vallone to open the bottom of 
the inning and he later scored on a bunt single by Brett Schafer to tie it, 
7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton allowed five earned runs and nine hits over nine innings, but most of 
the UCLA offense was generated by its wheels. The Bruins stole a single-game 
school-record nine bases in as many attempts, four by David Roberts and two 
each by Vallone and Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge narrowly missed a chance to take the lead with Cook and Howard at 
first and second in the ninth, but a sinking liner by Brian Vasey was snared in 
right by former Notre Dame High standout Chris Lohman to end the threat.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the 11th, Gillespie and Cook singled and Howard homered off Dan Kramer 
(0-1) for a 10-7 lead. Evan Howland (1-0) pitched two innings of one-hit relief 
for the win. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dogfight," Kernen said. "We hustled as a team better -- heck, 10 
times better -- than we have in any game all year."

 Winter Games Soar: CBS' coverage of Saturday's Winter Olympics opening 
ceremonies drew a record 20.8 rating, according to figures released Sunday by 
the A. C. Nielsen Co. With each national rating point representing 942,000 
homes, it means about 19.6 million households were tuned in. By comparison, 
ratings for CBS' coverage of the opening ceremonies for the 1992 Winter 
Olympics received a 14.5 rating. Ratings in Los Angeles Saturday lagged behind 
the national average with a 16.7, but were 55% higher than 1992's 10.8.

 GLAAD Ad: The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has placed a 
full-page ad in today's Daily Variety expressing its shock at ABC's refusal to 
broadcast an episode of "Roseanne" that includes a kiss between Roseanne Arnold 
and a character played by Mariel Hemingway. "ABC . . . don't break America's 
heart," is the headline of the ad, which goes on to call the kiss in a gay and 
lesbian bar "affectionate, funny and part of the story." The ad, in the form of 
a letter to ABC executives Robert Iger and Ted Harbert, praises the network for 
airing programs that show diversity in America, including "Roseanne" for its 
responsible portrayal of lesbians and gay men. "What has changed?" the ad asks. 
It encourages ABC to show the episode and let the American people judge for 
themselves. The network has said the episode, which was set for March 1, 
violates its broadcast standards.

 Long Live 'The King': Responding to upset viewers who missed the final

"Masterpiece Theatre" normally airs in one-hour chapters on Sundays, but in the 
case of "To Play the King," KCET showed parts three and four back-to-back on 
Jan. 30. Not everyone got the word, however, and when they tuned in Feb. 6 for

 Help!: A London newspaper report that the three surviving Beatles are planning 
a concert in New York's Central Park is an "out and out lie," an aide to Paul 
McCartney said Sunday. Jeff Baker, McCartney's personal assistant, told ABC 
Radio News that "there's not a shred of truth" to the report in the Mail that 
caused an international flurry. The newspaper said McCartney, George Harrison 
and Ringo Starr would perform in Central Park later this year, and would be 
joined onstage by the late John Lennon's sons, Julian and Sean. The newspaper 
did not identify its source. It said each of the former Beatles would be paid 
$30 million for the concert, which would be televised worldwide. The report 
also said McCartney chose New York as a tribute to Lennon, who was gunned down 
there in 1980. MOVIES

 'Outbreak' Director Breaks Out: Wolfgang Petersen ("In the Line of Fire") has 
been hired to direct "Outbreak," a Warner Bros. film about a deadly virus that 
is out of control. The movie is scheduled to begin filming in June and is one 
of two virus movies being developed for major studios. Last year, 20th Century 
Fox won the bidding war on behalf of producer Lynda Obst to make "Hot Zone," a 
film about a virus outbreak in a monkey research lab that was based on an true 
story that appeared in the New Yorker. The original screenplay for "Outbreak" 
was scripted by Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool with final screenplay 
credit given to Ted Tally ("Silence of the Lambs"). It is being produced by 
Arnold Kopelson and Gail Katz (Petersen's partner).

 Nice for Rice: Anne Rice can keep the film rights to her novel "The Mummy," a 
federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled. The dispute between the author 
and film producers Frank Konigsberg and Larry Sanitsky focused on an agreement

1980s for the film rights. But she said they failed to arrange a film within 
two years and lost their chance. The producers sued, saying they should have 
been allowed to extend the length of the agreement. Rice denied there ever was

POP REVIEWS; AN INTERACTIVE RUNDGREN RAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is MC Todd Rundgren the new master blaster? The veteran pop figure landed 
Saturday at the Fairfax High School gym on a one-man stage that was equal parts 
deejay booth, fun house and holy shrine to this maker of cult hits and uneven 
pop experiments, now deep in a funk of wild computer-ese. 
</P>
<P>
 Tossing confetti, condoms and inflatable toys to the crowd, Rundgren led his 
own personal rave, as promised: truly interactive , with some of the faithful 
even invited on stage to dance and play drums.He otherwise performed solo his 
new, quirky mix of techno and amazingly convincing hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the night's material was culled from Rundgren's "No World Order" 
album, which trades heavily in computer-generated sound (and has also been 
released on an interactive CD). The embracing pop melodies of his early work 
emerged among the samples and bits, although they were too often buried under 
an oppressive disco beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer crashes occasionally turned the show into "Todd Unplugged," forcing 
the party master to strum some warm folk-rock on a 12-string guitar. After the 
encore of "Bang the Drum," his rousing ode to primal leisure, Rundgren's 
computer failed him once again.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was the last crash," he promised, noting that this was the tour's final 
stop. He then kicked the thing over, picked it up and smashed it, Pete 
Townshend-style. A final victory of man over machine. STEVE APPLEFORD

JAZZ REVIEWS; VARIETY OF KINKS LIMIT ADDERLEY TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds like a great idea -- a salute to Cannonball Adderley to open the 
"sneak preview" season at the new Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long 
Beach. Unfortunately, Saturday's execution of the idea fell well short of its 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, the most successful part of the evening was provided by 
Nat Adderley's whimsical reminiscences about his late saxophonist brother, and 
the superlative playing of his own quintet. Restricted to a relatively brief 
set by a series of technical glitches, the Adderley Quintet made the most of a 
few jazz lines and the standard "Autumn Leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the bill, which featured the International Assn. of Jazz 
Appreciation's All-Star Big Band and the Stephen Wayne Quartet, left far more 
to be desired. A promised compositional tribute to Cannonball Adderley by Cecil 
Bridgewater was so poorly performed that its carefully crafted dissonances and 
moving inner voices were almost impossible to discern. 
</P>
<P>
 Random alto saxophone solos were apparently intended to reflect the Cannonball 
salute, although Jeff Clayton very nearly stole the show with a blistering, 
blues-drenched paraphrase of a famous chorus -- not by Cannonball, but by 
Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannonball salute was part of a trial run of programs leading to the 
Carpenter Center's grand opening in October. A wise strategy, since both audio 
and visual presentation will have to improve dramatically if this otherwise 
attractive arena is going to become a major performing arts venue. DON HECKMAN

POP REVIEWS; FLORES BRIDGES GAP BETWEEN LEE, RAITT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosie Flores is the missing link between Brenda Lee and Bonnie Raitt, which 
may help explain why, as such a definably "country" artist, she was in both her 
element and the club's Saturday night at the blues joint Jacks Sugar Shack. 
</P>
<P>
 One song she'd be sighing appreciatively, in high Bob Wills style, at the 
sound of one of Greg Leisz's lap-steel solos on a Tex-Mex waltz; the next, 
she'd be picking off her own economical but considerable blues guitar solos on 
a straight-out rocker, the full house supplying the appreciative hollers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's show was a belated "record release party" for Flores' third album, 
"Once More With Feeling," which has actually been out for a few moons but is 
only gradually picking up notice. The Hightone release is the most 
representative yet of her in-the-pocket song craft and plucky sweetness, a 
charmer that's probably the most purely fun album Nashville should have been 
responsible for and wasn't in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores and her five-piece band hit upon most of the album in a set chosen 
largely by audience members, who picked song titles out of a jar. Her voice is 
so inherently winsome that even the occasional weepers come up Rosie; taking a 
break from originals to cover Gram Parsons' "Sin City," with its potentially 
Angst -inducing earthquake lines, she made the impending L.A. apocalypse sound 
like such a lovely way to burn. CHRIS WILLMAN

MUSIC REVIEW; THE RETURN OF MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH, CELLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How quickly we forget. In becoming, in the last two decades, a serious 
international conductor, the celebrated Russian musician, Mstislav 
Rostropovich, has been touring less with his original instrument, the cello. 
Music lovers everywhere may still think of him as a cellist, yet he has been 
increasingly less visible and audible in that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, many of the curious, as well as a whole generation of young people who 
have not had the opportunity to hear the beloved Slava -- even strangers call 
him that, as strangers used to call Gregor Piatigorsky Grisha -- were 
represented at the cellist's return to Southern California (after three years) 
Saturday night at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Few could have gone away disappointed. Rostropovich may not now maintain his 
characteristic -- sometimes criticized -- fever pitch of intensity through 
every second of a performance, but that light shines brightly nonetheless. And 
technically, notwithstanding occasional moments of inconsistent vibrato or 
vagaries of pitch, his mastery remains complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Again assisted by pianist Lambert Orkis, the cellist offered a provocative 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 A piece put together just for this tour, Alfred Schnittke's arrangement -- for 
cello, piano and tape -- of the Epilogue to his own ballet, "Peer Gynt" (1986), 
provided the climactic half hour of this recital. It was a stunner. Schnittke's 
unique eclecticism -- alternating a harrowing atonality with a pungent and 
haunting tonal idiom -- makes this piece both grating and engrossing. 
Rostropovich/Orkis performed it with kaleidoscopic eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 They did as much with the wondrous Debussy Sonata (1915), finding all the 
insouciance and contrasts sometimes left buried in this enigmatic score. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, the team tried to make a case for Richard Strauss' early 
(and empty) Sonata (1882), a losing battle despite all their goodwill and 
affection. Then, alone, Rostropovich accepted the myriad challenges in Bach's 
C-minor Suite for unaccompanied cello. This was not a labored reading, yet it 
moved slowly, and often without the soloist's remembered elan.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: VALENTINE'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 BY ANY OTHER NAME: Unless you are buying one of those convenience store buds, 
expect to find company at your favorite flower stand today. . . . Valentine's 
Day is the busiest single-day holiday of the year for florists, with 81% of the 
buyers men. Some say the floral color one chooses reveals different meanings 
(E1), but industry groups say red roses are the favorites. "I'd say they are 
80% of what we sell for Valentine's Day," said John Abajian, owner of Conroy's 
South Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 LOVE TOKENS: While 47% of Americans say it with flowers today, 36% will pick 
jewelry, the American Florist Society reports. . . . A spokeswoman for Zales, 
the country's largest retail jewelry store chain, says heart-shaped solitaire 
diamonds are the hottest sellers nationally, though Orange County buyers have a 
"contemporary taste for more gold, a bolder look, and deep-set diamonds." Said 
a MainPlace / Santa Ana jewelry store manager: "Valentine's Day is more 
appropriate to buy a smaller token of affection. . .although we do sell a lot 
of engagement rings." 
</P>
<P>
 HEARTFELT: Some want nothing more from a Valentine than a good back rub, but 
at least you can get yours examined free today. . . . For the fourth year, 
Mission Viejo chiropractor Catherine Maloof, above, is offering the exams for 
those who donate five cans of food for Laguna Beach fire victims. "It is not so 
much good business," her sister Maureen says, "as much as a goodwill thing." 
</P>
<P>
 MOOD MUSIC: Valentine's Day without love songs is like Christmas sans carols, 
so what do some Orange County radio stations guess today's most popular tunes 
might be. . . ? At country KIKF in Orange, deejay Carrie Dunne predicted that 
"I Swear," now at the top of the charts, will remain in demand during the 
request hour, while Anne Murray's "Could I Have This Dance" is a perennial 
favorite. At Santa Ana's KYMS, program director Greg Parkhurst believes he's 
created the first nightly Christian "Heart Songs" program in the nation, 
adding: " 'I Will Be Here' by Steven Curtis Chapman is probably the most 
requested right now."

 WEDDING BELLS: In the tradition of flowers and romance, Valentine's Day marks 
the beginning of the spring marriage season. "It's funny; the office gets 
really busy all of a sudden," said Yvonne Knepper, owner of the Victorian Rose 
Historical Wedding Chapel in Ventura. . . . Marriage licenses have declined in 
recent years as Baby Boomers grow older and more settled. But that's changed 
since July when Los Angeles lovebirds started flocking here for licenses rather 
than endure the three-day wait imposed by budget-strapped clerks in L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 OPEN WIDE: The local Dental Society has its own Valentine's Day treat planned 
for low-income kids. . . . More than 160 society members have joined the 
"Dentist With a Heart" program to treat children at no charge. Some dentists 
acknowledge that a box of Valentine's candy might appeal to more kids than 
sitting still in their chair. . . . "If they think their parents are scared of 
dentists, they will be scared," said Vanna Master, a Thousand Oaks dentist. "It 
is very important that we take our time with them." 
</P>
<P>
 RAPID DEFLATION: Thousand Oaks city staff members last week proposed charging 
the city's Redevelopment Agency $1.1 million for office space in the Civic Arts 
Plaza for two housing administrators. The idea was rejected because it diverted 
money from creating affordable housing. . . . Meanwhile, the city has agreed to 
lease Civic Arts Plaza space to the two-person office of the Alliance for the 
Arts. Rent: $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 DISASTROUS PLANS: The Northridge quake left Moorpark City Hall without power. 
All of the city's cellular phones were dead. And some city staff had no idea 
where to go or what to do. . . . Though Moorpark suffered little damage 
compared to neighboring Simi Valley, city leaders want to re-examine all of the 
city's emergency response plans and take stock of its equipment (B5). Nuptial

 HIKES IN THE PARKS: Millions of vacationing Americans could be hit with a 
little-publicized item in President Clinton's budget: a hefty hike in entry 
fees at national parks. With many parks suffering from rutted trails, dirty 
restrooms and a scarcity of rangers, the Interior Department is seeking to 
raise fees by $32 million. . . . Specifics won't be released until spring, but 
last year, for example, the Administration suggested increasing the fee for 
vehicles at Yosemite to $11 from $5 -- a 120% jump. Congress rejected the 
proposal, but the Administration has added a sweetener this time: Individual 
parks would get to keep some of the receipts for their own needs. . . . 
Overworked rangers at some parks don't even bother to collect fees now because 
of the lack of incentive. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt says one harried 
ranger suggested that Babbitt collect fees when the secretary showed up, 
unrecognized, at a park near Washington and asked why money wasn't being taken 
in. . . . The National Parks and Conservation Assn. backs higher fees -- but 
only if they're levied against "bus and air tour operators, not Joe Six-Pack." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SACRED HORSES: Clinton's plan to shut down or slash numerous federal programs 
is already running into strong congressional resistance. A couple of 
long-running warhorses seem particularly unready to be sent out to pasture. . . 
. One is federal aid to schools impacted by nearby military posts. When Budget 
Director Leon E. Panetta came before the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Trent 
Lott (R-Miss.) recalled that Panetta was once part of a House coalition that 
led the annual battle against eliminating "impact aid." Grinning, Panetta 
acknowledged his past opposition but later winked to reporters, saying: "After 
all, Ft. Ord was in my district." The program appears safe for now. . . . 
Likewise home heating subsidies to the poor. Lamenting that his hometown of 
Bismarck had suffered a week of windchill temperatures as low as 76 degrees 
below zero, Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) told Panetta that he couldn't understand 
why the Administration wanted to cut the heating aid program in half. Panetta 
assured Conrad that his state certainly was in the area targeted for continued 
payments. But anything more than minor cutbacks "doesn't stand a snowball's 
chance in Hades," a Senate aide said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 BREAKING RANKS: Not all good men in the Marines are backing Iran-Contrameister 
Oliver L. North in his bid for the GOP Senate nomination in Virginia. One group 
of anti-Ollie Leathernecks in the Washington suburbs is mulling whether to call 
itself MAN (for Marines Against North) or MOON (Marines Opposed to Oliver 
North). They're upset that the ex-lieutenant colonel engineered an 
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran and ran illegal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras 
while he was a White House aide -- and lied to Congress about it. . . . Sen. 
John W. Warner (R-Va.) has broken ranks with many Virginia Republicans, 
asserting that North would stain the Senate with his record of criminal 
convictions. Angry GOP leaders call Warner a "traitor" for suggesting that the 
reversal of North's convictions on appeal was a technicality. . . . Many 
Democrats, hoping to see Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), another ex-Marine, 
reelected this November despite his own spate of problems, hail Warner's 
"courage" and "integrity."

 ENVOY IN WAITING: After months of delay that began with investigations 
surrounding the House Bank scandal, the White House is now ready to proceed 
with the nomination of former Rep. Stephen J. Solarz of New York as ambassador 
to India. The long delay in filling the post had caused considerable 
unhappiness in New Delhi and on the part of Solarz, an early Clinton backer.

 Louis Bonesio Jr., 60, the world's first recipient of two vital organs from 
different donors. Bonesio received a heart from one donor in 1974 and a kidney 
from another in 1985.The heart transplant surgery was performed at Stanford 
University Medical Center and the kidney transplant at UC San Francisco. Other 
multiple organ transplants have involved single donors. Bonesio was praised by 
medical personnel for his positive attitude and sense of humor, joking with 
doctors after the first transplant that he had "a 16-year-old heart and 40 
years of experience." He asked doctors to give him a new kidney, saying 
dialysis kept him from enjoying his life and community volunteer work. On Feb. 
6 in Gilroy, Calif., of heart failure.

STREET SMART: 2 NEW EXPRESS BUS ROUTES OFFER A WAY AROUND THE 'Y' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting today, Valentine's Day, the Orange County Transportation Authority 
will provide South County residents with a sweetheart of a commute as an 
alternative to the El Toro "Y." 
</P>
<P>
 Two new express bus routes will begin serving South County today. One of the 
lines, Route 306, runs between San Juan Capistrano and major employment centers 
in Irvine, including offices near John Wayne Airport. The other line, Route 
316, runs between San Juan Capistrano and the South Coast Metro area. 
</P>
<P>
 Each route is served by four northbound buses during morning hours and four 
southbound buses in the evening. In addition to serving San Juan Capistrano, 
both lines also stop in Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo before heading north. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses will make only a limited number of stops on both routes, which are 
designed to serve South County residents traveling to Irvine or Costa Mesa who 
now must drive through the El Toro "Y" interchange. Avoiding the "Y" has become 
increasingly important now that construction has begun on the interchange to 
increase its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 South County commuters needing more information on express routes 306 and 316 
may call OCTA at (800) 636-RIDE. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a fair-weather bicycle commuter and ride seven miles between my home in 
Costa Mesa and my workplace in Fountain Valley. I used the west side of the 
Santa Ana River Trail until construction began. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the levee has been rebuilt, I want to use it again. My problem: My 
exit from the trail was an access ramp at the east end of Garfield Avenue. At 
this time a ramp still exists there but appears to have been constructed for 
the dirt haulers. After the haulers are finished, will the ramp remain 
permanently? 
</P>
<P>
 The Garfield Avenue ramp is the only exit from the trail between Adams and 
Talbert avenues. A great many people used this access daily, before 
construction, and I hope we can continue to use it. Can you give me an update? 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Christensen Costa Mesa Terrie Medeiros, project manager for the lower 
Santa Ana River, said that bicycles are not even allowed on the west side of 
the Santa Ana River Trail, which is designated as an equestrian path, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail on the east side of the Santa Ana River is reserved for bicycle use, 
and the exits that would probably be most convenient for you are at Adams 
Avenue and Hamilton Avenue/Victoria Street, Medeiros said. The bicycle trail is 
paved with asphalt and cement, while the equestrian trail is paved with 
decomposed granite, which is softer on hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if those drivers who drive with their parking lights on know that it 
is always illegal. The law says you must turn your headlights on 30 minutes 
after sunset and use them until 30 minutes before sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 You must also turn your lights on any time you can't see at least 1,000 feet 
ahead. Use your headlights when it is cloudy, raining, snowing or foggy and on 
frosty mornings when other drivers' windows may be icy or foggy. Any time you 
have trouble seeing other cars, other drivers will be having trouble seeing you 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 These sentences are from the DMV 1993/94 California Driver Handbook, Pages 38 
and 39. My experience with seeing other cars after sunset is that just after 
the sun is completely over the horizon, the light changes such that many colors 
are harder to see, and this is especially true of car colors. Turning lights on 
sooner than 30 minutes after sunset would certainly help all of us see better. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Mallinckrodt Tustin True. With the days still short and the rainy season 
in full swing, it is especially nice now to be reminded when to flip on those 
beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart appears Mondays in The Times Orange County Edition. Readers are 
invited to submit comments and questions about traffic, commuting and what 
makes it difficult to get around in Orange County. Include simple sketches if 
helpful. Letters may be published in upcoming columns. Please write to Caroline 
Lemke, c/o Street Smart, The Times Orange County Edition, P.O. Box 2008, Costa 
Mesa, Calif. 92626. Include your full name, address and day and evening phone 
numbers. Letters may be edited, and no anonymous letters will be accepted.

 Former Apple Computer Chief Executive John Sculley's claim last week that he 
was sandbagged when he joined troubled Spectrum Information Technologies raises 
questions as to whether Sculley was enough of a skeptic when he joined the 
fledgling communications company last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley last week resigned from Spectrum, contending that he wasn't fully 
aware of the company's questionable financial and regulatory condition. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have done Sculley good to have consulted his own 1987 book, 
"Odyssey," in which he devotes an entire chapter to what he calls "The Rise of 
the Skeptical Man." 
</P>
<P>
 In it, Sculley maintains that "it's the ability to ask questions that deepens 
our knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley adds: "With questions and information at his command, Skeptical Man is 
free to decide his own direction." Wood

 The 25th anniversary of the 1969 Woodstock music festival is fast approaching, 
and the capitalists are out in force. 
</P>
<P>
 A New Jersey company is selling for $249 a framed display of a Woodstock 
original ticket, a Woodstock "peace sticker," a photo from the event and a 
Woodstock logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is a Kansas company that is selling individual framed tickets for 
$59. 
</P>
<P>
 It also offers $189 tickets for Friday through Sunday of the festival. The 
company says in its ads that it will throw in a letter of authenticity from 
"the former sales manager from the printing company" that printed the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, an article in the current Autograph Collector magazine notes that among 
Woodstock musicians and singers, the late Janis Joplin's memorabilia has 
emerged as the rarest, commanding top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The article says Joplin's signature is worth $900 to $1,000, while signed 
photos or albums are worth $1,500 and up. A routine Joplin document would fetch 
a minimum of $2,500, the magazine says. Unconventional Conventions 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earthquake fears, Southern California can still snare its share of 
conventions, or at least the New Age ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for three days in April in Anaheim is the 11th annual First 
Metaphysical Congress. It promises 70 speakers, workshops and lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is April's Whole Life Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center, 
billed as "The World's Largest Exposition of Holistic Health, Metaphysical and 
Personal Growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule includes 1960s drug guru Timothy Leary lecturing on "Creating the 
21st Century," a talk on "Past Life Regression" and another on "Creating With 
the Angels." Briefly . . .

 The latest pitchman for the Florida Citrus Commission is leaving a sour taste

 Rush Limbaugh starts his $1-million job today with the commission -- the same

 The right-wing radio and television talk show host, known for bashing

ELECTRIC POWER AUCTION 'LAST STAND FOR RENEWABLES'; ENERGY: THE COMPETITION FOR 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUTURE STATE UTILITIES CONTRACTS COMES AS ECONOMICS ARE 
HEAVILY STACKED AGAINST ALTERNATIVE PRODUCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial auction of future electric power, which could be resolved as 
early as Wednesday, could represent the last big chance for California's unique 
mix of wind turbines, geothermal plants and other energy alternatives to carve 
out more turf. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are billions of dollars in contracts to produce electricity for the 
state's public utilities -- the biggest opportunity in years for those who make 
power from the sun, wind and subterranean steam. 
</P>
<P>
 But the auction comes as economics are stacked against alternative energy 
producers more than at any time in recent memory. And many in the utility 
business and on Wall Street believe that the twilight has arrived for 
industries based on such environmentally praised sources of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last stand for renewables to carve out a market niche for themselves 
before the new order (of utility deregulation) comes in," said Arthur 
O'Donnell, editor of the industry newsletter California Energy Markets. "This 
is where the lines will be drawn for the future of energy in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Under policies that are a legacy of the 1970s energy crises, the state Public 
Utilities Commission has required Southern California Edison Co., San Diego Gas 
& Electric Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to entertain bids from companies 
vying to sell them the power to light more than a million California homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the auction has broken down over the utilities' contention that the PUC's 
process is flawed in favor of the renewable energies. Edison, going further, 
says it doesn't need more energy until well into the next century. For their 
part, the renewable energy producers say that the utilities -- particularly 
Edison and SDG&E -- simply want to build any new power plants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bids came in last December -- framed under PUC formulas that one critic 
termed "death by detail" -- the utilities cried foul. Some bidders, said 
utility executives, had scored well by using numbers that defied the laws of 
thermodynamics as well as the spirit, if not the letter, of the auction rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison accused some "clever" power producers of creatively -- though not 
necessarily fraudulently -- estimating production efficiency and other elements 
of their complex bids and asked the PUC to throw out Edison's portion of the 
auction. The other utilities called for throwing out the most problematic 
bidders, but keeping the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative energy producers generally defend their bids -- which cite 
energy-production costs substantially cheaper than the utilities' own benchmark 
prices. And they stand ready to modify the more creative payment clauses that 
the utilities object to. Indeed, they say that "utility dinosaurs" -- 
particularly Edison, which they call a "purveyor of doom" -- are seizing on the 
issue to resist increased use of the independent producers' renewable energy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday in San Francisco, the PUC commissioners are scheduled to begin 
hearing testimony to sort the matter out. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commissioners end up telling the utilities to accept somewhat modified 
bids, PG&E and the renewable energy producers will be more or less content. But 
Edison, the biggest player in the auction, and SDG&E say that their ratepayers 
would still see an unnecessary jump in their power bills if they are forced to 
buy additional alternative energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison -- which has contended all along that it doesn't need the extra power 
-- estimates that the auction would add 1% to 2% to its customers' average 
monthly bill, or $530 million in unnecessary costs from 1997 through 2004. 
SDG&E estimates that the "manipulated" bids would cost its ratepayers an extra 
$26 million a year over the next 25 to 30 years of the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commissioners surprise most parties and throw out Edison's part of the 
auction, it would be a major blow to renewable energy producers who have spent 
decades in research and development and are poised to become broadly 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not be the death knell of renewables," said Gerald Alderson, 
president of Kenetech Corp., the largest of the wind-energy generators. "On the 
other hand, we've spent a lot of time developing what would be $500 million 
worth of projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents contend that some of these technologies -- particularly wind and 
geothermal -- have finally become competitive with the utilities' fossil-fuel 
plants, citing the auction prices as proof. And though Edison may not need the 
new power production to keep its ratepayers' lights on, Alderson and others 
contend that it owes it to them to switch to lower-cost producers if they are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some old, inefficient power plants ought to be turned off," Alderson said. 
"But a utility is going to stand up and say 'no,' because they are still paying 
off the investment." 
</P>
<P>
 The renewables companies also tout the long-term benefits of their energy 
sources, ranging from low environmental impact to more stable energy pricing -- 
because they can be used as a hedge against future price hikes for natural gas, 
the utilities' principal fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 California, which was once 70% dependent on oil for its electricity, turned to 
renewable energy for that reason. After the 1978 revolution in Iran drove up 
world oil prices, California experienced the steepest electricity price hikes 
in the nation. The state legislature and regulators responded with a policy -- 
still unique in the nation -- to promote non-fossil fuels for electricity 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California has the most diverse palette of energy sources of any region 
in the world. Fully 10% of the mix comes from geothermal, biomass, solar and 
wind. And this is largely due to two big auctions -- the current one being the 
second -- in which part of the state's future power needs have been set aside 
for renewable and independent power producers. Historically, this has in effect 
subsidized the renewables producers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most utilities and industry analysts see a less rosy future today. Even if 
some renewables can now compete on their own with some fossil power plants, the 
utilities argue, renewables will still be too expensive to vie with the 
even-lower energy prices to come under electric-utility deregulation, which has 
been taking hold since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Social generation' is a thing of the past," said Edward J. Tirello Jr., a 
senior vice president and utilities analyst with NatWest Securities in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these higher-cost renewables and independent producers are out the 
window," Tirello said. "They can't compete in a real, competitive world . . . 
particularly against the new generation of gas-fired turbines." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, pressure on utilities to lower power bills, particularly to big 
industrial customers, is intense in California's business climate. While benign 
weather and widespread energy efficiency programs keep monthly power usage and 
costs for residential and industrial customers among the lowest in the nation, 
California's electricity rates remain higher than those in many other states, 
and large industrial users are threatening to push for even more deregulation 
-- in retail power, something the utilities vehemently oppose -- if they don't 
get cheaper electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 All this leaves California's utilities with little patience for the PUC's 
support of renewable resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to compete on a level playing field . . . and if we can do that, that 
eliminates an awful lot of the inherent disputes that are built into the 
current process," said Don Fellows, Edison manager of renewable resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, Fellows points out, already buys almost a quarter of its energy from 
renewable resources -- about twice the national average among utilities. Edison 
also has more different energies in its generating mix than any other utility 
in the world. Utilities, he argues, should now be free to simply buy the 
cheapest electricity from any available source, and to determine on their own 
when they need it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Sacramento-based Independent 
Energy Producers Assn., sees this as short-sighted dependence on currently low 
gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality," Smutny-Jones said, "is that none of the gas or oil crises that 
you can think of historically were predictable events. They just happened."

QVC LETS BID STAND AS DEADLINE NEARS; MERGERS: THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
APPEARS TO HELP VIACOM IN THE FIVE-MONTH PARAMOUNT TAKEOVER BATTLE, WHICH COULD 
END TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 QVC Network Inc. on Sunday declared that it does not plan to revise its 
$10-billion cash-and-stock offer for Paramount Communications, a move that 
appears to strengthen rival Viacom Inc.'s chances to win the prize this week in 
the five-month-long bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's 11th-hour announcement suggests that QVC Chairman Barry Diller has no 
last-minute trick up his sleeve -- as some investors had speculated -- to 
unveil before today's 9 p.m. Pacific time deadline for Paramount's shareholders 
to pledge their stock to either suitor.  
</P>
<P>
 A source in the QVC camp, however, strongly disputed any suggestion that 
Sunday's statement amounted to a concession by Diller that QVC has lost. Some 
analysts believe the contest could go down to the wire tonight -- with the 
possibility that neither side's $10-billion offers, made Feb. 1, will gain the 
50.1% shareholder support needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC's statement may also have been prompted by legal reasons. Viacom has been 
accusing QVC of a "back-door attempt" to quietly change its bid, which QVC said 
would violate procedures both Paramount suitors agreed to earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation had been that QVC partner BellSouth or another company might 
announce plans to buy QVC stock in the open market to prop up its value, thus 
strengthening the home shopping network's bid by shoring up the value of stock 
it is offering Paramount shareholders. But Sunday's statement appears to quash 
that speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that QVC's only hope appears to be neither side gaining a 
majority of Paramount shares tendered by investors before the deadline tonight 
set by Paramount's board. That would presumably throw the bidding open once 
again, giving QVC another chance to legally modify its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a better than even chance we could end up with a stalemate. We may 
not know who the sweetheart is on Valentine's Day," said Seidler Cos. managing 
director Jeffrey Logsdon. 
</P>
<P>
 But QVC appeared to send a signal that it may have reached its limit. In its 
statement, the West Chester, Pa.-based company noted that it has not tapped 
some available bank funds that would allow it to raise its bid. QVC said it has 
stuck to its promise of not bidding more for Paramount than is prudent and has 
also not compromised "the integrity" of QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors handicapping the race at this point put Viacom in front, although it 
remains relatively close. Viacom, an entertainment giant that owns the MTV and 
Nickelodeon networks, is making its bid along with its tentative merger 
partner, video giant Blockbuster Entertainment. Paramount's board supports 
Viacom's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 In its statement, QVC continued to tout its bid, arguing that its offer 
remains superior with "no collars, no games, no bells, no whistles and is 
easily understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in a statement Sunday, Viacom claimed its bid is better, saying, "It 
hardly needs to be stated that the Viacom offer on its face is clearly superior 
to that of QVC." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC also criticized those who have said the company needs to put a "collar" on 
its bid, or a safety net to protect investors from a fall in QVC's stock price 
should the company win. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC said investors have told the company that the "only issue that prevents 
our winning is the lack of 'back-end protection' " in its bid. QVC called that 
notion a "myth," saying that Viacom's stock also lacks such protection. Viacom 
disputed that allegation, calling QVC's statement an attempt to "erroneously 
denigrate" its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to lobby shareholders, QVC argued that it can bring out the best 
long-term value in Paramount. "The only good argument is one that contains 
concrete plans for the rebuilding of current assets and the creation of new 
ones, not nebulous talk about synergies and unspecified cutbacks," QVC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether QVC's message about long-term value has any impact is questionable, 
since as much as 60% of Paramount's stock is estimated by analysts to be in the 
hands of stock speculators who snapped it up looking for a quick short-term 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to QVC's statement, Viacom said it is "at the first stage of 
creating a global media powerhouse of unparalleled proportions in the 
industry."

JAPAN MUST OPEN ITS MARKETS, HOSOKAWA SAYS; TRADE: PRIME MINISTER SEEKS TO

 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, seeking to head off possible U.S. trade 
sanctions, on Sunday said Japan should take unilateral steps to open its 
markets to foreign goods and reduce its huge trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is now in Japan's court," Hosokawa told reporters traveling with him 
from Washington back to Tokyo. "We must use our brains. Japan will do what it 
can on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa said he will meet today and Tuesday with cabinet members to discuss 
what steps Japan should take. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a key index of Japanese stocks was down 3% at midday today on 
concern that the failure of last week's trade talks between Tokyo and 
Washington will lead to retaliation against Japanese exporters, traders said. 
In midday trading, the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average was off 590.46 points 
to 19,400.24. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Asian stocks also tumbled in midday trading today, dragged down by 
general uneasiness about trade issues, the U.S. dollar's weakness and rising 
U.S. interest rates. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 371.63 points, or 3.2%, 
to 11,132.40. Taipei's weighted index slumped 273.76 points, or 4.4%, to 
6,020.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations that the United States would seek to drive up the value of the 
yen were reflected on the Tokyo foreign exchange market, where the U.S. dollar 
finished today's morning session at 106.05 yen, down 2.20 yen from Thursday's 
close (Japanese markets were closed Friday). A strong yen makes Japanese 
exports more expensive and thus harder to sell, while foreign imports to Japan 
become more of a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear what steps Washington might take in reaction to the 
breakdown in trade talks, but there have been indications that a first step in 
punitive sanctions could come as early as Tuesday. That is the deadline for a 
determination on whether Japan has lived up to a 1989 agreement on opening its 
cellular telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts see a risk that Japan and the United States may fall into a 
downward spiral of mutual retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading economic daily, declared Sunday that 
"Japan and the United States are in a state of economic war in the wake of the 
breakdown of the framework trade talks." 
</P>
<P>
 But most reaction in Japan has been more muted. When Hosokawa and President 
Clinton announced that they had failed to reach a trade agreement at their 
Friday summit, the dominant reaction of Japanese commentators, business leaders 
and government officials seemed to be satisfaction that the Tokyo-Washington 
relationship has reached a new level of maturity in which the two sides can 
bluntly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's apparent intent is to carry out many of the steps offered by Japan 
during the trade talks. As part of a plan to open Japan's insurance market, and 
for government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, Japan 
had offered a variety of deregulatory and open bidding measures to increase 
foreign penetration. Japan had also offered to facilitate cooperation between 
Japanese and U.S. auto makers to boost the import of U.S. automobiles and auto 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa told reporters that an overall agreement had been "80% to 90% 
complete" when the talks broke down over the issue of numerical targets. 
Japan's refusal to agree to targets reflected a lack of certainty that these 
steps would achieve the degree of progress demanded by the United States. It 
thus remains unclear whether Hosokawa is capable of taking steps that would 
have sufficiently dramatic effects in boosting foreign imports and reducing the 
trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any real risk of a debilitating breakdown in economic ties, the 
roots of such danger may lie in what continue to be profoundly different 
perceptions of who is at fault in the persistent trade imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Japanese, from top officials to ordinary citizens, do not believe that 
Japanese trade barriers are the main problem. Higher savings rates in Japan and 
insufficient efforts by American exporters -- symbolized by the failure of U.S. 
auto makers to build small right-hand-drive cars for the Japanese market -- get 
most of the blame for the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese confidence in the face of U.S. threats is based on a variety of 
factors. One is the hope that Tokyo can take enough steps on its own to show 
significant results. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also believe that the two economies are so deeply intertwined that 
there is relatively little the United States can do in the way of sanctions 
that would not penalize U.S. companies and consumers just as much as Japanese 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Punitive actions by Washington are seen as likely to violate international 
rules agreed upon in the recently concluded worldwide trade talks under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Washington is not fully united on the issue of what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest fear in Japan may be that Washington will try to talk up the 
value of the yen. Many analysts think this is the only effective weapon in 
Washington's possession. 
</P>
<P>
 But too high a yen could cut off any Japanese recovery. That would work 
counter to the Clinton Administration's wish to see greater domestic Japanese 
demand pull in more imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it may not be that easy to push up the value of the yen. With Japan 
still in recession, while the U.S. economy shows strong growth and rising 
interest rates, economic forces could force the yen the other way.

 American Plans Smoke-Free Transatlantic Flights: The largest U.S. carrier said 
it will launch its smoke-free service from New York to London on May 
1.Dallas-based American Airlines said a recent customer survey shows that "a 
significant number of participants preferred nonsmoking flights." The airline 
will designate one of its five daily 6 1/2-hour flights on that route 
nonsmoking and see whether customers react favorably. The carrier has no plans 
yet to offer nonsmoking service on other international routes. American follows 
the lead of United Airlines, which announced in January that it would offer 
nonsmoking service from New York to London and Los Angeles to Auckland, New 
Zealand, starting March 1.

 Judge Dismisses Insider Trading Charges: A federal judge in New York has 
dismissed civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
against two stockbrokers, Frank Petrone and James Zanengo.In an oral ruling 
from the bench, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska threw out the charges 
Feb. 4 after a five-day trial, a lawyer for Petrone said. The SEC had accused 
the two of trading on inside information in the Philip Morris takeover of Kraft 
in 1988. Lawyer Jody M. Peikin said the judge stated she found no evidence of 
them receiving illegal inside information.

 Gasoline Prices Increase: Prices at the pump were up a little more than 1 cent 
a gallon on average during the last three weeks, a national survey showed. The 
average price of gas on Friday was $1.1086 per gallon, including all grades and 
taxes, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide.Survey 
publisher Trilby Lundberg said the upward trend started in January. The last 
survey, taken Jan. 21, showed an average price of $1.0985 cents per gallon, up 
from the Jan. 7 figure of $1.0951. The rise "should be looked at as a partial 
correction of extraordinarily low prices that prevailed from a fall oversupply 
of gas and a winter drop in crude oil prices," Lundberg said. At self-serve 
pumps, the average price of regular unleaded gas was $1.0361; at full-serve 
pumps, regular unleaded was $1.4313 per gallon.

FIRM SUED OVER SCREEN SAVER ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversy over software patents keeps going and going and going. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest conflict arising from a broad patent in the field involves PC 
Dynamics, a tiny Westlake Village outfit that has raked in a cool $1 
million-plus by selling a computer screen saver program featuring the Energizer 
Bunny, used for years by Eveready to promote batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 PC Dynamics was astonished to learn that Software Advertising Corp. in La 
Costa holds a patent covering, among other things, the use of screen savers for 
advertising. PC Dynamics wasn't the only one astonished. "My first reaction 
was, this was a hoax," said Bob Metcalfe, a pioneer in network computing who is 
now publisher of InfoWorld, a leading trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad nature of the advertising patent, along with a similarly 
all-encompassing multimedia patent awarded recently to Compton's NewMedia, 
raised hackles in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Screen savers are programs that project a changing display across a computer 
monitor. They were originally intended to prevent images from burning 
themselves in, but have caught on for their entertainment value. PC Dynamics 
pays Eveready a royalty for the use of its rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, PC Dynamics' President Peter Avritch got a letter from an attorney 
noting that his client, Software Advertising Corp., holds a 1992 patent 
covering methods for displaying ads on computer screens without interrupting 
whatever program is running at the time. The attorney said his client wanted to 
negotiate a royalty "under an amicable setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Avritch contended that advertising on computer screens is akin to putting your 
company logo on a coffee mug -- a patent for which would be preposterous, he 
said. But Dave Ekedal, president of Software Advertising Corp., begged to 
differ: "If it was so obvious, why hadn't anybody patented it before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Metcalfe, meanwhile, has used his InfoWorld column to rail against such 
patents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should not be able to patent ideas as obvious as this," he said. "This is 
another example of how ridiculously out of control our patent office is on 
matters relating to computers and software." MARTHA GROVES

IMPLANT MAKERS SAID TO AGREE ON SETTLEMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The three largest manufacturers of silicone breast implants have agreed to pay 
nearly 80% of a proposed $4.75-billion settlement to women injured by the 
implants, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the manufacturers, Dow Corning Corp., said announcing an agreement 
was premature.Representatives of the two other manufacturers, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. and Baxter International, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits over implants have been consolidated in Birmingham, where 
negotiations between about 20 corporations and attorneys representing hundreds 
of thousands of implant recipients are being overseen by a U.S. district judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers Stan Chesley and Margaret Moses Branch, who serve on the plaintiffs' 
negotiating committee, said a tentative agreement was reached Friday with Dow 
Corning, Bristol-Myers, Baxter and some smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 New York lawyer Perry Weitz, whose firm represents a majority of the 
plaintiffs, said in a statement Sunday that contributions from the three big 
companies plus the smaller defendants would amount to 80% of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from a previous settlement involving other defendants would raise the 
total to 85%, or slightly more than $4 billion, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are continuing with Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., which 
has not agreed on a contribution, and General Electric Co., whose offer was 
rejected as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million American woman have gotten breast implants, about 80% of 
them for cosmetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement would compensate women for everything from discomfort to 
disfigurement.

 Coors Wins Discrimination Lawsuit: Adolph Coors Co. said a federal court jury 
found in its favor in a civil lawsuit that charged it was responsible for the 
failure of a minority-owned business that was a supplier to the brewing 
company. Felix Burrows Jr. of Chicago sued Coors under the Civil Rights Act of 
1991, claiming Coors canceled orders placed with one of his businesses, Great 
American Tool & Manufacturing Co., because Burrows is African American.Burrows 
claimed the cancellations forced him to close his company in 1990. Coors said 
it presented evidence that it had taken "extraordinary" steps to help the 
company, including providing a no-interest $190,000 loan when Great American 
faced federal tax liens. At the time the Illinois company shut its doors, it 
was holding more than $85,000 in unfilled orders with Coors, Coors said.

60% of baby boomers -- Americans between the ages 29 and 47 -- say they will 
not have enough for retirement no matter how much they save, according to a 
report commissioned by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corp. About 66% 
of baby boomers say they believe their retirement savings are at risk.

 Kodak Names New Finance Chief: Eastman Kodak Co. appointed Harry L. Kavetas, 
former president and chief executive of IBM Credit Corp., filling a post left 
vacant since an avid cost-cutter quit, saying the company was reluctant to 
implement his ideas. The abrupt resignation of Christopher J. Steffen nine 
months ago in a dispute with then-Chairman and Chief Executive Kay R. Whitmore 
led to a management shake-up and a new strategy to sharply reduce the 
Rochester, N.Y., company's overhead.

 Nigeria Optimistic on OPEC Action: Nigerian officials, speaking after separate 
meetings with Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer and OPEC President Abdullah 
al-Attiyah, said they were optimistic that the organization will act to boost 
prices when it meets in March. Nigerian Oil Minister Don Etiebet, who agreed 
with Qatari Energy Minister Attiyah to propose a 5% to 10% output cut, stopped 
short of saying that key producer Saudi Arabia had agreed OPEC should cut 
back.But he spoke of agreement on ways of injecting new life into the market, 
where world benchmark Brent oil Friday languished near five-year lows at less 
than $14 a barrel in London, compared to OPEC's formal target of $21. In New 
York, where the price is usually $1 more per barrel, spot crude futures closed 
at $14.72 a barrel.

VIETNAM EMERGING AS TRAVEL'S NEWEST LURE; TOURISM: INDUSTRY EXPERTS PREDICT A 
BOOM. BUSINESS PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Travel industry experts driven by visions of tourists hiking down the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail are betting on a sharp rise in American visitors after the lifting 
of the U.S. trade ban against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the embargo was lifted, U.S. airlines began rushing to add the 
underdeveloped, hauntingly beautiful country to their lists of Asian 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of travelers is likely to be business people, some of whom will 
be trying to exploit the country's potential as a tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been hard to live in this country for the last 30 years without 
some consciousness of Vietnam," said Travel & Leisure magazine Editor in Chief 
Nancy Novogrod, who predicts a sharp increase in tourist travel there. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Americans, it will become one of the most sought-after destinations in 
the coming years," said Novogrod, whose upscale magazine will feature Vietnam 
and one of its French colonial-era beach resorts in an upcoming issue. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's move this month to lift the ban paves the way for direct 
U.S.-Vietnam air links and eases limits on how much money American travelers 
can spend in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a market where there is considerable interest," said Jon Austin, 
spokesman for Northwest Airlines, which has applied for approval to fly from 
Detroit to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, via Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers are expected to be a mix of business people and tourists who 
previously would have had to go elsewhere, such as Thailand, to catch flights 
and arrange visas to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 With cans of Pepsi rolling off an assembly line in Vietnam within hours of the 
ban's lifting, a boom in hotel building is expected to follow close behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But tour operators say there are still few hotels in the country, especially 
in the less developed north, and little road and air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a mainstream destination. . . . It doesn't have the 
infrastructure," said Sarah Timewell of Inner Asia Expeditions, which has 
offered Vietnam trips for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But something that's forbidden is always exciting. This was something that 
was not only forbidden -- Vietnam was a big question mark over the last 20 
years for people trying to make sense of it all," said Timewell, director of 
Burma and Indochina tours for the San Francisco-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 For a generation of traveling Americans, the failed war that pitted the United 
States and South Vietnam against the Communist-led North was the formative 
event in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two decades have passed since the U.S. government pulled out of the 
conflict in 1973, big-budget movies and a renewed fascination with Vietnamese 
culture testify to the lure the country has for Americans. 
</P>

 Inner Asia, a small company that offers specialized trips -- from trekking 
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to culinary tours -- for between $1,200 and $5,500 a 
week, expects its business to double, Vice President James Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lifting of the ban also came the end of Treasury Department 
regulations that prevented tourists from spending more than $200 a day on 
travel costs in the country, industry officials said. They predict the change 
could also attract more tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 For some Americans, including war veterans who opposed the lifting of the 
embargo while the fate of more than 2,000 missing soldiers remains unknown, the 
thought of tourists trekking down what was the main military supply line is 
anathema. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the journey to Vietnam has been soul-cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost so many American lives . . . there was so much bloodshed. Vietnam has 
a tragic sense about it," said Patrick Collins, a congressional aide whose 
parents were anti-war activists. 
</P>
<P>
 When Collins, 35, two years ago flew ago into Hanoi's airport, which was still 
littered with bomb craters, he found only a handful of Europeans and no other 
U.S. tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they found you were American, they were very, very positive," he said. 
"They had left the war behind. They made a distinction between government 
policy and Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese are really extraordinary people -- they learn incredibly fast 
and they see things with a sense of humor," said Timewell, who was going back 
to Vietnam this month for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They find it very entertaining that the scrap metal from leftover American 
ordnance is sold to Japan to be melted down and sold to make Toyotas for export 
to the United States," she said. "It's the perfect Confucian notion of 
justice."

 Hong Kong Fears Hotel Room Shortage: The government is considering zoning 
specific sites for hotels to combat the looming shortage. "The government will 
consider, as never done in the past, whether we should actually identify sites 
most suitable for hotels and zone them for that use," Planning Secretary Tony 
Eason said. Developers and investors have begun ripping down some of the 
territory's major hotels to make way for more lucrative office towers, sparking 
concern in the tourism industry.

 Tokyo Shoppers Gobble Up American Rice: The rice, subject of longtime 
U.S-Japan trade talks, appeared in Tokyo supermarkets last week and vanished 
again before anyone knew it.At $1.50 a pound, half the price of Japanese rice, 
the bags of California rice piled high at the Daiei supermarket in the Tokyo 
district of Meguro sold out in just a few hours. Similar scenes occurred in 
many other stores around Tokyo and Osaka, the Jiji news agency said. Foreign 
rice goes on full-fledged sale at the end of the month. In October, the 
Japanese government, suffering from the worst harvest since the 1950s, decided 
to import 200 metric tons of rice, mostly from the United States, China and 
Thailand.

restructuring plan aimed at bringing costs under control. The program calls for 
completing the cuts by the end of March, 1996, through attrition, curtailed 
recruitment, introducing contract employees in some cabin crew positions and

 Jobless Rate Declines: Unemployment in January fell to its lowest level in 20 
months, and employment rose for a fifth consecutive month, confirming that the 
nation's economic recovery is gaining steam, analysts said.The January jobless 
rate fell 0.1% to 10.6%. Economists had forecast a rise in unemployment. 
Employment grew by 22,000 jobs in January. The decrease in unemployment was 
achieved even though more people were out looking for work. The participation 
rate, which measures the number of people in jobs and those looking for work, 
increased 0.1% to 63.1%.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BEYOND PARAMOUNT: WHAT NEXT FOR MULTIMEDIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Our long national nightmare -- the five-month-old bidding war for Paramount 
Communications -- is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 With its conclusion, Wall Street is hoping for a new beginning of sorts: A 
revival of investor interest in entertainment, technology, telecommunications 
and multimedia stocks, many of which have slumped badly since last fall, when 
the Paramount saga began. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for Paramount, and the mammoth Bell Atlantic/Tele-Communications 
Inc. merger announced in mid-October, initially spurred wild bidding for almost 
any company that could boast a tie (real or imagined) to the madly overhyped 
information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Paramount story has dragged on, it has become a royal bore on Wall 
Street. Likewise, the wait for a final merger agreement in the Bell 
Atlantic/TCI deal has caused investors' eyelids to droop. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Stocks of all the players in these two mega-mergers have probably 
sunk further than would be dictated solely by a more sober, post-euphoria 
assessment of their long-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has made money in these companies since Oct. 1," laments Mario 
Gabelli, a big New York-based media stock investor. "Has that chilled interest 
(in other multimedia plays)? It's got to." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Inc., the apparent winner in the war for Paramount, has seen its Class 
B shares plunge from a peak of $61.25 last year to $31.625 now. Rival bidder 
QVC Network, whose shares hit $73 last year, trades at $46.875 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, have fallen 20% from their 1993 peak of 
$69.125, to $55.50 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the profit potential of the developing information highway remains 
huge. The customers for greatly expanded information and entertainment choices 
via TV or home computer ultimately number every adult and child in America -- 
and, eventually, the world. 
</P>
<P>
 So at some point, investors are sure to take another look at how best to play 
this revolution. Here, capsule summaries of three key groups in the multimedia 
industry, and the outlook: 
</P>
<P>
 * The telephone stocks. Shares of the seven regional Bell companies are down 
between 7% and 22% from their 1993 highs. But Wall Street's concerns seem to be 
contradictory: Bell Atlantic has been clipped for perhaps paying too much for 
cable TV king TCI; Nynex, meanwhile, has been dashed for allegedly moving too 
slowly into cable and other information-delivery systems, despite its planned 
investment in Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 While the regional phone stocks are unquestionably cheap on a 
price-to-earnings basis, many analysts see little hope of investor interest 
heating up soon. Mostly, that's because Congress may take all year rewriting 
laws governing what the phone firms -- and their competitors -- can and can't 
do. That will keep uncertainty high. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, for example, is how to open local phone service to greater 
competition, and whether the regional Bells should be allowed to offer long 
distance services. 
</P>
<P>
 David Shell, senior research analyst at media investor Eagle Asset Management 
in St. Petersburg, Fla., sees the phone stocks suffering from growing concern 
about their dividends, and whether those hefty payouts can be maintained as the 
firms spend on new services. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's worth remembering that the Bells have tremendous financial 
resources to throw at the information highway. For the most progressive of them 
-- Bell Atlantic, US West and Southwestern Bell -- investors may be 
underestimating the long-term payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cable TV stocks. Last fall, every cable franchise was viewed as a 
takeover target for a phone company. Now, Wall Street is much more focused on 
the looming federal re-regulation of cable rates, which may crimp cash flows. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, shares of Comcast Corp. have dropped from a peak of $28.125 last year to 
$20.25 now; Cablevision Systems shares have been hurt less, but at $66.25 still 
are off 8% from their peak. Multimedia Inc. is down 13%, to $34.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many analysts continue to believe that the remaining major cable 
franchises will end up in the hands of phone companies or other larger players. 
Indeed, new cable takeovers -- probably after the rate re-regulation issue is 
decided in coming months -- could be the catalyst for reigniting multimedia 
fever in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Crawford, media analyst at mutual fund giant Capital Group in Los 
Angeles, expects Cablevision (2.1 million subscribers) to be "the next 
transaction." Time Warner is a possible buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The software stocks. Some of the savviest observers of the multimedia frenzy 
last fall argued that, long term, the most money will be made investing not in 
the information highway itself, but in the programming that runs on it. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument still has merit. Note that the stock market value of Walt Disney 
far exceeds that of most other multimedia players, even though Euro Disney's 
troubles have weighed on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paramount shareholders get their money once its takeover is complete, 
they may begin to focus on other software shares. Time Warner, of course, has 
already become a target of the Bronfman family, which has accumulated 12% of 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller names could also be up for grabs. TV show syndicator King World 
Productions ("Oprah," "American Journal"), for example, "probably is a pretty 
avid target because they have superior research capabilities that anyone 
wanting to get into distribution will have to have," says Jeffrey Logsdon, 
media analyst at the Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 King World stock, at $39 now, is off 11% from its 1993 peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the surprise of the last few months has been Wall Street's renewed 
love affair with the networks. Cap Cities/ABC stock recently hit an all-time 
high; CBS isn't much below its high. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Reif, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, sees investors 
continuing to refocus on the networks, based on improving ad growth as the 
economy expands and on the companies' takeover values. A CBS-Disney union 
remains a hot rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in another software niche, the video games producers and educational 
software producers are back in the spotlight after last week's merger 
announcement between Broderbund Software and Electronic Arts. Many of these 
stocks, including Atari, Acclaim Entertainment and WMS Industries, are off 20% 
to 50% from their '93 highs, though they probably were far overvalued at their 
peaks. Entertainment Value on Wall Street 
</P>
<P>
 A simple way to measure investors's attitude toward entertainment, multimedia 
and telecommunications companies is to look at the companies' market value -- 
the stock price times the number of shares outstanding. How different companies 
compare (market value in billions of dollars): 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney: $24.54 
</P>
<P>
 BellAtlantic: 24.13 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell: 22.70 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner: 14.29 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities / ABC: 11.22 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Inc.: 4.85 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer: 4.30 
</P>
<P>
 QVC Network: 1.77 
</P>
<P>
 CableVision Systems: 1.51

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SOLID LITTLE AMERICAN GROWTH READY FOR CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mutual fund managers who build a solid track record can usually expect to 
attract a steady flow of investors. Robert Brody is living proof that it 
doesn't happen all the time, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody has compiled a pretty good performance history as head of the American 
Growth Fund, but his Denver-based portfolio counts just $74 million in assets 
-- an amount some funds pull in within months. Yet Brody has been at the job 35 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only three active managers have more continuous experience running a 
particular fund than the 68-year-old Brody. Lengthy tenure is much more the 
exception than the rule in a business in which most managers have been at their 
jobs since only the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody and American Growth are unusual in other ways, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, he has $1.8 million of his own money invested in the fund, a 
relatively high personal stake. In addition, he has made no effort to open 
sibling portfolios -- another rarity in an age dominated by fund families. In 
fact, Brody does very little outside money management for institutions and 
wealthy individuals -- a further sign of going against the grain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we do a better job by concentrating all our efforts in one fund," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 So with such dedication, why is the fund still comparatively small and little 
known? 
</P>
<P>
 For part of the answer, you need only look back to the period from 1983 
through 1991. Although American Growth posted positive returns in seven of the 
nine years, it also lagged rival growth funds in eight of those years. 
</P>
<P>
 Second and perhaps more important, Brody and his staff haven't succeeded in 
getting the word out during an era when aggressive self-promotion is a big part 
of the mutual fund game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done an outstanding job marketing it, which is obvious," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he's determined to change all that. And with American Growth coming 
off two very good years in 1992 and '93 -- when it outperformed 75% of its 
peers -- Brody has a lot more to boast about. The fund's long-term record is 
also quite decent. American Growth achieved an 11.1% annual compounded return 
from January, 1960, to January, 1994, according to the Summit, N.J. office 
ofLipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
 That was significantly better than the 9.8% yearly gain for growth funds in 
general, according to Lipper, whose numbers don't go quite as far back as 
American Growth does. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who paid the maximum original sales commission of 5% would have earned 
about 10.9% annually rather than 11.1%. The top load was later boosted to 8.5% 
but since then has been lowered to 5.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody is a so-called top-down manager, which means he starts with a 
macroeconomic outlook, then identifies attractive industries and, after that, 
individual stocks likely to fare well assuming his forecast is on target. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the economy gradually strengthening, cyclical stocks are the ones he 
believes will show the greatest earnings growth. A company's profit potential 
is "five times more important than any other factor" in predicting stock price 
performance, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, Brody says he's bullish about the stock market generally and 
cyclical companies in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorite firms include those in banking, auto making and steel manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pent-up demand for cars, and sales will rise," he says, explaining 
why he has placed a combined 11.3% of the portfolio in shares of General Motors 
and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 As for bank stocks, they're selling well below the market's price-to-earnings 
multiple, he points out, while years of restructuring have made steelmakers 
"lean and mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem Steel is the fund's second-largest holding, behind GM, at 5.7% of 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brody started out, there were fewer than 100 mutual funds around, and a 
3-million-share trading day on the New York Stock Exchange was considered 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the number of funds is closer to 5,000, and daily NYSE volume often 
exceeds 300 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In these heady days, Brody thinks managers such as himself who retain the 
ability to move significantly into cash during rough periods enjoy an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something that new investors should be aware of is that markets can and do 
move in two directions," he says, cautioning that first-time fund shareholders 
shouldn't forget about the risks they're assuming. 
</P>
<P>
 That caveat aside, Brody also considers it important for people to invest 
steadily over time, in both up and down markets, to meet their long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Men dominate the boards of directors at mutual funds, holding 94% of the 
seats, even though women represent nearly half of all shareholders, says a 
study by Fund Directions, a New York-based industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at a median age of 63, the typical fund director is about 17 years older 
than the average shareholder, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 340 trustees and directors at 50 mutual funds also found that 
72% of the members were independent outsiders, which Fund Directions viewed as 
evidence that boards aren't as cozy with management as critics allege. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired business executives, lawyers and academics also tended to be heavily 
represented. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The price of gold bullion has slipped just 2.8% so far this year -- from 
$390.80 on Jan. 1 to $380 now -- but some gold-mining stock funds have suffered 
far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week saw heavy profit-taking in many of the gold funds, after the Federal 
Reserve tightened credit for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's move was aimed at quashing inflation before it becomes a problem in 
an expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That apparently disappointed some gold stock investors, who may have been 
betting on a pickup in inflation to boost gold further this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's big losers among the gold funds included Lexington Strategic 
Investments, which plunged nearly 9% through Thursday, according to 
fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York. Year-to-date, Lexington is 
down almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lexington shareholders are used to wild volatility: The fund was the 
biggest gainer among all stock funds last year, rocketing 270%, Lipper notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also falling sharply last week was U.S. Gold Shares, down nearly 8% for the 
week ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund now is off almost 16% so far this year, after surging 124% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The average gold stock fund dropped 5.2% last week through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-to-date, the average gold fund's loss is just under 3% -- about in line 
with the decline in bullion prices so far. Deans of the Fund Business

GERMAN FACTORY STRIKE APPEARS IMMINENT AFTER TALKS BREAK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany appeared Sunday to be heading toward its worst labor unrest in a 
decade after the breakdown of last-ditch talks to avert a strike in the 
manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership of the 3.6-million-strong IG Metall engineering union will 
start receiving notification from regional branches this week that talks with 
employers have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 IG Metall has already announced its intention to call a strike ballot Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result of this ballot is already certain," commented the weekly Welt am 
Sonntag: "Strike." 
</P>
<P>
 IG Metall President Klaus Zwickel told German radio he was "no longer at all 
optimistic" there would be a fresh attempt to reach agreement, even though 
Germany is suffering from high unemployment and its worst postwar recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Dieter Kirchner, managing director of the employers' federation Gesamtmetall, 
told Welt am Sonntag: "I can't imagine us inviting this dogmatic and 
unrealistic union to seek a solution with us again." 
</P>
<P>
 The first all-out stoppage in Germany's most important industrial sector since 
1984 looked increasingly inevitable even before the failed top-level crisis 
talks between union leaders and employers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side reported any narrowing of the gap between employers' demands for 
pay cuts and more flexible working hours and the union's call for more pay, or 
at least job guarantees, and the retention of a 37-hour week it fought for 
years to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators agreed that a strike could not come at a worse time, as industry 
struggles to emerge from recession and to adjust to stiff competition from 
countries with lower costs and less rigid working practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be one of the greatest political idiocies of recent years, but union 
and employers seem determined to commit it," wrote the mass-circulation Bild am 
Sonntag. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties came in for equal criticism -- employers for trying to backpedal 
on pay concessions made in earlier years, and the union for being dogmatic in 
demands over working hours and refusing to allow flexible solutions for 
different firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said a strike would have even more 
dramatic consequences than the 1984 stoppage -- which cut half a percentage 
point off Germany's economic growth, measured by gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the union should stop complaining that the employers were trying to 
turn back the clock to before 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would be so bad if the German economy looked like it did in 1984, before 
the expensive reductions in working hours on full pay, when there was 3.1% 
growth and 2.4% inflation?" the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germany economy is expected to grow only about 1% this year after a 1.3% 
slump in 1993, and inflation is running at an annual 3.5%.

ANN CONWAY: SHOWING HIS COLORS; BERNARD LEWIN HELPS OPEN BOWERS EXHIBIT OF HIS 
MEXICAN ART COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask German-born Bernard Lewin to tell you why he has collected hundreds of 
works by modern Mexican artists and he talks about his first trip to Mexico in 
the '50s: "I saw great art there, the work of masters, and I couldn't believe 
they were not known around the world, or even in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so impressed, I began to seek it. I was fortunate to be the first one 
to enter Diego Rivera's studio six months after he died in 1958. I bought four 
paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Lewin, a Jew who fled Nazi Germany, has collected hundreds of 
works by artists such as Rufino Tamayo, Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro 
Siqueiros and Carlos Merida. 
</P>
<P>
 His love for the collection is difficult to put into words, the Palm Springs 
resident explained on Friday night at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art where 
the exhibit, Seven Decades: Modern Mexican Art from the Bernard Lewin 
Collection, was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something I feel in my stomach," said Lewin, an octogenarian, drawing 
his right hand toward his cobalt-blue velvet jacket. "When I look at the color, 
texture and composition, I get a sensation here ." 
</P>
<P>
 The million-dollar question: What museum will be chosen to house the Lewin 
collection after he is gone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum in Santa Ana is a possibility, Lewin said during a private 
party staged for exhibit underwriters by Sharon Jaquith (a trustee of the Leo 
Freedman Foundation that has donated $1 million to the museum). "I have thought 
about it, but I have not made a decision yet. There are many museums 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his wife, Edith: "There's a museum in Los Angeles that wants to build a 
building for our collection. But it's too soon to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests of Jaquith -- who included museum donor Fernando Niebla, exhibit artist 
Vladimir Cora and "Rain of Gold" author Victor Villasenor -- mingled in the 
colorful Fluor Gallery, quaffing Cristal champagne and nibbling on red-corn 
taquitos, as they spoke of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted," said Niebla, who has a museum balcony named after him. "I 
think the whole collection reflects what we're trying to do at the museum -- 
relate to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be tremendous if we could have it here forever -- but that is highly 
unlikely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin called the exhibit of about 100 of his paintings "sensational." "It is 
unbelievable what I see here," he said, mingling with a crush of about 80 
guests. "I love this museum; it is just great." 
</P>
<P>
 After the reception, guests -- who included museum director Peter Keller -- -- 
filed into the facility's sleek Topaz restaurant for a beef and swordfish 
repast taken at tables draped in black cloths and topped with fresh anthurium 
and orchid bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festivities, Jaquith -- stunning in a chili-red silk and lace 
cocktail dress -- introduced Villasenor, saying that his book, a nonfiction 
saga of his family's life in Mexico, had taught her what to do in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says they prayed and made love during an earthquake," Jaquith announced, 
laughing. "I can't think of a better way to handle a natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 A smiling Villasenor stood and recalled the day when he visited Lewin's Palm 
Springs gallery. "I saw a piece of art there, a carving, that I had to have," 
he said. "Just looking at it made me happy. And I want you all to know that the 
art you are seeing here tonight, if you take the time to let it touch you, will 
make a difference in your life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I went to Mexico and started seeing art that I began not to 
hate myself, feel inferior. For all of the Mexican kids who come here to see 
this exhibit, they will say, 'Oh, my God, I come from somewhere. I can be 
somebody.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give them hope." 
</P>

 Wolfing it down at Wolfgang Puck Cafe: Veggie pizza, Louisiana shrimp pizza, 
smoked salmon pizza, prosciutto pizza -- all were on the menu last week when 
members of the Center 500 support group of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center attended the grand opening of the Wolfgang Puck Cafe at South Coast 
Plaza. Not to mention the linguini with Chicken Bolognese, the wild mushroom 
tortellini or the angel hair with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 With wife Barbara Lazaroff (she designed the cafe) on his arm, Puck played 
host to about about 150 guests, shaking their hands and bringing them food from 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of the Spago restaurant in Los Angeles, Puck said he brought his 
scaled-down version to South Coast Plaza at the request of Macy's. "We did one 
with them in San Francisco and they wanted a cafe next to Bullock's here. I 
didn't think it was the best location for a restaurant, but they talked me into 
it and now it's very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 (FYI: Puck confided he didn't know who would be having an Oscar party at 
Spago, his famous Sunset Boulevard restaurant, now that super-agent Swifty 
Lazar is gone. Swifty had the only post-Oscar game in town for years. "We'll 
just have to wait and see," Puck said. "I keep asking myself: 'Who should have 
it?' The main thing is to find the right person.")

JACK SMITH: ON REAGAN'S SAYINGS -- YOU CAN QUOTE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a letter from Charlton Heston deploring the fact that the 16th edition 
of Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations," published in 1992, contains only three 
quotations from Ronald Reagan, and opining that those were selected to make him 
look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Heston further alleges that the editor of that edition, Justin Kaplan, was 
guilty of "Draconian censorship" in excluding from Bartlett's "most of the 
conservative comment" of the last generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Heston concedes he and I may be on opposite sides of the political fence, but 
suggests that because of my outspoken opposition to censorship I will agree 
that Kaplan's prejudice is despicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as my readers must know, I am not a political animal. I vote. 
Beginning with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I have voted for the Democratic 
presidential candidate in every election. (They just seem to have better 
personalities.) But I am not a Democrat. In the last gubernatorial election, I 
voted for the Peace and Freedom candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Heston encloses an article by Adam Meyerson, from Policy Review, quoting 
Kaplan as telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, "I'm not going to disguise the 
fact that I despise Ronald Reagan," and Kaplan's later writing in the Wall 
Street Journal that Reagan was not a memorable phrase maker but "only an actor 
masquerading as a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Kaplan deserves to edit the 17th edition of Bartlett's or not, those 
two quotations should surely be in it. 
</P>
<P>
 It does seem that Kaplan shouldered his task with a prejudice that should have 
troubled the book's publishers. As a popular two-term President, Reagan, I 
think, deserves to be quoted more extensively, even if it makes him look bad. 
After all, even his enemies called him the "great communicator." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Bettijane Levine of The Times in 1992, Kaplan said he 
intended to trim what he regarded as excessive amounts of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
Henry James and Oliver Wendell Holmes, but he said nothing about limiting 
Reagan to three quotations after his eight years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three passages quoted, Meyerson points out, Reagan states that there is 
no shortage of food in America, that the Republicans want "an America in which 
people can still get rich," and that government is like a baby -- "an 
alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no responsibility at the 
other." These were chosen, Meyerson asserts, "to make Mr. Reagan look 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The book does not include the remark that perhaps endeared Reagan to the 
public more than any other. When he looked up at his team of surgeons after 
being shot in the chest by a would-be assassin, he said: "I hope you're all 
Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps worth noting that the 15th edition of Bartlett's, edited by 
Emily Morison Beck and published in 1980, has not a single quote from Reagan, 
suggesting that before he became President he said nothing memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's edition has 10 quotes from Richard Nixon, including "I am not a 
crook," "I want you all to stonewall it," and, to the press, after losing the 
California gubernatorial election, "You won't have Nixon to kick around 
anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Ford has three quotations, the most memorable being, "I'm a Ford, not a 
Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carter has six, including his revelation to Bob Scheer of Playboy: "I've 
looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Truman has 19 entries, (nine fewer than in 1980) including, "If you 
can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen"; his famous desk motto, "The buck 
stops here," which President Clinton echoed in his recent State of the Union 
speech, and his stunning announcement in August, 1945, "Sixteen hours ago an 
American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima." 
</P>
<P>
 It does not, however, include what was perhaps history's most most 
consequential message. It was written by Truman with a lead pencil on the back 
of a pink message sheet from the War Department: "Suggestion approved. Release 
when ready but not sooner than Aug. 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Truman was at the Potsdam conference with Stalin and Churchill at the time and 
wanted to get away before the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently Kaplan has a thing for the American expatriate poet T.S. Eliot. He 
is given 129 quotations covering almost six pages, including "This is the way 
the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper." 
</P>
<P>
 For laughs, the book has three quotations from that great master of rhetoric, 
Casey Stengel: "Most people my age are dead." Kaplan also quotes Samuel 
Goldwyn: "Include me out." And the inimitable Yogi Berra: "It ain't over 'til 
it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Kennedy is quoted 28 times. On how he became a hero: "It was 
involuntary. They sank my boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of prejudice, I'm not quoted once.

BOY, 4, DISAPPEARS FROM FOSTER HOME; MISSING: OFFICIALS FEAR THE CHILD MAY HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY HIS BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. HIS FATHER IS A 
JORDANIAN NATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy disappeared from his foster home and may have been taken out 
of the country by his biological parents, sheriff's officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj Yaser Jayyusi was last seen at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. Authorities are 
looking for his biological parents, Yaser Majed, 55, and Deborah Ann Jayyusi, 
35, for questioning, Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the parents moved from their Anaheim home about the time Taj 
disappeared and because the father is a Jordanian national, deputies suspect 
Taj may be out of the country, Martini said. A court hearing to terminate 
parental rights had been scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's foster mother, Susan White, who had started adoption proceedings, 
said Sunday that Taj has a sister in another foster home in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my only hope that he hasn't been taken away to another country, that 
(the parents) would not abandon their daughter," White said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators refused to discuss even the existence of the sister, but White 
said she had been told that the girl is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she left Taj alone in her garage-turned-playroom Saturday morning 
while she took a shower. The garage door was open less than a foot. When she 
returned 15 minutes later, he had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I searched everywhere in the neighborhood, but I knew immediately that it was 
foul play," said White, 43. "Taj is not a roamer; he's afraid to go far away 
from home." 
</P>
<P>
 White said Taj is on medication for an attention-deficit disorder and suffers 
from chronic ear infections. If he is without his medication long, the child 
becomes hyperactive and "difficult to control," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj, who has been a foster child for two years, has lived with White since 
August. His parents were allowed court-monitored visitations weekly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who is single, said she and Taj had developed a mother and son 
relationship, and she had started adoption proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini declined to discuss why the 4-year-old had been placed in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, White's two-bedroom condominium was full of neighbors and family 
who had come with food, condolences and offers to help. A $10,000 reward is 
offered to anyone with information on the whereabouts of Taj, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a twosome, we did everything together," White said. "He keeps saying 
to me, 'I'm going to live with you forever.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Taj is 3 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 45 pounds. He has fair skin, blond hair 
and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing black and white gym shoes with Velcro 
closures, dark blue corduroy pants and a turtleneck shirt with vertical stripes 
in dark blue, gold, orange and red. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents drive a white 1980 Oldsmobile, California license plate number 
398ZIJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department at (714) 647-1832.

LAGUNA GROUP TRYING TO HELP DAYWORKERS; LABOR: TASK FORCE, WORKING TO RAISE 
FUNDS FOR A JOB CENTER, SAYS ANTI-IMMIGRANT CLIMATE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO ITS 
EFFORTS.

<P>
 They stand in a foothill clearing, these mostly Mexican and Central American 
descendants of Aztecs and Mayans and Spanish conquistadors. Their hands are 
callused, their faces weathered. 
</P>
<P>
 And they wait long hours for strangers to drive up and offer them work, 
usually hard manual jobs that pay less than minimum wage. But often, the people 
who pass by the dayworkers, many of them undocumented migrants, have something 
else in mind besides employment: They shout taunts and epithets and give the 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we go through every day," said one worker. "But you have to take 
it. Either that or go hungry, so you take it." The Laguna Beach Cross Cultural 
Task Force wants to change this harsh scene on Laguna Canyon Road near downtown 
by getting $50,000 to create a hiring hall that would be a safer, more 
dignified place for the workers and prospective employers to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 A hiring hall, say task force members, also would serve as a resource center 
offering day care and English classes, among other services. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, amid the anti-immigrant political climate, the task force is 
finding only rejection and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting an unpopular cause right now," said activist and task force 
member Alice Graves. "We're beating our heads up against the wall trying to 
find sources of money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Beck, a literature instructor at Cal State Long Beach who writes the 
grant applications for the task force, said that since July he has sent 
applications to foundations such as the Fluor Foundation in Irvine, Costa 
Mesa's Argyros Foundation, and the Ueberroth Family Foundation in Laguna Beach, 
"but nothing has come of it."  
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly," he said, "they get inundated with all kinds of requests. Day 
laborers represent a difficult political situation and foundations don't take 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one of the foundations approached by the task force said the 
political climate had nothing to do with its request being turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very specific guidelines and (the task force's petition) does not 
fall into any of our categories," said Deborah Land, spokeswoman for the Fluor 
Corp., parent company to the Fluor Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Land said the Fluor Foundation has established four specific areas for 
funding: education, health and human services, culture and arts, and public and 
civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, Land said, "has nothing to do with our selection process." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one organization, the Fieldstone Foundation in Newport Beach, is 
considering a grant for the hiring hall, Beck said, adding that the task force 
has been asking for $5,000 to $10,000 grants.

<P>
 Getting a helping hand from the city of Laguna Beach doesn't appear promising, 
according to the task force and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Robert F. Gentry said that now, just a few months after a 
devastating fire caused roughly $400 million in damage to the community, "I'm 
not sure where we would find resources" to support a job center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is going to be a real problem because of the firestorm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he advises the task force to put together a proposal, lobby hard and 
build community support to get public funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves acknowledged that the task force hasn't approached the city for funding 
because of Laguna's financial limitations. However, she said, "we might end up 
(asking the city for funds) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the task force, a grass-roots organization trying to bridge the 
cultural gap between the Anglo population and minorities, has collected only 
about $1,000 in about five months, far from the amount needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that money, said Graves, a Utah native who has lived in Orange County 
for most of her 62 years, was collected at a Mexican Independence Day 
fund-raiser in September. 
</P>
<P>
 While the task force struggles to get day laborers off the dirt lot, other 
communities in Orange County have successful job centers for migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder speaks glowingly of his city's 
5-year-old job center, which serves an average of 755 people a week, of whom 
200 obtain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Roeder said, "the best benefit has been a reduction of 
complaints in terms of people congregating on street corners soliciting 
employment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa job center and another in Orange are publicly funded. A third 
one in Brea was supported by the city but recently became privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said Costa Mesa spends $110,000 a year to keep the center going, but 
city leaders feel the expense is worth it. "Frankly, it has worked pretty 
well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Laguna Beach, the proposed job center has encountered opposition, and 
migrants have sparked controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Mosier, president of the Laguna Beach Taxpayers Assn., said "my 
personal feeling is that the situation of the dayworkers should be handled 
countywide and not be concentrated only on a few coastal cities." 
</P>
<P>
 "The county should look into the possibility of creating some of these centers 
in Irvine or Mission Viejo," Mosier said. "I don't think it's acceptable to set 
up (a center) that draws them from all over the county to just one or two or 
three cities. This thing should be spread out evenly." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Graves, residents of the city's north side are vehemently opposed 
to a hiring hall, believing it would only bring more migrants to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, upset residents convinced the City Council to strengthen the city's 
law requiring day laborers to seek work exclusively at the open field.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are the ones that are the most vocal about (removing the laborers) from 
Laguna but were the first ones to hire them during and after the fires," Graves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Laguna Canyon hiring site, workers know about the existing job centers 
and some have been to them, but most admit that working in Laguna Beach is more 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our position, a few dollars more mean a lot," said Carlos Aleman Mijangos, 
a native of Veracruz, Mexico, who has been in the United States for 1 1/2 
years. "Ask anyone here, they'll tell you, this area is full of rich people, 
and these people need us, need our work. Why go somewhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 During and after the October fire that destroyed 366 homes, there was plenty 
of work for the day laborers. Many were hired to clear dry brush surrounding 
threatened homes, and after the blaze, the same laborers were called upon to 
clean up the mess left by the firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of work then, although the pay was not that good, $30, $40 a 
day," said a squat but strong man who identified himself only as "Mario." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Mario said the insults from motorists of "greasers" and 
"wetbacks" and "go back to Mexico" have resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 And as they mill about the lot on Laguna Canyon Road, they are also reminded 
that by city ordinance, this is the only place in Laguna Beach where they are 
allowed to openly seek work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like whores," Mario said. "Nobody wants to see us in their 
neighborhoods, but when they need us, they come running to us. The thing is, 
that same need we have -- money -- is what keeps us here, accepting insults."

HEATED CONTEST; 100 FIREFIGHTERS TEST THEIR SKILLS, COMPETE IN 5-EXERCISE DRILL 
</P>

<P>
 Just a few more inches. That was all it would take if firefighter Rob Asay 
could just drag the legs of this dummy -- 175 pounds worth of dead, vexing 
weight -- across the finish line behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasping for air from his oxygen mask, the 26-year-old Asay heard, "C'mon, Rob! 
C'mon!" from his firefighter buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 The dummy's torso had crossed the line, but as Asay groped for a leg or a foot 
-- anything to grab -- he fell down heavily. Finally, with a desperate heave, 
he pushed the dummy's legs across the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have anything left," said Asay, who had joined more than 100 
firefighters from around Southern California on Sunday for the third annual 
Firefighter Combat Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 A cross between television's "Rescue 911" and "American Gladiators," the 
exhibition saw competitors run through five exercises designed to test 
firefighters in skills that they would need to battle a high-rise blaze with 
people trapped inside.  
</P>
<P>
 First, competitors had to race to the top of a five-story tower with a 
50-pound pack slung over their shoulders. At the top, they used a pulley to 
hoist a hose, which they heaved onto a platform. They then raced back down to 
the ground, where they had to drive a 165-pound beam five feet with a shot 
hammer, simulating the smashing of a door or ceiling with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 At their next stop, the firefighters dragged a hose 75 feet, cracked the 
nozzle and shot water at a black box. Then they grabbed the dummy under the 
arms and dragged it 100 feet to the finish line -- where most promptly 
collapsed on a blue mat and struggled to strip off more than 30 pounds worth of 
fire gear on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time, I did it just to see if I could do it," said Larry 
Vandenberg, an Anaheim firefighter who ran the course in under four minutes 
Sunday and, at age 52, was the oldest competitor. "Now it's fun just to prove 
you still can." 
</P>
<P>
 The for-profit event at the Fire Training Center was organized by a 
Washington-area company called ARA/Human Factors, which develops training 
programs for law enforcement groups around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 18 agencies represented Sunday, the California Department of 
Forestry took top team honors and won the right to represent the local region 
at the national competition in St. Louis in August. Each of its top three 
firefighters finished the course in under three minutes. Typically, Davis said, 
departments seek firefighters who can run the course in seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One competitor, a paramedic, suffered acute heat exhaustion and had to be 
given fluids intravenously after his heart rate began to rise and his blood 
pressure dropped nearly an hour after he finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, said Robert Olvera, an Orange County physician who 
assisted at the event, the signs of severe exhaustion and disorientation by the 
participants were normal for people who had just finished a few minutes of such 
intense physical exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they don't have any blood in their brains -- it's all in their 
muscles right now," he said. "This simulates a worst-case scenario for this 
type of physical demand, and it will normally take them about 15 to 20 minutes 
to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the best athletes in the lot appeared overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Jones, a lanky, 160-pound track and field competitor who is a reserve 
firefighter at the La Verne Fire Department, was well ahead of the day's record 
pace for virtually his entire run, as he dragged the rescue dummy just a few 
dozen yards from the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his legs gave out, and the 20-year-old toppled, stuck momentarily under 
the dummy. After a few false starts, he managed to right himself and drag the 
dummy across the finish line with one of the top times of the day. Even after 
finishing, Jones had a tough time even opening his eyes, and his fellow 
firefighters had to drag him to the first-aid tent for oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten feet away," he mumbled to himself after he had recovered a few minutes 
later. "At that point (when he fell), I just started feeling the pain. I kept 
thinking, 'This is a victim, keep him on his right side.' . . . I'll get it 
right next time." 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest heat of the day was turned in by James Drummond, 34, of the Los 
Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center fire department, who ran the course at two 
minutes and 28 seconds -- just 22 seconds short of the competition's all-time 
national record. 
</P>
<P>
 As Drummond finished, his colleagues marveled that he didn't appear to have 
broken a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put a little effort into it, would ya?" one yelled at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The main challenge in the event was "mental," Drummond said. "My buddies were 
high-fiving me (as he ran in the middle of the course), and that kind of pumped 
me up." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing missing from the event besides actual flames were more 
than a few female competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Perry, a 29-year-old Los Angeles City firefighter who finished the 
course in about four minutes, said the event drove home the point that 
firefighting is still largely dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
 "That'll take a long time to change," she said. "But it's nice to see that at 
least there are a few women who feel comfortable enough with the shape they're 
in to turn out."

L.A. FISCAL WOES THREATEN LOCAL HIGHWAY PLANS; TRANSPORTATION: THE $1.1-BILLION 
EASTERN TOLLWAY AND THE PROPOSED PARKING GARAGE-TRANSIT CENTER NEAR DISNEYLAND 
ARE AMONG THE PROJECTS JEOPARDIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Revenue shortfalls and cost overruns on transportation projects in Los Angeles 
County are jeopardizing Orange County highway projects, including the planned 
$1.1-billion Eastern tollway and the combined parking garage-transit center 
planned near Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "To think that Orange County projects could be put at risk due to a downturn 
in revenues in Los Angeles, that's amazing," fumed Stan Oftelie, chief 
executive officer of the Orange County Transportation Authority. "It's all due 
to events that we have no control over." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arises because Orange and Los Angeles counties are partners in the 
same regional transportation and clean-air pacts. To offset the increased 
automotive emissions that could come from cars using new highways, each county 
makes a commitment to undertake a number of mass-transit or car-pool projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority comes up 
short of funds, as it has this year, and cannot fulfill its commitments under 
plans to improve air quality, new highway projects throughout the region come 
under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, transportation officials at the six-county Southern California 
Assn. of Governments and the U.S. Department of Transportation are poised to 
delay or kill several highway projects -- including those in counties that have 
no influence over Los Angeles' budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a combination of things," said Sarah Siwek, a manager at the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "It's reduced revenues. In our original 
30-year plan, there were revenue projections that were (overly) optimistic. . . 
. And some projects have cost more than we anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MTA currently faces a $126-million shortfall in operating funds, plus cost 
overruns of more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 An OCTA staff report outlining the threat to Orange County's highway program 
will be discussed today by OCTA's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The report lists projects at risk, including all toll roads not already under 
construction, the addition of lanes to the Costa Mesa Freeway north of the 
Garden Grove Freeway, the remodeling of the interchange between the San Diego 
and Corona del Mar freeways, the proposed elevated toll road that would extend 
the Orange Freeway from the Garden Grove Freeway down the Santa Ana River to 
Costa Mesa, the proposed auto garage and transit center across the street from 
Disney's proposed Westcot expansion project, and several so-called 
"smart-street" efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional planners have assured OCTA there is sufficient evidence that the 
region's highway improvements will not create "excess" emissions and that 
previously adopted transportation control measures are being implemented "in a 
timely manner," the OCTA report states. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the report adds, "the wild card this year is the weak financial condition 
of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. . . . The 
agency must demonstrate . . . that it has the financial resources" to pay for 
several new rail and car-pool projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA must submit a letter by April that commits the agency to steps to fund 
the necessary projects through a combination of cost savings elsewhere and new 
revenues. It is likely that the cost savings would have to come from reduced 
bus service and that the new revenue would be from increased bus fares, OCTA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning 
body, is expected to decide whether the regional projects are in conformity 
with deadlines established in the clean-air pact. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ortner, OCTA's manager of air-quality programs, said: "There's no room 
for maneuvering on this one. They've really tightened up the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a temporary solution is found, Ortner said, "they're only going to 
push the day of reckoning back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a related problem: The Mojave Desert Air Quality Management 
District failed to meet a deadline for submitting a plan to reduce carbon 
monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that have to do with Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the desert area is included administratively in the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. Without the desert basin's carbon monoxide 
document in hand, regional planners are forced to conclude that its 
transportation improvement program does not conform to federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials said they will work with other agencies in the region to try to 
resolve both the carbon monoxide issue and the threat posed by the MTA's 
financial crisis, which has been worsened by earthquake repair bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, said OCTA's Ortner, failure to proceed with projects in both Los 
Angeles and Orange County will result in more congestion and a net increase in 
smog.

BUILDING COLLAPSE PUTS OWNER IN SPOTLIGHT; QUAKE: NORTHRIDGE COMPLEX WHERE 16 
DIED IS PART OF A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE BUILT BY AN INDIAN IMMIGRANT. SOME SEE HIM 
AS ROLE MODEL, BUT HE HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF SEVERAL LAWSUITS ON HIS 
PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 25 years since he immigrated from India, Shashikant Jogani quietly 
built a real estate empire, borrowing to buy apartment buildings no one else 
wanted, fixing them up, then leveraging them to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a rich man, and one of Los Angeles' largest residential landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 But 30 seconds of shaking on Jan. 17 brought one of Jogani's jewels -- the 
three-story, 164-unit Northridge Meadows apartment building -- groaning to the 
ground as the first floor collapsed, killing 16 tenants. The Reseda Boulevard 
complex, the scene of the highest concentration of quake fatalities, came to 
symbolize the temblor's deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy has thrust Jogani, a savvy businessman with a passion for privacy, 
into the spotlight. The picture that emerges from interviews with associates 
and clients and from public records is one of paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 He is respected as an example of American entrepreneurial success, but 
acknowledges serious financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has forced the evacuation of hundreds of the apartments he controls, 
amounting to 15% of his holdings. Four years ago, his wealth was estimated at 
$375 million; last week, Jogani issued a statement to The Times asserting that 
aside from the estimated $9 million loss at Northridge Meadows, the continuing 
recession has meant that "equities in my other properties have vanished." 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani is considered a role model in the Southland's closely knit 3,000-member 
community of Jains, an Indian religious sect that teaches asceticism, 
nonviolence and vegetarianism. Yet at least one tenant, a creditor and the city 
of Los Angeles filed lawsuits against Jogani, asking the courts to force him to 
better maintain his residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has earned a reputation as a shrewd and skillful negotiator, some 
say Jogani will never distinguish himself as a great communicator. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, survivors attacked their landlord as distant and aloof from 
their misery.  
</P>
<P>
 But an aide insisted that Jogani donned a hard hat and personally helped 
tenants salvage belongings, and offered generous terms at his other apartment 
complexes for those left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how great my loss," Jogani said in a prepared statement, "it does 
not compare to the loss of those who died in the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani learned about the collapse of Northridge Meadows while listening to his 
battery-powered radio after being jolted awake in his Glendale home. The news 
pitched him into "shock and grief," according to the Jogani statement.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he offered tenants discounted lodging at another apartment building in 
Van Nuys, but that only five families accepted. He said he promptly returned 
security deposits and refunded prorated rents. He hired engineers to make sure 
it was safe to re-enter Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know him say Jogani, 47, never has been comfortable in the 
spotlight. In fact, drawing attention to oneself goes against the teachings of 
Jainism. The sect's name is derived from the words for conquering the body, or 
material self. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he drives a 1987 Cadillac, Jogani is the Jains' most obvious example 
of an American success story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a pioneer in the Indian community," said Dr. Krishna Reddy, 
president of the Federation of Indo-American Associations .  
</P>
<P>
 Born near Bombay, Jogani came to California in 1969 to study chemical 
engineering at USC. As a young man, Jogani and other Jains lived on Berendo 
Street in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he owns a 38-unit apartment building worth $1.5 million on that street. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while after graduating from USC, Jogani sold beads and worked as a hotel 
bellhop, then started a jewel business called Gemlust. He still runs several 
jewelry companies from his Hill Street offices in the Los Angeles jewelry 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamonds gave him seed money. He comes from an old family, which with other 
Jain families has been heavily involved in the uncut diamond trade for a 
century. But real estate was Jogani's path to fortune.  
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, he attended a few seminars, read some how-to books and 
started buying apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "California real estate is where the real money is," Jogani said in an 
interview three years ago. "Most of the big millionaires in America made their 
money in real estate. I take my clue from that." 
</P>
<P>
 He bought his first apartment building in 1979, a small Glendale complex he 
purchased for about $500,000. By 1990, a profile in the business magazine 
Forbes estimated the value of Jogani's holdings at $375 million -- but noted 
they were encumbered by $280 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 He is worth "much less" now, said Jogani's attorney, Steven E. Glass, because 
Jogani and other landlords have been pummeled by falling property values and 
escalating vacancy rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that Jogani and his wife, Renuka, own more than two 
dozen Valley apartment complexes, located in working class neighborhoods in Van 
Nuys, North Hollywood, San Fernando, Sylmar, Northridge and Canoga Park. He 
also owns properties in Hollywood, as well as more than two dozen properties in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows was a good example of how Jogani built his fortune. He 
bought the complex, then nearly 10 years old, from builder Brian Heller in 
1981, paying about $3.5 million. Property records show the complex was in 
"fair" condition and Jogani took out a $500,000 conventional loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, he restructured his financing for the building. Jogani, 
acting as an individual, sold the property to S J Properties No. 4, one of his 
holding companies. The building was assessed at $6.8 million, nearly twice what 
it was worth 10 years earlier, and he took out a $1.2-million mortgage from 
First Nationwide Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Jogani's holdings have been more controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Two apartment buildings on Blythe Street in Van Nuys allegedly were notorious 
drug-dealing havens in 1988, when the city attorney's office filed a nuisance 
abatement lawsuit against the Joganis. The city sought to close down the 
apartments for a year, but the case was resolved when the Joganis agreed to 
install lighting, erect a chain-link fence, remove graffiti and hire security 
guards to patrol the grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that Jogani has been named as a defendant in scores of 
other lawsuits over the last decade. Many of the cases could be classified as 
routine stumble-and-fall litigation. One pending suit, scheduled for a hearing 
this week, accuses Jogani of tolerating slum-like conditions in a North 
Hollywood complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In another lawsuit, a creditor sought a court order forcing Jogani to maintain 
a 46-unit apartment building at 8634 Columbus Ave., in North Hills, which the 
lender alleged was deteriorating while Jogani was defaulting on his loan 
payments. The building was yellow-tagged after the earthquake, with repairs 
estimated at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Jogani was accused in a lawsuit by the NAACP's Legal Defense & 
Education Fund of discriminating against prospective African American tenants 
by charging them higher rents and security deposits and limiting their numbers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani would not discuss details of his financial situation, nor would several 
banks that hold large Jogani mortgages on Northridge Meadows and other 
condemned or damaged Jogani properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani, who declined repeated requests for an interview, said in the prepared 
statement that the Northridge earthquake "has been devastating to me personally 
and financially." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows is a "total loss" and "must be demolished and the land 
cleared as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers who studied the building shortly after the collapse noted an absence 
of plywood in the walls. The material would have stiffened the structure and 
enhanced its ability to withstand the quake. The building met code requirements 
in effect when it was completed in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani said he, like most apartment building owners, has no earthquake 
insurance. The premiums are too expensive and the deductible too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordhan Patel, vice president of the Federation of Indo-American Associations 
and a longtime Jogani friend, said Jogani was deeply depressed by the deaths at 
Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of human life is totally unacceptable to the Jain belief," Patel 
said. "Any living organism, you do not harm it. You do not even kill a fly. . . 
. I am sure it has crossed his mind, 'Why my building?' "

 The Santa Ana Unified School District will hold the rescheduled meeting on the 
proposed space-saver school at Bristol Marketplace on Wednesday . 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held 7 p.m. at City Hall in the City Council chambers.The 
board is expected to decide whether to approve the $43-million project at the 
meeting, said district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 people attended a public hearing on Feb. 1 concerning the 
proposed school, but the board postponed its decision to seek more information 
on property appraisals and potential alternative sites. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board voted 3 to 2 to seek two additional appraisals of the 
proposed site. The district previously received a single appraisal of the site 
in accordance with state procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Sal Mendoza, Tom Chaffee and Rosemarie Avila voted to spend $50,000 
for the new appraisals, calling it a prudent business expense to be certain of 
the price of the property to be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Robert W. Balen and Audrey Yamagata-Noji voted against the motion, 
saying it was too expensive and unnecessary. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; SEWER SERVICES MAY PASS TO CITY CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider whether the city should take over sewer 
services from the Los Alamitos Water District for households within city 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district, formed in 1952, eight years before Los Alamitos was 
incorporated, provides sewage collection services to about 8,000 households in 
Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and portions of Seal Beach and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have recently proposed that the city take over the sewer services to 
cut cost and improve services, although water district officials have 
maintained that rates would probably go up if another agency assumes its role. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pay about $1 a month for the service, according to Jack Rosenthal, 
the president of the five-member board that runs the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a report that the council will consider today, City Manager Robert C. 
Dunek said that the water district "did not appear to have adequate revenue 
sources to maintain and rehabilitate the sewer system in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the water district's expenses have exceeded income, and the 
reserves have dipped to less than $1 million for the past four fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said that it might be prudent for the city to explore the possibility of 
taking over sewer services, probably in coordination with the other cities that 
the water district currently serves. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident, Carolyn T. Sylvia, wife of Councilman Charles E. Sylvia, suggested 
last month that the water district be dissolved and for Los Alamitos to take 
over sewer services. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Dunek also said that a 1982 Grand Jury Report on Special 
Districts in Orange County has identified the Los Alamitos Water District as 
one of those that may be considered for consolidation with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Jury report said that cities are in a position to reduce sewer 
services because of their manpower and ability to provide other municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Los Alamitos and the Rossmoor Community Services District conducted a 
financial study to determine if either or both agencies could take over the 
sewer services, Dunek said. The study concluded that a comprehensive financial 
plan was needed to assess the future cost of the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of more pressing matters, the plan was shelved, until Sylvia 
brought it up at a council meeting last month. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The regional water district is offering free classes in Garden Grove on Feb. 
22 to teach landscape workers and gardeners about water conservation 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is sponsoring the 
three-hour courses, which will be offered in English and Spanish.The classes 
will be led by staff from the Irrigation Technology Research Center at Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes will include a one-hour discussion of the relationships of soil, 
plants and water. Instructors also will offer solutions to common landscape 
irrigation problems, and offer a sample outdoor sprinkler layout to maximize 
water efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District imports water from the Colorado River and 
Northern California and routes it to 27 public agencies. The district provides 
60% of the water used by nearly 16 million people in Orange, Los Angeles and 
surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The English class begins at 9 a.m. and the Spanish class starts at 1 p.m. Both 
classes will be at the Garden Grove Community Center, 11300 Stanford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-registration is required, and all students will be given a certificate of 
completion at the end of class. The classes are part of an outreach program 
that will teach about 30 of the courses through 13 public water agencies 
throughout March. 
</P>
<P>
 To register or get more information, call the Municipal Water District of 
Orange County at (714) 963-3058 or the Metropolitan Water District at (213)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; HER TREE SIGNS GET TO HEART OF THE MATTER

 Happy Valentine's Day! Save Laguna Canyon Road! 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message local environmentalist Beth Leeds wanted to impart to 
motorists driving on Laguna Canyon Road on Sunday when she pinned red foil 
paper hearts on about 150 trees lining the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a heart-type person," said Leeds, 52, resting against a tree during 
a break. "I have a lot of love for Laguna Canyon Road and I want to do my part 
to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, Leeds has pinned hearts in January or February on the 
trees to protest the planned San Joaquin Hills toll road which, she said, will 
destroy the area's natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-billion San Joaquin Hills toll road, due to open in 1996, would be a 17 
1/2-mile extension of the Corona del Mar Freeway connecting San Juan Capistrano 
to John Wayne Airport and traversing Laguna Canyon Road at the Sycamore Hills 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developers say that it's necessary to move and widen Laguna Canyon Road," 
Leeds said. "I say they're wrong and that if the road is widened, the area will 
be blighted because nature will have been destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to appreciate the beauty of Laguna Canyon even if there are some who 
don't," she said. Referring to the October fires that scorched much of the area 
and Laguna Beach, Leeds continued, "The fires didn't destroy the hills but the 
bulldozers will, and we have to do everything possible to prevent that." 
</P>
<P>
 So, she and two friends started out at 11 a.m. to pin on the trees shiny red 
hearts Leeds said she hopes will appeal to others to join the fight to save the 
road. LILY DIZON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SCHOOLS MAY ADOPT BICYCLE HELMET RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cypress School District is considering adopting a policy requiring 
students to wear bicycle helmets while riding to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed policy, principals would be required to make sure their 
students know they must wear helmets, and teachers would be required to teach 
about bicycle safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they expect to pass the policy unanimously at their meeting 
on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Lohrman, principal of Arnold Elementary School, said she supports 
the policy. She told board members last week that a fourth-grade student 
wearing a helmet escaped major head injuries when his bicycle collided with a 
car in the rain outside school on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works," Lohrman said. "Every kid should have a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent groups are working with administrators to develop scholarship programs 
to provide helmets for children who cannot afford them, district officials 
said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; TRUSTEES TO DRAFT SCHOOL CHOICE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a statewide mandate, trustees of the Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District have directed district staff to formulate a policy allowing 
parents to choose the schools their children will attend in the 1994-95 year. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy will permit parents, within certain restrictions, to pick schools 
each year based on the teachers, programs or facilities they think are best 
suited for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In this first year, district officials told trustees at their Tuesday meeting, 
the change could result in significant enrollment shifts among schools. 
Although officials said they expect the vast majority of parents to select 
their neighborhood schools, they said they have no way yet of predicting which 
schools will be more popular than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take almost a market-based approach," said Trustee Frank L. Ury. 
"Open it up to parents and see where they fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said the district should provide parents detailed information on how 
the open enrollment program will work and what each school has to offer. They 
suggested a variety of forums for providing the information, including 
parent-teacher association meetings, school tours, pamphlets, information 
nights or a fair where schools would set up booths to market their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has to make every effort that we can to inform the community of 
what we are doing and what the available programs are," said President Dore J. 
Gilbert. Under a state law passed last year, the district is required to have a 
policy in place by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft of that policy presented by district officials Tuesday would give 
children residing within a school's designated attendance boundaries first 
choice at attending that school. Parents would be allowed to send their 
children to schools outside their attendance boundaries only if space was 
available at those schools, according to the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are preparing criteria to determine which students will be 
given priority if demand for a school exceeds available space. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will require parents to provide transportation to schools other 
than their neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a schedule presented Tuesday, trustees will review the policy at 
their next meeting on March 8 and adopt it March 22. Parents would then be 
notified and provided with information through materials, events and meetings 
in early April, and would be required to submit registration requests by April 
22. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PLAN WOULD BAN DOGS AT SMALL PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking what could be considered a nervy step in a city where dogs rate their 
own "bark park," the City Council will discuss Tuesday the possibility of 
banning dogs from small parks and children's play areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda item, put forth by Mayor Ann Christoph and co-signed by 
Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn, calls for "endorsing the concept of additional 
regulations on dogs in city parks to protect the general public and small 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 It is already illegal to have dogs off leash anywhere in the city except at 
the dog park, a fenced grassy strip alongside Laguna Canyon Road. Laguna Beach 
is the only city in Orange County with a park for dogs only. The new measure 
would force dogs out of some parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dog park has been extremely popular, some residents have 
continued to allow their dogs off leash elsewhere. The city has reacted by 
cracking down on leash law violators, doubling the fine for such offenses and 
stepping up enforcement by animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate on further restrictions is being prompted, Christoph said, by the 
special problems dogs create in small parks and in children's play areas. At a 
recent picnic at the small South Laguna Village Green Park, Christoph said at 
least three people brought leashed dogs "to do their thing while we were eating 
lunch" and as young children played in the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs are urinating on the grass where the kids are rolling around," she 
said. "My impression is the dogs are not recreating. They're brought there to 
relieve themselves. And when they're such small parks, it really has an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 A small park would be one with less than half an acre of land, she said. 
Children's play areas, which usually include sandboxes and play equipment, are 
often located within larger parks, such as at Main Beach, Alta Laguna and 
Moulton Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council were to favor additional restrictions on dogs, the item would 
be referred to the city's recreation committee and to the city staff for a 
report on how to implement such controls. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SCHOLARSHIP CREATED IN NAME OF STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of Robb Nimmo, a well-known Saddleback College drama student who 
performed in numerous campus productions before dying of AIDS in 1986, has 
established a perpetual scholarship at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimmo's mother, sister and brother contributed $40,000 for the scholarship, 
which will be given annually to one or more students pursuing a fine-arts 
degree.The amount of the scholarship will be determined by how much interest 
income the $40,000 generates from investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimmo died at the age of 26. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Saddleback in 1977 after graduating from Mission Viejo High 
School and studied under drama instructors Lynn Wells and the late Wynn Pearce. 
He played many roles in the college's theater productions, including Peter 
Quilpe in T.S. Eliot's "The Cocktail Party" -- the first play staged in 
Saddleback's fine-arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robb was one of the most talented students we've ever had here at Saddleback 
College," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning his bachelor's degree in fine arts from New York University in 
1985, Nimmo returned to Saddleback to play Orsino in "Twelfth Night, or What 
You Will," directed by Wells. At the time, he was waging a battle against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship in his name was presented to the college by his mother, Bertha 
Marie Nimmo of Laguna Hills; his sister, Heidi Nimmo of San Bernardino; and his 
brother, John Nimmo of Mountain View. They said they established the 
scholarship to help fine-arts students continue their education and to carry on 
Robb Nimmo's name at the college he most enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always thought of (Saddleback) as his home," Heidi Nimmo said. "He felt 
very good about being on this campus." RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; ANTI-VENDING LAW TO GET FINAL CITY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ordinance prohibiting pushcart and sidewalk vendors from selling 
merchandise including food, flowers, clothing, magazines and balloons on the 
city's streets has been given preliminary approval by the City Council and is 
expected to receive final approval this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance would take effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the move to enact the anti-pushcart and sidewalk vending 
law was prompted by residents' complaints about the vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These vendors are bused in here (from other cities), they urinate and 
defecate on our streets and most of them are (undocumented workers) who have no 
business to be here to begin with," said Zona Neighbors, a resident who urged 
the council to pass the ordinance. "I saw one of them defecating in a dumpster 
in an alley." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she feared that the vendors, especially those selling food, did not 
meet health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city issues business licenses to street vendors at a cost of 
$200 a year or $100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new ordinance, people who sell anything on La Habra's streets or 
other public property and those who employ people to do so could face 
imprisonment and have their pushcarts confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no public hearing on the matter and none planned, Mayor David M. 
Cheverton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, City Manager Lee Risner and Police Chief Steven 
Stavely said the most common complaint of vendors from residents is "the 
unsightly appearance of carts and apparent failure to meet health and safety 
code requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 The report further states that allowing "human-powered" or "non-motorized" 
street vending "is counterproductive to the welfare, safety and good order of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen other cities throughout Orange County, including Anaheim and Brea, 
prohibit pushcart vending, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, urban affairs director for the state League of United Latin 
American Citizens, called the ordinance "another typical racial baiting by 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it's people of color (doing street vending), they don't want us in 
the streets unless it's in the gutter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Risner, however, said the ordinance has no "bearing at all on ethnicity. We 
cannot tolerate" racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Carlos Quinonez, coordinator of the Anaheim Street Vendors Assn., said 
pushcart vending is "an honest way of making a living. My heart goes out to 
pushcart and flower vendors . . . If they're doing things decently and in 
order, why should anybody try to cut off their livelihood?" MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL CANDIDATES REPORT CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four City Council candidates have raised more than $10,000 for their 
campaigns, statements filed recently with the city clerk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Ericson, who is president of the largest city employee union and an 
office supervisor in the Parks and Recreation Department, reported raising 
$38,095 for her campaign treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Lopez, an Anaheim police officer and a member of the Anaheim City School 
District and Anaheim Union High School District boards of education, reported 
$15,143. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Zemel, a mortgage broker who has run twice before for the council, has 
raised $32,024. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Olesen, a computer hardware salesman who ran in 1992, has raised 
$14,610, his statement shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates who filed reports are: Leonard Lahtinen, a high school 
teacher and a member of the North Orange County Community College District 
board, who reported $6,420; and Paul Bostwick, the president of a mobile home 
supply company and a 1988 candidate, who has loaned himself $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements reflect money raised in 1993 and details of all contributions 
between July 1 and Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are seeking at least two and possibly three seats in November's 
council election. The seats of Councilmen Irv Pickler, Fred Hunter and Bob D. 
Simpson will be open. Pickler and Hunter are prohibited by term limits from 
seeking reelection. Simpson has said he will not run again for the council but 
may oppose Mayor Tom Daly in the mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daly were to lose the mayoral race, he would still have two years left in a 
council term he won in 1992, and that would eliminate one of the open seats. If 
he is reelected mayor, all three seats would be available. Anaheim has had five 
City Council members, with one elected by the voters to be mayor. But beginning 
this year, the mayor will be elected from among city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ericson's largest benefactor thus far is her husband, Robert D. Ericson, a Los 
Angeles County firefighter, who has loaned her campaign $20,000. Her largest 
contribution was from Hunter, who gave her $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez has received $1,750 each from business partners Frank Elfend, a 
developer consultant, and Carmen Morinello, an attorney, who frequently

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; HE HOPES TO FEATHER NEST WITH OSTRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peering over a fence next to a busy Fullerton street, an eight-foot ostrich 
waved his shiny black wings, and stuck out his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to show me how big he is," said 32-year-old Dennis Campbell, 
owner of Orange County's only ostrich farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a common sight in Southern California when ostrich feathers were in high 
demand for lady's hats last century, the birds are now a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 But entrepreneurs like Campbell and his partner Alex Wilson are hoping to 
change all that. Campbell envisions a booming business in ostrich meat, 
feathers, hide and eggs in California and plans to sell the young from his 
five-ostrich farm to others who want to get into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a fad like pot-bellied pigs or llamas," Campbell said. "There's an 
established by-product market for the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 While most people have heard of ostrich-hide boots, belts and purses, and the 
bird's enormous eggs, few know that ostrich feathers make excellent dusters 
used by the auto and computer industry to cut down on dust in sensitive 
assembly areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And ostrich steaks might eventually become a popular alternative to beef, 
Campbell said, pointing to a block of frozen bird meat in his freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 The red meat has the nutritional value of chicken and "tastes like filet 
mignon," he said. It now sells for $30 per pound, but ostrich farmers hope that 
with widespread production, the price will eventually drop to $2 or $3 a pound, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage, though, farmers are concentrating on increasing the "herd" to 
generate a large enough population for a slaughter market. When the ostrich 
population reaches half a million nationwide, farmers can start killing their 
birds and selling the parts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and his partner started researching ostrich farming last year and 
decided to join the ranks of the estimated 200 ostrich ranchers in California. 
The two raised $60,000 from investors nationwide to buy six birds and start a 
breeding farm, which is actually a quarter-acre pen beside Campbell's house on 
Hermosa Drive. The ostriches have been at the property since November, he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The lifelong Orange County resident expects to raise 40 to 50 chicks this 
year. Female ostriches can continue to produce eggs for 30 to 40 years in 
captivity and live as long as 70 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the financial security he hopes the birds will bring his family, 
Campbell says the birds are fun and he welcomes visits from schoolchildren and 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stood beside the muddied ostrich corral, a 150-pound brown-feathered 
female sauntered over to the fence to say hello. Her spindly, matted neck felt 
like a warm carpet and her muscles bulged like ropes as she curved her bald 
head through the fence to peck at Campbell's hands.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear about ostriches you think of a gawky, ugly bird, but they're so 
interested and curious, and they want to see who you are . . . you really get 
attached to them," he said. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; LAW BEFORE CITY MAY IMPOUND STORE CARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on an ordinance declaring 
abandoned shopping carts a public nuisance. The measure authorizes the city to 
collect $25 for each one it impounds. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that numerous carts are abandoned on sidewalks and in 
streets every day throughout the city. While most grocery stores have a cart 
retrieval service, the ordinance is aimed at those that do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the grocery stores that are the problem so much as" drug stores and 
discount stores, city administrator Robert D'Amato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's current practice is to pick up abandoned carts and hold them at the 
city yard for pickup. Under the proposed ordinance, stores that contract with a 
retrieval service will be notified of a cart's locations, but carts from stores 
without the service will be picked up and impounded. The store must then pay a 
$25 fee to get the cart back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose isn't to make money," D'Amato said. "We prefer stores to monitor 
the carts themselves, but when they don't, the carts become a real liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will apply to all abandoned carts regardless of what city they 
come from. If approved the ordinance will take effect in 30 days. DANIELLE A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PARK RESIDENTS SUE OVER RENT INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The residents of the Bayside Village mobile home park filed a lawsuit last 
week against their leaseholder to force a rollback in the hefty rent increases 
that went into effect last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court on Feb. 7 and accuses 
DeAnza Assets Inc. of Beverly Hills, the park's leaseholder, of unfair business 
practices and asks the court for rent relief. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, DeAnza Assets began enforcing a park-wide rent increase of about 
20% -- although some of the 250 residents saw their rents go up 47% and some 
rents decreased about 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bought the place, we encouraged everybody not to pay the increase," 
said Bil Gekas, a resident who has rallied residents of the seniors-only park 
against the leaseholder. His rent went from $1,087 per month to $1,600 on the 
first of the year; he is now facing eviction. "The next step is the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is the latest move in a lengthy fight between residents of Bayside 
Village and DeAnza. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, DeAnza first announced the rent increases that are now the subject 
of the lawsuit. On Dec. 28, a coalition of residents then formed a corporation 
and purchased the park for $11 million from the Irvine Co. right out from under 
DeAnza, who also wished the purchase the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though residents now own the park, DeAnza still holds a lease that 
expires in about 15 years and, with it, the authority to set rental rates.  
</P>
<P>
 When some residents refused to pay the rent increase last month, DeAnza sent 
out notices of intent to evict. A series of meetings ensued where residents and 
DeAnza came to an agreement whereby residents would pay their full rents but 
under protest. Despite that, DeAnza has told Gekas that he will be the only 
rent-striking resident to be evicted, according to Gekas and DeAnza president 
Barry McCabe.  
</P>
<P>
 No court date has been set to hear the residents' complaints, Gekas said. BOB 
ELSTON

118 FREEWAY CONNECTOR REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley (118) Freeway connection to the San Diego (405) and Foothill 
(210) freeways, which was closed after the Northridge earthquake, was reopened 
Sunday, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most of the transition roads linking the three freeways were 
opened Sunday, meaning that commuters will now be able to switch from freeway 
to freeway without taking as many surface streets, a Caltrans spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 118 Freeway west of the 405 is still closed in both directions, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A section of the Golden State Freeway between Lyons Avenue in Newhall and 
Roxford Street in Sylmar will be closed overnight and Tuesday for quake-related 
repairs, from 11:30 p.m. until 5 a.m.

CURBSIDE L.A.: HISTORIC ADOBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These names are all signposts of Los Angeles' history, most closely associated 
today with a school, city, street or shopping center. But for a trip into Los 
Angeles' past, here are several adobe structures that still exist: 
</P>
<P>
 1. MICHAEL WHITE ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 2701 Huntington Drive, San Marino 
</P>
<P>
 In 1845, an English seaman named Michael White built his adobe house on a 
parcel of land he called Rancho Ysidro. The old adobe stands in the middle of 
the campus of San Marino High School. The San Marino Historical Society can 
arrange tours. (818) 568-0119 
</P>
<P>
 2. EL MOLINO VIEJO 
</P>
<P>
 * 1120 Old Mill Road, San Marino 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a mission mill, it became the home of James S. Waite, editor of Los 
Angeles' first English-language newspaper, the Star, in 1850. It is the home of 
the Southern California Historical Society. Open to the public. (818) 449-5450 
</P>
<P>
 3. ORTEGA-VIGARE ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 616 S. Ramona St., San Gabriel 
</P>
<P>
 This adobe was built by Don Juan Vigare, a soldier of the mission guard, 
between 1792 and 1805. In the 1860s the house was used as San Gabriel's first 
bakery. Vigare's great-granddaughter lived here until the 1930s. Today, it is a 
private residence and not open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 4. RANCHO LAS TUNAS 
</P>
<P>
 * 315 Orange St., San Gabriel 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1776, the same year as the San Gabriel Mission church, it housed the 
padres who supervised the Indians constructing the mission. It is a private 
residence and not open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 5. LA CASA PRIMERA 
</P>
<P>
 * 1569 N. Park Ave., Pomona  
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1837 by Ygnacio Palomares, a cattle rancher, this five-room adobe is 
the oldest home in the Pomona Valley. It is the home of the Historical Society 
of Pomona Valley. A short distance away stands a second home known as El Adobe 
de Palomares. Open to the public. (909) 623-2198 
</P>
<P>
 6. RANCHO LA PUENTE 
</P>
<P>
 * 15415 E. Don Julian Road, City of Industry 
</P>
<P>
 Two adobes stand here, the first built in 1842 by William Workman, co-founder 
of the first banking house in Los Angeles. In 1876, the bank's failure 
bankrupted Workman, who shot and killed himself in his office in this building. 
Workman's half of the original 48,470-acre Rancho La Puente (Ranch of the 
Bridge) was reduced to 75 acres because of his financial calamities. In 1920, 
Workman's grandson, Walter Temple, built a more modern adobe nearby. Today, the 
Homestead Museum offers free tours of both homes and the family cemetery. (818) 
968-8492 
</P>
<P>
 7. SANCHEZ ADOBE MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
 * 946 N. Adobe Ave., Montebello 
</P>
<P>
 Dona Casilda Soto de Lobo built the little place on the banks of the Rio Hondo 
in 1845 to fulfill a condition of ownership of the 2,363-acre Rancho la Merced. 
But the adobe house carries the name and legends of Juan Matias Sanchez, who 
took over the property seven years later. He lived rich and died poor, and in 
the end his family lost the house. Open to the public. (213) 887-4592 
</P>
<P>
 8. RANCHO LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
 * 6400 Bixby Hill Road, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built in the early 1800s by retired soldier Juan Jose Nieto, it was 
renovated in 1842 by Abel Stearns as a home for his 15-year-old bride, Arcadia 
Bandini. Later the Bixby family bought the 26,000-acre Ranch of the Little 
Cottonwoods and lived here from 1881 to 1968 . Open to the public. (310) 
431-3541 
</P>
<P>
 9. RANCHO LOS CERRITOS 
</P>
<P>
 * 4600 Virginia Road, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Temple built this adobe and redwood house in 1843 on a bluff 
overlooking the Los Angeles River. Besides a museum, it houses a research 
library of California history. Open to the public. (310) 424-9423 
</P>
<P>
 10. DOMINGUEZ ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 18127 S. Alameda St., Compton 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen cities were carved out of Rancho San Pedro, the 76,000-acre 
grant given to Juan Jose Dominguez in 1784 by the Spanish crown. His 
grandnephew, Don Manuel, inherited the ranch and began building the U-shaped, 
one-story adobe in 1825. Don Manuel and his bride, Maria Engracia Cota, lived 
here for 55 years and raised 10 children, six of whom survived to inherit more 
than 40,000 acres. Open to the public. (213) 631-5981 
</P>
<P>
 11. VICENTE LUGO ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 6360 E. Gage Ave., Bell Gardens 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 200 years, this was the heart of the vast 29,413-acre Rancho San 
Antonio, and home of Don Antonio Maria Lugo, a Spanish cavalier, his heir, Don 
Vicente Lugo, and later Henry T. Gage, a former California governor who got the 
home as part of his wife's dowry. Open to the public. (310) 927-1235 
</P>
<P>
 12. GILMORE ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 6301 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Shrouded by vegetation in the middle of Farmers Market sits a 166-year-old 
adobe house. It was once the residence of Antonio Jose Rocha II on part of the 
Rancho Rincon de Los Bueyes. In 1880, Arthur F. Gilmore bought the property. 
His son, Earl Gilmore, founded Farmers Market. In 1976, the A.F. Gilmore Co. 
turned the adobe into its private offices. Not open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 13. AVILA ADOBE 
</P>
<P>
 * 10 Olvera St., Los Angeles  
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1818 by Francisco Avila, once mayor of the city, this 176-year-old 
adobe -- the oldest in the Los Angeles city limits -- was occupied in the 1930s 
by the indomitable Christine Sterling, the "Mother of Olvera Street." Open to 
the public (213) 625-5045

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY TO DISCUSS TRASH DISTRICT TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will meet today to discuss a takeover of the Costa Mesa 
Sanitary District, the independent government agency in charge of residential 
trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district's board of directors sets trash rates without consulting 
the council. Founded 50 years ago, the district includes all of Costa Mesa and 
parts of Newport Beach and unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she is concerned about the council's lack of 
control over trash collection. She noted that state laws now call for cities to 
increase levels of recycling, "which leaves us with the responsibility and the 
penalties, if there are any, but no authority to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wahner, who heads the board of directors and has been a member for 15 
years, said he and other board members see no need for the city to control 
trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at it," Wahner said. "We don't really feel that it warrants any 
change. We are run by a very (financially) conservative group of people. We all 
feel strongly that we're looking out for the public the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahner said the district consistently recycles more than the state-required 
25% rate. The district sends trash to a sorting facility in Stanton, where 
recyclables are separated out. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district was founded 10 years before the city was incorporated, 
and has an elected board of five directors. Genis said if the city took over 
the district, it would probably be run by the council or a committee. The 
sanitary district now operates out of City Hall, and employs some city 
personnel for clerical and other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the takeover at a 4 p.m. study session, and has 
invited the sanitary district directors. Wahner said he will not attend, but 
wants to have a joint meeting next week with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said any takeover would have to be approved by voters unless Wahner and 
other directors choose to dissolve the district. WILLSON CUMMER

FAMILY IDENTIFIES TEEN WHO FATALLY SHOT SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relatives of a 16-year-old boy who fatally shot himself in the head while 
playing with a gun identified the victim Sunday as Ismael Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the Santa Ana teen-ager was playing with the loaded handgun at his 
home on Bishop Street Saturday when he shot himself.Dominguez had been showing 
the weapon to a friend who apparently warned him against playing with it, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the friend, Javier Paramo, 20, of Santa Ana, left the room, he heard a 
gunshot and returned to find his friend with a fatal wound, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women who were in the house at the time of the shooting verified Paramo's 
story, police and Dominguez's relatives said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez's parents live in Mexico, police said, and he was staying with 
relatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Name: Carol Yates 
</P>
<P>
 Company: Frederick's of Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "I like getting out to all the stores in my district and seeing 
what is happening in each of them. Most of the customers are there to select 
something for a special occasion, and that makes for a fun day. Frederick's is 
a fun, happy environment, and we sell a fun product. I also like directing our 
employees and working to develop their professional skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "I spend a lot of time on the road between stores. For some 
people, that might be a drawback. But I have learned to use that time 
constructively. I listen to self-improvement tapes and keep up with the news 
and a little music." 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I would like to become a regional manager."

Q & A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Greg Johnson, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DONALD CHOU and MAUREEN TSU 
</P>
<P>
 Certified Financial Planners, Professional Financial Advisors Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Tsu and Donald Chou are certified financial planners with Professional 
Financial Advisors Inc. in San Juan Capistrano. They spoke with Times reporter 
Greg Johnson after the Federal Reserve Board increased a key interest rate, a 
move that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by nearly 100 points on 
Feb. 4. For the week ended Friday, the index recovered somewhat, gaining 23.36 
to close at 3,894.78. Despite jitters in the financial community, the advisers 
advocate that consumers not make big changes in money strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 What should investors have learned from the market drop? 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu: People have been willing to take the stock market plunge because they 
don't see the degree of risk and the possible losses. All some people have ever 
seen is the market going up. They've had good-paying jobs, and (housing prices) 
kept going up. Now, people have lost jobs, more people have had foreclosures on 
homes. The market drop means you should be aware of your investment timetable. 
If you've got a short timetable and the market takes a dip, then it's a 
problem. That's a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what are you advising that senior citizens do in the wake of Feb. 4? 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: In many cases, seniors have moved their assets out of certificates of 
deposit and savings accounts because of the low interest rates and have already 
gone into long-term bonds and utility stocks. But with all the talk of 
interest-rate changes, there's been more volatility. You can get a higher yield 
on a bond. But when rates go up, bond prices go down, so there's a Catch-22. 
We've advised some to go from longer bonds to (shorter) bonds. And we're 
advising people to factor in the true cost of last year's tax bill, which is 
effective April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How about regulatory changes that affect seniors? 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu: Social Security benefits will be taxed at higher amounts this year. And 
that makes income sources even more important -- what income they get and how 
they get it. There will be a higher tax rate, and more of your Social Security 
benefits will be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: That means you should not just focus on interest-rate increases. 
Instead, look at what kind of return after tax and after inflation you'll get. 
In the 1980s, some seniors were getting a 20% return on money markets, but 
after tax and inflation they had a limited return. They might not get as much 
in gross dollars now, but they might be netting a better amount. Also, price 
deflation in certain areas has helped. If they can refinance a mortgage, that's 
good. They can adjust their costs so they have better cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How about estate planning, which is always tough in a changing market? Did the 
interest rate hike and market reaction mean anything there? 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: The big concerns now aren't caused by changes in interest rates or 
inflation. Most people are looking at what Congress plans to change. In the 
last tax bill Congress took away the alternative minimum tax preference item 
for unrealized capital gains on property donated to charity. That changes 
estate planning. Congress is looking at the unified credit, which allows you to 
pass up to $600,000 to non-spouses and not have to worry about estate taxes. 
Some legislation has been introduced to reduce that to $250,000, but it's not 
gotten very far. So what's more significant in estate planning is what Congress 
is doing, . . . and it's often said that dead people don't have a very big 
lobby in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the increase in the Fed funds rate: So it's not too late to refinance 
debt like home mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: If you've not done your restructuring, while interest rates might be 
higher than three months ago, they're not anywhere near where they were for 
most of the past 20 years. Lots of people wanted to restructure a year or two 
ago but just didn't have the ability. What happened on Friday affects mainly 
short-term rates, so it's still a good time to refinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How about stock market investments? 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: There was a significant sell-off on Feb. 4, but it was really a small 
change, and the market is back up again. That means it was anticipated, that 
the market is going back where it should be. Remember that corporate earnings 
should show improvement in 1994, and there are money managers still out hunting 
for bargains, looking for value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What should people factor into their financial planning for the next year or 
two? 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu: People have to have more realistic expectations. Southern California got 
kind of spoiled in the 1980s. We got used to double-digit real estate gains, 
and the stock market did well. But our expectations have to be adjusted because 
we're not going to see those times again for a while. We will have good gains 
but more steady and slower, which is healthier in the long run for our economy. 
And people need to understand inflation. You can come out positive after taxes 
and inflation. That's what's important -- not just the numbers but what the 
numbers mean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Are financial planners generally changing strategies because of Feb. 4?  
</P>
<P>
 Chou: No. I'd be more inclined to say don't do anything rash as a result of 
what happened. I think the economy is in good shape -- we'll see slow but 
consistent growth. Interest rates and inflation are relatively stable, despite 
the 0.25% move-up on short-term rates. What you need to do if you're making 
capital investments or personal investments is make sure you're buying good 
values and holding for the long term. Try not to have your vision colored by 
this one event. I don't think we'll see interest rates escalate as we saw in 
the early 1980s. This (increase) was timed, it was planned, it was done in a 
very small way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On repercussions of the market's dive. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: "This is a transition time, so there's one key goal: Understand and 
identify your own unique goals, and don't just jump on the bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On whether the rate increase will affect lending to small businesses. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chou: "Banks won't change lending habits because of a slight hike in interest 
rates. This won't change anything of significance for small business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On whether Feb. 4 changed their guidelines. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu: "I don't see any major changes. When interest rates and inflation change, 
there are lots of new opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On buying real estate or a new home. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu: "Look at the long term, not just the next two or three years. People live 
in a home on an average of seven to 10 years."

THE DONALD MAY ONCE AGAIN HOLD TRUMP CARD; FINANCE: HIGH-FLYING '80S POSTER 
BOY, WHO LOOKED LIKE A GLOSSY DEADBEAT FOR AWHILE, SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING A 
FINANCIAL RESURRECTION. 
</P>

 Is The Donald back? 
</P>
<P>
 Picture this: Donald Trump, surrounded by well-wishers, plunges a knife into a 
large gray-frosted cake shaped like a hunk of Manhattan's elevated West Side 
Highway. The party last year celebrated city approval of his planned apartment 
complex near the relocated road. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward four months, to Gulfport, Miss., where Trump wants to build a 
casino. On a steamy July day, dignitaries jam a waterfront party to honor 
Trump, sipping iced tea, nibbling fried chicken and gazing, awed, at the 
developer. Moby Solangi, whose company plans to lease land to Trump, later 
recalled: "We've had the president of Honduras, and the president of Belize, 
and we got 300 or 400 people. When Trump came, we had 600 or 700." 
</P>
<P>
 Trump, the poster boy of the high-flying 1980s who looked like a glossy 
deadbeat a few years ago, behaves like he's enjoying a financial resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 He is regaining control of his three casinos after they underwent bankruptcy 
reorganization. He is snapping up Palm Beach real estate for a luxurious club. 
Within months, the man who brought you the Trump Tower probably will introduce 
another namesake: the Trump Stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business is doing so well. People perceive it as this great comeback," 
Trump, 47, said in an interview at his Trump Tower offices, decorated with 
pictures of Trump casinos and magazine covers of Trump. 
</P>
<P>
 A peek behind the curtain of Trump hyperbole suggests a different story. Two 
of his casinos lost money for much of last year, and they still carry enormous 
debt. Bankers and some bondholders have lost tens of millions of dollars in 
Trump's ventures. It's unclear whether Trump himself has enough money for a 
major new project, although he claims otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Trump deals on. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he do it? Strong financial markets, a recent improvement at his 
casinos, and Trump's own perseverance are some reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important may be the Trump name. Like J.P. Morgan or John D. 
Rockefeller, Trump has transformed his name into a symbol of success -- a myth 
that transcends the rockier reality. Even as his backers have experienced the 
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride of investing, Trump has maintained a mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a name that is really magic in the marketing world," said Richard 
Kahan, an urban development expert who agreed to support Trump's Manhattan 
apartment development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Trump's latest activities: 
</P>
<P>
 * He is expected to offer stock in his casinos over the next three to four 
months. Securities analysts say Trump may raise tens or even hundreds of 
millions -- though some estimate that the casinos aren't worth more than their 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Governments in Gulfport, Miss., and Gary, Ind., are supporting Trump's 
casino projects -- even though Trump said he won't use his cash. "It just would 
be foolish to do that," he said. "If you have a good project, the bondholders 
like Trump." 
</P>
<P>
 * Community groups are teaming with Trump to support his 5,700-apartment 
project in New York. Trump is planning a novel way to guarantee financing: ask 
Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump is proceeding even though he apparently didn't have enough money to pay 
New York taxes on the apartment property over the past year. He owes $6 million 
in taxes and $700,000 in interest dating to January, 1993, said city Finance 
Department spokesman Joe Dunn. Trump said he has reached a repayment accord. 
Dunn said there is no accord yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two years ago, Trump looked financially humiliated. His property empire 
built on borrowed money was devastated by the recession and the real estate 
market collapse. His Atlantic City casinos and elegant Plaza Hotel in New York 
all sought bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing enormous debts, Trump surrendered properties ranging from his Trump 
Shuttle airline to his yacht -- featuring a bedroom with a tortoise-shell 
ceiling and solid onyx shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, I had 15 incredible years, and then the world went into a 
depression, plus I probably wasn't working as hard or focusing as much as I was 
before, in all fairness," Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I now had to focus totally and exclusively on this. I did. And it 
just worked out great." 
</P>
<P>
 For him, maybe. But Trump admits his banks forgave some loans. While he won't 
say how much, the banks wrote off millions of dollars, judging from his 
financial documents. Banks may lose even more as they sell Trump properties 
they took in exchange for loans, one bank source said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump's creditors could have tried to seize his assets. Instead, they 
bargained, anxious to avoid years of costly litigation and the possible loss of 
the Trump name, which they felt drew gamblers to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump was forced to relinquish a half-interest in his casino-hotels and in the 
Plaza hotel to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, he reclaimed full control of two casinos and began 
negotiations on the third. With operating profits up, thanks partly to savvy 
new casino management, Trump was able to refinance. One casino, the Trump 
Plaza, actually assumed an extra $50 million in debt so Trump could pay some 
personal debts and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of a comeback may be premature. Trump's deals allow him to pay some 
of his interest in fresh Trump bonds. That may inflate his debt because of how 
the bonds are structured. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, $60 million of the debt on Trump's Plaza will triple by 2001 if 
he pays the interest with more bonds instead of cash, an analysis by New 
Jersey's Casino Control Commission shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether the bondholders ultimately receive that amount remains to be seen," 
said Randy Gaulke, a casino analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. With 
interest payments gobbling up would-be profits, two of Trump's casinos were in 
the red overall for the first nine months of 1993, the latest figures available 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The casinos showed improvement in the third quarter. But they're not flush 
enough so that Trump can withdraw enough to fund a new project, creditors and 
financial analysts say. Trump says it would depend on how big the project would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 While Trump waved a financial report during an interview, saying he had $139 
million in cash, he later said the sum included the approximately $127 million 
cash on hand at his casino companies -- which he can't remove. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his other ventures, Trump may still be shrinking. While he owns 51% of 
the Plaza Hotel, for example, the banks that loaned him money for the deal have 
taken the remaining 49% -- and the right to sell the hotel, bankruptcy court 
records and bank sources say. Trump declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump also was supposed to sell a number of New York condominiums and his 
half-interest in the Grand Hyatt hotel in Manhattan by the end of 1993, to 
repay lenders, said a New Jersey Casino Control Commission report last June. 
Trump says he has worked out a deal with his banks to keep some condos and his 
Hyatt stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he can plunge into new projects, Trump grew incensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hot on the bond market. The bondholders like Trump," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump indeed may find financing for his new projects, if investors eager for 
double-digit returns continue to pile into his junk bonds, the 
non-investment-grade IOUs that offer high yields in exchange for high risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street has a very short memory," said Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst 
with Roffman Miller Associates in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump also appears to believe a stock offering in his casinos will help him 
finance new projects. The casinos are groaning under $1.5 billion in debt, 
about equal to their value, securities analysts estimate. But Trump may offer 
two sweeteners: using the stock-sale proceeds to reduce the debt, and throwing 
in one or more new floating casino deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, his name helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "People certainly know who he is, they see him in the news, they read the 
books," said Jason Ader, a gaming analyst at Smith Barney Shearson. "There's 
certainly a market of retail investors who would like that opportunity" to buy 
Trump stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump estimates his companies still carry $3.5 billion in debt -- $115 million 
of it guaranteed by him personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump's deal partners appear unfazed by his financial past. 
</P>
<P>
 Local politicians in Gulfport believe a Trump casino will lure cruise ships. 
Officials in Gary are supporting Trump's efforts to get a license for a 
floating casino on Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess his name would probably be the biggest attraction," said Clark 
A. Metz, an assistant to Gary's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 With his Riverside South apartments in Manhattan, Trump gave hostile community 
groups broad power in designing the project. In exchange, they shepherded it 
through New York's zoning approval labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are seeking federal mortgage insurance to guarantee fresh bonds, 
said Kahan, who chairs the Riverside South Planning Corp., which oversees the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the $213-million mortgage on the property came due last June. A Los 
Angeles-based real estate firm, Colony Capital Inc., is negotiating to buy the 
mortgage, said sources close to the deal. Reportedly, the company is offering 
$80 million to $100 million. Trump declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump acknowledges that one of his secrets is sheer bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play to people's fantasies," he wrote in his book "The Art of the Deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very 
excited by those who do. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts."

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; NO MATTER THE RACE, MOES WIN; SKIING: 
HIS FAMILY BARELY ARRIVES IN TIME TO SEE THE U.S. DOWNHILLER'S GOLD-MEDAL RUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The race was on. It began Friday, on a mountain and in an airport. At opposite 
sides of the world. On snow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Norway, Tommy Moe licked his chops after an Olympic downhill training run 
here as he sized up Marc Girardelli, Kjetil Andre Aamodt and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alaska, father Tom and stepmother Tyra boarded a plane in Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 No way dad misses the gold-medal run. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Moe finished fourth in final downhill training and almost had to 
bite his lip to contain his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Mill, the former downhill racer turned network commentator, tried to goad 
Moe into predicting victory, a la American Bill Johnson in 1984 at Sarajevo. 
Moe was tempted, but he wouldn't bite. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moe knew. 
</P>
<P>
 He became only the third American male ever to win an Olympic gold medal in 
Alpine skiing on Sunday, defeating Aamodt by 0.04 seconds in the closest Alpine 
race in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight plan called for Tom and Tyra to make a leisurely connection through 
Kennedy airport in New York, then straight through to Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended up in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy checked his skis. Tom Sr. checked his pulse, then the departures. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of Sunday's downhill, as the Swiss took a few practice rings on 
their cowbells, Moe was almost melancholy. Someone caught him yawning. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe had never won a World Cup race. He was second once. What did he know? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Moe, in the meantime, was blowing fuses. There's only so much one Moe can 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight went Palmer to Dallas, Dallas to Copenhagen, Copenhagen to Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at 9:30 p.m. Saturday night, it went Oslo to Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Start to finish, it took 46 hours. Or was it finished? Not trusting anyone's 
transportation system, Tom Moe awoke at 5 a.m. to catch the first bus to 
Kvitfjell, usually about an hour's trip. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bus stop, he and 4,000 others waited. Tom and Tyra were crushed by the 
humanity, shut out of one bus after another. No taxis either. Or dog sleds. 
</P>
<P>
 Four and a half hours after his wake-up call -- 90 minutes before race time -- 
Tom and Tyra were still in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 9:30, I was screaming mad," Tom said. "I went into the (phone company 
office) and started screaming at them, anyone I could yell at, then went up and 
stormed past 4,000 people, they were all the way up into town." 
</P>
<P>
 In one final, exasperating moment, Tom grabbed Tyra and started elbowing a 
path through people to the bus door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to get there and that was it," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kvitfjell, Tommy Moe started to loosen up. He would be the eighth racer 
down the hill, a favorable starting position. He remained calm and collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working a lot on my mental preparation and I ski best when I'm 
relaxed," Moe said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus pulled into Kvitfjell a little after 10:30. Tom and Tyra, exhausted 
but relieved, rushed to the entrance gate. 
</P>
<P>
 What could happen now? 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get our tickets," Tom said. "You'd think they ought to take care 
of some of the parents who helped the kids here." 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes before Luxembourg's Girardelli left the downhill starting gate, 
Tom and Tyra got their tickets and fought their way to the right side of the 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite box seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was on. Girardelli set the pace with a time of 1:46:.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Following him down were Hannes Trinkl of Austria in 1:46.22, Peter Runggaldier 
of Italy in 1:46.39, Pietro Vitalini of Italy in 1:46.48 and Daniel Mahrer of 
Switzerland in 1:46.55. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, the top five racers were within .46 of each other, but the times 
were getting slower, if only fractionally. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that Girardelli had taken the best race from the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Cary Mullen, racer No. 6, then crashed after catching an edge, 
creating the first dramatic pause of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials tended to Mullen, who was not seriously injured, home-country 
hero Aamodt waited above in the gate, a trainer massaging his thighs, 
Norwegians cheering wildly and waving flags down in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen finally cleared, Aamodt shot down the hill in a blur, the crowd 
becoming more frenzied whenever the scoreboard posted his intermediate times. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt was ahead at every race segment, then leaned into the wire as the new 
leader at 1:45.79. He got a hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to the finish, I was really enjoying life," Aamodt said. "There 
were 30,000 people shouting. It only lasted two minutes. Then Tommy came down." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe wobbled a bit at the start and was only sixth after the first interval. 
Then he made up for lost time, and was in first place after the third interval 
as he streaked through the remaining sections, Svingen, Bukkerittet, Boygen, 
Loftet and Klemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe crossed at 1:45.75, four-hundredths of a second faster than Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 From his cramped position near the grandstand, Tom Moe pounded on the guard 
railing and implored that he be allowed across the finish area. 
</P>
<P>
 His son looked up at the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the biggest surprise was when I came down and saw my name and I was 
first on the board," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe still had to sweat out some big-time racers -- the gold busters -- among 
them defending Olympic champion Patrick Ortlieb of Austria and William Besse, 
the swift Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 One after another they tried, but no one could beat Moe's time. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only two scares. Canada's Ed Podivinsky, starting 21st, stopped a 
few hearts with his time of 1:45.87, which was good enough for the bronze 
medal. Then Nicolas Burtin of France, the last man Moe really feared, finished 
sixth on the chewed-up course, after having started 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Rasmussen, Moe's teammate, started 26th and shot all the way to 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the course changing? Was the track getting faster? 
</P>
<P>
 Moe and Aamodt, standing side by side, watched and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 AJ Kitt, another American of promise, posed the last real threat from the 30th 
position. But it soon became clear that this was not Kitt's course, or his day. 
He finished 17th. 
</P>
<P>
 After the top 30 racers were done, Moe realized that no one from the second 
division could pull off a miracle. His time would hold. He would be the only 
American besides Johnson to have won Olympic gold in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Aamodt was asked if the delay after Mullen's crash had hurt his 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 He jokingly replied, "I think it hurt me by about five-hundredths," the margin 
separating him from the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Moe, draped in a conspicuous fur coat he called "a timber wolf," was 
finally able to bust through security and join his son.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just looked at him," Moe Sr. said. "We don't have to say much." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different look from the one Tom Moe had flashed his son after Tommy 
had finished 28th in super-G in the 1992 Games in Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 That look, one of disgust, had reduced Tommy to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so hard on him," his father says now, remorsefully. "It made me feel 
like maybe (the race) was actually mine instead of Tommy's. For this Olympics, 
whatever he did was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moes are not the Waltons. Tommy's mother, Joann Persons, remarried after 
she and Tom split and is living in Whitefish, Mont. She was not here for the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy is not John-Boy. At 13, he was caught smoking marijuana and was shipped 
off to live with his father in Palmer. Tom Sr. runs a river-rafting business 
and used to be a construction worker. Before that, he worked as a smoke jumper 
-- "I jumped out of planes to fight fires." Tom Sr. figured he could straighten 
his son out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tommy loved the high life. At 16, he was caught with marijuana again and 
suspended from his local ski team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really irritated me," Tom Sr. said. "I thought I would do my own 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe took his son to work on a construction project on a barren, brutal stretch 
of nothingness called Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dutch Harbor is right close to hell," Tom Sr. said after Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy stayed a month and a half. "I think he learned a lesson," his father 
said. "He's a skier, not a contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Moe has been a straight arrow since Dutch Harbor. He says his 
dance with drugs was all part of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people know me as a drug user," Tommy said at his post-race news 
conference. "That wasn't true. I was just experimenting, being a normal 
American kid." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's come a long way from Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in 1992, Moe, who will turn 24 on Thursday, wanted to quit the World Cup 
circuit after a string of mediocre performances. He sought his father's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike at Albertville, Tom Sr. was not upset with his son. He did not call him 
a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he extended his hand. He told his son to come home. He said he 
understood the strains of ski racing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe went home, did some free skiing, spent time with his dad and an older 
brother, Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe began the Games ranked ninth in both downhill and super-G. He has twice 
placed third this season in World Cup races, once in each discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 For this career turn, he thanks his father. "I wouldn't have any of this if it 
weren't for him, his guiding and support," Tommy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made him tear his hair out, but he made me learn what you can have if you 
put your mind to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was meant to be. Although Moe deprived Aamodt and Norway of the gold, 
he sort of kept it in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1800s, Moe's great-great-great grandfather emigrated to the United 
States from Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't feel too bad," Tom Moe said. "Because a Norwegian still got a 
medal." 
</P>
<P>
 And his father got to see it.

BIGGEST ALL-STAR FALLS FLAT; PRO BASKETBALL: EAST PREVAILS, 127-118, BUT SHAQ 
IS HELD TO EIGHT POINTS. PIPPEN IS MVP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Did you want him to shoot? Did you want him to pass? Did you want him to slam? 
</P>
<P>
 Tough luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, at 21 by grace of Madison Avenue the player of his era, 
didn't make a shot until the third quarter and didn't dunk until the last 
minute of Sunday's NBA All-Star game, won by the East, 127-118. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal missed his first 10 shots, finished two for 12, and lined seven of his 
11 free throws off the rim. That was good for eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he raised his large, bald, sideburned young head, he was surrounded 
by two or three Westerners and they weren't there to get his autograph on their 
copies of his CD, "ShaqDiesel" or for tickets to his movie, "Blue Chips." 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the whole team was trying to block his shot," said West Coach 
George Karl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought people were jumping out of the first row of the stands, trying to 
block his shots," said West center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be termed a spontaneous folk movement because Karl hadn't told 
anyone to double-team. 
</P>
<P>
 He told his players to only help out in the post. They took it on themselves 
to collapse en masse whenever the young mogul got the ball. It wasn't exactly 
like the '85 game in Indianapolis when a couple of resentful veterans put the 
freeze on the young Michael Jordan, but the spirit of rivalry was working 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get the ball in position to score, there's not much anybody can do, so I 
understand what they were trying to do," said O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to see them play me straight up but that didn't happen. I 
thought they'd play me one on one, but I was dreaming. My dream didn't come 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has rivals. You guys (the press) make rivalries up. All the guys in 
this locker room are friends. Every time you see us on the court, fighting, 
we're just battling because we want the same thing. We want to win. I don't 
have a rivalry with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 That's his story, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the truth!" said David Robinson. "Nobody said any thing about 
double-teaming at the beginning of the game. Nobody even mentioned it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Shaq is fine. You know, if you talk about your game and you say you're great 
and everything, I mean, there's gonna be more intensity when you play against 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because guys got some pride. I mean, when you step out on the floor, if you 
say something, you better be able to prove what you say. I mean, night in, 
night out, you'd better be able to show what you say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're asking me, do guys get a little more intense, I mean, of course! He 
comes out and he says what he's going to do. More power to you. Play well. But 
you gotta know, nobody's going to make it easy for you." 
</P>
<P>
 No they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time O'Neal touched the ball, Mitch Richmond dropped down and 
knocked it away. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, Shaq hurried a jump hook over Hakeem Olajuwon and missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, Shawn Kemp stole it from him. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth, O'Neal got off a layup and Kemp blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you take too long getting off your shot," Kemp said. "It gets 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for me personally, I could care less if he had a great game or a bad game 
and that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The game, itself, was professional, low-key and a lifetime removed from the 
era of Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan who talked trash gleefully 
all weekend and put on sizzling exhibitions of fancy passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their era was full of moments: Isiah Thomas winning MVPs in '84 and '86; the 
Jordan freeze in '85; Rolando Blackman making two key free throws at Seattle in 
'87 while Thomas stood next to him and screamed he was going to miss; Bird's 
three-year sweep of the three-point competition from '86 to '88; Johnson's 
memorable farewell at Orlando in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson, Bird and Jordan gone, with Thomas missing, with Charles Barkley 
injured and 11 players making their All-Star debuts, this game came and went 
with little electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe this year it was more quiet because there were so many new 
guys," Robinson said. "It kind of felt a little bit uncomfortable." NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen made nine of his 15 shots, led all scorers with 29 points and 
won his first MVP. . . . The Lakers have reportedly offered Elden Campbell, 
their No. 1 pick and a choice of Anthony Peeler or Doug Christie to the Nets 
for Derrick Coleman.

 The short-hitters of the golf world are packed in Corey Pavin's corner today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, one of the game's longest hitters, had the skinny little former 
Bruin right where he wanted him going into the last day of the $1-million 
Nissan Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a one-stroke lead on his favorite course, where his boisterous fans can 
be as intimidating as his booming drives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pavin, who may be fudging when he says he weighs 150 pounds, never 
flinched. 
</P>
<P>
 A master of match play strategy, Pavin sliced and diced his way to a 
three-under 68 at Riviera Country Club and carved up Couples (71) in the 
process to post a two-stroke victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody else was even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin's tournament total of 13-under 271 was six strokes better than third 
place Chip Beck, who finished with a 68. David Frost was two more strokes 
behind at 279 after his 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin earned $180,000 for his first PGA Tour victory in nearly two years, but 
he wasn't concerned about his U.S. record. He pointed out that he won the World 
Match Play title last year, beating, in order, Peter Baker, Nick Price, Colin 
Montgomerie and Nick Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he can add a notch on his bag for Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I am pretty comfortable with match play," Pavin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tournament was medal play, it took on the look of match play from 
the first hole when each player birdied to further distance themselves from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it better when it's just you and the player you're paired with," Pavin 
said. "You can put a lot of pressure on the other guy if you can hit your irons 
close and make some putts." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin said he learned many years ago that it was useless to try to hit it with 
the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much knew from the get-go that chipping and putting was going to be 
the key for my game," Pavin said. "Oh, there's a few times that I try to hit it 
a little harder in certain situations, but I can't do it too often because then 
I get away from what I do best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish we played some match play events on our tour. That's the real 
essence of golf in its purest form." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davis Love II complained in 1992 that Couples' galleries bordered on 
being rude to anybody challenging Couples at Riviera, nothing of the sort had 
an effect on Pavin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my following out there, too," Pavin said. "They aren't as loud as 
Freddy's. They're more like me -- quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in Bruin blue and gold, Pavin displayed the type of shot-making on the 
first hole that makes him such a tough match play competitor. He had reached 
the front bunker of the 501-yard hole in two, then blasted out to eight feet 
and made the putt for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really a big shot for him," Couples said. "I was in pretty good 
shape in two and felt like I could birdie the hole and pick up a stroke, but he 
made his birdie first. It made my (six-foot) putt a tough one." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples made it, the first of his two birdies for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples lost his lead when he missed a 2 1/2-foot putt at the second hole, and 
Pavin took the lead with a 25-foot birdie at the third hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a great putt," Pavin said. "I was trying to lag it close, and it 
just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither player made a bogey or birdie over the rest of the front nine, 
although Couples missed the best chances on a few birdie putts that came up 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin's wedge helped him increase his lead to two with a birdie at the 
311-yard 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit my drive too long and had to hit a pretty good shot just to get 10 feet 
from the pin," Couples said. "He dinks a little wedge to about four feet. Just 
like cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples finally pulled even with a two-stroke swing at the 413-yard 12th. It 
was the only time Pavin appeared a little tense. Couples made his birdie with a 
six-foot putt, then watched as Pavin missed a four-footer to save par. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set for a big Couples finish over the last five holes, but his 
putter let him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples had a chance to take the lead with a 20-foot putt at the 14th, but 
lagged it 2 1/2 feet short, then missed that one for a bogey and dropped back 
by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin sensed it was over when he rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt at the 16th 
hole. He raised both arms as the putt dropped, picked his ball from the cup and 
watched as Couples missed his 18-foot attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples had no chance to reach the 578-yard 17th in two because it was into 
the wind. But he could have applied some pressure with a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 But, again, it was Pavin applying the pressure with a third shot that landed 
12 feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a key shot, because if I don't get it close, Freddy can relax and 
try to get his shot in close for his birdie," Pavin said. "But when I hit it 
that close, he had to feel the pressure because he knew I had a chance to make 
mine."  
</P>
<P>
 Couples hit a poor third shot and neither player birdied. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin felt pretty good about a two-stroke lead with one hole to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, he had Couples where he wanted him.

 Peter Jacobsen, playing the final group with the leaders, was amused when 
somebody suggested he still had a chance to win. "Sure I do," deadpanned 
Jacobsen, who is from Portland, Ore. "After all, I know Tonya Harding." . . . 
The shot of the day was Jay Delsing's second at the 418-yard ninth hole. He

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; 'HAIR-TRIGGER GRIN' GETS 
PUT TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One guy named Moe. Tommy Moe, American, is sitting by himself, elbow on a 
desk, chin cupped in his palm, daydreaming, drifting off into space, scratching 
his Fu Manchu, four days before his downhill run. He is thinking about Bill 
Johnson, about another place, another race, another American. He is thinking 
about Wild Bill's wild ride down the slope of an Alp, about what it must have 
been like, 10 years before, descending that snowy stairway from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see. Yeah. Where was I then?" Tommy Moe asks himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Away he goes, on a ski lift in his mind, transporting himself backward in 
time, searching his memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A smile suddenly gleams like a sunbeam on a snowcap. One often does. The 
official USA ski team guide describes Tommy Moe as having "a hair-trigger 
grin." 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "Guess I must've been in Alaska. I was, like, 13 or 14 years old, so, 
you know, I don't know how far I could have wandered off." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, Alaska, population 2,666 and several moose, is the Moe family's home 
base. Has been for years. Pa Moe (Tom Sr.) runs a river-rafting business near 
Mt. Alyeska for what he calls "day-trippers." Step-Mom Moe (Tyra) began her 
weekend in Palmer, north of Anchorage on the way to Fairbanks. She and her 
husband day-tripped by airplane and automobile Saturday and came huffing and 
puffing to the zenith of a Norwegian mountain range Sunday morning, just in 
time to see Tommy ski. 
</P>
<P>
 And oh, what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw him hurtle downward at speeds as high as 80 m.p.h., hugging every 
turn, bumping and grinding over snow and rock. They saw him descend the 2,746 
feet of Kvitfjell in a low tuck, then glide to a stop within sight of the 
frosted Glomma riverbank. They saw him squint into a perfect sun, flip up his 
goggles, check out his time and thrust his arms skyward triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe, king of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 That hair-trigger face of his, clean-shaven now, fired off another grin. Look 
who was here. What a place for a family reunion. Great-Great-Great-Grandpa Moe 
made his home here in Norway in the 19th Century before emigrating to the New 
World. Great Uncle Olvar, 82, still lives in Oslo, as do a dozen other Nordic 
kin. What a place for this to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in his daydreams, he couldn't quite picture it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be unbelievable, me winning?" Tommy asks, four days before the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I will," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe, American, on top of the world. He has had total northern exposure. 
He knows every inch of our 49th state. He mountain-bikes. He kayaks. He camps 
out. He fishes. He and his older brother, Mike Moe, go free-skiing. Together 
they recently built a house, with the name, Downhill Circle, etched into the 
driveway post. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy can clown around about having been an adolescent stranded in Alaska, but 
fact is, when he was 14, he already was winning medals in junior events, 
mushing along like a malamute, making tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike never sensed how much faster his brother could go. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father said here Sunday, "Mike's back home, probably tearing the house 
down right now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 17, 1970, slightly more than 24 years to the day before he would 
become America's favorite and most famous Alaskan, Tommy Moe was born in 
Montana, up near the glorious peaks of Missoula. He grew up and hung out in the 
hillsides near Whitefish. When his ancestors left Europe and headed for lower 
ground, they didn't want to go too low. They settled in Montana, not long after 
it achieved statehood. This is where Tommy Moe started out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he moved north to Alaska and that's when his gold rush really began. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4, he already could ski. Once up in Alaska, though, Tommy Moe got familiar 
with Mt. Alyeska the way children closer to sea level got to know hockey rinks 
or soccer fields. Tommy took sixth place in the U.S. junior championships a 
couple of days before another dear-diary birthday, his sweet 16th. Later that 
same year, he also won the Western J-II downhill, the super-G, the grand 
slalom. A silver in the slalom, too. Tommy Moe was junior skiing's hottest 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in Tommy's teens, skiing in America became hotter than ever before. 
At Sarajevo in 1984, after years and years of European rule, oh, how the 
Americans had flabbergasted everybody. As others crashed all over the Mt. 
Bjelasnica slalom course -- only 47 of 101 starters completed two runs -- Phil 
Mahre paired his silver medal from Lake Placid with a gold. His twin brother, 
Steve, got the silver. And then both twins broke down crying on American TV, 
when Donna de Varona broke the news to Phil that his wife had given birth to a 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't a bad way to end an Olympics. But combined with what happened at 
the beginning of those Olympics, skiing's popularity in American rose like 
never before. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Johnson had won the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember what he said before the race?" Tommy Moe asks, on this dreamy day in 
Norway 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, someone says, but Tommy repeats it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Everybody else is racing for second place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe knows this story the way other kids know stories about Babe Ruth 
supposedly pointing to a baseball fence, or Joe Namath guaranteeing a football 
game. He knows that Bill Johnson went on to say, "I don't even know why 
everyone else is here," not unlike the way another Johnson, a football coach 
from Dallas, would crow 10 years later that his team would have no problem with 
a team from San Francisco. How even though no American had ever won an Olympic 
downhill gold medal, the totally cool Wild Bill stood in front of everybody and 
said, "They should just hand it to me now." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Tommy Moe's all-time favorite tales. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why didn't you do that?" the person he is chatting with inquires, once a 
crowded room has cleared out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe gives him the eye and says, "You know, I thought about it. I really 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Then that grin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't that have been cool?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure would have.

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; ANGER IN KERRIGAN'S CAMP; 'THIS IS SUCH 
A TOUGH DEAL FOR NANCY,' SAYS HER COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan's camp resolved to react with restraint to the 
announcement in the early morning hours here Sunday that rival Tonya Harding 
will compete in the Winter Olympics, but, by the end of the day, the 
frustration and anger was pouring out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a tough deal for Nancy," her coach, Evy Scotvold, said Sunday 
night. "She faces a second wound. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has to face somebody . . . whether that person or her family was trying 
to do her in, and yet they come in here with such bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't live in a perfect world. Sometimes, as those license plates say, it 
just stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wylie, the Olympic men's silver medalist in 1992 and a close friend of 
Kerrigan's after training with her for several years in the Boston area, said 
he was so upset after learning of the settlement between the U.S. Olympic 
Committee and Harding that gives Harding the green light to skate in the 
Olympics that he could not sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But he reserved his harshest judgments for the International Skating Union's 
insistence that Kerrigan and Harding must share practice times at the official 
rinks inside the Olympic Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they seem to be concerned about is protecting Tonya," said Wylie, who is 
working as a commentator for CBS. "Nobody seems to be standing up to protect 
Nancy, especially in the area of practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy is the one who suffered the injury. Let's not forget that." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kerrigan, she practiced as scheduled Sunday afternoon, and although she 
did not look as sharp as she did the previous two days, Scotvold said that it 
had nothing to do with her reaction to the news about Harding. He said that he 
advised her to back off because she had been trying too hard to be perfect in 
practices since arriving last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Chelsea Clinton, whose mother led the official U.S. government 
delegation that attended Saturday's opening ceremony in Lillehammer, was 
allowed to speak to Kerrigan, but reporters were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's agent, Jerry Solomon, later issued a statement from his client that 
said: "As you all know by now, I am not a lawyer and have tried to stay out of 
the fray in the whole matter of the investigation on the attack to my knee, 
which resulted in my having to withdraw from the U.S. championships. It has now 
been some 35 days since I was hit, and they have been trying ones to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems now, for the moment and as it relates to the Olympic competition, 
the matter has been resolved. Regardless of my opinion of the ruling, the 
Olympics have begun and it is time to skate. We have all worked very hard to 
get here, and I hope now that the focus can turn to the competition and all of 
the athletes who represent the pinnacle of athleticism and sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon added that Kerrigan will offer no more statements until her 
competition begins Feb. 23, which means that reporters will have to draw their 
own conclusions about how she handles practicing with Harding. Scheduled to 
arrive Wednesday, Harding could be sharing a rink with Kerrigan by the next 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly disturbed because the ISU will not change the practice assignments so 
that Kerrigan and Harding can skate separately, Scotvold said: "Everyone has 
kept silent, but silence is not weakness. The most important thing is that 
Nancy came here to be a champion. She is trying to do that by taking the high 
road and doing it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that doesn't work today in society. Maybe it's who yells loudest and 
most profane." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated pleas by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn., the ISU has not budged. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't like it, don't bring her," said ISU vice president Lawrence 
Demmy of Great Britain, referring to Harding. "You come as a team, you skate as 
a team." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' representative to the ISU Council, Chuck DeMore, agreed, 
arguing that placing Kerrigan and Harding in separate practices would attract 
large media contingents to both and burden twice as many skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "By splitting up the practice, you would expand the disturbance element to 
other skaters," he said. "It isn't fair. This is an American problem. 
(Kerrigan) is going to have to face the reality. She'll be on the ice at the 
same time (with Harding). She might as well get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wylie said the ISU position is wrong. "They think they're minimizing the 
problem by having them at a single practice," he said. "But instead of having a 
small problem at two practices, you're going to have an extra-large problem at 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, he said, the ISU is not taking into consideration Kerrigan's 
feelings about being forced to practice with a skater who has been implicated 
by a U.S. Figure Skating Assn. hearing panel in the Jan. 6 assault on her at 
the national championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy has a scenario in her head," Wylie said. "She says, 'I can handle this, 
and I can handle that.' But each day she has had to take on more stress because 
of the events that are unfolding here." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMore said, however, that there will be as much pressure, if not more, on 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harding is the one who has to watch it," he said. "If Harding skates by and 
Nancy just happens to fall from the breeze, they're going to say she got too 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA's team leader, Gayle Tanger, said the association offered both 
Kerrigan and Harding ice time in Oslo, 80 miles south of Hamar, if they would 
like to avoid potential problems by practicing away from the official rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, both say they'd rather be here," Tanger said. "So we'll see 
how it works." 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA already had the Oslo rink available to accommodate Michelle Kwan, 
13, of Torrance, the first alternate who was asked to come to Norway in case 
she was called upon to replace Harding. As an alternate, she is not allowed to 
skate on the official rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it appears now that Kwan will not compete, the USFSA still wants her 
in Oslo in case things change between now and the Feb. 21 deadline for naming 
its entries in the women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought we should have our alternate close by," said Tanger, adding 
that Kwan probably will arrive late this week. "I see no reason to change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA also is urging Kwan to remain in shape. Pending the final outcome of 
the association's investigation, she might represent the United States in the 
March 22-27 World Championships in Chiba, Japan, if Harding is removed from the 
team. Harding has until March 7 to respond to the USFSA hearing panel's 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're agreeing with the USOC in the resolution of this situation," said 
Claire Ferguson, USFSA president. "But we have our own code of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 * ANALYSIS: The USOC's code of conduct was never meant to deal with acts of 
violence. C8

HE TAKES THE LOW ROAD AND WINS; AUTO RACING: GORDON OUTSMARTS EARNHARDT AND 
IRVAN TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH TWO LAPS REMAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jeff Gordon is only 22, but he spent a lot of years racing sprint cars and 
midgets on dirt tracks before making the move to Winston Cup stock cars and 
high-banked superspeedways two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, in the Busch Clash -- a pair of 10-lap sprints for last year's pole 
winners that are combined to determine a single winner -- Gordon used all the 
experience of his youth to snooker a pair of racing's toughest campaigners, 
Dale Earnhardt and Ernie Irvan, to win the $45,000 winners' purse at Daytona 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, running third with two laps remaining, went low through the second 
turn in a three-abreast move that shot him to the front. Once there, he held 
off Brett Bodine, who followed him past the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gordon's second win on Daytona's high banks. Last year, he became the 
first rookie and the youngest driver to win one of the Twin 125-mile qualifying 
heats for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "To beat these guys, the best in the world, is just unbelievable," said 
Gordon, who got in the race by winning the pole in last October's Mello Yello 
500 at Charlotte, N.C. "This is kind of like the racing I was used to doing 
growing up. In sprint car racing, you start in the back and come to the front 
as fast as you can in as few laps as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a hole and you go for it. It works or it doesn't work. We may do this 
race tomorrow and I'd go to the inside and to the back I'd go." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan and Earnhardt had come from the rear of the 13-car field in three laps 
to set up what appeared to be a shootout between the two most aggressive 
drivers in racing. But while they were keeping a wary eye on one another, 
Gordon slipped in behind Earnhardt and waited for the moment to strike.

 "Ernie was leading and Earnhardt was looking all over, trying to (find a way) 
by him," Gordon explained. "I wouldn't commit either way. When Earnhardt would 
go low, I would kind of go with him and then maybe I'd sneak up there with 
Ernie. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Earnhardt made his move and got underneath Ernie when we got down to 
turn one, I decided to go with him. When Dale's car looked like it was getting 
loose and he had to lift a little bit, I pulled alongside. Luckily, Brett 
(Bodine) went with me. If no one had gone with me, I would have been out there 
all by myself. Brett and I had the momentum and got by on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt admitted he made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been paying attention," Earnhardt said. "I didn't know what lap 
it was. I was just trying to get by Ernie. I really wasn't focusing and we just 
got beat. The 24 car (Gordon) and the 26 (Bodine) hooked up and ran by us. I 
congratulate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt won the first 10-lap segment, collecting $25,000. The race was 
halted and the field inverted for the final 10 laps.

 Loy Allen Jr., who will start on the pole in the Daytona 500, had an 
embarrassing moment in the ARCA 200 when the tie rod broke in his Ford, 
pitching him into the wall while following the pace car at a slow speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," Allen said. "I tried to accelerate to keep it 
from snapping to the right, but that only made it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wallace of St. Louis won the accident-marred race in a Chevrolet.

MORNING BRIEFING: CONCENTRATION WAS MORE THAN STATE OF MIND

 How different was Steve Carlton from everybody else who surrounded him during 
his days in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
 Jayson Stark, writing in Baseball America, describes a unique moment from the 
career of the recently elected Hall of Famer: 
</P>
<P>
 "People still talk about the game in West Palm Beach, Fla., back in the early 
1980s in which an Expo hitter chopped a foul ball down the third base line off 
Carlton. Well, it was never Carlton's style to waste time watching where 
foul-ball choppers wound up. So he turned immediately toward the plate to await 
a new ball. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Except the third baseman picked the ball up,' then-Expos broadcaster Tommy 
Hutton said, 'and fired it back to the mound. And Lefty wasn't looking, so it 
hit him right in the side of the head. And he never even flinched. It was like 
a fly ticked him.' "

 Mean feat: In Phil Berger's new book, "Miracle on 33rd Street: The New York 
Knickerbockers Championship Season, 1969-70," he writes about a cloth good-luck 
charm Willis Reed acquired along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cloth featured a smirking pioneer holding a rifle to a pigeon on a perch 
and read: There's a little meanness in everybody. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball translation: Sometimes you have to find an opposing player who is 
not up to the ability, smarts or hustle and you must use your resources to 
exploit the other team's 'pigeon in sneakers.' Reed brought this cloth into the 
Knicks locker room prior to the season and soon after the Knicks went on to win 
17 straight games."

 Moorer power: At the news conference announcing Evander Holyfield's April 22 
fight against Michael Moorer, Holyfield got a display of Moorer's power. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, dressed in combat fatigues, strode up and pounded the podium with his 
right fist, splintering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation 
heavyweight champion, sounded like he enjoyed the prop-gag. "I'm glad to have 
the opportunity to display my talent," Holyfield said. "And I'm glad I'm not a 
podium."

 Boss Angelos: Mega-rich Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos certainly hasn't 
gone out of his way to quiet talk that he might run for state office or buy an 
NFL franchise.

William Donald Schaefer is urging Angelos to enter the gubernatorial race. The 
next, he's talking to him about buying the Los Angeles Rams or Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers."

DUCKS TAKE WING ON LATE GOALS; HOCKEY: THEY SCORE THREE TIMES IN THE THIRD 
PERIOD TO BEAT THE OILERS, 6-3, FOR TUGNUTT. YAKE SCORES 100TH CAREER POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beating the Edmonton Oilers is no longer a big deal for Mighty Duck goaltender 
Ron Tugnutt, which is pretty much the way the rest of the NHL feels about the 
Pacific Division's last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply winning, by 6-3 Sunday at Northlands Coliseum, meant more to Tugnutt, 
who hadn't won since Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt had already beaten the Oilers, his old team, twice this season, but 
victory No. 3 looked shaky for a long stretch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks trailed, 2-0, after 10:11 and skated lethargic shift after 
uninspired shift for most of the first 30 minutes. Tugnutt was not immune to 
the flat play, giving up goals by Ilya Byakin and Doug Weight only 20 seconds 
apart in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big difference to play an afternoon game," Tugnutt said. "It throws 
off all your rituals. You can't have spaghetti and chicken at 9 in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ducks finally snapped out of their afternoon nap, they were swift and 
efficient in converting their scoring chances. They scored five consecutive 
goals, including two each by Joe Sacco and Terry Yake, to help make Tugnutt a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one was important (the first victory in Duck history), but the 
second and third were just wins," Tugnutt said of his Edmonton victories. "We 
kept our composure and they didn't. We got that power-play goal and that turned 
the game around." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco's power-play goal, with the Ducks on a five-on-three advantage, pulled 
them even, 2-2, at 17:23 of the second period. From there, they dominated the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it didn't hurt that the Oilers left the next three Duck 
goal-scorers all alone in front of the net. But that also might explain why the 
once-proud Oilers are 15-36-8 and 10 points behind the expansion Ducks, who are 
tied with the Kings for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Ducks' three-goal flurry in the third period was about as 
impressive an offensive performance as the defensive-minded team has had all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Yake beat goalie Bill Ranford with a slap shot from the slot 2:44 into 
the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Sacco scored in front of the crease after an uncontested pass from 
behind the net by Shaun Van Allen, another former Oiler, at 5:45. 
</P>
<P>
 And 14 seconds later, Yake, alone at the left side of the net, swatted a pass 
from Tim Sweeney past Ranford for his 100th career point and a 5-2 Duck lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson said he didn't single anyone out in speeches between periods, 
but after the second he asked for more from the Yake-Sweeney-Bob Corkum line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our guys to relax and that the scoring chances would happen," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly pleased to see Tugnutt settle down after the first period. 
Tugnutt was not sharp in his last start, a 4-2 loss to Calgary on Feb. 2, and 
Wilson was glad to see his confidence return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important," Wilson said. "(Guy) Hebert has been great the last three or 
four starts, and Tugnutt has struggled. You need two strong goaltenders. That's 
what we've had all year." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Bill Houlder, scratched for three consecutive games, assisted on 
Joe Sacco's first goal of the game. "Bill had gotten himself into a rut," Coach 
Ron Wilson said. "He was making two or three errors a game, critical errors." . 
. . The Ducks evened their road record at 13-13-2. They are undefeated in their 
last eight games outside the United States.

PIPPEN MAKES MORE THAN ONE STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen started with a fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Very bright red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ugly, man," said George Karl, coach of the Seattle SuperSonics and 
the Western Conference All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loud," Chicago Bull and Eastern teammate Horace Grant added. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the peers cringed and the crowd reached for sunglasses, the game began. 
Then Pippen made another statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Good player. 
</P>
<P>
 Very good player. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday at the Target Center, he was the best, contributing 29 points, five 
three-pointers, 11 rebounds and four steals to the East's 127-118 victory in 
the NBA's 44th All-Star game. He won the MVP award, a trophy and, in front of a 
worldwide television audience, the right to step out from Michael Jordan's 
solar eclipse of a shadow, and not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grant: "I think Scottie had something to prove. He proved he belonged up 
there with the elite. Not just the all-stars, but the superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes what transpired about as close to a coming out as you can get for 
someone who has played for three championship teams, the Dream Team, has twice 
been selected to the all-defensive team in a vote by coaches and was playing in 
his fourth All-Star game. That it came as the Bulls are two games away from the 
best record in the league after the greatest player in the game, maybe league 
history, retires only makes it better. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen always has been known, at least since being drafted in the first round 
out of Central Arkansas in 1987. It's just that being known as Jordan's 
supporting star in the three-peat or The Guy With The Headaches isn't exactly 
ideal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 So he sprung this showing on the non-believers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a statement, I think it was past-due judgment," Pippen said. 
"Having Michael on our team really overshadowed guys like Horace and B.J. 
(Armstrong) and, to some extent, myself. It's time we were all recognized as 
all-stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, of course, was easy to recognize. He couldn't be missed, not with 
those red shoes (plus black trim and a white logo) and recent boot-camp 
haircut. And he couldn't miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws early in the game. Slam dunk. Three-pointer from the top of 
the key. Two possessions later, three-pointer from the left corner. This was as 
the Bulls -- starters Pippen and Armstrong -- had all the points in a 15-12 
lead for the East and before a third, reserve-for-a-day Grant, had even checked 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first quarter, Pippen had 12 points. By intermission, 16 
points and six rebounds in 14 minutes. Eleven more points in the third period 
clinched the award, even as Patrick Ewing got 12 of his 20 points off the bench 
in the final 12 minutes to hold off a charge by the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been shooting the ball well, and I just continued to let the shot flow," 
said Pippen, who is 10th in the league in scoring at 21.7 points a game while 
also averaging 8.5 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.81 steals and shooting 50.8%. 
"It (being MVP) wasn't anything I thought about before the game. I think the 
fans come here to be entertained, and that's all I tried to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel I had anything to prove. I think just being selected as an 
All-Star and as a starter shows recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 But it still remains a moment to cherish in a season full of those, a time 
when the Bulls have spent the first half handing out almost as many 
told-you-so's as losses. The uprising of the supporting cast, as Jordan 
indelicately tabbed them, carried all the way into the All-Star game, where 
Pippen went for 29 points and the MVP, Armstrong had 11 and Grant grabbed eight 
rebounds in 17 minutes, six on offense.

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK; KOSS SETS A RECORD AND WINS 
NORWAY'S FIRST GOLD MEDAL 
</P>

 Speedskater Johann Olav Koss won the host country's first gold medal Sunday, 
setting a world record in the 5,000-meter race at the Viking Ship rink in 
Hamar. 
</P>
<P>
 Koss, urged on by a raucous crowd of about 12,000, won in 6 minutes 34.96 
seconds, topping his own world record, 6:35.53, set on the same rink in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammate, Kjell Storelid, finished second in 6:42.68, which was an Olympic 
record until Koss skated two pairs later, and Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands 
was third in 6:43.94. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was great, the best thing that's ever happened to me," said Koss, a 
25-year-old medical student. "I have never performed better. I was not very 
confident before the race but Kjell Storelid's great performance was an immense 
inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Skating on freshly resurfaced ice, Koss lagged behind his record pace in the 
early going and with a lap left still was six-hundredths of a second behind. 
But with the crowd screaming, "Johann! Johann! Johann!" he stepped up the pace 
and skated the lap six-tenths of a second faster than he had done in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Wanek, the only American skater entered, finished 30th in 7:05.95 in the 
32-skater field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first gold medal of the Games was won by Italian Manuela Di Centa, who 
upset two Russian skiers in the women's 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Centa, 31, the only non-Russian to have won a World Cup race this season, a 
15K classical at Toblach, Italy, in December, skied the course in 39:44.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Lyubov Egorova, winner of three gold and two silver medals two years 
ago in the Albertville Games, was second in 41.03.0, and her teammate, Nina 
Gavriluk, won the bronze in 41:10.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetano Di Centa, Manuela's father and longtime coach, hugged her in the 
finish area and said, "Bravo, my star. This is only the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura McCabe of Park City, Utah, was the first American to finish. She placed 
34th in 43:51.1. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What would a Winter Olympics be without Eddie (the Eagle) Edwards? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not nearly as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, the nearly blind English ski jumper who captivated the world with his 
short and formless jumps at Calgary in 1988, then was not allowed to jump at 
Albertville, showed up at the large ski hill here, carrying a pair of slalom 
skis. He said he was entered in the competition, to be held next Sunday, but 
was not allowed into the jumping area because he had no accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 After saying he was being prevented from jumping because the the judges feared 
he would jump too far, he confessed to having a secret weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jet engines concealed in the bindings," he said. MIKE KUPPER

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; LUGE; KENNEDY TO GO ON THE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Duncan Kennedy of the United States planned to spend Sunday night playing 
video games in the Olympic village and sharpening his putting stroke on the 
synthetic green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable where I'm at," he said, referring to his position on the luge 
leader board, as well as in the game room. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on the people ahead of me. They have to hold on, while I can 
attack," he said. "I have nothing to lose. I have a lot of room in which to 
move." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas teammate Wendel Suckow was a disappointing ninth after two of four 
heats, Kennedy was fourth, separated by a split second, perhaps, from the first 
U.S. medal in luge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we wanted, to be in reach," Coach Wolfgang Schadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good setup. I'm sure he'll attack (in today's final two heats)." 
</P>
<P>
 After cautiously finishing 10th and 14th in his two previous Olympics, Kennedy 
vowed to "fly or die" in the Norwegian woods and did just that in his second 
heat Sunday, picking up two places with the third-fastest time of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a cumulative 1 minute 41.220 seconds compared to 1:40.856 for leader 
Georg Hackl of Germany; 1:40.866 for Austria's Markus Prock, and 1:41.042 for 
Italy's Armin Zoggeler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aiming beyond that," Kennedy said when it was mentioned that he is only 
two-tenths out of third. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some great sliders ahead of me, but anything can happen and I've 
been consistent all week." 
</P>
<P>
 All season, actually. He was second on the World Cup circuit, behind Prock. 
Hackl, the defending Olympic champion, was third in World Cup and under fire by 
the German media, who questioned his Olympic preparation in the wake of his 
erratic World Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they think I can't count to three," he said of his nation's media 
after providing a blistering response to their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting first in the first heat on a sunny, windless morning of 11 degrees, 
the 27-year-old German soldier set a track record of 50.296 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the clock at the top of the hill, Kennedy said he smiled and thought 
to himself, "Same old Georg." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were counting him out, but the same thing happened before 
Albertville (and the 1992 Olympics)," Kennedy said. "I knew that was a mistake. 
I think Georg just likes to sandbag a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackl also had the best time in the second heat -- 50.560 seconds, but is only 
a tenth ahead of Prock. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's only luck," Prock said of the small difference. "It should be an 
exciting fight between me and Hackl." 
</P>
<P>
 That eliminates Zoggeler and Kennedy, who isn't buying it, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to take risks," he said. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was sixth at 50.587 after the first heat, saying he might have been a 
bit too cautious at certain points. 
</P>
<P>
 He started first in the reverse order of the second heat and virtually had to 
jump on the sled without thinking about it when he misjudged his preparation 
time during the 20 minutes between heats. 
</P>
<P>
 His 50.633 on a track rutted by the first heat enabled him to move past Arnold 
Huber of Italy and Jens Muller of Germany, fourth and fifth previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow, the 1993 World Champion who was fourth on the World Cup circuit, had 
times of 50.698 and 50.819, paying a price for his lack of aggressiveness at 
the start, Schadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow agreed. "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed," he said. "I was 
tense and sloppy in the first heat. I felt that I slid better in the second, 
but the time didn't reflect it. I just want to come out of tomorrow feeling I 
did the best I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 "At this level, if you finish in the top six, the top 10, you have to feel 
good, and the nice thing is that I'll always have the world title. No can take 
that away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, too, said he is here to have fun, do the best he can do, but an 
Olympic medal would underscore his development in a sport dominated by 
Europeans and culminate a season in which he gained worldwide recognition and 
applause for his confrontation with German skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 However, unlike World Cup races, which comprise only two heats, Kennedy will 
have to think about his situation overnight. Depending, of course, on how he 
putts.

is not an easy language to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 It is full of sounds and inflections that trip enchantingly off the tongues of 
those who grew up with it, but merely trip up the unwary foreigner trying to 
make a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, foreigners here are spoiled, because most Norwegians speak English 
and many speak another language as well, often German. Still, there are place 
names that really can't be said in other tongues, so when you're asking 
directions, it pays to say them right. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those of you watching the Games at home, eager to impress your friends 
by dropping the names of the various venues into your Olympic conversations, 
here's a little pronunciation guide: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lillehammer: It's LIL-uh-hom-mer, not Lily-hammer. It means little crag , 
to distinguish it from another similar sounding place nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hamar: This is the similar sounding place nearby. The speedskating and 
figure skating will be held in HOM-ar, which used to be Storhamar/Hamar, or big 
crag . The differences in spelling and pronunciation of the two craggy places 
are not explained, simply accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hunderfossen: The luge-bobsled run is at Hunderfossen, which sounds pretty 
much the way it looks, HOON-der-faw-sen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hafjell: The thing to remember is that in Norwegian, J sounds like Y. Thus, 
the site of some of the Alpine skiing is HOF-yell. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kvitfjell: The F in the middle is merely there to confuse and there 
apparently is local option on the V. Some say it like a W, some like a V, so 
the site of the rest of the Alpine skiing is either KWEET-yell or Ka-VEET-yell. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gjovik: Now here is an interesting word. The G-J combination is common in 
Norwegian but does not translate well, since the G is hinted at, rather than 
pronounced. And this particular O isn't really an O, since in Norwegian it has 
a slash through it, which gives it kind of an uhr sound. So if you say -- if 
you can say -- YEE-uhr-vik, people will probably know you're talking about one 
of the hockey sites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lysgardsbakkene: There is no way most Americans are going to do justice to 
the name of the ski-jumping arena, but it sounds like Liss-gorsh-BAH-kuh-neh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegians also say, Adjo, which means, See you later. MIKE KUPPER

 Finally, one small step for man. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe's gold medal in Alpine downhill skiing was the first by a U.S. male 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Brian Boitano's figure-skating victory at Calgary has a gold been 
won by an American man. The only victorious U.S. athletes at Albertville in 
1992 were women -- speedskater Bonnie Blair twice, figure skater Kristi 
Yamaguchi, freestyle skier Donna Weinbrecht and short-track skater Cathy 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right! One for our side!" Boitano joked after Moe's success Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Headline from Sports Illustrated's Winter Olympic preview issue: "What's wrong 
with U.S. skiing? Sit down, this may take awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 From writer E.M. Swift's text: "Slovenia, Luxembourg and New Zealand all have 
better chances to take home Alpine medals from Lillehammer than Uncle Sam's 
lead-footed snowplow brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norway . . . has four skiers ranked ahead of the top U.S. man, Tommy Moe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Moe and a miracle stand between this team and a repeat of the 1988 Games 
in Calgary, where the top U.S. skier finished ninth, just ahead of the lift 
operator." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody still believe in miracles? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add article: Moe had this to say about the SI story: "Everyone should read it, 
because none of it is really true. The result today kind of puts it in place. A 
lot of American skiers work hard. We don't need to be ridiculed." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "It's funny that it came out this time of year, before the Olympics. I 
read it. It stoked my fire." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine also asked why "all seven million Austrians and half of the cows 
in Switzerland ski faster than the entire U.S. ski team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Austria's downhill skiers placed fourth, tied for sixth, 15th and 19th Sunday. 
Switzerland's were 14th, 16th and 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans placed first, 11th and 17th.

 CBS' first-night coverage of the Winter Olympics drew the largest audience 
ever to watch the opening ceremony of a Winter Games. An average of 19.6 
million television homes were tuned in to all or part of the tape-delayed 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The next most-watched opening ceremony was at Lake Placid in 1980, when it was 
watched in 17.3 million television homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's three-hour prime-time show drew a 20.8 national Nielsen rating and 
a 34 audience share even though there were viewer complaints that the network 
spent too long -- about an hour -- on features and interviews before going to 
the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The rating for the opening ceremoney at Albertville, France, two years ago was 
a 14.5 and a 24 share. 
</P>
<P>
 Each ratings point represents 942,000 households. The share refers to the 
percentage of televisions in use that are tuned to a program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were complaints Sunday that CBS, on its daytime shows, was giving 
results of events that were to be shown later. Lou D'Ermilio, a CBS spokesman 
in Lillehammer, said next weekend the anchors, Jim Nantz and Andrea Joyce, will 
be more consistent in warning viewers to look away if they don't want to know 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Joyce said the United States' 4-4 tie in hockey with France was shown on 
"a little bit of a delay." In the East, it was a half-hour delay. But in the 
West, the delay was 3 1/2 hours, meaning the game was over before the start was 
shown by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the hockey telecast was CBS' much-balleyhooed goalie-cam because 
U.S. goalie Mike Dunham told the network Saturday he had decided he wouldn't 
feel comfortable with a tiny camera mounted on his helmet.

 David Kurtz, an attorney and assistant U.S. bobsled coach, said the U.S. 
Skeleton and Bobsled Federation is likely to countersue driver Bruce Rosselli 
if he persists in "criminal allegatations" against driver Brian Shimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer and driver Randy Will did not attend a news conference with the U.S. 
team Sunday.It was announced that they were working on their sleds, but Shimer 
might also have chosen to avoid questions about a federal suit Rosselli filed 
at Indianapolis last week, charging him with theft of equipment as part of an 
alleged conspiracy by the federation to favor driver Jim Herberich during the 
Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, who failed to qualify for the third time, is also seeking an 
injunction that would prevent the U.S. team from participating in the Olympics, 
but Kurtz said he had heard unofficially that the injunction request will be 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 In noting that the conspiracy charge has been rejected in arbitration, a 
ruling upheld in Illinois state court, Kurtz said, "We're tired in the spirit 
of good sportsmanship of turning the other cheek with each allegation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These very unfair accusations by a very frustrated athlete are tarnishing the 
reputation of a very fine driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to disrupt our focus here, but if the allegations persist, we 
will certainly countersue." ROSS NEWHAN

 Rather quietly, American Kyle Rasmussen has supplanted AJ Kitt on the U.S. 
downhill depth chart. Rasmussen finished 11th in Sunday's downhill, missing a 
top 10 spot by one-hundreth of a second, and only sixth-tenths of a seconds out 
of first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had another solid, good run," Rasmussen said. "Like I've been having 
the last month or so. One of these weeks I'm going to break through. This is my

be happy with it." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Swedish defenseman Tomas Jonsson has a chance to become only the second player 
ever to win an Olympic gold medal and have his name on the Stanley Cup. 
Jonsson, who played on the New York Islanders' Stanley Cup championship teams 
in 1982 and '83, can share the distinction with by Ken Morrow, who won a gold 
medal with the U.S. in 1980 at Lake Placid and was a member of the Islanders' 
four Cup-winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a European guy, an Olympic gold medal is really big," said Jonsson, who 
assisted on Sweden's first goal Sunday. "There is no comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 But to win that medal, Jonsson said Sweden will have to improve its play over 
its tournament-opening effort Sunday. Sweden fell behind Slovakia, 3-2, before 
scoring twice in the third period. A goal by Roman Kontsek with 5:48 to play 
brought Slovakia even. 
</P>

<P>
 Peter Forsberg, the Swedish center who signed a three-year, $6.9-million 
(Canadian) contract with the Nordiques, did not impress one knowledgeable 
observer Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't play every night," said Finnish center Raimo Helminen, who plays 
against Forsberg in the Swedish Elite League. "Some nights he's not so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Although widely rated the best young player in the world, Forsberg has also 
been criticized for being inconsistent. He played well at the Izvestia 
tournament in December, but was not a factor in the pre-Olympic Globen Cup 
competition in Sweden. His future Nordique teammates have publicly groused 
about the money given him by Quebec's management, creating the potential for 
discord. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him," said his teammate, Jonsson. "There's too much pressure 
on him for a guy who's only 21. He's going to be a great hockey player, but 
it's tough for him." 
</P>

 Mikko Makela is hoping to catch the eye of NHL general managers and scouts at 
the Olympics and get an offer to return to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go back there, that's no secret. If I play good here and in the 
world championships, maybe that will open some doors for me," said Makela, who 
had a 36-goal season for the Islanders in 1987-88 but never became the prolific 
scorer they though he would. He had seven goals in 45 games with the Kings in 
1989-90 before being traded to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Makela's Finnish team, seeded seventh, opened the Olympics with a 3-1 upset of 
the Czech Republic, which is seeded third. That has made Finland a new medal 
favorite. The Finns play Russia today.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough for us, playing two good teams right away, but we're 
all excited about playing Russia," he said. "I think they have a good team. 
Always in Russia the margin was really small between their (worst) team and 
first team. Now, maybe the margin is a little bigger, but they're still a good 
team. Four or five teams can win here, and I think we have a strong team." 
</P>
<P>
 Finland's best Olympic showing was a silver medal in 1988. 
</P>

 Being chosen the first flag-bearer in Slovakia's first Olympic appearance was 
beautiful," said Peter Stastny, the former Quebec Nordique and New Jersey Devil 
standout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't only spectacular, it was a lifetime experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only achievement he could imagine that might surpass it would be for 
Slovakia to win an Olympic game here, an accomplishment it narrowly missed 
Sunday in a 4-4 tie with Sweden. Slovakia is seeded 12th in the 12-team Olympic 
field. Sweden is seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have won, but I'll take it," said Stastny, who scored Slovakia's 
third goal. "I'm very proud today." 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia became an independent nation in July, 1992, and was not represented 
at the 1993 World Championships. Stastny, a fervent backer of Slovakian 
independence, agreed to represent the new country last fall even though he was 
37 and had planned to return to Quebec this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand, we were over 1,000 years out of independence," he 
said. "During World War II we had five years of a Slovak state, but that was 
all. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "All my dreams came true. To carry the flag, play for my national team and 
helping the country enjoy the sport, that's very, very special to me." HELENE

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; U.S. COMES BACK TO TIE FRANCE, 4-4; 
HOCKEY: TWO GOALS IN THE THIRD PERIOD MAKE UP FOR TWO EARLIER REPLAY CALLS A 
GAINST THE AMERICANS.

 They saw their 4-4 tie with France as a form of justice, that by scoring two 
late and improbable goals against goaltender Petri Ylonen on Sunday, they were 
rewarded for their tenacity and granted retribution for calls that had gone 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one on the U.S. Olympic hockey team acknowledged how lucky it was that 
Ylonen fanned on Peter Laviolette's 60-foot flip shot with 8:37 to play in 
their tournament opener, or how doubly blessed they were when Ylonen misjudged 
Brian Rolston's wrist shot from deep on the left side with 6:02 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenacious? Maybe. A lesser team might have given up after a short-handed 
breakaway by Pierrick Maia put France ahead, 4-2, at 7:48 of the third period 
before 8,145 at Hakon Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous, tentative and utterly ineffective on seven consecutive power plays? 
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Ylonen's shaky play, the U.S. team, seeded sixth in the 12-team field, 
would be near the bottom of its group. Thanks to Ylonen, the U.S. stands in a 
cluster of four teams tied for second behind Group B leader Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he was letting in goals he should have let in in the first and second 
period," Rolston said of Ylonen. "That goalie, I take my hat off to him. He 
played a great game in the first two periods. You definitely question yourself 
when you dominate the first two periods and you're not ahead. You definitely 
shake your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defenseman Brett Hauer, whose holding penalty with 1:56 to play made the 
final minutes tense: "People ask me how upset and disappointed we are. You've 
got to realize we were two goals down. We're not jumping up and down, but we 
showed a lot of character to come back and get the tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played a good game. At times we're going to get running around. 
This is a huge ice surface and European teams are good at holding onto the puck 
and delaying it and chipping it in. . . . We fought through the tough replay 
decisions, whether right or wrong, and we showed a lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
 They needed character and resilience to pull even with the 10th-seeded French 
team, which had only 14 shots on Mike Dunham compared to 32 at Ylonen. They 
also needed resilience to overcome their disappointment when an apparent goal 
by Peter Ciavaglia was disallowed at 8:22 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Marko Lepaus of Finland, after consulting replays, ruled Ciavaglia 
used his right foot to direct a shot by Ted Crowley into the net, waving off a 
goal that would have given the United States a 3-1 lead. France, which had 
benefited from a replay on its first goal -- a shot by Christophe Ville that 
bounced off Frank Saunier's skate -- tied the score in the second period and 
surged ahead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come from behind as we did, from being down two goals, was somewhat of a 
moral victory for our young team," U.S. Coach Tim Taylor said. "For the most 
part, we played the kind of game we wanted to play. We had a lot of pressure in 
the French end. Unfortunately, we were ineffective on the power play, and that 
was our downfall tonight. Five on five we had a huge edge in shots and 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:04 of the first period, John Lilley converted Mark Beaufait's pass-out 
from behind the net. France pulled even at 15:16, but the United States 
regained the lead when Peter Ferraro's shot dribbled through Ylonen's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauer's turnover in the neutral zone led to France's second goal, at 18:07 of 
the second period. Franck Pajonkowski broke away from Hauer and Ferraro for a 
shot that ticked off Dunham's pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have had that one and the third one," Dunham said of Banjamin 
Agnel's wrist shot at 2:36 of the third period. "It's tough to get into the 
game when they have only four shots in the first period. I felt like I was back 
at (the University of) Maine, where I'd get only five, six, seven shots a 
period because we were down at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 Maia's shorthanded goal from the right circle let Dunham and the other U.S. 
players know they were in a tougher game than they had expected even though 
they had played a 4-4 tie with France on Feb. 5 in a pre-Olympic tournament in 
Rouen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take the positive out of it," Dunham said. "I know I feel a lot 
better now with one game behind me. You can prepare all you want, but I finally 
got out there and realized what was going on and what was at stake and I was a 
little nervous. It was a game I was playing not to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're a good team and we should have won tonight. They played a solid 
game, but I think if we keep playing the way we did offensively, we'll be all 
right."

 A look at some celebrated cases involving U.S. Olympians:  
</P>
<P>
 1936: Backstroke champion Eleanor Holm was kicked off the U.S. team for 
drinking and shooting craps on the ship as it carried the American contingent 
toward Berlin. Holm, preparing to compete in her third consecutive Olympics, 
was married to Hollywood composer Art Jarrett, and enjoyed a lavish life style. 
So, she ignored warnings to moderate her behavior. After Holm had attended an 
afternoon-evening champagne party in Cherbourg, France, where the ship had a 
stopover, the U.S. Olympic Committee disqualified her because of what it said 
was uproarious behavior. The next day, she went to the stateroom of Avery 
Brundage, committee president, to plead her case. Brundage refused to change 
the decision. More than half the U.S. team signed a petition asking for Holm's 
reinstatement, but she never swam in the Olympics again. 
</P>
<P>
 1968: John Carlos and Tommie Smith were expelled from the U.S. Olympic team 
after their black-power salute during the U.S. national anthem in Mexico City. 
The sprinters, who had won the gold and bronze medals in the 200 meters, were 
protesting the plight of African Americans. No record was kept on how officials 
handled the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: A group of U.S. athletes, bitterly charging that the U.S. Olympic 
Committee had overstepped its authority in ruling against U.S. participation in 
the Moscow Games, sued to have the decision overturned. Twenty athletes, led by 
rower Anita DeFrantz, filed a class-action suit in U.S. District Court in 
Washington. The court ruled the athletes had no Constitutional grounds to sue 
the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 1988: Bruce Kimball, charged with vehicular manslaughter, competed in the U.S. 
Olympic diving trials. He came within two dives of making the team. At the 
time, Kimball was awaiting trial on charges of driving while drunk and running 
into a group of teen-agers, killing two and seriously injuring three. Bob 
Helmick, then-USOC president, said officials discussed the use of the 
code-of-conduct guideline to disqualify Kimball had he made the team. The USOC 
had no jurisdiction over the Olympic trials, run by the U.S. diving federation, 
and could not block him from competing until he made the U.S. team. Kimball was 
convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a Florida prison. He recently was 
paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 1988: Troy Dalbey and Doug Gjertsen were confined to the Olympic village after 
stealing a 60-pound stone mask from a hotel wall, adding to U.S.-Korean 
tensions at the time. Although they were not charged with a crime, the 
gold-medal winning swimmers were disciplined by the Games Administration Board, 
an arm of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: U.S. Olympic officials learned that Olympic shotputter Jim Doehring had 
been convicted of a felony six months before qualifying for the Barcelona 
Games. Doehring had pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess methamphetamine 
with intent to distribute, and was put on five years' probation by a U.S. 
District judge. He also was sentenced to spend five months at a halfway house 
and ordered to perform 125 hours of community service and to participate in a 
drug-treatment program. Still, Doehring was not disqualified because the USOC 
does not have a provision to bar an athlete from competing because of a 
criminal record. "We don't have anything in our constitution that says we can 
kick him off the team," Mike Moran, USOC spokesman, said at the time. Moran 
said once an athlete is selected to the Olympic team, he or she must adhere to 
a code of conduct or risk expulsion. But because Doehring's conviction occurred 
before he qualified, that rule did not apply. Doehring won a silver medal at 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: Sprinter Butch Reynolds was disqualified from competition by the 
International Amateur Athletics Federation, the governing body of track and 
field, after failing a drug test in France. He challenged the test results and 
the case eventually landed in U.S. courts, Reynolds fighting to compete at the 
U.S. Olympic trials. His dispute did not involve the USOC. Reynolds won a 
$27-million judgment against the IAAF, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he 
was eligible to compete at the trials, where he qualified for the 1,600-meter 
relay team. But he lost appeals to the IAAF to have his suspension lifted in 
time to compete in the Barcelona Games. "(Butch) would give up his judgment and 
all the money for the chance to compete in 1992," said Reynolds' attorney, John 
Gall. ELLIOTT ALMOND

'94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER; RUSSIANS DOMINATE PAIRS FIGURE SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of debate about Skategate, and hour upon hour of scrutinizing 
Nancy Kerrigan's and Tonya Harding's practices, figure skating competition 
began Sunday night in the Winter Olympics, and, although neither U.S. woman was 
involved, the opening session was intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because the last two Olympic pairs champions, Russians Ekaterina 
Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov from 1988 and Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur 
Dmitriev from 1992, took advantage of a new International Skating Union rule 
and returned from professional careers to serious competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a cliche to say that they are in a class by themselves, but it is 
nevertheless true that no one else belonged on the same ice with them in the 
technical program at the Olympic Amphitheatre except perhaps the third-place 
pair, 1993 world champions Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first by six of nine judges, Gordeeva and Grinkov were superb, which 
was no revelation. But Mishkutenok and Dmitriev, although not as classically 
elegant, were technically their equals, which was something of a surprise 
because they have been underachieving in practices. "I looked into their souls 
and willed them to skate well," said their colorful coach, Tamara Moskvina. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nicks of Costa Mesa's Ice Capades might have used a similar technique 
because his pair, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, performed the best technical 
program of their 21-month partnership. All it earned them was sixth place 
entering Tuesday night's freestyle program, which accounts for two-thirds of 
the final score, but the competition is more daunting than ever before in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did what we came to do, which is skate the best we could," Meno 
said. "There's no reason to be disappointed. Four of the teams ahead of us 
finished among the top five in the Olympics in 1992, and we weren't even 
together then." 
</P>
<P>
 The other U.S. pairs, Karen Courtland and Toddy Reynolds and Kyoko Ina and 
Jason Dungjen, were 13th and 15th, respectively.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; POLITICS OF THE WORLD CUP KEEP SPORT'S LEADERS ON THEIR 
TOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Little that the public servants in Washington can dish up is as ruthless, 
back-stabbing and calculating as the politics of international sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the U.S. Soccer Federation has heard the jingle-jangle of sponsor 
dollars and felt the warm glow of the spotlight, its politics are getting as 
ugly as its international brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 USSF president Alan Rothenberg is increasingly on the receiving end of attacks 
in ongoing political skirmishes. With Rothenberg's profile, this is to be 
expected. The problem is not that there are attacks, but with the form they 
take. Some of the methods have been sophomoric, such as the anonymous Top 10 
spoof that was distributed at the Final Draw that belittled the personal lives 
of World Cup officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Legitimate concerns about Rothenberg's stewardship of the USSF as well as the 
World Cup organizing committee get lost in the petty sniping and obvious 
jealousy. The other problem is that few in the soccer family are willing to 
demonstrate that they have courage of their convictions. They complain 
endlessly, they allege, they hint, but they seldom speak on the record or put 
their name to paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently. A letter written by Louis Palivos, president of the Illinois 
State Soccer Assn., was circulated last week, and it raised concerns about the 
financial accounting of the World Cup. Presented in the form of a resolution, 
it called for both the World Cup and the USSF to open their financial records 
and it raised questions about possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg dismissed the allegations made in the letter as "utter nonsense." 
He also sent a letter in response to state association presidents and the World 
Cup board of directors. His letter calls the resolution a "scurrilous document 
falsely accusing the officers and directors of the United States Soccer 
Federation and the World Cup Organizing Committee of a litany of illegal, 
unethical and secret activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said last week that the resolutions did not reflect the feelings of 
the soccer community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the Illnois association," Rothenberg said. "It's one idiot. It's an 
example of soccer federation politics at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Palivos, a Chicago attorney, said the high-stakes financial dealings of the 
World Cup and their ramifications on the future of soccer in the United States 
makes full disclosure imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of us who are genuinely concerned about all the things in 
the letter," Palivos said. "We think these are reasonable questions: What money 
is coming in? Where is the money going? How much are they getting paid? We in 
the state federations are part of soccer, and we believe we have a right to 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said the USSF and the World Cup's books are open for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no secrets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. 
</P>

 World Cup '94 joined soccer tradition with last month's earthquake. Twice 
before a devastating earthquake threatened World Cup preparations -- Chile in 
1962 and Mexico in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Impoverished Chile was already on the brink when the earthquake struck, 
further crippling the nation's infrastructure. Arguing that the World Cup 
should not be taken from his country, Chilean Football Federation president 
Carlos Dittborn implored, "We must have the World Cup because we have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico played host to the World Cup by default, after FIFA determined the the 
violence and political uncertainty in Colombia had grown too desperate. The 
quake that hit Mexico City in September of 1985 only served to galvanize public 
sentiment to the World Cup, and ease, in some way, the pain of rebuilding a 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the 1994 World Cup has experienced riots, floods, fires and 
earthquakes -- in one venue. But the damage came to the Coliseum, not the Rose 
Bowl, where eight games will be played, including the final. There was some 
minor damage at World Cup headquarters in Century City, but the biggest 
headache the earthquake engendered for the organizers is logistic -- how to 
transport FIFA officials from their westside hotels to Pasadena with a portion 
of the 10 freeway out of commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, soccer games at the Coliseum have been rescheduled: Mexico and 
Sweden will play at Fresno State on Feb. 24, and two games have been scheduled 
for East L.A. College -- Colombia and South Korea on Feb. 26 and Bolivia and 
the Mexico City club team Pumas on Feb. 27. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials caution not to make too much of Disney's recent pullout of 
the opening and closing ceremony. Neither side is being specific about the 
split, but Rothenberg said the differences centered on the use of Disney 
characters. "We wanted a soccer event with Disney characters," Rothenberg said. 
"Of course, they wanted it to be nothing but a Disney commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 No contracts had been signed and Disney and World Cup entertainment executives 
are currently working on a Spanish language World Cup television special. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chuck Gayton, vice president of entertainment productions for 
World Cup, the opening ceremony in Chicago and the closing ceremony in Pasadena 
will be produced by separate companies. In addition, each of the seven other 
venues will have a closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayton said the opening and closing ceremonies will last about 30 minutes and 
can be expected to feature the kind of glitz and high production values that 
American productions are known for. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be a dull moment," Gayton said. Soccer Notes

 The English Football Assn. wants to renegotiate its contract with Wembley 
Stadium, which runs through 2002, because it claims that the stadium takes too 
high a cut of the revenue from international matches. Wembley has for 
generations been the premier venue for top soccer in England. The dispute, if 
not settled, could affect the 1996 European Championship final, which is 
scheduled to be held at Wembley. . . . What does the folding of the Tampa Bay 
Rowdies, the country's oldest professional soccer club, say about the viability 
of pro soccer in the United States? . . . The city of Pasadena will hold a 
World Cup celebration Feb. 25 starting at 11 a.m. at Centennial Square.

THIS SEASON, LOCALE A FACTOR IN MAKING PLAYOFF PAIRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boys' basketball coaches in the Southern Section were in for plenty of 
surprises when the playoff pairings were released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the field has continued to shrink from two years ago when every 
school was allowed to participate in the postseason.This season, 217 teams in 
10 divisions were guaranteed berths and another 36 received at-large bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who qualified also found a different procedure used for setting the 
brackets. The section's basketball advisory committee put more emphasis on 
geography and less on equity to come up with the pairings. 
</P>
<P>
 This was done in an attempt to lessen travel problems and costs, which were 
expected to escalate because of freeway and road problems caused by last 
month's earthquake. As a result, teams from the same league could meet as early 
as the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we dropped some of our regular rules, the brackets were certainly 
easier to set," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner. "We tried to 
regionalize the pairings as much as possible, and at the same time maintain as 
much balance as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller field and regionalized brackets were not as tough to take for many 
coaches as the fact the many divisions begin the playoffs as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the first round of the playoffs started on Friday. This season, 
four divisions open on Tuesday.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; TALK DOESN'T BOTHER ARIZONA, 96-77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arizona won twice Sunday, beating California on the court at Berkeley and in a 
running war of words. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16th-ranked Wildcats emerged with a 96-77 victory over the No. 18 Golden 
Bears in a Pacific 10 Conference game that pitted trash-talking players against 
each other. Even the coaches got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-year Cal Coach Todd Bozeman and 11th-year Arizona Coach Lute Olson got 
into an angry exchange with 1:38 to play. Olson interrupted Bozeman's 
complaints to officials by yelling, "What's your problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your problem?" Bozeman shot back. "Oh, sit down!" Olson screamed. "No, 
you sit down, you sit down!" Bozeman shouted. They ended the exchange by 
cursing each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 19-4 overall and 8-3 in the Pac-10, ended Cal's six-game winning 
streak by going on a 22-0 run after the Bears (16-5, 8-3) had rallied from a 
14-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Massachusetts 56, No. 8 Temple 55 -- Playing in his second game after 
collapsing on the court against Cincinnati on Jan. 27, Mike Williams made a 
jumper with three seconds remaining to give the Minutemen an Atlantic 10 
Conference victory at Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who finished with 17 points, underwent a battery of tests. He was 
cleared to play last week and returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donta Bright made two free throws to put the Minutemen (18-4, 10-0) ahead, 
54-53, with 11 seconds left. Temple (17-4, 10-3) had a final chance to win, but 
Aaron McKie's jump shot at the buzzer bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Michigan 72, Ohio State 70 -- The Wolverines almost squandered a 
seven-point lead in the last 90 seconds before holding on for a Big Ten 
Conference victory at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled Michigan (17-4, 9-2) to retain sole possession of the 
conference lead. Ohio State is 10-12 and 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton 82, No. 17 St. Louis 77 -- Shawn Haughn scored 30 points and made all 
eight of his three-point shots to help the Flyers (5-14, 1-6) rally from a 
12-point deficit to upset the Billikens (19-2, 5-2) in overtime in a Great 
Midwest Conference game at Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Haughn, who helped the Flyers end an 11-game losing streak, matched the NCAA 
record for three-point accuracy set by Tomas Tompson of San Francisco in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 89, No. 22 Marquette 82 -- Dontonio Wingfield and Damon Flint each 
made two baskets in the second overtime to give the Bearcats (16-7, 4-4) a 
Great Midwest victory over the Warriors (16-6, 7-2) at Milwaukee.

 Randolph Childress scored 22 points in the second half and Wake Forest spoiled 
Duke's shot at the No. 1 ranking Sunday with a 78-69 upset of the second-ranked 
Blue Devils in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Childress, who finished with 28 points, almost single-handedly helped Wake 
Forest, 16-7 overall, 6-4 in the ACC, to its first season-series sweep of Duke 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (17-3, 8-3) was poised to overtake ACC rival North Carolina as the top 
team in the country after the top-ranked Tar Heels were upset by Georgia Tech 
on Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 13, with Duke ready to climb over the Tar Heels for No. 1, Childress 
made a three-point basket to give the Demon Deacons a 69-68 victory.This time, 
Childress did the bulk of his damage from the free-throw line. He made nine of 
10 free throws in the last 3:20.

SANTA ANITA; THE WICKED NORTH WINS SAN ANTONIO HANDICAP BY 4 1/2 LENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Slew of Damascus broke through the gate, dumped Pat Valenzuela and ran 
off shortly before the start of Sunday's San Antonio Handicap, jockey Kent 
Desormeaux and trainer David Bernstein were already adding up their winning 
shares from the $268,000 Santa Anita stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nice," said Desormeaux, who then rode The Wicked North to a 4 
1/2-length victory. "The Man Upstairs must like us." 
</P>
<P>
 With Slew Of Damascus scratched from the San Antonio at 5-1, the pressure was 
off The Wicked North; both horses have a front-running style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slew Of Damascus coming out of there was a blessing," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North, a 5-year-old who has run only 13 times since his owner, 
Philip Hersh, bought the grandson of Northern Dancer for $10,000 at a yearling 
auction, dueled with Star Recruit through modest fractions for three-quarters 
of a mile, then pulled away in the stretch. The Wicked North's sixth victory, 
worth $155,500, was the biggest of his career and sets him up for the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grabbed himself (kicked a leg) when he ran off," said Craig Roberts, Slew 
Of Damascus' trainer. "I don't think it's anything serious. If he had run well 
in this race, he would have been 90-10 to run in the Santa Anita Handicap. Now, 
since he's missed a race, he's 50-50 for the race. We'll also look at the 
Arcadia Handicap (a $100,000 race that's also March 5)." 
</P>
<P>
 More disappointing than Slew Of Damascus, who's on a four-race winning streak, 
was Best Pal, who got the chance to run and did nothing with it. Flirting with 
the $5-million earnings mark, Best Pal was the 9-5 favorite Sunday. He was last 
at the start, 11 lengths away from the lead, and finished seventh in the 
nine-horse field, more than 10 lengths behind The Wicked North. Best Pal hasn't 
won an open race since his victory in the Hollywood Gold Cup 7 1/2 months ago. 
"Nothing would have helped us today," said Best Pal's owner, John Mabee, 
referring to the Slew Of Damascus incident. "We had no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing second, Hill Pass was disqualified to third place, with 
Region, whom he had beaten by a half-length, being moved up to second place by 
the three stewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither jockey Chris McCarron nor Hill Pass' trainer, Jack Van Berg, agreed 
with the decision, which stemmed from tight quarters at the three-sixteenths 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other horse tried to go into a spot where he didn't have room to go," Van 
Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 If McCarron receives a five-day suspension, he would be prevented from riding 
Dehere, one of the early Kentucky Derby favorites, in the Fountain of Youth 
Stakes on Saturday at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North is one of the largest horses on the grounds, going well over 
1,000 pounds, and he was even bigger, maybe 1,300 pounds, when Bernstein was 
sprinting him. His last victory on dirt was in the six-furlong Bing Crosby 
Handicap at Del Mar 6 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux was aboard The Wicked North for the first time since he 
successfully rode the horse at the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my chances were slim after my horse got so worked up before the 
race," Desormeaux said Sunday. "He was absolutely drenched (with sweat). But my 
chances increased when Slew Of Damascus broke through the gate. So we got to 
gallop on the lead and I had plenty of horse to come home with." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania, last year's national sprint champion, didn't run in the San Antonio 
because of a cracked cannon bone in his left hind leg and was to undergo 
surgery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North's time for 1 1/8 miles was 1:47 2/5 and he paid $14.80 as the 
fourth betting choice. He carried 116 pounds, five less than top-weighted Best 
Pal. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, Fly'n J. Bryan, who won his first start, on Jan. 22, while 
running six furlongs in 1:08 2/5, moved into stakes company for trainer Doug 
Peterson and won the $103,825 San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes by two lengths 
over Gracious Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Vicente was a furlong farther than Fly'n J. Bryan's debut. "Mentally, 
this horse will go long," Corey Black said. "I mean, he'll relax enough to go 
long. You never know until you try them. I'm sure he'll go a mile. Beyond that, 
we'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan has been on the lead in both of his victories. Peterson wasn't 
sure about the 3-year-old colt's next race. 
</P>
<P>
 Correcting an item in the Daily Racing Form that was excerpted in The Times, 
trainer Wayne Lukas said that his son, Jeff, may leave the hospital in three or 
four weeks to begin treatment at a rehabilitation center. "We're very pleased 
with his progress, but he has a long way to go," Lukas said. "He has taken 
solid food, but not consistently. He's taking meals the next couple of days to 
see how well his stomach can handle it. He is participating in both physical 
and group therapy four hours a day, and he's walking with the aid of a walker."

 Sandis Ozolinsh scored with 1:59 remaining to give the San Jose Sharks a 1-0 
victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozolinsh was too deep in the offensive zone and not in good position to get

THIS LONG HITTER LEAVES THEM SHORT, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are different ways to lose golf tournaments, and Fred Couples chose the 
most frustrating one at Riviera Country Club on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his head-to-head matchup with Corey Pavin at the Nissan Los Angeles Open, 
Couples came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 He came up short on No. 6, on No. 7, on No. 8 and on 14. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of paradox that golf thrives on, how the longest hitter on 
the PGA Tour gets beat in the final round because he can't make the shortest 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left them all short," Couples said of his putting. "I couldn't get a real 
good feel." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't all that bad, Couples insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I putted like a clown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin shot a 68 to win by two strokes while Couples had a two-birdie, 
two-bogey round of 71. Pavin needed only 25 putts for 18 holes, but Couples had 
33. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Couples was asked to assess his round: "There's not a lot I can say 
because I didn't do much." 
</P>
<P>
 He had chances, though. Couples missed eight-foot birdie putts at No. 10 and 
No. 11 that would have put him even with Pavin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after he finally caught Pavin at No. 12, Couples made a costly putting 
mistake on the par-three 14th. Couples stood over 20-foot putt for birdie and 
left it 2 1/2 feet short. He missed that one, too, for a three-putt bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has happened to Couples this year is that he has pretty much 
perfected finishing second. His runner-up finish Sunday is his second in two 
official PGA Tour events, counting the Mercedes Championship at La Costa where 
he lost a playoff to Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Costa really hurt because it could have been a great way to start the 
year," Couples said. "This, no, this was a fun day. It's great to come here and 
play. Someone's going to win. If I don't win, I'd like to finish second." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, finishing second can be very lucrative. Couples has won 
$228,134 in his two official events, but that doesn't count the $100,000 he 
received for a second-place finish in Thailand last week and the reported 
$100,000 appearance fee he got for playing in Dubai, which Couples chose to do 
instead of playing Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples will skip the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic next week so he can work with 
his golf teacher, Paul Marchand, the pro at the Houston Country Club. Couples 
will return to the tour the second week of March at the Honda Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I can come back out and play well," he said. "I don't think I'm 
playing terrible. I seem to be very close. That's probably a weak statement to 
make because I almost won my two times out." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Los Angeles Open champion might have won Sunday if the ball had 
rolled a little farther for him. He said Riviera is his favorite course and 
that the greens were easy to read and he got used to them quickly. The putts 
were there for him to make, but he simply didn't do it often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Couples said it's important to remember one thing about putting on the 
last day of a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 We're pretty clear on that.

ANOTHER BAVASI TAKES CHARGE OF THE ANGELS; SINS OF THE FATHER NOT LOST ON THE 
SON, FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His father used to savor these moments, cherishing every last detail. He had 
these news conferences mastered. Strut to the podium, smile for the cameras and 
drop the bombshell that would captivate the town for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie Bavasi would have been in all his glory this Jan. 31 afternoon, 
standing in front of a packed house and telling the world that Bo Jackson was 
coming to the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't have left the room before the last reporter departed, making sure 
that every last notebook was filled. Buzzie was the only general manager in 
baseball who could have 10 reporters drop in on him during a baseball game and 
have each of them believing they had a scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 33 years as general manager of the Dodgers, San Diego Padres and 
Angels and never ran away from a pen or tape recorder in his life. Buzzie loved 
the limelight. And it loved him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie, bless his heart, would have recoiled in horror if he had been around 
this day to witness the Bo Jackson press conference. There was his son, his 
flesh and blood, sitting on the dais during the entire news conference without 
saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, 36, hired a month ago as Angel general manager, was presented the 
opportunity of a lifetime to display himself to the world. Instead, he sat 
silent, dutifully answered a few questions afterward and then slipped quietly 
away to the sanctuary of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, who now uses the same office his dad once occupied, was asked how it 
feels knowing that he's the man responsible for returning Jackson to Southern 
California, this time to play baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he shrugged. "I was just hoping I wasn't remembered as the man 
who lost Steve Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, this isn't like General Patton taking over the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Bill Bavasi scrambling." 
</P>
<P>
 His birth certificate says he's a Bavasi -- the third family member to be a 
major league general manager -- but you would never know he was even a distant 
cousin by his personality. 
</P>
<P>
 This is as humble and unassuming a person as you'll find in all of baseball. 
He believes he's no more important to the Angels than his own secretaries. He 
doesn't own a Mercedes or BMW, choosing instead to drive a Bronco or the 
10-year-old family Volvo. He still takes his 6-year-old son to school, and 
telephones his wife every night he's away. He demands input from his employees, 
refusing to make a decision without them. 
</P>
<P>
 For God's sake, the Angels will tell you, there are clubhouse attendants who 
have bigger egos than Bavasi. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't know any better," said Whitey Herzog, former Angel general 
manager, "you'd never know he was a Bavasi. He's very, very modest, and that's 
not a Bavasi trait. 
</P>
<P>
 "But believe me, this guy is going to be every bit as good as his dad and 
brother, and probably better. He may not toot his own horn, but there are going 
to be people tooting it for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll be right there at the front of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, when Bill Bavasi joined the Angels, I was afraid that one day he 
would become general manager. Now, every Angel fan's worst nightmare has come 
true -- another Bavasi running the team. We can expect more bad trades, seeing 
the best players leave as free agents, and no strategy or commitment to putting 
a winning team on the field." -- Letter to the editor, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Life as a Bavasi was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to be a better baseball player than all of his friends . . . 
because of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He had kids in school who wanted to get close to him . . . because of his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 He listened to critics tell him that he was handed a job in baseball . . . 
because of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretended it wasn't out there," Bavasi said, "but I knew it was. Growing up 
around baseball, you learn to roll with the punches. That's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, who grew up having Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax drop by the house on 
Sunday evenings, made a habit of never volunteering his ancestry. Certainly, no 
one could figure it out on their own. He quit playing baseball in high school. 
He attended the University of San Diego but majored in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't associate the name with Bill," said Steve Wesierski, his 
college roommate and best man. "He didn't walk or talk the part of being a 
high-profile guy. I mean, you really had to push. Most people who went to the 
University of San Diego probably never knew who his father was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt that he was better than everyone, but it seemed like he already 
had life mapped out. I think he always knew that one day he'd be a general 
manager." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bavasi knew how he'd spend the rest of his life, he wasn't dropping any 
hints. His friends can't recall him divulging his career aspirations, but 
instead can vividly recall his antics at toga parties. They still laugh at the 
day they gathered for a mud bowl football game, and when they headed out for 
breakfast, Bavasi sat the entire time wearing water polo head gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the only preferential treatment he received for being Buzzie's kid 
was that he got a job on the grounds crew at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
Even after graduation, his first job was as a glorified secretary in the 
scouting department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the son of a general manager can help, but also be a big hindrance," 
said Padre General Manager Randy Smith, the son of Tal Smith. "You feel 
sometimes that you have to be twice as good as anybody else to overcome your 
last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you have to prove yourself all the time so that people don't think 
you just got something handed to you. Billy and I can relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Whispers of nepotism stopped the moment people met him. He was just like 
everyone else. He was promoted to farm director in 1984, and so little was made 
of his background that many players had no idea he was related to Buzzie. 
Former Angel infielder Bobby Grich remembers the time he walked into Bill's 
office, started to grumble about Buzzie and was horrified to learn he was 
talking to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years were spent in the same job, but Bavasi never minded, content in 
trying to become the best damn farm director in baseball. He watched several 
members of his generation being promoted to general manager, but never was he 
fazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom used to get on me," Bavasi said. "She used to tell me, 'Go to the 
All-Star game. Go to the World Series. Go where people will see you there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I refused. I wasn't going to play politics just to get noticed. It was very 
evident there were some guys who became farm directors or scouting directors 
were going places just to be seen in all of the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did anything to get noticed in my life, and I'm proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi's demeanor was so utterly unpretentious that the first day rumors 
circulated he would become general manager of the Angels, he immediately went 
in and apologized to Dan O'Brien and Herzog. He didn't want to take anyone's 
job, and as far as he was concerned, he'd stay put until everyone was good and 
ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my brother," said Peter, 51, his eldest sibling. "His ego quotient is 
very low. It's hardly even a blip on the radar screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi didn't even bother addressing the office staff when he became general 
manager. The only new rule was that he wanted messages limited to two minutes 
on the voice mail. Certainly, he wasn't demanding, arriving at 9 every morning, 
leaving at 5 and wondering why the rest of the world gets stressed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like all the best qualities of Mr. B and his sons are all rolled into 
Bill," said Kathy Carey, who has been a secretary for four members of the 
Bavasi clan. "I don't know how to prescribe him. It's not that he's laid back, 
but just so, uh, mellow. His temperament is not extreme either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, he's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tim Mead, Angel assistant general manager: "He's a throwback to the '60s 
without the long hair and beads. To this day, I've never seen him lose his 
temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest tribute to Bill Bavasi is that in my 13 years with the Angels, 
I've never heard a player in our clubhouse run him down. To me, that's 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The man is completely unflappable, and his sense of humor is uncanny. The day 
the letter to the editor appeared, Wesierski telephoned him and read it aloud. 
Bavasi jumped off the phone and immediately went scrounging for the newspaper. 
He actually wanted to find it, cut it out and keep it for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 Really. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," Bavasi said. "I wanted to show my wife (Tracy). It 
shows how quickly you can be a nobody in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute you understand that you're a a genius when you win, and a bum when 
you lose, you can relax." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "None of my boys ever wanted to be president of the United States, but they 
all wanted to be GM of a baseball team." -- Buzzie Bavasi 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie and his wife, Evit, insist that they never prodded, provoked or even 
persuaded their four sons to enter this crazy baseball business. Yet, everyone 
but Chris developed a passion for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Peter, whose personality most resembles that of his father. He once 
was general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians and now is 
president of Sportsticker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I called up Billy and congratulated him," Peter said, "I told him that 
he's now a future ex-GM. Hey, doesn't everyone gets fired in this business?" 
</P>
<P>
 There's Chris, 47, whose first job in baseball was shuttling beer kegs at 
Dodger Stadium. It would be his last. He went to Northern Arizona University, 
fell in love with Flagstaff and today is mayor of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here with every intent of going back," Chris said, "but this place 
really grows on you. I just never developed the interest in baseball like my 
brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Bob, 40, who has owned the Class A Everett (Wash.) Giants for the past 
10 years. He still remembers how Buzzie and Peter scouted the church where Bob 
got married in 1981, trying to find the pews with the best reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had impeccable credentials for baseball," Bob said, "because I got a birth 
certificate with the right name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Bill, the first son in baseball history to become a general 
manager with the same club and ownership as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt in my mind that he'd eventually make it," Buzzie said. "Of 
all my sons, I knew he'd be the one who's get into baseball. He's going to be a 
great one, because he's learned from all our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie, 78, taught his boys everything he knew about the game, and as mementos 
of his affection, he and Evit presented his four World Series championship 
rings to their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys each randomly selected a ring at Buzzie's 70th birthday party in 
1985, and Bill wound up drawing the most cherished of the collection. It was 
the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers' championship ring, the only one ever won in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done my share," Buzzie says. "Now it's up to Bill to start a new family 
collection."

CAPISTRANO VALLEY SAVING ITS STRENGTH; WRESTLING: COUGARS WILL FORGO DUAL-MEET

<P>
 What appeared to be the biggest surprise of the pairings for the Southern 
Section dual-meet team wrestling playoffs proved to be no surprise at all. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pairings were announced Sunday, the absence of South Coast League 
champion Capistrano Valley in the Division I draw wasn't the glaring omission 
many thought it was. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, the only top-10 county team excluded in the Division I, II, III 
or IV playoff draws, chose not to enter dual-team postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a lot of calls about it," Capistrano Valley Coach Joe Zeller 
said. "We decided we didn't want to go to duals with the rest of (the Southern 
Section playoffs) coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeller's reasoning, which the majority of his team shared, was that the dual 
championships -- beginning with Wednesday's first round -- are scheduled too 
close to the section individual championships Friday and Saturday. The Cougars 
simply didn't want to spread themselves too thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sending 10 wrestlers to individuals," he said. "If they do both, they 
have to hold weight three days, and that's tough. Most of them felt, let's just 
go with individuals . . . We probably would have done well, but if you don't 
get to finals, the kids don't get that much out of it. They just get beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the duals will be scheduled at least a week in advance of the 
individual tournament, to the relief of many coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Coach Cliff Jarmie, whose Hawks are seeded second in the Division 
III draw -- defending State champion Calvary Chapel is top-seeded -- said the 
change can't come quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, teams are done early, so (wrestlers) can concentrate on 
individuals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Laguna Hills, winner of seven consecutive Pacific Coast League 
titles, will concentrate on Wednesday's opponent, Corona Centennial. A victory 
would have the Hawks facing the winner of Sunny Hills-Long Beach Millikan in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough draw," Jarmie said. "We're going to use it as a practice setting 
with individuals in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III pairings showcase several county teams, including co-Freeway 
League champions Buena Park and Sunny Hills and Sea View League champion 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I, top-seeded El Modena, San Clemente, Orange League champion 
Anaheim and at-large Edison will wrestle at El Modena and at-large Brea-Olinda 
and Sunset League champion Santa Ana compete at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II, Empire League champion and at-large Los Alamitos compete at 
West Torrance. County Division IV participants are Garden Grove and Los Amigos.

NEWPORT HARBOR'S HEADS PULLS HER WEIGHT; ATHLETICS: HER TRADEMARK IN 
BASKETBALL, TRACK AND FIELD OR WEIGHTLIFTING IS DEDICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A startled Gina Heads looked toward her coach with wide-eyed confusion on 
hearing the referee's screeching whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor guard was called for a foul while setting a pick during 
summer-league play before her junior year, and she did not understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 When Heads sought an explanation, the referee pointed to an opposing player 
sitting on the gym floor several feet away. The player was still shaking her 
head after the collision with Heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I pushed her, but she just ran into me and bounced off," Heads said. 
"He probably thought that was the only way I could have made her bounce like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he did not know Heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he would fall down if he ran into Gina," Sailor Coach Shannon 
Jakosky said. "Most people can't tell how unbelievably strong she is -- until 
they play against her." 
</P>
<P>
 A record-setting weightlifter, the Sailor senior might be the strongest player 
in the county, despite her diminutive stature (5 feet 3). Heads has also 
parlayed her dedication to weightlifting into a standout career in the discus 
and shotput, events usually mastered by athletes several inches taller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people still think women lifting weights is odd," Heads said, 
"but it's what makes me the athlete I am in basketball and track." 
</P>
<P>
 Heads, 17, has been a member of the Newport Harbor varsity basketball team 
since her freshman year. She is a three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-captain, Heads was selected to the All-Sea View League first team as a 
junior while averaging eight points, eight rebounds and four steals. Jakosky 
said her play was a key in the Sailors capturing their first league title. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been a steadying force again this season. Heads averaged nine points, 
five rebounds, five assists and five steals as Newport Harbor finished second 
in league (19-6, 12-2 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 "Gina really is our defense," Jakosky said. "Her weightlifting has made her so 
quick and strong that most gals hate to be guarded by Gina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call basketball her 'hobby' sport because her main focus is weightlifting 
and track, but she's got a lot out of basketball because of how strong she is 
and how hard she works." 
</P>
<P>
 Heads' love of track piqued her interest in weights. 
</P>
<P>
 She began lifting as a freshman at Newport Harbor to improve her distance in 
the the discus and shotput. It wasn't long before she no longer needed coaches' 
mandates to lift. 
</P>
<P>
 And the work paid off -- quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads has qualified for the State track championships every year. Last season, 
she finished fourth in the shotput with a distance of 43 feet 6 inches, and 
placed sixth in the discus at 139-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm so short, I really needed to get stronger to make good throws," 
Heads said. "As soon as I got into (weightlifting) I saw how much it could help 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also felt I was getting good quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Tony Ciarelli. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant coach in football and track at Newport Harbor, Ciarelli was 
impressed with Heads' strength and how quickly she learned proper weightlifting 
technique. He began working with her individually and encouraged her to lift 
competitively. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has competed in only five sanctioned meets, Heads was ranked 
seventh in the nation in her weight class (76 kilograms; 154-167 1/2 pounds) by 
the U.S. Weightlifting Federation in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She was second among juniors (ages 17-20) and set a national junior record in 
the clean-and-jerk with a lift of 92.5 kilos (203 3/4 pounds) during December 
at the American Open in San Anselmo, north of San Francisco. What's more, her 
younger sister, Cara, is also a promising weightlifter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gina has great natural strength and she has a perfect body for weightlifting 
because of her low center of gravity," Ciarelli said. "And like lots of great 
athletes in any sport, Gina learns what you tell her to do quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 She learns at the same rate in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads has a 3.6 grade-point average and plans to become a veterinarian, 
specializing in care of large animals. She is being recruited by Stanford in 
track and also is considering Brown and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 She will continue to compete in weightlifting, hoping to compete in the 
Olympics. A spokesman for the U.S. Weightlifting Federation said the 
organization is working to make the sport an Olympic event for women, possibly 
by 2000 in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 That would please Heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not good enough to make it (to the Olympics) in basketball or track, but 
I think maybe I could in weightlifting," Heads said. "That would be great."

TRABUCO HILLS SEES THE SHIFT IN PAIRINGS; BASKETBALL: MOVING UP IN DIVISIONS 
MEANS TALENTED TEAMS RATHER THAN JUST ONE STAR PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills boys' basketball Coach Rainer Wulf won't be seeing any stars in 
the playoffs this season -- not on the court, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the Mustangs have had to wade through the Division II-A 
playoffs. A tough task, considering the quality of players in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, there was Charles O'Bannon (Artesia), Avondre Jones (Artesia), 
Jacque Vaughn (Pasadena Muir), Jelani Gardner (Bellflower St. John Bosco) and 
James Cotton (Bellflower St. John Bosco). Except for Gardner, all are playing 
on a Division I college team. And Gardner, a senior, is currently being 
recruited by most top colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," Wulf said. "Sooner or later, you were going to hit a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the Mustangs (21-5) moved up to Division II-AA this season. Now, they 
just have to beat teams, not stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the big difference," Wulf said. "All I see in this division is some 
well-coached teams with good high school players." 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the phone, big guy. Sitting out there as the Mustangs' possible 
second-round opponent is Huntington Beach. The Oilers are led by 6-foot-6 Tony 
Gonzalez, Orange County's second-leading scorer, who already has signed with 
California. He might prove to be another immovable object. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica won its first league title in 23 years and a lot of folks credit the 
Mariners' shoot-it-if-you-got-it offense. Not so, said first-year Coach Bob 
Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we're going to have to win games, 95-94," Becker said. "But once a 
few of our guys figured out that we could win games by playing defense, things 
got better." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson took a while. The Mariners lost their first eight summer league 
games, then tightened up. The result was a 23-1 record, a Garden Grove League 
championship and the third seeding in the III-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica plays host to Estancia, which finished third in the Pacific Coast 
League Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Southern Section boys' teams finished the regular season undefeated, 
Mater Dei (26-0) and Riverside North. Mater Dei is the No. 1-seeded team in I-A 
and the division's defending champion. North is the top-seeded team in II-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight was present at the Southern Section office 
Sunday when the pairings were announced. Two years ago when the pairings were 
announced, he took his wife, Judy, to the mountains for a brief rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent most the time pacing around the cabin, so we decided not to do that 
again," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was another important reason for McKnight to stay in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the Little League draft Saturday," said McKnight, who also coaches 
Little League in Mission Viejo. "But I didn't get the player I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Can't win 'em all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: Three important players missed games last week to rest for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Demitrius Zeigler, the county's leading scorer, missed University's game 
Wednesday because of an ankle injury. Schea Cotton sat out Mater Dei's game 
Wednesday because of a back injury. And Ali Ton sat out Los Alamitos' game 
Friday because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler and Cotton played Friday and all three are expected to be in the 
lineup for their eams' first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Santa Margarita's Brian Finneran might return. The 6-5 Finneran, who has 
missed the last six games because of a broken bone in his foot, will be 
examined by his doctor Wednesday, at which time the cast might be removed. If 
cleared, he could return in time for the Eagles' III-AA first-round game Friday 
against La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the cast is removed, he'll start doing light workouts on Thursday," Coach 
Jerry DeBusk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finneran hasn't exactly been a couch potato. He has hobbled around practice 
trying to keep his shot sharp. DeBusk even had a stationary bicycle moved into 
the gymnasium, so Finneran could keep his legs in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1: Mater Dei and Sonora (III-A) were the only county teams to be seeded 
No. 1. Los Alamitos had a chance in I-AA, but the Griffins lost their Empire 
League season finale against Katella and were seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cup of coffee winners: County teams that made the playoffs, but probably won't 
be around too long are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Irvine, which drew Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foothill, which drew Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cypress, which drew top-seeded Dominguez (25-1) in II-A.

TITANS RALLY IN NINTH TO BEAT TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton rallied for five runs in the ninth inning to beat Texas, 
18-14, in a nonconference baseball game Sunday in front of 5,184 at Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the ninth consecutive victory for Cal State Fullerton (10-1), the 
sixth-ranked team in the nation by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the first time Texas has been swept at home since Arizona State 
did it in 1988. Texas (6-3) is ranked ninth by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Tony Miranda opened the ninth with a pinch-hit double 
and scored on a single by Dante Powell to tie the score, 14-14. Infield singles 
by Brian King and Jeff Ferguson loaded the bases and Jim Betzsold walked to

Ricabal started for Fullerton, but gave up 10 runs, six earned, on seven hits.

PICK YOUR SENTIMENTS CAREFULLY; ROSES ARE LOVE; CARNATIONS ARE PASSION. THINK 
BEFORE SENDING YOUR HEART IN THIS FASHION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning to declare your love to your valentine with a bouquet of flowers? 
</P>
<P>
 Think again if you're about to choose the bright, cheerful yellow roses: They 
may communicate to your loved one that you think he or she is unfaithful and 
that you're jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto on the daffodils that are catching your eye. You may think their 
freshness will speak of the coming spring, but they may tell your beloved that 
your sentiments are only regard, not love. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you ready to propose marriage? You just have if you've tucked some ivy 
into the bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "say it with flowers" is truer that many realize. For centuries, 
until the beginning of this one, people commonly exchanged flowers to 
communicate messages -- especially useful in the times when most people 
couldn't read or write. 
</P>
<P>
 Each flower, tree or plant had a meaning, as did their colors. 
</P>
<P>
 From earliest of times, there has been a human fascination with plant 
materials as part of worship, art and cultural festivals. And flowers were a 
part of the rituals and ceremonies of everyday living, as they still are today, 
but with the addition of verbal meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 A few still linger in popular lore: rosemary for remembrance, lilies for 
purity, and laurel for victory -- harking back to the era when victorious Greek 
and Roman athletes, philosophers, poets, soldiers and rulers were crowned with 
laurel wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The art of communicating with flowers probably reached its peak in Victorian 
England, with dozens of books published to explain the intricate messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a craze in England and America to exchange bouquets and 
tussie-mussies," said Shirley Kerins of Huntington Beach, who teaches a class 
in the language of flowers. Kerins is a landscape architect, founder of the 
Orange County Herb Society and curator of the Herb Garden at the Huntington 
Botanical Gardens in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase tussie-mussie owes its origin to an Anglo-Saxon word for "thrown 
together" and refers to fragrant mixed bouquets of flowers and greens that were 
held in the hand or pinned to a garment. Part of their practical use was to 
ward off the foul smells and pestilence that were part of daily life. So the 
tussie-mussie, also known as nosegay, talking bouquet or word poesy, was held 
to the nose for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the custom evolved of using them for romantic exchanges of 
sentiments, especially convenient in the repressive atmosphere of Victorian 
times when women were closely chaperoned. The same is true for the language of 
love via flowers in the Middle East when women were enclosed in harems and 
ardent suitors resorted to floral messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a strong oral tradition in England, western Europe, China, Japan 
and the Middle East. People knew the symbolism of their plants and flowers," 
Kerins said. "It disappeared during this century, and especially in current 
times. No one sends a message when they can grab and grope. Flowers are used in 
restrictive times when people are forced to be subtle." 
</P>
<P>
 Restrictive times or not, Kerins and others who value herbs and flowers would 
like to see a revival of the lost art of communicating with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 But do not go gently into that bouquet. The subtleties of messages delivered 
from roses alone are enough to give a florist pause. 
</P>
<P>
 The rose is an ancient symbol of love, beauty, charm and grace. Its meaning 
was further refined by color and stage of bloom -- bud, flower or fully opened. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Kate Greenaway's Language of Flowers," published in 1884, a red 
rose was a declaration of romantic love, but a deep red rose meant "bashful 
shame." A single rose said "simplicity"; a white rose said "I am worthy of 
you," but a withered white rose meant "transient impressions." 
</P>
<P>
 White roses played a key role in Roman times and were fastened to the ceilings 
of banqueting halls. Their meaning was "secrecy," and it was understood that 
anything spoken within the banquet hall was to be kept secret. The custom 
remains now with the legal term sub-rosa , signifying "confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosebuds had their own meanings. White signified girlhood; red meant "pure and 
lovely," and the bud of a moss rose was a confession of love. 
</P>
<P>
 Many flowers say something different in one culture than they do in another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the chrysanthemum is associated with fall, and tradition 
assigns the meaning of optimism and cheerfulness in adversity. In Japan, the 
chrysanthemum has been used for centuries and is part of the Imperial crest, 
but the flower's symbolism is elevated to designate long life and happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 An ardent lover may tell his intended "I shall love you always" by sending her 
a camellia. But if you give a camellia to someone of Japanese descent, you may 
have sent a death omen.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerins notes that one reason for the decline of the language of flowers is 
that it became too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many books and dictionaries were published that the messages became 
garbled," she explained. "Some authors took liberties with the meanings, and 
that led to the confusion of the same flower having contradictory 
connotations." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the dictionary you used, you could have been telling the 
recipient of your tussie-mussie that you hated him by tucking some basil into 
bunch. But if the recipient used a different reference book, that same basil 
could mean "good wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Borage, an herb with bright blue flowers, similarly had several meanings. It 
could signify courage, but it also meant "bluntness," which could cause 
considerable confusion to both sender and recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 While certain flowers -- such as red roses -- communicate a pretty clear 
message even today, many of the flowers and plants described in the old floral 
dictionaries don't. Some simply aren't available, and new customs have made the 
meanings for others obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerins recently planted a garden at the Huntington filled with the several 
hundred plants that Victorians favored for creating their fanciful bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to give your valentine an especially meaningful bouquet, here are 
some suggestions from Kerins and from Geraldine Adamich Laufer, author of 
"Tussie-Mussies: The Victorian Art of Expressing Yourself in the Language of 
Flowers," (Workman Press, $22.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Laufer recommends your bouquet contain:  
</P>
<P>
 * A red tulip for a declaration of love 
</P>
<P>
 * Honeysuckle to signify bonds of love 
</P>
<P>
 * Red carnation for passion, fascination, pure love 
</P>
<P>
 * Larkspur to express your ardent attachment 
</P>
<P>
 * For greenery, add silver king artemisia for unceasing remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kerins further defines valentine tussie-mussies by creating different ones for 
men and women. She suggests the following for a man to give a woman: 
</P>
<P>
 * Red rose: "I love you"; passion; desire 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget-me-not: "Do not forget me!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Ranunculus: "I am dazzled by your charms" 
</P>
<P>
 * Fern: sincerity, fascination 
</P>
<P>
 * Red tulip: passion. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman can use the red rose, forget-me-not and fern for her floral message, 
but she may want to add the following to tell her man of her great admiration: 
</P>
<P>
 * Juniper: strength 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweet William: gallantry 
</P>
<P>
 * Pinks: fascination 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that your intended gets the meaning of these unconventional 
gifts, Kerins recommends including a card explaining the floral message.  
</P>
<P>
 "That way you can be sure you both understand," she said. Floral Testimony

ROLE MODELS? ROMEO AND JULIET? THAT EXPLAINS ALL THE DERANGED LOVE MUTANTS 
</P>

<P>
 Every year when Valentine's Day rolls around, I make a special point of trying 
to scan the horizon for a reasonable example of romantic love, just so I know 
what we're all supposed to be celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the preceding 364 days I am adrift in a sea of stories about love 
gone dopey. I refer here to both the whining weepy anecdotes of my various 
friends as well as those of the never-ending parade of deranged love mutants 
booked in triplicate on the afternoon talk shows. To say nothing of the stream 
of stunning examples reported daily. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite: 
</P>
<P>
 "A 71-year-old woman was arrested Friday after she allegedly doused her 
husband of more than 30 years with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire for 
eating a chocolate Easter bunny she had saved for herself, police said." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving once and for all that when evaluating the success of a love 
relationship, the element of longevity should not necessarily be the key. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that isn't, what is? It has become increasingly disturbing how few good 
models of love there are. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, we can't look to the First Couple for any hints. It's pretty 
apparent that Hillary is just putting the best face on some kind of marital 
sciatica. In fact, these past few years every single public couple who ever 
looked the least bit intriguing bought a ticket for the long slow ride to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I still remember with a shudder when I thought Woody and Mia looked like they 
had worked out something impressive. Eccentric, yes, but romantic and mature. 
That was way back in the late '80s -- when we used to be able to count on 
England's royal couples to at least fake a show of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, we can't even count on Tom and Roseanne. Yes, John Tesh and Connie 
Selleca would like to step up to the plate as our new romantic ideal, but 
having survived the taping of an embarrassing infomercial is not qualification 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, in honor of Valentine's Day, I decided to reread a true classic 
-- "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have not had the occasion to do so lately, please allow me to 
reacquaint you with the details of this timeless model of romantic love. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first meet the teen-age Romeo, it is a Sunday night and he has decided 
to crash a ball just to catch a glimpse of Rosaline, a girl with whom he is 
desperately in love. Instead, he meets the 13-year-old Juliet. And even though, 
only seconds before he was deeply in love with Rosaline, now he knows instantly 
that this 13-year-old girl is the greatest love of his life. Really. She is. 
He's not kidding this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliet has never been in love before. And yes, their two families hate each 
other. But so what? My parents never liked anyone I went out with either. The 
important thing is that by Monday afternoon, so beautiful is their love, they 
go ahead and get married. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one day later. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of a honeymoon, Romeo kills Juliet's cousin and Juliet goes back home 
to spend the night at her parents' house. Of course her parents do not know 
about the marriage yet, but they are so beside themselves with grief about the 
murdered cousin that Juliet's father decides there is no time like the present 
to arrange for Juliet to marry an older man. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, she is 13 and not getting any younger. Soon, she'll be 13 1/2. However, 
because he's an adult and not a hot-headed teen-ager, he really doesn't want to 
rush things. So he sets the wedding date for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the already-married Juliet realizes she must defy her father's 
wishes. She is no longer a co-dependent. She has boundaries and as a fully 
individualed adult, she must stand up to him and tell him her intentions. She 
takes the most sensible course of action under the circumstances. She pretends 
to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 This also bodes very well for the future of her marriage to Romeo since we now 
know that the core of any "love-at-first-sight" attraction is usually 
"repetition compulsion" -- wherein a person re-enacts the identical behavior 
and problems first seen in the parent-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God both Romeo and Juliet killed themselves before we were able to chart 
their marriage any farther into the future when it most certainly would have 
descended into scenarios like this: 
</P>
<P>
 (Romeo enters parlor)  
</P>
<P>
 "Juliet! Juliet! My Light! I'm home! Juliet? Oh, I forgot to tell you that I 
ate that chocolate Easter bunny that you were . . . Juliet? Juliet? Oh no. 
Honey. Not dead again. Don't tell me you're dead again. Please don't be playing 
dead again. You were just dead on Monday. I can't call 911 twice in one week. 
It's too embarrassing. Juliet? Juliet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there you have this year's Valentine's Day poster couple. A 13-year-old 
girl who likes to pretend to be dead married to a teen-age murderer who has no 
trouble falling in love with two different girls on the same Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leaves us with this slightly comforting fact: 
</P>
<P>
 There is no reason to lament today's lack of viable romantic models. Things 
are no worse now than they ever were. The only difference is that back then no 
one watched Oprah or read psychology books. So they didn't mind calling 
deranged neurotic behavior "the greatest love story ever told." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Valentine's Day.

AMERICA'S PROFESSOR OF PEACE; IDEALISM: ATTEMPTS TO FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH 
VIOLENCE HAVE FAILED, SAYS A COLUMNIST AND TEACHER. HIS SUGGESTION? TEACH KIDS 
TO SOLVE LITTLE ARGUMENTS BEFORE THEY BECOME BIG FIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a grand day for the peaceniks when "Mad Dog" Colman McCarthy hit town. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a Sunday morning stop at radio station KPFK in the Valley, where 
McCarthy (dubbed a "mad-dog liberal" by the National Review) told listeners 
that "Clinton, (Dick) Cheney and the chairman of Northrop" are the real 
"warlords" of the world, not the little "oddball rulers" who use weapons that 
the United States "so graciously" provides for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a trip downtown to Immaculate Heart College Center, where McCarthy (also 
known as "the liberal conscience" of the Washington Post, for which he writes 
two columns a week) talked to a group that included everything from scientists, 
psychologists and teachers to firefighters and carpenters -- all eager to hear 
his views about teaching peace to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is finally doing something about this violent society we live in," 
Lori Klaidman said after hearing McCarthy talk. Klaidman, 32, a brain research 
scientist at USC, said she might try to follow McCarthy's path and start a 
peace course at her local elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, McCarthy led two assemblies at Polytechnic School in 
Pasadena, where some of the city's best and brightest students received his 
pacifist word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard things like this before, but only in relation to religion," said 
Tia Roosendahl, 17, a senior. "We were taught to love one another, to have 
peace in relationships and to follow Jesus at the Christian elementary school I 
attended. But I never thought it applied to everyday life. I'm impressed that 
(McCarthy) has thought it all out and written it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Layton Pendorf, a Polytechnic Spanish teacher, also heard McCarthy and 
was one of "quite a few teachers here who asked to start a peace studies course 
at the school. That would be a lot more interesting than the pluperfect 
subjunctive," she chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, McCarthy made his way (at his usual freeway speed of 45 m.p.h.) to 
Claremont McKenna College, where about 120 students and faculty heard his 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were moved by him; some got fired up about starting to teach his 
courses in nonviolent resolution of conflict," said Bonnie Snortum, director of 
the school's Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum. "Many students had never been exposed 
to ideas like his before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first it sounds absurd: a man who teaches peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer skills, yes; parenting, maybe; dead languages like Latin, marginal. 
But peace? How would you teach it -- and why? 
</P>
<P>
 Colman McCarthy finds it odd that anyone would ask. It's obvious to him that 
seeking peace through violence hasn't worked. In his 54 years, he has seen too 
many conflicts erupt around the world -- always followed by an increase in 
armaments and threats to use them. He has watched the number of prisons soar, 
never enough for the prisoners destined to live in them. He has seen families 
erode, youth gangs explode, drugs and violence invade our cities and 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a peaceful man, not a stupid one. If fighting violence with violence 
worked, he says, the results would by now be obvious to everyone, and even he 
could not dispute them. 
</P>
<P>
 He's packed with statistics to support his point: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly 80 million have been killed in wars in the last 100 years; about 
40,000 are killed per month right now in wars everywhere; more than 10,000 
Americans are killed in handgun homicides every year. Carjackings, rapes, 
follow-home robberies. We are afraid to walk the streets for fear of being 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that, he says, the very personal atrocities that occur within the home 
-- spousal abuse, child abuse, all sorts of family quarrels that end in harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't we tired of it all?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't peace -- defined by Webster's as an absence of war, freedom from 
public disorder, and an undisturbed state of mind -- the thing we all want most 
in our lives? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, he has some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's teach children, starting in the first grade, the theory and meaning of 
peace, and how to achieve it by resolving conflicts nonviolently. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them the tools to solve small arguments before they become big fights, 
McCarthy says. Let them grow up using this knowledge, so that they will become 
peace-loving, peace-making adults. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a nation of peace illiterates, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't ever put kids through 12 years of elementary and high school with 
no reading or math. They get math every day; how many will use it? How often do 
you have lively discussions of algebra in your home?" 
</P>
<P>
 But children learn nothing in 12 years about how to solve conflicts or make 
peace with family and friends, he says. Every child experiences these 
conflicts, which can be hugely healthy, he adds. "Conflict is simply a signal 
that we've got to change the way we operate, or something worse may erupt in 
the relationship. We can achieve that change by violent or nonviolent means." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy says if enough children are taught to solve problems without hurting 
others, the world will eventually become a peaceful place. 
</P>
<P>
 Children need inspiration as well as technique, he adds. "They know all about 
the generals, like U.S. Grant and Robert E. Lee," he says, "but ask them about 
great (humanitarians) like (Albert) Schweitzer or (Jane) Addams, and they draw 
a blank. . . . There are hundreds of peace-oriented authors out there to read, 
but the kids never hear about them at school." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who label him a leftover-leftist-flower-child acknowledge his 
sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 "McCarthy represents the pacifist Catholic tradition. He's one of a kind and 
authentic. We can't find anybody like him to replace him," says Patrick 
Buchanan, the conservative columnist and co-host of TV's "Crossfire." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a likable guy," Buchanan adds, "but I think his views are heretical. 
Even the Pope now says people have an obligation to use force if necessary to 
stop what's happening in Bosnia. The idea of personal pacifism is fine, but you 
can't even do that when you have a moral obligation to protect your family. I 
think he missed his third-grade class on original sin, (where they taught) that 
some people really are violent, dangerous or wicked -- and you have an 
obligation to defend yourself with force, if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan says McCarthy, a frequent guest on his TV show, practices "a doctrine 
of freeloading. The U.S. is protected by people who risk their lives so that 
Colman can stand in a classroom and say they are doing unjust and immoral 
things. It's because (the military) and the police are willing to defend us on 
a daily basis that Colman is free to stand up and preach the beauties of 
pacifism." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy chuckles at such detractors; intellectual battles don't trouble him 
at all. Judging from mail and phone calls he receives after every public 
appearance, he says, more Americans are willing to try a loving, nonviolent 
approach. Of course, they're not yet pounding down the doors to join his 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 So McCarthy treads his Gandhian path alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick trip to Los Angeles last week was part of his usual pattern, sowing 
insights like apple seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 At home outside Washington, he describes life as solitary, except for his wife 
of 27 years and three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 He's up before dawn five days a week to teach a 7:15 a.m. peace studies class 
at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he bikes to the office, where he writes the peace-pushing columns that 
are syndicated in about 50 papers (including The Times). 
</P>
<P>
 Then to the Center for Teaching Peace, a nonprofit educational institution he 
started seven years ago to teach children nonviolent methods of resolving 
conflicts, while disseminating the literature and theory of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 (He has raised about $600,000 for his center in the past five years, $300,000 
in a grant from Bill Moyers. Part of that money is used to teach teachers how 
to teach peace, a subject he hopes will eventually be taught in all the 
nation's elementary and secondary schools.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then to Georgetown University School of Law, or the University of Maryland, 
where he teaches would-be lawyers a 14-week course he created, called "Law, 
Conscience and Non-Violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy can't pinpoint the origins of his pacifism. His parents were devout 
Catholics; his father a lawyer "who didn't really care about making money" and 
used to offer free legal services to all the poor people in their Long Island 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls being disturbed that the college he attended (Spring Hill in 
Mobile, Ala.) had an ROTC program. "It struck me then, and still does now, that 
the military really has no place on campus. A college ought to be a place where 
we learn to solve disputes through the force of ideas, the force of truth and 
justice -- rather than through violence and killing. I was radicalized by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the ideal student, he says. "I was a pretty wild kid in school, so 
afterward I decided I needed discipline. I wanted to read all the books I 
should have read in school and didn't." He entered a Trappist monastery -- "a 
very strict, austere order" -- for what he thought would be a few weeks. He 
stayed five years, he says, making friends with the cows who were in his 
charge, and the only ones to whom he was allowed to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, those were the most important years of his life, he says. "It's 
therapeutic to have a period in your life of contemplation, of strenuous 
physical exercise and of opening your soul to spiritual concerns. It has been a 
wonderful resource for me and helped me to love my family tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helped him to love the cows and other living things. "I came to 
realize just how sweet and gentle those animals really are, to understand why 
the Hindus consider them sacred," he said. "As soon as their milk would taper 
off, they'd be shipped somewhere" to a fate he didn't want to even imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy's audiences are startled sometimes when he suddenly shifts gears from 
peace mongering to the evils of eating meat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of this whole nonviolence thing, he says. "I tell my students not to 
eat anything that had a mother." Seven Ways to Resolve Conflicts Without 
Violence 
</P>
<P>
 1. Define what the conflict is about. Studies on spousal disputes show that 
about 75% of the time, the partners are fighting about different issues. It was 
something the wife said or did this morning that has the husband enraged, and 
something the husband did six weeks ago that has the wife losing it. 
</P>
<P>
 2. It's not you vs. me. It's you and me vs. the problem. The problem is the 
problem. It's stupid to try to defeat the other side, because the first thing 
the other side thinks after losing is, I need a rematch: I'll come back with 
more firepower. We have a world of rematches of rematches of rematches. Don't 
bring your adversaries to their knees, bring them to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Before a conflict heats up, list your shared concerns against your one 
shared separation. Deal with the conflict from where the relationship is 
strongest, not weakest. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Never ask people who have been in a fight what happened. They'll only give 
you their version of what occurred. Instead ask, "What did you do." Then you 
have facts, not opinions. Facts help clarify perceptions, which is basic to 
conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Develop a sense of forgiveness. Reconciliation is impossible without it. 
Many people are willing to bury the hatchet, but they insist on remembering 
exactly where they buried it -- in case they need it for the next war. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Learn to listen actively. Turn it around, from "when I talk, people 
listen," to "when I listen, people talk." 
</P>

 7. Purify your heart. You can't get violence out of other people without first 
getting it out of your own soul. We can't eliminate the weapons of the world

DOCS GO HOLLYWOOD; RELIEF GROUP HONORS PAIR OF PRODUCERS AND RAISES $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Brussels-based relief organization Doctors Without Borders crossed a new 
frontier Thursday with its first full-scale fund-raiser in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The group adapted well to local customs. Its honorees at the Beverly Hilton 
dinner were two major show-business figures: producer Lauren Shuler-Donner, 
best known for "Dave" and "Free Willy," and her husband, producer-director 
Richard Donner, whose credits include the "Lethal Weapon" series and the 
upcoming "Maverick." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong backing from Warner Bros. and the Creative Artists Agency helped make 
the event a $500,000 evening, part of which went to local earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 This mix of a show-business crowd and an international aid organization made 
for an interesting gathering. There were some foreign medical personnel, but 
they were outnumbered by talent agents and studio execs. One way to tell the 
two groups apart is, French doctors rarely greet each other with "Hi, bubbe!" 
</P>
<P>
 One strong undercurrent of the evening was the respect the Hollywood 
contingent had for the work of MSF (the group is known internationally as 
Medecins Sans Frontieres), in sending volunteer doctors to disaster areas, both 
natural and man-made. Actor Danny Glover called the members "humanitarians who 
represent us in the best possible way around the world." And Shuler-Donner and 
Donner, who had once considered making a film about MSF, stressed the doctors' 
work in trouble spots such as Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch TV, you see these terrible things and you wonder what you can do," 
said Shuler-Donner. "Well, this is what you can do: Support this organization 
and they'll provide relief." 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner was done in the traditional manner. Opening remarks were by emcee 
Dustin Hoffman; then came a meal of grilled breast of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 One guest joked that he liked free-range chicken because "at least you're 
giving the bird a running start. It seems more fair." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meal, there was a strong performance by comedian Paul Reiser, a 
six-minute video on MSF's work and Linda Eder's show-stopping performance of 
"Bridge Over Troubled Water." 
</P>
<P>
 She was followed by Daniel Spiegel, U.S. permanent representative to the 
United Nations, who covered the subject of humanitarian diplomacy in detail. 
MSF secretary Victoria Bjorklund and Dr. Alain Destexhe made the award 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 600 guests were Mel Gibson, Bob Daly, Mike Ovitz, Barbara Hershey, 
Terry Semel, Mark Canton, James Garner, Susan Harris, Paul Witt, Ed Marinaro 
and CAA's Bob Bookman, widely credited as the catalyst who put MSF in touch 
with Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests left with bags filled with Warner videos and a pocket atlas from MSF. 
One man said he saves gala gift bags for his mother in Florida. "That way," he 
said, "she thinks I'm doing something with my life."

SEEING RED OVER THE COST OF HOLIDAY ROSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the day to say, "I love you." If you want to prove it, say it with 
roses. 
</P>
<P>
 To send your love a dozen red roses today will cost at least $60, and more 
likely $75. If you want to buy the very best with the longest stems and the 
richest color, the tab can climb to $100 a dozen. Throw in $5 to $15 for 
delivery, depending on the location, and you have made a substantial investment 
in romance. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of roses jumps for Valentine's Day and though customers may 
complain, it's still the florists' busiest day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are basically swamped with delivery orders," Dina Morimoto at the Westwood 
Flower Garden said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-stem red roses there start at $75 a dozen. "Roses are graded, like 
eggs," Morimoto explained. "The extra fancy ones have larger heads and really 
long stems -- about three feet. They're $100 a dozen." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's too stern a test of your affection, she suggests tulips. "We have a 
lot of red, pink or white. These are the colors everyone wants and you can get 
a nice bouquet arranged in a vase for $35." Another fall-back bouquet, she 
said, would be tulips and spring flowers with a couple of token roses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the demand that drives up the price this time of year," Morimoto said. 
"We have 10 times more deliveries than usual. Everyone wants them sent to the 
office -- with this investment, they want people to ooh and ahh over them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The price does seem awful darned expensive," said Frank Kuwahara, president 
of the wholesale Southern California Flower Market. "But you have to realize 
that roses are highly perishable and can't be stored up."  
</P>
<P>
 Because florists can't stockpile an inventory, he said, growers sacrifice a 
whole crop of red roses by pinching back the buds that would normally bloom in 
January so they can bring in a February crop. Furthermore, Valentine's Day is 
the one holiday that everybody insists on having flowers delivered that very 
day, he added. "It puts a terrific burden on the florist." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Pollitz is vice president of Teleflora, the Los Angeles-based 
clearinghouse for floral wire services across the country. She acknowledged 
florists "get a bad rap" on Valentine's Day. But despite the high prices, she 
said, "people send roses because this is a flower holiday and we are a land of 
romantics."  
</P>
<P>
 On the practical side, she offered this advice to rose shoppers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pick roses that are just beginning to open. If they are curled too tightly 
they may have been cut too green and won't open all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for a rich color -- "that velvety port-wine red." 
</P>
<P>
 * Check that foliage is bright green and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy roses should last from five to seven days, if properly cared for, 
Pollitz said. "If a rose begins to droop, take it out of the container, run 
warm water over it and cut the stem under water. The stem is like a straw and 
if it gets clogged, the bloom dries up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what the price of a rose is," she added, "there is nothing that 
tells the story of love like a flower."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CAMARILLO METROLINK STATION OPENS TODAY; 
TRANSPORTATION: NO-FRILLS FACILITY WAS BUILT IN A WEEK. IT MARKS THE FIRST 
COMMUTER TRAIN SERVICE IN WEST VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pioneer commuters will step onto the first Metrolink trains in Camarillo this 
morning as transportation officials continue to combat crowded freeways 
following last month's deadly earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers Sunday put the finishing touches on an impromptu railroad 
platform that took only a week to build once the decision was made to expand 
the commuter train route into west Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "A permanent station would have canopies, water fountains, landscaping -- 
many, many more amenities," Metrolink construction manager Joe Castro said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local dignitaries are scheduled to be on hand this morning as the platform 
opening is officially celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter trains will make two round-trips a day from Camarillo to Union 
Station in Los Angeles, with stops at Moorpark and Simi Valley before they move 
into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way trip from Camarillo to Los Angeles will take about 80 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other emergency Metrolink platforms have also opened in Northridge, Canyon 
Country, Palmdale and Lancaster since the Jan. 17 earthquake, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley commuters boarded Metrolink trains 
at those stations in the weeks following the earthquake, pushing and shoving 
combined with confusion and mayhem as first-time riders swarmed trains before 
others could disembark. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials promised Sunday to make sure that does not happen in 
Camarillo or Northridge, where another station opens today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made provisions to ensure there is adequate staffing at the 
stations," spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. "We have a series of Metrolink 
ambassadors wearing purple caps and shirts to assist first-time riders on how 
to experience Metrolink." 
</P>
<P>
 The 700-foot-long Camarillo platform, located just off a newly paved and 
striped parking lot along Lewis Road, is scheduled to be in service as an 
emergency transit alternative for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Castro said, local and regional transportation officials will 
decide if the ridership from Camarillo warrants its continuation as a regular 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the emergency stations we've already opened, we've been getting 200 or 
more riders a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Biere, operations supervisor for contractor C. A. Rasmussen, said his 
crews have worked 14-hour days since last week to complete the Camarillo 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, it takes a month or longer to even get the documents together to 
start a project like this," said Biere, whose firm also constructed emergency 
Metrolink stations in Canyon Country and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it was a matter of hours," said Biere, who added that his crews 
lost two days because of rain early last week. "It gives you a sense of pride 
to knock something like this out in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry and Grace Bignami, a retired Camarillo couple who toured the platform 
Sunday, said they had been waiting for years for commuter train service to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to use it once in a while," Grace Bignami said. "We won't drive 
down there, so we never went to Los Angeles for that very reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said Metrolink has retained more than half of the first-time riders 
that have used the commuter train since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't supposed to have the numbers we've been having for several years, 
so we're certainly ahead of the game," he said. "Unfortunately, it took an 
incident like this to see some type of commuter behavior changes." 
</P>
<P>

CITY COUNCIL CAN'T AGREE ON HIRING OF RECRUITER; VENTURA: MEMBERS HAVE BEEN 
UNABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS ON ROLE OF AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT OR 
WHETHER ONE IS EVEN NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after Ventura Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures was elected in November, 
she said she wanted to hire within three months an economic development 
consultant with broad powers to woo businesses to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three months have passed but no such professional business recruiter 
has yet been added to the city payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Measures is still pushing hard for hiring the consultant, other 
council members are wary of the idea because they fear giving too much 
authority to a staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has discussed Measures' idea, but no consensus has emerged yet 
about it. A council subcommittee is scheduled to create a job description by 
the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a long ways to convince me," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "This 
could be just some independent guy who's out there cutting deals for the city. 
Who does he answer to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle pointed out that the Ventura Chamber of Commerce and the Ventura 
Visitors & Convention Bureau already do some recruiting of companies and act as 
business boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Ventura is the only large city that does not have an 
economic development position on the city payroll. Some cities, such as 
Camarillo and Oxnard, have contracts with private consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Steve Bennett and Mayor Tom Buford said they support the 
idea of a professional business recruiter, but would like to see a more 
detailed job description first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need more information before I can commit to anything," said Bennett, who 
has a bachelor's degree in economics from Brown University. "I've got to see 
that the expense for a economic coordinator will be offset by the revenues 
generated. We could get someone who's a dud." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Measures originally told reporters at a news conference Nov. 3 that 
she hoped to have a new business recruiter within three months, she now says 
her real deadline has always been April -- or before the city adopts a new 
budget in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, a former banker and investment adviser, emphasized her business 
experience during the election and touted the idea of hiring an economic 
development coordinator in campaign speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our economy is really struggling," Measures said. "I think we need someone 
totally concentrated on revitalizing our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she has not yet figured out exactly what the coordinator would 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have it defined yet," Measures said. "It would be someone who would 
re-create our economic vitality." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures said some of her ideas include establishing a nonprofit corporation 
to work with city staff or putting together a pilot program of six to 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, a small-business owner, said the council may be expecting too much of 
the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he or she is supposed to be a business recruiter, a cheerleader, an 
ombudsman, a Jack-of-all-trades," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the council, Measures has the strongest support from conservatives Monahan 
and Jack Tingstrom. Councilman Greg Carson said he also supports the notion of 
a business recruiter, but is still working on crafting a job description. 
Carson suggested the idea in 1991, when he was first elected on a pro-business 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven council members have differing ideas on the position. 
</P>
<P>
 They are debating how much to pay the person, and whether the job should be 
contracted out or assigned to a staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't agreed on what the person should do. Some say he or she should 
concentrate on recruiting businesses; others say the emphasis should be on 
keeping businesses from moving out of Ventura. A few suggest that the job 
should help businesses maneuver through the city bureaucracy when applying for 
licenses and permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all over the place on this one," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council allowed for such a position in the 1993-94 budget, but 
never filled it because of a hiring freeze. The annual salary would range from 
$46,876 to $62,814. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no consensus on the council about it," Community Development 
Director Everett Millais said. "Goodness, if you go to the Midwest or East, 
you'll find it's a key position for cities there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Chamber of Commerce officials said they support hiring an economic 
development coordinator and have assigned a committee to draft a proposed job 
description that chamber officials will submit to the city in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber President Bob Alviani said: "We will get it on the table because they 
won't. They obviously can't agree on what needs to be done. It's time to stop 
talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Flavin, a private consultant who has a contract with the city of 
Camarillo, said more cities are turning toward companies like his to lure 
businesses to communities starved for tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities and counties are getting more aggressive because in the last 
four or five years, they've lost a lot of businesses to other states," Flavin 
said. "We can't take our economic well-being for granted any longer. We have to 
get out there and be more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city officials said there is no data available for the number of firms 
that leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said his city has done well by employing an 
economic development coordinator, a position established in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten more aggressive in chasing businesses and landing them," 
Stratton said. "The large developers and businesses want someone to talk to who 
is at the top, who can help them get through the red tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom, elected on a pro-business platform, said hiring an economic 
development coordinator is vital to Ventura's long-term economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really had to do this because Ventura's retail sales were the 
best in the county," he said. "Now we're falling behind. We're way overdue on 
this."

STREET SMART: CAMARILLO CYCLISTS DON'T APPRECIATE THE MUDSLINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Who is responsible for cleaning muddy road shoulders in Camarillo? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a major problem with mud along the farmland on Las Posas Road south of 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time it rains, the tractors from the fields drive along the shoulder and 
leave a trail of mud that can go on for miles. The mud is a major hazard for me 
and many other bicycle riders who commute along these shoulders each day. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mud dries, it is hard as concrete, creating even more problems. The 
portion of Pleasant Valley Road that runs along the airport entrance is another 
problem spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't the mud being removed? 
</P>
<P>
 David Schachte, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your predicament stems from negligent farmers who don't clean up after their 
mud-trailing tractors, says Butch Britt, deputy public works director for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 If farmers don't mop up, mud duty on Las Posas and Pleasant Valley roads near 
Camarillo Airport falls to county workers. 
</P>
<P>
 During rainstorms, however, the mud has a tendency to pile up as workers 
attend to other water-related problems, such as flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a rainstorm, we have crews out every which way from Sunday trying to 
solve problems," Britt said. "I know the crews try to get to the mud-clearing 
within a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 If the forecast calls for more rain, the mud slicks are intentionally left 
unattended because they come right back again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just caution people traveling on the shoulder after a rainstorm to be 
very cautious around mud," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a left-turn hazard on Olivas Park Drive near Ventura that I'm 
concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
 I often go to a flower stand on the south side of Olivas, which is a two-lane 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 If I'm heading west on Olivas, I have to stop in the middle of the road, 
stalling traffic behind me while I wait for a chance to turn left. 
</P>
<P>
 This is very dangerous because I could get rear-ended by someone driving fast 
who doesn't see that I am stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I could get hit by someone coming toward me as I try to turn left. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid these hazards, I recently drove past the stand to the stoplight at 
Telephone Road and made an illegal U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed safer to me, but I got a ticket! Can this U-turn be made legal, or 
can a left-turn lane be put in at the flower stand? 
</P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans to add a left-turn lane on Olivas Park Drive, and U-turns 
at Telephone Road are illegal because they are not safe, county traffic experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the answer is not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Olivas at Telephone is outside the Ventura city limits, the city and 
Ventura County share responsibility for this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The county maintains the road, while the city is responsible for the light 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 However, county traffic policy states that if traffic hazards are created by a 
business, the owners must pay for street improvements to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear that roadside stands would fall under this requirement, says 
Butch Britt of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 County traffic engineers will examine the problem in coming weeks and try to 
find a way to make the road safer, Britt says. But don't expect anything major. 
Britt says the county can't even afford to pay for the road improvements it has 
planned for the next five years.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I are concerned about the lack of lighting on the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 We feel the lighting conditions are totally inadequate and endanger drivers 
who travel after dark. Can lights be installed, before there is a serious 
accident? 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Siegel, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, lighting on the Simi Valley Freeway meets state Department 
of Transportation safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent rash of burned-out lights may have left some drivers in the dark, 
Caltrans Traffic Engineer Bob Houle says. Maintenance workers have replaced the 
bulbs, and the road should again be sufficiently illuminated.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; DUMP SITES GET THEIR FILL OF QUAKE DEBRIS; 
CLEANUP: SIMI VALLEY CLOSES ITS FREE SERVICE, WHILE FILLMORE STILL ACCEPTS 
BRICK AND CONCRETE. LANDFILLS HAVE EXTENDED HOURS AND RAISED WEIGHT LIMITS.

 Nearly a month after an earthquake ravaged Simi Valley and Fillmore, residents 
continue to sort through the debris, salvaging personal items and hauling 
toppled chimneys and broken water heaters to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 At Simi Valley City Hall, the city closed its free dump site Sunday, even 
though the cleanup is far from over for some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we spent all our time cleaning up the inside, and now we've got to 
take care of the outside," Simi Valley resident Philip Maciel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel is just beginning to haul away the collapsed patio and remains of a 
fireplace from his home at the end of the Sabina Circle cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 By closing time Sunday at the dump site, the city had taken in an estimated 
6,500 tons of material at a cost of $366,000, said Joe Hreha, deputy director 
of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is applying for reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Landfill, residents have brought in 4,000 tons of quake debris, 
said Doug Corcoran, division vice president of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the increase, the landfill, which opens at 7 a.m. seven days a 
week, now stays open until 6 p.m. each day rather than 4:30 p.m. Fees for 
dumping a fully loaded pickup truck have been reduced from $35.95 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, trucks loaded with rubble from earthquake-damaged buildings in 
Fillmore continue to roll up the narrow dirt road to the Toland Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily 135-ton limit at the dump was lifted to accommodate up to six times 
the usual amount of trash received each day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday alone, the dump took in a record 630 tons of quake-related rubble, 
enough to fill 30 large trucks, said John Conaway, director of solid waste for 
Ventura County, which operates the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaway said the landfill employs enough workers to handle the increase. "We 
were ready for the onslaught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debris is coming from the 20 condemned houses and businesses that 
the city began demolishing last week, Conaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, residents with minor damage are dumping broken glass and 
shattered household items in dumpsters placed in hard-hit neighborhoods. The 
city is also supplying boxes to aid in the cleanup, and plastic sheets to cover 
leaky roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will continue to allow residents to dump bricks and concrete for free 
at Main and Mountain View streets through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Public Works Supt. John Kozar said residents have welcomed the city's 
efforts to help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any complaints yet," he said. "We got those dumpsters out 
there the day after the quake and, as soon as they're full, they're dumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Simi Valley, Fillmore is applying to FEMA for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, eager to rid themselves of rubble, are hiring contractors. A 
table in Fillmore's temporary building and safety office is covered with 
business cards from dozens of construction and demolition companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore resident Jim Blansett paid a contractor $3,000 to demolish his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it postponed any longer," he said. "It's a potential lifetime 
of liability if someone breaks in and gets hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley contractor Steven DeVries, who usually receives one or two calls a 
month, said he has logged 300 calls for service since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, DeVries tore down and replaced four chimneys. He charged about 
$4,000 apiece, including hauling out the old chimney, and obtaining permits and 
materials for the new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great business, and it's just the beginning because people are 
waiting for their insurance and FEMA money to come through," DeVries said. "I'm 
going to be busy for another year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, unwilling to hire contractors, are taking matters into their 
own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 John Jones and the other 64 members of the Fairway Park Homeowners Assn. in 
Simi Valley refused to pay a contractor $30,000 to tear down and haul away 
damaged block walls throughout their east end neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they rented a truck and tractor, and are hauling the stuff 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big project, but it's worth it to save the money," Jones said. "Little 
by little, we're chipping away."

PANEL TO REVIEW AMGEN EXPANSION PLANS; THOUSAND OAKS: COMPANY OFFICIALS ARE 
HOPEFUL THAT CITY WILL OK DOUBLING OF OFFICE SPACE AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS. 
APPROVAL WOULD CUT THROUGH RED TAPE AND SPEED COMPLETION OF THE FIVE-YEAR 
PROJECT. 
</P>

<P>
 Plans for a major five-year expansion of Amgen Inc.'s Thousand Oaks 
headquarters, including the construction of several buildings that would exceed 
city height limits, will be reviewed today by the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials said they are optimistic that the plan, which would more than 
double the company's office space to more than 2 million square feet and make 
room for 2,000 additional employees, would be well received by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident that we've done everything necessary to move ahead with 
this plan," said Ed Bjurstrom, director of engineering and construction for 
Amgen. "We're not just an average development; we're building a home here." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year expansion proposal is laid out in a specific plan, which is a 
joint effort by city planners and company officials to guide future development 
on Amgen's property. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the specific plan, in part, will clear the way for Amgen 
to continue its growth without the delays of government red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which was founded in Thousand Oaks in 1980 and is now the largest 
independent biotechnology firm in the world, occupies a 100-acre site along 
Hillcrest Drive at the west end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's five-year plan outlines dozens of major projects it intends to 
initiate, including the construction of buildings, widening of roads, and 
creation of parking facilities, bicycle paths, walkways and landscaped open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission and City Council approve the proposal, Amgen will not have 
to return to the Planning Commission for further approval of any of the 
construction plans it has laid out in the document, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the specific plan is passed, it will supersede city zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 That is of particular interest to the company because several of the proposed 
buildings would exceed the city's maximum height requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect there will be some very special concessions made to Amgen in terms 
of approvals for these future buildings," Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields 
said. "They're going to be allowed to go higher to accommodate their special 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Frields said the commission has been directed by the council to consider 
waiving some of the city's more traditional building requirements in Amgen's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past eight months, the council has held two special study sessions 
with Amgen officials to discuss the company's plans and help outline the 
specific plan to fit the city's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several City Council members have said they are intent upon working with Amgen 
because the company generates jobs and tax dollars for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen recently released a study showing that the company, with the five-year 
expansion plan, could double the amount of money it generates for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which employs about 2,200 people, generates about $268,000 in 
property, hotel, sales and business license taxes in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Amgen officials project that the company will employ 8,000 people 
and bring more than $1 million a year into the city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Irving Wasserman said the project's sheer scope and size 
should justify approval of the specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with a project of this magnitude -- we're talking about 2 
million square feet of office space -- it's deserving of and really requires 
special circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Amgen shows a willingness to do what we believe is necessary to fit into 
the plans of the city, this should work out well for them and for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed expansion and other 
Amgen projects at 7:30 p.m. at Thousand Oaks City Hall, 2400 Willow Lane.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOTE ON METROLINK AIRPORT STOP DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink directors have postponed for a month a decision on whether to stop 
trains at Burbank Airport, asking for more study of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the opening last week of a refurbished platform across the street from 
the airport, Burbank officials and Ventura County transportation planners have 
pressed Metrolink to add the stop to its Moorpark line, which also has stops in 
Simi Valley and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the platform only serves Amtrak trains running between Santa 
Barbara and San Diego. Amtrak trains use the same track as Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the stop would encourage airport-bound riders from Ventura 
County and the western San Fernando Valley to use mass transit, but Metrolink 
officials note that customers can already catch the train to the downtown 
Burbank Metrolink station and take a free shuttle to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which oversees 
Metrolink, voted Friday to have its staff analyze the proposal more thoroughly, 
including questions of upgrading the platform to Metrolink standards. HENRY CHU

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDY SOUGHT FOR ETHNIC MUSEUM SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushing the concept of a Native Peoples Museum in Thousand Oaks, Councilman 
Frank Schillo will ask his colleagues Tuesday to approve a study to identify 
possible sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum designers Al Fiori and Jean-Michel Cousteau have proposed a center that 
would showcase art and artifacts from indigenous cultures around the world.They 
envision lectures by visiting scholars, displays of traditional dance and other 
presentations designed to enliven history lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest idea: to establish a satellite link between the Thousand Oaks 
center and prestigious museums worldwide. Emerging technology would allow them 
to show video footage or perhaps even holograms of exhibits on display in other 
museums, Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not have a cost estimate, Schillo said a feasibility study 
will take about 60 hours of staff time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some public support out there," Schillo said. "We need to see if it's 
feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she wasn't sure whether she would support 
spending staff time to study such a sketchy idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that unless the (museum designers) have got cash in hand or a 
proven ability to fund-raise, they're ultimately going to be looking for 
financial help from the city," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Schillo said the Cousteau name -- Jean-Michel is the son of 
explorer Jacques Cousteau -- would help attract dollars and predicted that 
"raising funds will be a heck of a lot easier than some think." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HOME IS EVACUATED AFTER HEATER EXPLODES

<P>
 More than half a dozen people were forced from their south Oxnard home after a 
kerosene heater erupted in flames and burned the hallway, fire officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Terry McAnally said Francisca Jimenez was trying to light the 
heater when it exploded about 9:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 12 firefighters about 30 minutes to extinguish the fire, which caused 
$4,000 in damage to the Wolff Street home and another $1,000 in damage to its 
contents, McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez and her family were offered emergency services from the American Red 
Cross, but decided to stay with friends, McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerosene heaters are illegal in California for indoor use because of the 
danger they pose, and fire officials have forwarded the results of an 
investigation into the incident to city building inspectors, fire officials 
said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LIBRARY PLANS EVENTS FOR PRESIDENTS' 
DAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library will hold a White House Weekend from 
Friday through Feb. 21 in celebration of Presidents' Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Events will include a presidential look-alike contest, a turn-of-the-century 
lawn party and the Presidential Race -- an uphill foot race on the hillside 
behind the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first of what will be a lot of free events and events built 
around themes," said Stefanie Salata, spokeswoman for the library. "It's a fun 
thing for us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Presidential Theatre Festival will kick off the events with the first of 
three one-man performances Friday, featuring Jim Cooke as Calvin Coolidge. Ted 
Zalewski will play Theodore Roosevelt on Saturday, and Jim Getty will portray 
Abraham Lincoln on Sunday. All performances start at 7 p.m., and admission is 
$10 for each performance or $25 for all three. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 21, the day's events will begin at 8 a.m. with the Presidential Race. 
The entrance fee of $5 includes a "I Ran in the 1994 Presidential Race" 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawn party -- complete with games, music and refreshments -- will be held 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and is free with library admission: $4 for adults, $2 
for senior citizens and free for children 16 and under. The winner of the 
presidential look-alike contest will get to meet former President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Salata said Presidents' Day is an appropriate date to kick off a series of 
events aimed at bringing new visitors to the library. In addition to the 
special events, the library's current exhibits will be open. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House Replica, a 60-by-20-foot model of the White House, and 
"Symbols of Diplomacy," an exhibit of gifts from heads of state given to Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan, are on display until April. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 The Ventura City Council today will consider a developer's request to rezone 
an area designated for office space to allow residential housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-acre parcel is on Thille Street between Hill Road and Partridge 
Avenue on the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based Raznick & Sons wants to build a 100-unit apartment 
project on the vacant site instead of the seven-building office complex it had 
originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending against the zone change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be short of office space in the future," Community Development 
Director Everett Millais said, "and we've got all the residential housing we 
can handle." PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HORSE KILLED WHEN TRAILER OVERTURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A horse was killed Sunday when the trailer it was riding in overturned on the 
Simi Valley Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12:30 p.m. accident occurred on the eastbound lanes of the freeway near 
Tapo Street when the trailer disconnected from the truck that was towing it. 
Eastbound traffic was backed up for about two miles while emergency crews 
cleared the freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were still trying to determine late Sunday why the trailer

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HEARING SLATED ON QUAKE-REPAIR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will hold a public hearing tonight on the city's 
plan to pay for earthquake-related repairs with federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the city received approval for early release of its $738,000 share 
of federal Community Development Block Grant funds.The 1994-95 allocation 
wasn't scheduled for release until this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider a list of proposed projects, the largest of which is 
$275,000 for street repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects include $120,000 to repair utilities at the city's mobile-home 
parks, $100,000 for low-interest loans to homeowners and $75,000 for loans to 
businesses. City officials said they hoped that the federal government would be 
able to replace the funds so that groups that usually receive block grant money 
do not get short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, the city gave $50,000 to the Simi Valley Soccer Foundation, 
$20,000 to Interface Children Family Services, $21,750 to the Simi Valley 
Historical Society, and $5,100 to the Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is scheduled at 6:30 p.m. at Simi Valley City Hall, 2929 Tapo 
Canyon Road. SARA CATANIA

JAZZ REVIEW; MISSING THE TARGET; EXCEPT FOR HIS BROTHER'S PLAYING, CANNONBALL 
TRIBUTE IS WIDE OF THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounded like a great idea: a "Salute to Cannonball Adderley" Saturday night 
as part of the "Sneak Preview" season at the new Carpenter Performing Arts 
Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Don Marquis once suggested, an idea "isn't responsible for the people 
who believe in it," and the execution of the Cannonball salute unfortunately 
fell well short of its aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, the most successful part of the evening was provided by 
cornetist Nat Adderley's whimsical reminiscences about his late saxophonist 
brother, and by the superlative playing of his own current quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Restricted to a relatively brief set by a series of technical glitches 
(admirably covered up by KLON deejay Chuck Niles' impromptu joking), the 
Adderley Quintet made the most of a few jazz lines and the standard, "Autumn 
Leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Adderley and alto saxophonist Vincent Herring (whose style blends a 
Cannonball-like articulation with a more contemporary rhythm flow) peaked on a 
grooving Hank Mobley melody, "This I Dig Of You." But the highlight of the set, 
in part because of its powerful association with the Adderley Brothers' groups 
of the '60s, was the soul-jazz classic "Work Song." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the bill, which featured the International Assn. of Jazz 
Appreciation's All-Star Big Band, left far more to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 A promised compositional tribute to Cannonball Adderley by Cecil Bridgewater 
was so poorly rehearsed, and so inaccurately played that its carefully crafted 
dissonances and moving inner voices were almost impossible to discern. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Nat Adderley Quintet also came on stage, the large ensemble -- with 
no noticeable written music to play -- was left to generate some on-the-spot, 
spontaneous "head arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Random alto saxophone solos by Herring, Antonio Hart and Jeff Clayton were 
apparently intended to reflect the Cannonball salute, although Clayton very 
nearly stole the show with a blistering, blues-drenched paraphrase of a famous 
solo -- not by Cannonball, but by Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenor saxophonist and singer Stephen Wayne started the evening with a pleasant 
-- if occasionally uncertain -- group of such jazz works as "Maiden Voyage" and 
"Moody's Mood For Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannonball Salute was one of a number of programs at the Carpenter Center 
leading up to the grand opening in October. The trial run is a wise strategy, 
since both audio and visual presentation will have to improve dramatically if 
this otherwise-attractive arena is going to become a major performing-arts 
venue.

FIRESTORM DESTROYED SOCIAL BARRIERS TOO; COMMUNITY: LAGUNA NEIGHBORS WHO BARELY 
KNEW EACH OTHER NOW SHARE INFORMATION, HUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During 22 years of living in the peaceful hills above this city's downtown, 
Christian Werner had never learned the name of a single neighbor on Buena Vista 
Way -- a quiet, winding street lined with hedges and high walls that provided 
the privacy he cherished. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Werner, a geography professor at UC Irvine, his rare, chance 
exchanges with neighbors seldom varied from the ritual: They would greet each 
other, concur yet again on the beauty of the day, then slip back inside their 
hillside havens. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Oct. 27 firestorm destroyed the wooden fences and leafy curtains 
that once divided these neighbors, social barriers tumbled as well. The 
emotional distance many on Buena Vista had carefully preserved for years is now 
shattered, no less a casualty of the fire than the nine houses that burned 
along this narrow, one-block street. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the relationships have changed," said Loretta Edger, 53, who has owned 
a house at 661 Buena Vista for 18 years and visited frequently from her main 
residence in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all much more open now, more willing to talk and be helpful to each 
other. There's a feeling that we're all in this together, a feeling for the 
first time of real community." 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, 58, agrees, although at times he wistfully remembers the seclusion he 
enjoyed behind his jungle of exotic greenery at 657 Buena Vista, next door to 
Edger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a remarkable experience," Werner said soon after the blaze, as he 
fielded phone calls from fellow fire victims he barely knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of events tend to establish a commonality among neighbors. I have 
only seen or talked to these people very casually in the past, but they are 
reaching out to me now, and they are proving to be very nice, compassionate and 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months after the fire raced down Buena Vista and other nearby 
roads -- incinerating homes, upsetting routines and scarring lives -- the 
neighborhood here is reviving even as its residents' relationships grow. While 
home foundations will not be laid for several more months, signs of the 
street's regeneration already abound. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge, blackened cork oak that stands before Don and Jo Williamsons' 
burned-out lot at 665 Buena Vista has burst into verdant bloom. Bright green 
asparagus ferns have struggled up through the ashes nearby and a scorched 
Indian hawthorne is now covered with tiny pink blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the northern end of the street, an architect's sign sprouts from the yard 
of what used to be Sheila Patterson and Shannon Nally's home at 644 Buena 
Vista; down the way, a surveyor's orange flags mark the boundaries of the 
Williamsons' lot -- both preludes to the new homes to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In much the same way, friendships among neighbors on Buena Vista have also 
blossomed, ensuring that life here will never return to the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has changed so dramatically, it can't be the same," said Jackie Allen, who 
says she is looking forward to the new, more neighborly incarnation of her 
street. "All of us were pretty much into our own lives before, but it'll be a 
different story now." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Vista Way had never been the sort of street where residents borrowed 
sugar from each other, sweated together over back yard projects or entertained 
back and forth, several said. Most on the street are busy professionals whose 
limited time for socializing centered more on their offices or long-term 
friendships than on their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours of the fire, the new bonds were forged, as family after 
family returned to the charred northern end of the street to discover their 
homes in ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, flyers blanketed the block, at first from residents offering 
support to those whose homes had burned, later advertising one fire-related 
gathering after another: a joint thank-you presentation for firefighters from 
the lucky ones whose homes still stood; a "we survived the fire" celebration 
for anyone around that first weekend; a three-street block party to honor a man 
credited with saving several dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, residents who had waved casually to each other for years found 
themselves exchanging hugs, often along with their names and new phone numbers. 
Since then, they have seen one another in visits to the devastated street and 
at the many meetings here aimed at helping fire victims find their way through 
the maze of insurance claim forms and rebuilding regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't make the meetings are often kept informed by their neighbors. 
Werner, the next-door neighbor Loretta Edger barely knew before the fire, now 
calls her frequently at her home in Illinois and sends her handouts from the 
meetings he attends, Edger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The genteel, almost formal, distance between many here once kept them from 
teasing each other, even gently, about the appearances of their homes or 
gardens. But those barriers, too, have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, a eucalyptus tree that had stood in Werner's jungle-like 
garden and blocked a corner of George Cary's view. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, after the fire, Cary and Werner stood together on the street, looking 
out toward the Pacific over their blackened lots, the charred skeletons of 
trees poking up through the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half seriously, half joking, I told him I really hoped that particular tree 
didn't come back," said Cary, who lived at 645 Buena Vista with his wife, 
Marlene Wright, and their infant daughter. "I would never have said that 
before; we didn't even know him." 
</P>
<P>
 As the new friendships evolve, residents say they are sharing more than their 
mutual frustrations with the tedious rebuilding process. According to several, 
they are also volunteering specifics of their personal finances, including the 
extent of their insurance coverage and the values of their old homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner and Edger have compared notes, for example, on the widely different way 
their two insurance companies are determining the values of their old homes. 
Werner's has required that two architects re-create the plans, at a cost of 
about $3,000 per set, while Edger's has assessed her home based on an appraisal 
of the lot, a survey of comparable properties and her description of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several others, including Sheila Patterson, her next-door neighbor Tom Homan, 
and Jackie and Jim Allen are sharing information about the amounts their 
insurers are willing to pay architects to draw the plans for the new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to help each other get through all the bureaucratic 
insanity," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire survivors said they have begun discussing ways to cooperate as they 
rebuild, efforts that extend far beyond the usual conversations between 
neighbors in Laguna about promising not to obstruct each other's views. 
</P>
<P>
 As they plan their new houses, many on the street are considering hiring a 
single geological firm to reduce the cost of studying their lots -- hoping a 
comprehensive, joint survey might enhance their knowledge of their land, 
including any risk associated with rebuilding on a slope that has slid at least 
once before. 
</P>
<P>
 The city requires such studies before it will issue building permits, and 
several of the Buena Vista owners feel the current situation provides an 
opportunity to study the entire area for potential problems that might affect 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Several on the street, including Werner, also regularly attend meetings of the 
activist, well-organized homeowners association in nearby Mystic Hills, and 
have returned to their neighbors with borrowed ideas for even greater 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner said he is interested in exploring whether the group should hire the 
same landscaper, jointly purchase building materials, or try to cooperate in 
scheduling the arrival of construction vehicles along the narrow street. But he 
expects that many of those ideas will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary, a lawyer who has tried to organize the cooperative effort by arranging 
meetings and acting as an information clearinghouse for his neighbors, agreed. 
Cary said the only viable current plan involves the geological survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes a huge amount of time and effort to get everyone together, to 
get the word out, even to make the phone calls," Cary said. "We're still trying 
to do it with the geological (study) but that may end up being the only thing 
we do together." 
</P>
<P>
 The various households, subject to the schedules of their insurance adjusters, 
architects and others, already find themselves at widely different stages of 
the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have just begun to compile the comprehensive lists of 
belongings required by their insurance companies. Others have completed their 
lists and received settlement checks. A few are already working with architects 
to plan the specifics of their new homes, while others have yet to choose an 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Each stage of the process holds the potential to widen the gaps still farther. 
</P>
<P>
 One family already has decided to move forward on its own with plans for 
rebuilding, convinced that any group effort on the required studies will take 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
 For 37 years, the Williamsons had lived in a soaring A-frame designed by Don, 
an architect and the former director of Laguna's Pageant of the Masters. Now 
80, Don Williamson is already designing the couple's new home and said he and 
his wife, Jo, 78, have decided to proceed in order to maximize the time they 
can spend in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could just see this going on forever," he said, referring to the ongoing 
discussions over the geological study and a recent decision by the group to 
seek a second bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsons, who have lived on Buena Vista far longer than any of the 
other residents, have been staying in the nearby home of their daughter and 
son-in-law since the fire. Before then, they knew many on the street, although 
none were close friends, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Williamsons said it was an earlier disaster that brought them 
into closer contact with several neighbors on Buena Vista, especially James 
Kelly and Robert Mangel, whose Spanish-style dwelling at 675 also burned, and 
Frank and Julie Ireland, whose blue-trimmed home at 711 made it through 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last March, two houses across the street from the Williamsons' 
suddenly slipped several feet down the hill toward them, apparently because 
water from a leaky underground pipe eroded the earth beneath them. The houses 
were later condemned, while a third required extensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly and several house guests helped the Williamsons rescue paintings and 
other valuables from their home, then learned that Kelly's house could also be 
in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Ireland, an energetic 74-year-old whom Kelly fondly calls the "Mayor of 
Buena Vista," offered to let her neighbors store their valuables in her garage 
for the 12 days they were evacuated from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those items, so carefully saved from the landslide, later perished in the 
flames, but those involved have warm memories of getting to know one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful experience," said Don Williamson. "All these people we 
hardly knew before were carting our stuff up the street and putting it in 
Julie's garage. They were just terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not surprisingly in such a litigious age, however, the interaction 
among Buena Vista residents has not always been so pleasant. Several lawsuits 
resulted from the March landslide, and other legal disputes over the years have 
stemmed from barking dogs, property boundaries and street access. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for their new efforts at solidarity, though, none of the street's 
fire victims has ever sued another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us sound like such a litigious lot," sighed Patterson, an attorney 
who sought the support of many of her neighbors during a heated, long-running 
dispute with an adjacent property owner over their common boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor, H.J. O'Connor, who has also battled with several on the street 
above, at one point chopped down a large eucalyptus tree from the foot of 
Patterson's driveway, then planted a number of palm trees in front of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson and a friend uprooted the trees, but were forced to replant them 
after discovering that O'Connor actually did own the land on which they stood. 
She later paid him damages, but in a separate court case, was held not 
responsible for the removal of the trees one dark night by mysterious "Ninja 
tree assassins," as Patterson puts it. The trees have not reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and others said those battles seem far in the past as they struggle to 
adjust to rental homes, new furniture and the absence of virtually any familiar 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just takes so long, every step of the way," moaned Jackie Allen, 
lamenting the loss of her home of 18 years at 631 Buena Vista. "My main thing 
is just to get back into that house and try to get back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 And when she does, she said, she will throw a party for her neighbors, a 
celebration of survival, renewal and new-found friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done, it will be a nicer neighborhood," she said. "We 
will all be better friends because of what we've been through."

VENEZUELAN BANK COLLAPSE THREATENS NATION'S FUTURE; FINANCE: BANCO LATINO'S 
FAILURE IS WORST EVER IN SOUTH AMERICA. ANALYSTS FEAR A SOCIAL EXPLOSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Banco Latino seemed a depositor's heaven. It had more branches here than 
anyone, more services, far higher interest rates and, best of all, the 
confidence that comes from being an institution closely connected to this 
country's most powerful industrialists and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Using all of these advantages and some of the most modern, incessant 
advertising seen in Venezuela, Banco Latino attracted almost a million 
depositors, including the pension funds of the armed forces and the national 
electric and oil companies, as well as the funds of the government's bank 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Banco Latino bought several other banks and invested millions of dollars in 
office buildings (at last count, it owned 493), farms and hundreds of other 
businesses. It became the second-largest bank in Venezuela and held 20% of the 
market. Its officers owned executive jets -- three for bank Chairman Gustavo 
Gomez Lopez alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Paris office was opened last fall, important clients and depositors 
were treated to an all-expenses-paid, three-day trip to France to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 But one month ago, the exultation about the bank turned to grief: In the worst 
failure of its kind in South America, Banco Latino collapsed, endangering not 
only its depositors' fortunes but the entire Venezuelan financial system and 
this nation's economic and political future. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately at risk is more than $1.5 billion in Venezuela and subsidiary 
banks throughout the world, including $243 million in Miami's Banco Latino 
International that is not protected by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts here, that's far from the worst of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total cost of bailing out Banco Latino could reach $5 billion," said one 
of Venezuela's most respected bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 That multibillion-dollar bailout, experts say, is far more than the government 
and the banking system can absorb without setting off a social explosion that 
could seriously endanger Venezuela's already tattered democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuelan officials have said little about Banco Latino's calamities. Bank 
officials have either declined to comment or were unavailable in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Banco Latino's rise and fall begins in the late 1970s, when what 
had been a small bank was taken over by some of the country's most powerful 
industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
 They were so close to Carlos Andres Perez, then serving his first term as 
Venezuelan president, that Banco Latino was dubbed by many the "Bank of the 12 
Apostles" because of its support and connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Banco Latino's president was Pedro Tinoco. He was so close to Perez that he 
was named the Venezuelan central bank's chief when Perez won a second term as 
president in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bank "apostles" included members of the Gustavo Cisneros clan, 
considered one of the two richest families in the country, and Francisco Perez, 
the president's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all of this power, Banco Latino remained relatively insignificant 
until four or five years ago, when it began a big push to capture at least a 
20% market share. 
</P>
<P>
 It launched a creative, wide-ranging advertising campaign. It accepted smaller 
minimum deposits to attract clients. It put up automated teller machines and 
dozens of branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, it offered high interest rates. In an economic system already rife 
with inflation, many Venezuelan banks were offering interest rates reaching 
70%; Banco Latino gave 8% beyond that and sometimes even 12% more. When 
certificates of deposit paid 50%, Banco Latino paid nearly twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 As a growth strategy, this plan worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Banco Latino moved from eighth place in savings deposits in 1989 to No. 1 last 
year and was clearly Venezuela's No. 2 bank overall. Its marketing efforts were 
so seductive that the U.S. Embassy here even deposited funds with Banco Latino 
at a time when American economic experts were beginning to worry about the 
bank's stability. 
</P>
<P>
 According to banking experts -- who asked not to be identified -- Banco 
Latino's problems began in the early 1990s, when Venezuela's economy went into 
deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices dropped," said an analyst who sits on the board of another bank, "and 
the investments Banco Latino (made) stopped producing cash income. It became 
impossible for Banco Latino to generate enough liquidity to keep up its 
interest to depositors." 
</P>
<P>
 Another banking source called the bank's investments "improvident to begin 
with." The bank had sunk its money into long-range investments and, "even in 
good times, (these) couldn't have provided the cash needed" more immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of retrenching and ridding itself of its bad investments, Banco 
Latino began what one expert labeled "a Ponzi game," named for the American 
confidence man who bilked investors of millions in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it became harder to pay its interest, the bank raised its rates even 
higher to attract (more) funds," the source said. "At one point, it even paid 
100% when the normal rate was 70%." 
</P>
<P>
 By last October, insiders had caught on to what was happening, sources said, 
particularly when Banco Latino once paid 1,000% interest on an overnight, 
inter-bank loan used to maintain liquidity in its system. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at this point in Banco Latino's problem-filled life, experts said, 
the government declined to act, partially because of a fear that intervention 
would bring down the entire banking system by creating a panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing a part was the political situation. Although Perez was in trouble 
and ultimately would be forced from the Venezuelan presidency, his power was 
real, as was that of his appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also have to realize," one banking source said "that many people just 
couldn't believe that a bank as powerful as Banco Latino could collapse. People 
would say that the No. 2 bank, the 'Bank of the 12 Apostles,' would not be 
allowed to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 By January, however, there wasn't much that could be done. Even employees 
began pulling out deposits, setting off a run against the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of its directors fled, many to Miami. About $900 million was pulled from 
Banco Latino and sent to its bank in Curacao, the largest island in the 
Netherlands Antilles, just north of Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Jan. 13, the Venezuelan government intervened, freezing all of 
Banco Latino's funds. The Curacao bank was shut by Dutch officials; the Miami 
operation was closed when depositors clogged the bank, demanding money from 
uninsured accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venezuela, government regulators found a financial nightmare as they 
investigated the Banco Latino collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that the bank could not cover its accounts; its assets had been 
misstated; its capital was backed by undervalued or fraudulent bonds; its 
reserves for bad loans were woefully short. 
</P>
<P>
 Government agents who took over the bank began on Jan. 28 paying back some 
customers -- those with certain savings accounts -- up to $9,300, a figure that 
doubled as of Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 But that covers only a tiny percentage of deposits. It does not apply to 
checking accounts or the other, enormous investments held by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 All the armed forces pension funds in Venezuela, for example, are frozen, as 
are parts of pensions for the government-owned electrical and petroleum 
monopolies. The total value of the Venezuelan government accounts held by Banco 
Latino is estimated at almost $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, and as an example of the cozy relationship between the bank and the 
government, are funds deposited in Banco Latino by the Deposit Guarantee Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, known as Fogades, is the Venezuelan equivalent of the U.S. Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. Government records show that Fogades had put 33.6% of 
its resources in Banco Latino and 13% more in another bank largely owned by 
Banco Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be as if the FDIC had given half of its money to the worst of the 
(American) savings and loans," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still more bad news. The Fogades money, as well as other government 
funds, was not kept in highly liquid accounts, as the law requires. Instead, it 
was put into investments that, even if they are sound, will not pay returns for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources blamed these gaffes on the inexperience of Esperanza Martino, the 
Fogades chief, who is the wife of the onetime head of Perez's personal security 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the question now is what to do to salvage the Banco Latino 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 To the consternation of some experts, not much appears to be happening. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and several large Venezuelan banks are pooling their reserves 
to pay off savings account holders. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also offering other temporary support to troubled institutions that, 
in exchange, must increase their capital, take write-offs on bad loans and 
investments, limit their new credits and pledge to live up to the new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank, for example, has reduced its reserve requirement to help 
other troubled banks avert a general run. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts see hope in the implementation of a new banking law that took 
effect Jan. 1. It calls for tighter regulations and stronger enforcement in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the government has made broadcasts three or four times a day in an 
attempt to assure the public of the banking system's stability. Officials hope 
to prevent a panic and to keep Venezuelans from turning to foreign currency, 
particularly U.S. dollars, as an investment haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing goes wrong and there isn't a run . . . it might work, at least for 
the short run," one economist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela's stability has already taken a series of hits, what with two 
serious coup attempts in 1992, criminal charges that forced Perez to resign 
last year and a criminal indictment of another former president, Jaime 
Lusinchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, of course, resolving the current crisis will rest with the new 
government of Rafael Caldera, said one economist, who noted that the president 
is "perceived as honest and incorruptible. If he acts quickly and decisively, 
there may be time to reform the system and save it."

ISRAELI OFFICIALS WARY OF KEEPING SMALL SETTLEMENTS; MIDEAST: PERES QUESTIONS 
NATION'S ABILITY TO PROTECT SETTLERS. STATEMENT UNLEASHES RESENTMENT IN GAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a windy strip of coastline between the Mediterranean and the turbulent 
slums of Gaza, painted like a still life of white stucco, red tile and sandy 
gardens across a landscape of conflict, stands this unlikely wedge of suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is home to 28 Jewish families who, protected by armed guards and a high 
fence of barbed wire, have taken up residence in the very maelstrom of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. Their tranquil homes lie just three miles south of the 
birthplace of the Palestinian uprising, and their future as Jews lies in a land 
that may soon be flying the flag of Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiators debate a final agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, Israel's determination to ensure 
security for settlements like Netzarim is raising troubling questions about how 
far the protective arm of the Israeli army can stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres gave the strongest voice ever to those 
doubts over the weekend when he expressed skepticism about whether Israel could 
afford to continue protecting small Jewish settlements like Netzarim. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some questions that have to be asked aloud," Peres told Israel 
Radio. "What is the point of maintaining a settlement with 28 families that 
needs workers from Thailand, that needs an army platoon to guard it and needs 
to have its road guarded by patrols? Where is the logic? Where is the point?" 
</P>
<P>
 With his remarks, which unleashed a flood of resentment among Jewish settlers 
in Gaza, Peres became the most senior figure in the Israeli government to raise 
questions about the future of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Cabinet officials, Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban and Environment 
Minister Yossi Sarid, expressed similar sentiments Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tiny settlement is stuck like a bone in the throat in the Strip. . . . 
We have to seriously discuss the possibility of evacuating it," Tsaban said of 
Netzarim, and Sarid called the settlement "a hole in the head, and you have to 
plug a hole in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks are scheduled to resume today in the Egyptian resort town of Taba 
to work out further details of a Palestinian autonomy agreement, even as other 
Arabs reopen parallel peace talks with Israel in Washington. Yet the issue of 
the 5,000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip, one of the most difficult points 
in the preliminary agreement initialed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in Cairo last week, promises to be one of the most difficult 
security issues as the Palestinian autonomy plan unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 While the majority of Gaza settlers live in the cluster of Jewish communities 
known as Gush Qatif in the south of Gaza, three settlements -- Netzarim, with 
28 families, Kfar Darom, with 30 families, and Morag, with about 25 families -- 
lie farther north along a major thoroughfare that is scheduled for transfer to 
Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting them and the Gush Qatif communities will involve Israeli control of 
at least three east-west thoroughfares in Gaza and difficult decisions on 
issues like joint road patrols with Palestinians -- a subject that consumed a 
great deal of the discussion in Cairo. The Cairo agreement specifies that 
expensive road overpasses will have to be built to allow Jewish settlers to 
leave their enclaves without crossing Palestinian thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many Gaza settlers are troubled that the agreement does not go far 
enough to protect their safety at a time when they are about to be surrounded 
by an autonomous Palestinian enclave, much of it hostile to Jewish communities 
in its midst. 
</P>
<P>
 "The protection they're offering in no way looks proportional to the danger 
that is going to happen," said Datya Herskovitz, spokeswoman for the Gaza Coast 
settlers association. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'Get rid of Gaza, give it to the Palestinians, all your 
problems will be solved.' But . . . Gaza will not go away," she said. "People 
next will say, 'Get rid of the West Bank, get rid of the Golan Heights.' And 
next is someone going to say, 'Get rid of Jerusalem'? " 
</P>
<P>
 In Netzarim, there is a sense that Peres' comments betrayed Israel's 
longstanding commitment to protect Jewish settlements, wherever they are, 
whatever their size -- and also a nagging memory of the settlements in the 
nearby northern Sinai that were forcibly dismantled when the area was returned 
to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sorry to hear Peres saying these statements. I hope these thoughts 
will go away, because the importance of this place is huge," said Ronen Harari, 
a yeshiva student who lives with his wife and two young children in the 
2-year-old Netzarim settlement, a community built on the site of a former 
kibbutz opened in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Netzarim residents, Harari believes the settlement provides a 
crucial strategic role for the Israeli army in maintaining a foothold in 
northern Gaza once Palestinian self-rule takes effect. And like other 
residents, the Hararis are not optimistic that the current talks are about to 
produce peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the new bases and facilities being built by the army now in 
preparation, and to me, these facilities are preparations for war, not peace," 
said 26-year-old Meri Harari. "The animosity and the conflict is a conflict of 
thousands of years, and there is no instant solution to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near the blooming greenhouses that fill the outskirts of the 
settlement -- up to half of Israel's tomato exports now come from Gaza 
settlements -- Eliyahu Uzan, 33, said most settlers feel confident that Peres 
was not speaking for the majority of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I know very well: The government of Israel won't do anything to 
abandon us or to compromise our personal safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 150 Jewish families moved into Gaza. Nearly 500 new homes stand 
ready for additional families in the months ahead, and the settlement council 
is busy trying to attract new industry to provide jobs for settlers. The people 
of Netzarim hope it will no longer be an outpost of just 28 families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're convinced that in the next few years, whoever comes to Netzarim will 
find hundreds and hundreds of families," Meri Harari said.

DEFENSE CHIEF SEES LITTLE AIR STRIKE RISK; BALKANS: PERRY IS CONFIDENT THAT 
SERBIAN WEAPONS POSE ONLY A MINIMAL THREAT TO AMERICAN PLANES. BOSNIAN SERBS 
RESUME TURNING IN THEIR BIG GUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the United States prepares to take part in possible air strikes over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry asserted Sunday that 
"the risks will be minimal" that any American warplane would be shot down or 
any pilot taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had airplanes flying air cover over Bosnia for some time now," Perry 
said in an ABC television interview. ". . . We have a very high-performance 
aircraft, the best in the world, over there, and there is a minimal air-defense 
system that we're going against." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's confidence was echoed by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who 
said in a separate TV interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" that "we're not 
talking about the (former) Soviet (Union). We're talking about the Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is planning to participate in the air strikes as part of a 
NATO operation that could begin one week from today if the guns around Sarajevo 
are not pulled back to at least 12 miles from the city's downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 A shaky truce prevailed in Sarajevo on Sunday and Bosnian Serbs besieging the 
city resumed turning in some of their big guns, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy spent the day packing the families of 35 diplomats out of 
Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia. Dutch, British and German officials also have 
urged their citizens to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation of dependents was a precaution against Serbian reprisals in the 
event of air strikes. Many in the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government and army 
support the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, appearing on "This Week With David Brinkley" in his first television 
interview as defense secretary, described in detail what would happen to 
Bosnian Serb artillery if it tried to fire during any NATO air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, if the shells come in, we can deploy artillery-locating radars 
which will backtrack the position of the guns," he said. "And, secondly, the 
air-strike aircraft we have are the most modern and the most precise in the 
world and with the best sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . From the time of the impact (of the artillery on the ground), it's a 
matter of seconds to get the information, the coordinates, to an airplane. Then 
it's a question of where is the airplane relative to the gun? . . . We are 
maintaining continuous air cover. So if an airplane is near that area, it can 
be there in a matter of a minute or two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "No military operation is without risk," Perry acknowledged. ". . . But the 
risks, I believe, are minimal in this operation." 
</P>
<P>
 If the first air strikes didn't work, the defense secretary said, the Clinton 
Administration would consider other military options, including increasing the 
intensity of air strikes and extending them to areas beyond Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry emphasized, "We are not looking at options which involve the commitment 
of U.S. ground forces to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the United States has pledged to provide thousands of peacekeeping 
troops to help enforce any peace plan agreed to by all warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported from Sarajevo that U.N. officials over the 
weekend accepted a compromise plan under which the Bosnian Serbs besieging the 
city will be allowed to turn in their heavy weapons at U.N.-monitored Serbian 
bases, rather than at the Sarajevo airport as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian army objected. "Those weapons can be returned to combat positions 
very fast," Bosnian Gen. Fikret Muslimovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid that such an approach and an attempt to appease the aggression 
further would bring a hardening of the Serbian position," said Haris Silajdzic, 
the Bosnian prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs had earlier insisted that they would surrender their guns 
only if the Muslim-dominated government's infantry abandoned its front-line 
positions. But after heavy lobbying by U.N. officials, the Serbs turned over 13 
heavy weapons on Sunday, bringing the total to 36 guns: 26 Serbian and 10 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs are believed to have at least 500 heavy weapons. The Bosnian 
army has perhaps a tenth that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, U.N. officials in Sarajevo made statements suggesting that the 
NATO deadline for lifting the siege of Sarajevo is not set in stone, according 
to a report in the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said they told Bosnian Serbs that they were not necessarily 
concerned that some Serbian guns might remain pointing at the capital after the 
Feb. 21 deadline. The officials argued that altering terms of the ultimatum is 
part of the process of lifting the siege by peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. and NATO officials have remained adamant about enforcing the 
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zagreb on Sunday, U.S. Adm. Jeremy Boorda, NATO's southern flank commander, 
met with Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, and 
Yasushi Akashi, special U.N. representative in the former Yugoslav federation, 
to coordinate action, the Associated Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has given Akashi the authority to 
order air strikes. Rose will report on whether Bosnian Serb guns still threaten 
Sarajevo. Boorda commands the planes that would carry out any bombing.

LOBBYISTS USE ALL WEAPONS IN LEGISLATIVE WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fiercely contested bill to triple late fees for bank credit cardholders was 
bottled up in an unsympathetic Senate committee last year -- headed for defeat 
-- when lobbyists for the bankers decided that their backs were against the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time for an attempted hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic would have melded the credit card fee with a distantly related 
measure, bypassed the hostile committee and taken the vote directly to the full 
Senate, where passage seemed likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But their effort failed and Senate Bill 1145, by Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright 
(D-Concord), which might bring $60 million a year to California banks, was put 
to a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee this month and narrowly defeated. 
Even so, the battle continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit card measure is one of hundreds of bitterly fought bills introduced 
every year that are of deep concern to narrow interests but receive little if 
any public attention. Such bills pit one battalion of high-priced lobbyists 
against another in grinding legislative warfare enlivened by bold assaults and 
tactical surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 With huge sums at stake, lobbyists often reach for the bayonets and rifles of 
their trade -- the "spot bill," the "gut and rewrite," committee shopping, 
closed-door negotiations and well-placed campaign contributions. Even an 
occasional "hijacking." 
</P>
<P>
 The maneuvering over the credit card bill offers a glimpse at the process -- 
at the strategies and tactics of lobbyists. Particularly when one powerful 
interest clashes with another, the noise can be overwhelming -- and the voice 
of ordinary consumers can be lost in the din. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case the bill's sponsor, the California Bankers Assn., is supported by 
some of the largest financial institutions in the country, including Bank of 
America, Wells Fargo, Citicorp and Household International. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the nonprofit Consumers Union, publisher of Consumers 
Report, and the California Trial Lawyers Assn., with close ties to the 
Democratic legislative leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers' bill was a reaction to a decade of class-action lawsuits that 
have cost the state's banks more than $30 million in penalties and rebates. The 
courts found that many banks were overcharging credit card customers for making 
late payments or exceeding their credit limits -- in violation of century-old 
California contract law that limits the banks' recovery to actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits have forced California-based banks to limit the penalties to 
about $5 -- a third of the $15 charged by many out-of-state banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten in the courts, the banks decided to respond with a bill that would 
allow them to charge whatever late fees and over-limit penalties they chose. 
The Spot Bill 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wells Fargo officials went to Boatwright and persuaded him to carry 
the bill, which was written by the California Bankers Assn. The bankers argued 
that California would lose thousands of jobs because credit card operations 
based here could not charge the same high penalties as out-of-state 
competitors. In general, banks may issue cards all over the country but are 
governed by the laws of their home states. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a bill to lift the limits in California, some banks said they would 
move their credit card units to friendlier states, such as Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wells Fargo credit card operation is located in my district," Boatwright 
said. "I didn't want to lose several hundred jobs in my district." 
</P>
<P>
 But the five-line bill that Boatwright introduced in March had to do with 
disclosure of bank account charges and made no mention at all of late or 
over-limit fees. Opponents described the measure as "a spot bill," trivial 
legislation intended to hold a place for the real bill to follow. Its real 
purpose was to make sure the bill got to a friendly committee. Committee 
Shopping 
</P>
<P>
 Because the spot bill was strictly a banking measure, with no effect on credit 
card fees, it was referred to just such a sympathetic committee -- the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Commerce and International Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright is a member. And chairing the committee at the time was Sen. Wadie 
P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), for years a paid director of the Pacific Commerce Bank of 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the committee members had received significant contributions from 
the banks. The biggest beneficiary was Deddeh, who received $5,000 from the 
bankers' political action committee for his unsuccessful 1992 run for Congress. 
The Gut and Rewrite 
</P>
<P>
 In late April, just weeks before the banking committee was scheduled to hear 
the measure, Boatwright amended his bill -- dropping all five lines and 
substituting language that would eliminate the ceiling on credit card late fees 
and over-limit charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parlance of lobbying, this was a classic "gut and rewrite," taking the 
potential opposition by surprise while the bill sat in a favorable committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, which tries to keep track of all bills affecting consumers, 
spotted the change, and lobbyist Gail Hillebrand began making the rounds of 
legislative offices in an effort to defeat it. Her approach was the most basic 
form of lobbying, arguing the bill on its merits. At one point, she allowed a 
reporter to trail after her, acknowledging that she hoped his presence might 
slow efforts by the bankers to slip their measure through. 
</P>
<P>
 Her message was that the bill would hurt consumers and jettison a hundred 
years of established contract law. She often ended conversations with lawmakers 
or their aides by asking: "Is this the message you want to send? 'You lose in 
court and you get it overturned in the Legislature.' " Finding Allies 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists for the Consumers Union realized that their arguments alone were 
unlikely to carry the day. They sought out a powerful ally to defeat the 
bankers and found one -- the California Trial Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among this group's members were a number of attorneys who had discovered a 
bonanza in filing class-action lawsuits against banks. Leaders in the field 
were two association members, James and Patricia Sturdevant, a San Francisco 
husband-and-wife team, who had been awarded more than $3 million in attorney 
fees in a series of cases filed against Wells Fargo Bank. The Sturdevants hired 
a lobbyist, Richard E. Damm, who worked closely with the trial lawyers' 
lobbyists against the bankers' bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers group is one of the most influential in the Capitol. Its political 
action committee donated $671,778 to state races during the 1991-92 legislative 
session -- almost twice the $343,100 from the California Bankers Assn. Many 
lawmakers are attorneys sympathetic to the trial lawyers' positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the united forces of consumers and attorneys had little hope of 
killing the credit card bill in the Senate Banking Committee. Shopping Again 
</P>
<P>
 So opponents went to Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), then chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial lawyers' lobbyist Donald C. Green asked Lockyer to have the measure 
referred to his committee, where the bill stood little chance of passage. An 
attorney, Lockyer has long enjoyed the financial backing of the trial lawyers, 
who gave his campaign $11,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Lockyer, now Senate president pro tem, was quite frank about 
the tactics of committee shopping. "One of the games that people play," he 
said, "is to introduce a bill and have it assigned to a committee regarded as 
friendly and then amend it in ways that, if originally written that way, it 
would have gone to a different committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that the banking community has a lot of influence with the 
banking committee," he said. And he admitted that the trial lawyers have 
similar clout with the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new subject matter, Lockyer agreed with the lawyers and said 
the bankers' bill belonged in his committee. Making sure it got there, he said, 
was "part of my job as chairman." 
</P>
<P>
 So on the same day that the Senate Banking Committee voted 6 to 1 to approve 
the bankers' measure, the Senate Rules Committee, which assigns bills to 
committees, unanimously agreed to send the bill to Lockyer's committee as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Every committee vote is another opportunity for opponents to kill a bill and 
the bankers knew their bill would be in trouble in the Judiciary Committee. "We 
didn't want to be in two committees," California Bankers Assn. lobbyist Gregory 
O. Wilhelm said. Private Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was another round of intensive conversations with lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm contended that failure to act would cost the state 20,000 jobs. The 
assertion was based on a series of studies, all funded by the credit card 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The banking lobbyists also got out the word that both lawyers and consumer 
groups had directly benefited from the class-action lawsuits. Last year, a 
judge awarded Consumers Union $703,000 in a late-fee overcharge case against 
Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyist Hillebrand countered that her group was willing to compromise -- 
setting reasonable fee limits and shielding the state's banks from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his power as committee chairman, Lockyer insisted on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in a May hearing, Lockyer ordered lobbyists from both sides to 
meet in the tiny Senate Judiciary Committee law library and work something out. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over the meeting was committee consultant Gene Wong. But no 
lawmakers attended the closed-door session, and the public was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers were unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour, Lockyer ducked in, asking whether there had been any progress. 
When told there had been none, several of those present said he replied: "Well, 
I guess the bill's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the hearing room, Lockyer postponed the vote indefinitely and berated 
the banks publicly for being "unnecessarily rigid. We want to keep your jobs in 
this state. . . . We don't want a repeat of the S & L debacle where consumers 
were ripped off." The Hijacking 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days of last year's legislative session, the bankers made a 
desperate effort to revive their bill with a "hijacking." 
</P>
<P>
 They approached Assemblyman Sal Cannella (D-Modesto), who had a bill to stop 
credit card issuers from disclosing information to telemarketers and others 
unless cardholders were given a chance to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannella bill had won approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was 
awaiting a final vote by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want people thinking they were gangsters in the night," Cannella 
said. "They didn't threaten to kill my bill or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cannella said he went to Lockyer, who told him that unless a compromise 
could be worked out on the late fee issue, the consumer protections in his bill 
could also go down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannella turned the bankers down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never give up," banking lobbyist Wilhelm later explained. "As long as the 
Legislature is in business, you'd like to see if you can advance the ball." 
Trying Again 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers had no choice but to wait out the four-month legislative recess. 
In January, at another hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the bankers 
offered a modest compromise. They would amend their bill, putting a limit on 
late fees and over-limit penalties, but setting them at $15 -- triple the 
amount most California banks are now charging. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial lawyer and consumer lobbyists countered with a proposal of their own 
-- allowing late fees of $3 or $6 depending on how tardy the payments were. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer and Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), then Senate president pro tem, 
proposed a middle ground -- limiting penalties to $10, but adding a 10-day 
grace period for credit card customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of votes, the committee rejected all the compromises and then 
defeated the Boatwright bill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, every lobbyist knows that no bill is ever dead as long as the 
Legislature remains in session. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bankers are considering introducing the same measure all over again -- 
in the Assembly. The Lobbyist's Vernacular (Southland Edition, A20) 
</P>
<P>
 Every profession has its own coded vocabulary to deal with day-to-day 
business. Lobbying is no different. Here is a brief glossary of terms used by 
lobbyists and legislators in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lobbyist -- In common usage, anyone paid to influence the actions of 
legislators or other government officials. But rules established by the Fair 
Political Practices Commission define lobbyist much more narrowly. In 
California a lobbyist is anyone paid $2,000 or more in a month to influence 
legislative or administrative action, or who is paid any amount and makes 25 
contacts with government officials in a two-month period. Many people who lobby 
can rightfully say they are not "lobbyists" under the definition and thus 
escape most regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third House -- The lobbying corps in the Capitol, so-called because of its 
pivotal role in the operations of the Legislature. The first two houses are the 
Assembly and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Author -- The legislator whose name appears on a bill. Often, the real 
author of a measure is a lobbyist or an attorney for a special interest. In 
some cases "authors" freely admit that they are carrying a bill for a 
constituent, corporation, trade group or labor union, and will bow to the 
wishes of a special interest on questions of strategy or amendments. Other 
"authors" insist on maintaining control over bills and reserve the right to 
reject any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sponsor -- The special interest that is the moving force behind a bill. It 
could be an association of doctors, a large company or an environmental group 
like the Sierra Club. Increasingly sponsors are writing their own legislation 
and supplying all the staff work, even scripting speeches for legislators to 
deliver on the floor when the bill comes up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spot bill -- A measure of little or no consequence, introduced and moved 
through the Legislature so that it can later be stripped and rewritten, often 
into a bill that does a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gut and rewrite -- An amendment that totally changes the character of a bill 
by removing all the old language and replacing it. This is done with a spot 
bill when its sponsor is ready to move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hijacking -- Seizing a bill and using it for a completely different purpose 
than originally intended. Hijacking most often occurs near the end of a session 
or at crucial deadline times in order to bypass parliamentary rules and enact a 
measure quickly.

TANTALIZING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW JURORS THINK. LAWYERS OFTEN RELY ON THEIR OWN

 "If the plaintiff is a woman and has those qualities which other women envy -- 
good looks, a handsome husband, wealth, social position -- then women jurors 
would be unwise. Women's inhumanity to women is unequaled. They are the 
severest judges of their own sex . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Melvin M. Belli Sr., 1982 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like women jurors because I can't trust them. They do, however, make 
the best jurors in cases involving crimes against children. It is possible that 
their 'women's intuition' can help you if you can't win your case with the 
facts . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- From a 1970s jury selection manual for Dallas prosecutors 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly it is astonishing how few gender differences you can find on most 
questions."  
</P>
<P>
 -- University of Chicago law professor Albert Alschuler, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Menendez trial even started, lawyers in the case assumed that 
female jurors would be good for the defense, men for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 More than six months later, the Erik and Lyle Menendez juries were deadlocked, 
torn between the prosecution's argument that the brothers murdered their 
parents out of hatred and greed and the defense's contention that they feared 
for their lives after years of abuse by their father. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome has set off a tantalizing debate over a question that jury experts 
have grappled with for years: 
</P>
<P>
 Does gender play a role in jury decisions? 
</P>
<P>
 Some close observers of the sensational trial argue that it most surely did. 
Totaling the votes from both panels shows a majority of men for murder 
convictions and of women for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Erik Menendez's jury, the gender split could not have been more pronounced 
in the killing of his father, Jose. Deliberations churned up a bitter battle of 
the sexes, with the six men pressing for first- or second-degree murder and the 
six women lined up solidly for lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But such gender divisions are rare on juries, experts say. And, in fact, it 
did not happen that way on Lyle's panel: Women were slightly harsher than the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the widely held views of attorneys, studies have found that the 
gender of jurors does not shape most verdicts. Although jurors of one gender 
may be responsible for a certain case's outcome, research shows statistical 
differences between male and female jurors only in sexual assault trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual assault did figure in the Menendez case, where both brothers claimed 
that their father raped and molested them. But unlike Lyle Menendez, who said 
his father abused him for two years as a child, Erik Menendez testified that he 
was molested until the time of the killings. He, therefore, may have been 
perceived as having suffered more than his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women might have been more likely to believe in the possibility of long-term 
sexual abuse than men," said Valerie Hans, a University of Delaware criminal 
justice and psychology professor and co-author of "Judging the Jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the gender polarization on Erik Menendez's jury also may have 
been triggered by hostility that developed during deliberations, prompting 
female and male jurors to unite by sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Women may be more likely than men to believe testimony by children, ongoing 
research suggests, but it is not clear whether that difference holds up after 
deliberations. More women than men also oppose the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The research suggests that gender typically doesn't make much of a difference 
(in verdicts) except in cases that involve real women's issues, like rape, 
where women are more punitive than men are," said Phoebe Ellsworth, a 
University of Michigan professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the Menendez case only reinforced what many lawyers have 
long believed: Women, particularly mothers, tend to be more sympathetic to 
certain kinds of defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a death penalty case," said prominent Los Angeles criminal 
defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, "you want a mother on the jury or someone who 
understands about raising children." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than gender attitudes, the different jury votes may have reflected 
the different styles and personalities of the two defense attorneys, Cochran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that some of the men on Erik Menendez's jury "may have felt 
threatened" by defense attorney Leslie Abramson, while the women may have been 
captivated by her "dominating presence" in court. He said her maternal 
gestures, such as picking lint off Erik's shoulders, may have particularly 
struck a chord with the women. Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's attorney, was "a 
bit more low key, not as dominating in the courtroom," Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all sorts of factors can shape jury decisions. Juries often bend the law 
when they believe the outcome would be unjust, a factor cited by experts to 
explain the recent acquittal of Lorena Bobbitt and the verdicts in the Reginald 
O. Denny beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 During Prohibition, juries rarely convicted bootleggers. Before the Civil War, 
Northern juries almost never convicted people charged with helping slaves 
escape. In 18th-Century England, juries refused to convict people in capital 
cases because they found the death penalty too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, abuse defenses resonate as realistic in what one legal expert called 
our "Oprah Winfrey society," accustomed to tales of dysfunctional families and 
famous people distraught because of childhood abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 A male juror admitted that he believed Lyle Menendez was legally guilty of 
first-degree murder but voted for second-degree because he felt "pity" for him 
after hearing his claims of abuse. "The physical abuse was so severe, I didn't 
want to convict him on first-degree murder," said the juror, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Although women today are considered more sympathetic to sexual assault 
victims, lawyers widely assumed 15 years ago that women tended to blame the 
victim in rape cases. Some research back then suggested that women needed to 
distance themselves from the victim so they could convince themselves "This 
could not happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury experts also have learned over the years that geography can affect views 
of people of the same gender. Pretrial polls taken in the early 1970s showed 
that women in Pennsylvania were more sympathetic than men to defendants in 
anti-war cases. But similar polls in Florida found women were harsher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best guess that we have," said Neil Vidmar, a Duke University law 
professor and jury consultant, "is that at least at that time, Southern women 
were much more traditional and deferential to authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in abuse cases, predicting female jurors' attitudes can be tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 When a woman goes on trial for killing an abusive husband, women who have been 
battered themselves may not support the defendant because they never resorted 
to killing, said Lois Heaney, a trial consultant for the Menendez defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In her view, it is important to assess how jurors who suffered abuse dealt 
with it, including whether they sought psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways," Heaney said, "the dangerous person is the person who says 'I 
was abused, but I am fine.' . . . People tend to judge people like themselves 
more harshly." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best jurors for battered women charged with murder have been men, 
she said. They tend to want to distance themselves from the cruelty committed 
by the husband and may feel protective toward the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, lawyers pick jurors according to stereotypes all the time. Most 
of their prejudices are based on how such people voted on previous juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish-Americans have been thought to be good for the defense because they are 
considered emotional and likely to get in trouble with the law, whereas 
Protestants have been seen as strict and judgmental. Women have been viewed as 
sympathetic to the defense, men as more rule-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco criminal defense attorney Gil Eisenberg said he follows his own 
generalizations when picking jurors: Women in their early 20s are categorical, 
judgmental and rigid; middle-aged men are flexible, and Asians submit to 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he has found exceptions to all of these rules. "I pay attention to 
them," he said, "but I am not rigid about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Lynch, a former prosecutor and now a professor of law at Columbia 
University, recalled that a fellow prosecutor many years ago advised him never 
to seat a juror who wore sunglasses indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior, the prosecutor opined, meant the person was probably a 
nonconformist who wanted to cultivate a "hip" image. Prosecutors also were wary 
of people who seemed stubborn, fearing a hung jury. But Lynch now would heed 
such admonitions no more than he would the daily astrology column. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the particular rapport an attorney may sense with a prospective juror is 
more important than anything else about that juror, he said. Lynch recalled 
trying a case in which an older woman, a prospective juror, gazed at him in a 
way he felt was maternal. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just had this fond gaze so I figured this is somebody who is going to be 
good for me, regardless of her political views or gender. And it turned out the 
instinct was right." He later discovered that the juror had a son who was a 
professional about his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that prospective jurors cannot be eliminated 
because of race alone and will soon decide whether they can be eliminated 
because of gender. In the case before the high court, the prosecution 
eliminated men from a jury deciding a paternity case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower courts have frowned on gender-based disqualifications. The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals in October reversed the conviction of a man convicted 
of passing counterfeit securities because the prosecutor disqualified two 
unmarried women from the Los Angeles jury. The prosecutor had argued that the 
women would be physically attracted to the handsome defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of women on juries has not been widely researched. In fact, 
women have been on juries in significant numbers nationwide only since the late 
1960s, said Stanford University law professor Barbara Babcock, who has written 
extensively about juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after women got the vote, she said, some states continued to ban them 
from juries. In later decades, women were routinely excused from jury duty 
because of child-rearing responsibilities. In studying 20 mock juries in 1979 
and 1980, Ellsworth, the University of Michigan researcher, found male jurors 
still did most of the talking. The men were more likely to be elected foreman, 
and they interrupted women more often. In the 20 juries, only one elected a 
forewoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also found that a woman will say something and there won't be any real 
response to it," Ellsworth said. "And sometimes in the next five minutes, a man 
will say the same thing, and people will say: 'That's a good idea. We can get 
somewhere with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Research shows that men and women are equally good at recalling evidence and 
understanding points of law. Bette L. Bottoms, an assistant psychology 
professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, is using mock juries to 
study how male and female jurors respond differently to alleged crimes against 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she has found that women tend to believe children more readily because 
they can more easily "take the place of a child" and empathize with children. 
But the differences are slight and may not hold up after deliberations, a point 
she is still testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, juries tend to be more lenient once they start deliberating 
because they begin to fret about "reasonable doubt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Erik Menendez case, the male and female jurors were divided on their 
first ballot. "We were all in shock" about the gender split, said juror Wendy 
B. Delahunt, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliberations eventually became "nasty and ugly." One female juror accused 
the men of being uncomfortable with strong women, and the men referred to the 
women as "you women," according to Delahunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy district attorney Lester Kuriyama, echoing several experts, said the 
tensions may have polarized the two camps by gender. Looking at the vote count 
on both juries, he said female jurors are not necessarily detrimental to the 
prosecution. "I don't think you can say we don't want women on the juries" 
during the retrials. 
</P>
<P>
 Male jurors thought Erik Menendez was gay, which the prosecution had suggested 
during the trial, and therefore knew how to describe in detail the sex he said 
his father forced on him, Delahunt said. The male jurors also surmised that 
Erik Menendez's father learned of his homosexuality and threatened to cut him 
off financially, providing a motive for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delahunt had her own reasons for wanting leniency. The single mother said 
she was moved by the apparent support the defendants received from their 
grandmother, the mother of the man they killed, as well as by the emotional 
testimony of Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury experts said jurors, regardless of gender, often have difficulty deciding 
cases in which murder victims are portrayed as being as immoral as the 
defendants. Many said they were not surprised by the hung juries in the 
Menendez case and refused to draw generalizations about gender from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lynch: "If you were going to bet money on the outcome of trials based on 
whether the jury had eight men on it or four men on it, you would lose your 
shirt." Divided Juries 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the jury counts in the Lyle and Erik Menendez cases broke down by 
gender:

 The six-month Menendez brothers' trial ended Jan. 28 with both juries 
deadlocked. Lyle and Erik Menendez -- now 26 and 23, respectively -- were 
arrested several months after the 1989 shotgun slayings of their wealthy 
parents at the family's Beverly Hills estate. Prosecutors said they killed out 
of hatred and greed, citing their lavish spending on cars, jewelry and tennis 
lessons. But the trial was dominated by a bold defense that insisted the 
brothers killed in fear after years of sexual and mental abuse. Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to set 
a new trial date. The brothers remain in custody without bail.

HEALTH PROGRAM COULD REALIGN WORK FORCE; REFORM: BUDGET OFFICE WARNS THAT 
SKILLED-UNSKILLED GAP COULD WIDEN. SMALL FIRMS MIGHT KEEP WAGES LOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue has been overshadowed so far by the debate over government spending, 
but congressional analysts warn that President Clinton's health care reform 
plan could contribute to a fundamental restructuring of the U.S. work force. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the Clinton plan 
could widen the existing divide between professional and unskilled workers, 
accelerate the trend toward corporate "outsourcing" of work to independent 
contractors and create new incentives for small businesses to stay small and 
keep wages low. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO analysis, while not intended as an attack on the Clinton plan, could 
provide new ammunition to congressional opponents who hope to stop the White 
House from rewriting the rules governing a sector that accounts for one-seventh 
of the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan budget agency, which prepares financial analyses at the 
request of Congress, says some of the labor market changes it foresees could 
work to the advantage of employees. And it notes that the existing system, 
which leaves 37 million Americans without health insurance and forces others to 
pay far more than their fair share, is hardly a model of fairness or 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the budget office's predictions about potential employment impact could 
increase the wariness of lawmakers who are already hesitant to endorse what is 
arguably the largest piece of social legislation in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any plan that is this complicated is going to have all sorts of unintended 
consequences," said Rudy Penner, an analyst at KPMG Peat Marwick, a Washington 
consulting firm. "We could sit for hours and only think of a fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of poring over the details to recognize all of the possible 
consequences, and I'm sure we missed a lot of them," said CBO Director Robert 
D. Reischauer. "If you make a big change like this, you suddenly get all kinds 
of consequences that you didn't think of." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledge that they recognized the potential for 
labor market disruptions long before Reischauer released the CBO analysis, 
which said the health plan should be regarded as a vast new government 
entitlement program and estimated that it would cause the federal deficit to 
balloon in the near term. But the Administration officials said they saw no 
reason to call attention to the employment impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised no one picked up on this before CBO," said one senior 
Administration policy-maker who requested anonymity. "We didn't really hide it; 
we just didn't stick it in your face for you to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential work force changes identified by the CBO are largely 
attributable to the Administration's decision to soften the blow of health care 
reform on small-business proprietors, who are among the most vocal opponents of 
mandatory universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, all employers would be required to provide health 
insurance for their workers and to pick up most of the cost. Once the plan was 
fully phased in, no company would be required to spend more than 7.9% of its 
total payroll for health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But small firms with many low-wage employees would get a big break: Depending 
on their size and average wages, the maximum contribution would be reduced to 
as little as 3.5% of payroll. The government would pick up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the subsidies could be dramatic. The CBO estimates that a 
typical employer whose workers receive an average of $40,000 a year would be 
required to pay an unsubsidized premium of $2,031 for each single employee on 
its payroll. But a small firm employing unskilled workers whose wages average 
$10,000 a year would qualify for the maximum subsidy, lowering its cost per 
employee to only $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, the less an employer paid its workers, the bigger the 
subsidy it would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO warns that the subsidies could contribute to the stratification of the 
U.S. work force by creating incentives for low-paid workers to migrate to small 
employers, and for well-paid, highly educated workers to congregate at bigger 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential impact on the labor market is enormous, the budget office said. 
By 1998, an estimated 8 million low-wage workers now working for larger 
employers would be worth considerably more to small firms that qualify for the 
health care subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO predicts that 20%, or 1.6 million, of those workers would actually 
change jobs. Some would go voluntarily because subsidized firms could afford to 
pay them more. Some would be forced to make the move as the private sector 
restructured itself in response to the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential shift would be so large that it could add $12 billion a year to 
the cost of the government subsidies starting in the year 2004, the CBO 
analysis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers at different wage levels would have an incentive to work for 
different firms," it said, noting that the creation of two classes of employers 
-- a phenomenon it calls "labor sorting" -- would "reduce the efficiency of the 
labor market." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term impact on the U.S. economy is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this is a problem is that corporations might start doing things 
that don't make economic sense at all except to take advantage of these federal 
subsidies," said John Shiels, a health care expert with Lewin-VHI, a Fairfax, 
Va., consulting firm that has conducted its own analysis of the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations might begin to organize themselves in ways they otherwise 
wouldn't, and become less efficient as a result," Shiels said. "Those 
inefficiencies should be counted as part of the costs of health reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations are already restructuring in response to health care costs. The 
difference is that they are now divided between those that provide private 
insurance and those that don't. "You have got to remember that the current 
system has plenty of unintended consequences of its own," Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO analysis assumes that lower-paid workers would gradually migrate to 
smaller employers because of the economic value of the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a city where the prevailing wage for janitors is $15,000 a 
year, a big employer with a sizable number of higher-paid employees would have 
to pay an additional health care premium of $2,000 or so for each new janitor 
it hired, the CBO calculates. But a small custodial contractor with fewer than 
25 employees and no white-collar workers would pay a premium of only about $500 
because of the payroll cap. 
</P>
<P>
 All other things being equal, the subsidy would make it possible for the 
contractor to bid for the big company's custodial work at less cost than the 
company was paying to do the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the subsidy could trickle down to workers if the contractor 
decided to pay his janitors more than the $15,000 prevailing wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it might trickle down to consumers if the big company reduced its prices as 
its operating expenses declined. In either case, taxpayers would be paying the 
subsidized portion of the health premium. 
</P>
<P>
 For higher-paid employees and their bosses, the incentives could work in the 
opposite direction. For a small, subsidized firm, the presence of one or more 
highly paid professionals on the payroll would reduce the value of the 
government subsidy, since it would be based on a percentage of total wages 
paid. But at bigger firms, where total premiums are not expected to hit the 
7.9% payroll ceiling, big salaries would not necessarily increase health care 
outlays. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could end up with a situation where a company like Microsoft, which has 
lots of highly paid workers, will spin off its janitorial service to take 
advantage of subsidies, while a company like McDonald's, which has lots of 
low-wage workers and only a few high-paid executives, will spin off its 
professional staff into a separate entity to avoid higher costs," said one 
White House official. "We don't know how much of that will take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Reischauer predicts that small firms might eliminate highly paid jobs by doing 
such things as contracting out for advertising and legal work, allowing them to 
shut down in-house departments. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials say labor market distortions are among the first issues 
they will attempt to address as they try to respond to the CBO analysis of the 
Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely modification is one the Clinton health care task force 
considered, but rejected, as it developed its plan last year, according to one 
Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 The premium subsidies could be channeled to individual workers who qualify, 
rather than being funneled to corporations to cover their overall payroll 
costs. That would eliminate the incentive for firms to divide themselves along 
subsidized and non-subsidized lines. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said they originally rejected that idea largely for 
political reasons: It would let rich law firms and investment companies enjoy 
the benefits of having some of their lower-paid workers receive subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 But fixing one unintended consequence could lead to yet another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is things like this that make me a gradualist when it comes to public 
policy," Penner said. "This plan, after all, is the equivalent of creating not 
one, but several new federal entitlement programs all layered on top of each 
other. And we are all just making guesses about what this plan would do."

FRENCH LOOSEN TIES TO FORMER AFRICA COLONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When African leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny was laid to rest last week in Ivory 
Coast, 3,000 miles south of Paris, 100 French politicians stood dutifully at 
the graveside. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and 
other French officials mourned an old friend and assured Africa of their 
support, they were steadily putting an end to the long, cozy and paternalistic 
relationship with France's former colonies on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy changes, which include a 50% devaluation in the French-backed 
currency in 13 African nations last month, have angered some African leaders 
and created sudden economic chaos in a French-speaking region that represents a 
third of the continent. And France's influence in Africa, though still strong, 
is bound to diminish, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance is that France is letting go of its pretension to be a 
global empire," said Mort Rosenblum, author of "Mission to Civilize," a book on 
France's relationship with its former colonies. "This just shows that France is 
not willing to stand against any tide." 
</P>
<P>
 The tide, in this case, was the growing drain of Africa's beleaguered 
economies on France's own recession-hit budget. 
</P>
<P>
 For 46 years, France has propped up the currencies of African countries in the 
"Franc Zone," guaranteeing to exchange their currencies for French francs at a 
rate of 50-to-1. France has also spent an estimated $3 billion a year in its 
former African colonies, including gifts to meet month-end shortfalls in civil 
servants' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had the feeling we were wasting our money," said a top-level French 
official in Paris. "It wasn't going for development but rather for salaries and 
debt payments. So we've said: 'We'll help you in an emergency. But we don't 
want this to become a habit anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The French government insists that it is not abandoning Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, it tried to soften the blow of its new policy by writing off $5 
billion in loans to Africa. (In fact, much of France's aid to Africa flows back 
into France in contracts for French companies.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the French say they want to force Francophone Africa to practice the same 
fiscal austerity required these days by the government in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to our African friends is, 'We can help you, but we want you to 
be responsible too,' " the French official said. "We will have our shared 
history for a long time. But what is changing is the way we look at Africans. 
Maybe we don't look down on them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the devaluation, from 50-to-1 to 100-to-1, was tough economic 
medicine. The region had been accustomed to relative economic and political 
stability, thanks to France's treasury and, occasionally, its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for many Africans, the sudden drop in the value of their African francs 
represented the biggest change in their lives since independence. 
</P>
<P>
 African leaders, under pressure from France and international lenders, agreed 
to the measures at a meeting in January in Dakar, Senegal. (Thirteen accepted a 
50% devaluation, while the tiny island nation of Comoros agreed only to a 33% 
devaluation.) 
</P>
<P>
 But some African officials complained later that they had been presented with 
a fait accompli.  
</P>
<P>
 L'Union newspaper, the mouthpiece for Gabon's president, Omar Bongo, sharply 
criticized the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selloff of black Africa has begun," it said in an editorial. "De Gaulle 
must be turning in his grave. Your heirs have gone crazy, mon general. " 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur strongly defended the devaluation and applauded the "courage" of the 
African leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was difficult," he said, "but it shows that Africa is taking its 
destiny in hand and ensuring the long-term development and well-being of its 
people. And France will do its utmost to help these countries get through these 
difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
 The devaluation will cause prices of imported goods in Francophone Africa to 
double, which is likely eventually to hurt French exports to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher prices for such imported staples as rice, already announced by some 
African leaders, have created deep anxiety in French African capitals. And 
shoppers went on a buying spree after the devaluation announcement, wiping 
shelves clean of goods priced according to the old exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 African leaders are worried because food riots on the continent have toppled 
more than one government. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy political peace in the cities, many African nations have maintained 
overvalued currencies, which kept food cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 But those policies also dried up export markets for farmers, prompting many to 
give up on the land and flood the cities in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, economic analysts say, the new exchange rates will make French West 
African products more attractive to the international market, including other 
African countries. 
</P>
<P>
 No immediate increase in exports is expected, though, largely because the 
world market for Africa's primary products, such as cocoa and coffee, is deeply 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, those analysts say, the devaluation was a necessary first step to 
long-term economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis was precipitated by the refusal of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund to lend more money to Francophone African countries 
already unable to meet their debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
 International lenders had demanded a devaluation as a condition of writing new 
loans, and they have responded quickly to help the affected countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand, the Socialist president, had warned Africa in 1990 that future 
French aid would be linked to political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But his government did not follow through, and in fact helped several of its 
friends retain power despite evidence of election fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Gaullists routed the Socialists in French elections last March, and 
Balladur quickened the French policy changes in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur sent a letter to the African leaders last year, urging them to take 
decisive action to heal their economies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a warning unlike any the leaders had ever received from Paris, and it 
prompted several, including Houphouet-Boigny, the aging patriarch of French 
West Africa, to come to France and argue against a devaluation of the African 
currencies. (Houphouet-Boigny died of cancer on Dec. 7 and was buried on Feb. 
7.) 
</P>
<P>
 But France's sentimental attachment to Africa has waned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real generational shift taking place now, and it will continue," 
said an American diplomat with long experience in Africa. "Some of the 
Gaullists care because it's Africa, and it's where France is still a world 
power. But the French people don't care. They'd rather see their money spent in 
places like China, where the French can make money." 'Franc Zone' 
</P>
<P>
 France has for decades propped up the currencies of 14 African countries. But 
that practice is ending as France backs away from the cozy and costly 
relationship with its former colonies. Here are the nations of the "Franc 
Zone."

AMERICAN WINS THE DOWNHILL IN OLYMPIC UPSET 
</P>

<P>
 Tommy Moe of Palmer, Alaska, became only the third American male ever to win 
an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing on Sunday when he defeated, in dramatic 
fashion, local favorite Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway to win the downhill 
before an estimated crowd of 40,000 at Kvitfjell, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe succeeded where Olympic officials had failed, turning attention to the 
Lillehammer Games and away from the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even have any thoughts in my mind that I was going to win," said 
Moe, who won by 0.04 of a second over Aamodt in the closest Alpine race in 
Olympic history. "I just figured, 'Hey, I'll ski the best I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was late getting to the slopes and missed 
Moe's medal-winning run, but she and daughter Chelsea were in attendance later 
in the day when the U.S. hockey team rallied from a two-goal third-period 
deficit to achieve a 4-4 tie against France. 
</P>
<P>
 * Norwegians at the Viking Hall celebrated a world-record-setting gold medal 
performance by countryman Johann Olav Koss, who won easily in the 5,000-meter 
speedskating event. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kerrigan, among the favorites in women's figure skating, issued a statement 
regarding the decision Saturday by U.S. officials to allow Harding to compete 
in the Games despite Harding's admission that she knew about the Jan. 6 attack 
on Kerrigan well before she reported it to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The matter has been resolved," Kerrigan said in the statement, which did not 
mention Harding by name. "Regardless of my opinion on the ruling, the Olympics 
have begun and it's time to skate." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe silenced a mountain full of clanging cowbells with his victory over 
Aamodt, the world's top skier. Moe won with a time of 1 minute, 45.75 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt, skiing from the sixth position, had taken the lead from Luxembourg's 
Marc Girardelli, much to the delight of fans who cheered wildly and waved 
Norwegian flags. 
</P>
<P>
 But the euphoria was short-lived as Moe, skiing right after Aamodt, stunned 
the crowd with the finest race of his career. Although he was the world's 
ninth-ranked downhill skier entering the Lillehammer Games, Moe had never 
before won an international race. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe earned the gold 10 years after Americans Bill Johnson and Phil Mahre won 
the downhill and the slalom, respectively, at the 1984 Sarajevo Games. Johnson, 
Mahre and Moe are the only American men to have earned Olympic gold medals in 
Alpine skiing.

</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Nicks of Costa Mesa's Ice Capades might have used a similar technique 
because his pair, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, performed the best technical 
program of their 21-month partnership. All it earned them was sixth place 
entering Tuesday night's freestyle program, which accounts for two-thirds of 
the final score, but the competition is more daunting than ever before in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did what we came to do, which is skate the best we could," Meno 
said. "There's no reason to be disappointed. Four of the teams ahead of us 
finished among the top five in the Olympics in 1992, and we weren't even 
together then."

</P>
<P>
 After his run, Moe had to wait anxiously to see whether his time would hold up 
with some of the best downhill racers yet to ski, among them Austria's Patrick 
Ortlieb, the defending Olympic champion, and Switzerland's Franz Heinzer, the 
reigning World Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But he really had only two scares. Canada's Ed Podivinsky, racing from the 
21st position, jumped all the way to third place to take the bronze medal with 
his run. And France's Nicolas Burtin, a skier Moe feared on the Kvitfjell 
course, climbed from the 33rd start position all the way to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe earned the gold 10 years after Americans Bill Johnson and Phil Mahre won

HUFFINGTON HITCHES HIS U.S. SENATE RACE TO '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-term Rep. Michael Huffington, preparing to run for the U.S. Senate, has 
signed on as the chief bankroller and co-chairman of the hottest political 
ticket going in California: the proposed "three strikes" anti-crime initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) contributed about $100,000 of his own money to 
help qualify the initiative for the November ballot, and he agreed to help 
direct the campaign along with Mike Reynolds, the father of an 18-year-old 
murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman congressman seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
said he is acting as a concerned citizen and the father of two young daughters, 
not as a candidate. That's why, he said, he did not identify his political 
affiliations in a radio commercial he recently made for the proposed 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read about Polly Klaas' abduction, it just made me mad," said 
Huffington, referring to the kidnaping and murder last year of a 12-year-old 
Petaluma girl. "I was fed up and I wanted to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime promises to be one of the major issues in the coming election year, and 
nothing has proved more irresistible for the 1994 candidates than the 
initiative that seeks a life sentence for habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" -- as the measure is called -- has been 
endorsed by most of the leading candidates for statewide office, and in a 
recent poll it was supported by a whopping 84% of the state's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's support for the initiative is not likely to distinguish him from 
the two other major candidates in the U.S. Senate race because it is also 
backed by Feinstein and Republican challenger William E. Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But his leadership role in the initiative campaign will help him achieve the 
first task he faces in his Senate bid: introducing himself to an electorate 
that does not know him. He said it should also demonstrate his leadership and 
commitment on the issue because he is "putting my money where my mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of politicians say they are for it, but very few people put up the 
commitment to make sure it gets qualified," said Huffington, 46, a former 
banker and the son of a wealthy Texas oilman. "If I had not been able to step 
into this, I'm not sure we would have a measure on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's sponsors said the campaign needs another 50,000 signatures -- 
for a total of about 600,000 -- before March 7 in order to be sure the plan 
qualifies for the November ballot. Reynolds said the effort has been costly and 
when money was short he went to Huffington seeking financial help. He said 
Huffington's contribution represents about a quarter of the campaign's funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's rivals said his role on the initiative highlights his light 
public record. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington won his first public office in 1992 when he spent a record $5.4 
million to unseat a veteran Republican congressman. Asked whether he had been 
involved in anti-crime measures before, Huffington said: "This is the first 
initiative I've seen in a while that makes sense." As for his role in the 
House, he said: "The liberal leadership has not allowed us to play a role in 
anything that is significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein aides have promised that one of the central themes of the senator's 
campaign will be to contrast her experience as a public leader with 
Huffington's lack of a record. They said the crime issue and the "three 
strikes" initiative is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he has been able to do because of his hundreds of millions of dollars in 
personal wealth is . . . try to buy a legislative record," said Kam Kuwata, 
Feinstein's California director. "I think that's what distinguishes the two 
candidates. One is passing laws in the Congress, and the other is trying to buy 
a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer made a similar complaint. "He's seeking to use his personal wealth 
to make himself . . . seem to be strong on crime," the former Orange County 
congressman said. "The voters will sort out what his motivation is." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not new for a candidate seeking statewide office to sponsor a concurrent 
initiative, although the tactic has met with mixed results in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. successfully rode a campaign reform measure into 
the governor's office when he was elected in 1974. But in 1990, Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de Kamp's campaign was bogged down with 
three initiatives that drained precious time and resources from the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think largely candidates have made a mistake in trying to identify 
themselves with initiatives," said Sal Russo, a Republican political consultant 
in Sacramento. "More often than not, it's not a very effective tactic, although 
there are obviously notable exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he plans to campaign for the initiative around the state on 
talk radio programs and in news conferences. Once it qualifies for the ballot, 
he said, he will continue to promote the measure to make sure it passes in 
November, although he is uncertain whether he will contribute more money. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors of the initiative said there is some question about whether it 
will have to go before the voters. The state Legislature is considering five 
"three strikes"-style bills, including one that is virtually identical to the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said that if Gov. Pete Wilson signs a sufficiently similar bill 
before March 7, he might drop the initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington disagreed with that approach, saying the initiative would still be 
necessary because it would be harder to modify or repeal than legislation. 
"That's a key point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Huffington's role in the anti-crime initiative is unconventional, his 
supporters said it is an indication of the style that should be expected from a 
unique candidate who is not a product of the political Establishment. They said 
it demonstrates that he follows his own judgment instead of seeking the most 
politically expeditious route. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understand one thing about Michael Huffington -- he is moved by his 
conscience," said Carlos Rodriguez, an adviser to Huffington's campaign. "These 
are things he firmly believes in. These are things that move him whether he is 
an individual or a candidate running for office."

 When Julie Gassert could no longer face the boarded-up storefronts and cracked 
walls of her favorite San Fernando Valley malls, she headed west this week for 
a more therapeutic shopping experience in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like a ghost town over there," said the Reseda resident, shivering 
as she rested on a bench at The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks. "Here, it feels 
like another world. It's nice to see normal operations and normal things going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 From Oxnard hardware stores supplying lumber to Simi Valley disaster victims 
to Thousand Oaks businesses besieged by Valley residents, the commercial sector 
-- at least in those parts of Ventura County that escaped major damage from the 
earthquake -- has benefited dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite a boon," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce in Thousand Oaks. "We're very pleased to help our neighbors 
to the south." 
</P>
<P>
 The change is particularly noticeable in the commercial rental market, where 
brokers say hardly a large industrial building remains vacant east of Oxnard. 
In two weeks, businesses looking for temporary or permanent working space 
gobbled up about 500,000 square feet of rental space, said Rick Heath, a broker 
with Grubb & Ellis in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big companies needed to act within a week of the earthquake or they lost 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many companies that moved westward from the Valley are Vivitar, the 
camera manufacturer, which moved its corporate headquarters this month from 
Chatsworth to Newbury Park, and computer giant Packard Bell, also formerly of 
Chatsworth, relocating temporarily in Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Between all the new workers trying out local businesses on their lunch breaks 
and Valley residents seeking a haven from persistent aftershocks, business is 
flourishing, merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really hectic," said Gary Endicott, manager of the Thousand Oaks' 
Sears store, which has handled much of the overflow from the closed Sears 
stores in Northridge and Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Local hardware and glass stores say they are swamped with customers since the 
quake jump-started the ailing construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every morning when I drive down the 101 to Oxnard from Thousand Oaks, I'm 
seeing hundreds of glass-carrying trucks heading toward the Valley from as far 
away as Santa Barbara and Goleta," said Dave Gulbranson, owner of Oxnard-based 
Oakstone Glass Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good time to be in the glass business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks, shoppers from the Valley, such as Winona Roark of West Hills, 
fill the mall's boutiques and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting a 5.0 aftershock here like I am out there," Roark, 74, said 
as she searched for an athletics store where she could buy walking shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Roark said she had considered going to one of the malls near her in the West 
Valley, but hopped on the Ventura Freeway when she could not figure out which 
stores were open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew some were open, but we didn't know which ones," she said. "We knew 
they were all open here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Iovine, another customer at The Oaks, said the earthquake had made a 
Thousand Oaks convert out of her and her husband. The couple moved to Agoura 
four years ago after living for years in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever they needed a mall, they headed to Topanga Plaza or the 
now-devastated Northridge Fashion Center. When they wanted to go out to dinner, 
they drove east again, to Calabasas and Woodland Hills. Then the earthquake 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley is home, but right now, it doesn't seem like home," said Iovine, 
55. "It gives me the feeling that a war's been through there, and I wanted to 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, the Iovines tried at least three new restaurants in 
Thousand Oaks and made extensive shopping trips to The Oaks. They have found 
that they like the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less crowded out here -- just delightful," she said. "We're saying, 'Why 
didn't we do more of this before?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Iovines are not the only ones with that thought. The residential rental 
market in undamaged parts of eastern Ventura County and Camarillo has 
skyrocketed since the Jan. 17 temblor, with residents of hard-struck 
neighborhoods in the San Fernando and Simi valleys looking for a temporary roof 
over their heads while their homes are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're filling up fast," said Barbara Beck, operations manager at Hacienda de 
Camarillo Apartments, where about 40 units have been rented since the 
earthquake. "We've been renting to everybody from Northridge all the way to 
Simi Valley, and we're still having people come in today."

RECALL TARGETS VISTA BOARD'S CREATIONISTS; EDUCATION: HANDLING OF SCHOOL 
DISTRICT BY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF BITTER FEUDS. THE 
MEMBERS UNDER FIRE SAY THEY ARE BEING PERSECUTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Since three members of a Christian right majority took control of the city's 
school board in 1992, residents have feuded bitterly over the teaching of 
creationism, sex education and prayer in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new topic has recently moved to center stage in the ongoing political 
debate in this conservative community of 76,000 in north San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recall," said activist parent Barbara Donovan. "We want to recall them. And 
we think we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Targets of the recall effort are board President Deidre Holliday and board 
members John Tyndall and Joyce Lee, who compare themselves to Christians who 
were persecuted during the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has us all wrong," Lee said. "We don't have a private agenda. We 
haven't started half the things we've been accused of. But yes, we are 
Christian. And most of the time, we're being punished only for that." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began in January. The group behind it needs the signatures 
of 9,100 registered voters by today. If successful, the effort will mandate a 
June election that will cost the Vista Unified School District between $12,000 
and $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan, whose son attends the Vista schools, said the recall was organized as 
a response to: 
</P>
<P>
 * The board's efforts to "force" creationism into the district's curriculum 
"and taking up valuable time in marathon school board sessions to do so, at the 
expense of all other agenda items." 
</P>
<P>
 * Attempts to introduce "Sex Respect," a controversial sex education program 
that spurns any talk of contraception in favor of a rigid, 
abstinence-until-marriage approach that has led to litigation in other 
districts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rejection of a $400,000 state grant to fund a pilot program aimed at 
helping low-income minority students. Donovan said board members opposed the 
program's free breakfast component, saying that children eating breakfast away 
from home was warping much-needed "family values." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee says the recall proponents are misguided and that much of the furor has 
been created by "our hostile opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 But Donovan maintains that the three board members' agenda is not educational. 
</P>
<P>
 "Linda Rhoades, one of the other board members, is Christian, but we're not 
trying to recall her, because she doesn't have a private agenda," Donovan said. 
"If we were recalling people just because they were Christian, we would have 
had a recall every year since school boards were invented." 
</P>
<P>
 Holliday, Tyndall and Lee opened the door to the teaching of creationism with 
the introduction of a new science policy late last year that drew national 
attention and stinging rebukes from state educators -- and stirred up the 
debate in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy orders that "discussions of divine creation" shall take place at 
"appropriate times." Educators say the policy comes close to being illegal by 
bridging the line between church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, no school board in the nation is more closely watched than that 
one," said Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the battle escalated, with a Christian voters' lobby accusing the 
state Democratic Party of masterminding the recall. The Rev. Billy Falling said 
state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press fired the first salvo by declaring 
at a recent speech: "We're not going to let the religious right be in charge of 
curriculum, in charge of hiring teachers. We're going to be there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Falling threatened a lawsuit, saying the three board members had been 
discriminated against because they are Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Press countered by saying of Falling: "I hate to burst his bubble, but he's 
not important enough to be on my radar screen." Press said although "recalls 
are provided for under the California Constitution," his party -- to his 
knowledge -- had given no money to the recall effort in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absurdity of the allegation speaks for itself," Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Brazier, a Vista parent and member of the Christian Voters League that 
helped sweep the three to power, said that a local Democratic club had funneled 
at least $100 to recall proponents, based on records filed with San Diego 
County's registrar of voters, a charge the chairman of the Democratic Party in 
San Diego County denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Turvill, spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices Commission in 
Sacramento, said Falling lacks the grounds for a lawsuit if financial 
assistance is his only evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing prohibits the Republican Party or the Democratic Party from making 
contributions to either candidates or ballot measures -- including recalls," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The targeted board members also maintain that a recall is not the proper 
vehicle for challenging their views. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were elected openly and democratically," Lee said. "And if people don't 
like it, they can vote against us the next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the board's fiercest opponents agree with that position and have come 
out against the recall. Some question the expense involved and the political 
risk of throwing a spotlight on the three. One is activist Ken Blalack, who 
said: "They were clearly on the ropes. So why did we need this -- now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tyndall and Lee joined Holliday, a sitting board member, by the 
narrowest of margins. Cox and others say Holliday may well be defeated when she 
runs for reelection in November, thus ending the majority on the five-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blalack believes the high visibility of the recall effort may have helped 
-- rather than hurt -- Holliday's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all the (recall proponents) may have done is stir up a few more amens 
and Hallelujahs at school board meetings in Vista," he said. "Somehow, I hope 
I'm wrong."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE CAMERA LOVES HIM -- WILL AUDIENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown is frozen to a chair in his office, eyes riveted 
on the TV set as he ponders a new talk show host: Himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The show -- "Willie Brown" -- will not debut until March 14, but prototypes 
already have been shot and the Speaker is studying one intensely. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much that intimidates me, but I'm really nervous about whether or 
not I can actually be as good as (the show's creators)," Brown says after the 
tape ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are incredible." He leafs through a booklet that is a 
combination script and prospectus. "Look how they do this -- they've got all 
the dos and don'ts, they've got every minute of it right down to the last 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 Do -- "Make sure your guest gets a chance to express his or her opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't -- "Bully . . . or create an atmosphere of hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's longtime critics might find ironic humor in his embarking on a career 
where he must be patient and not bully. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democratic leader says he has become "definitely a lot more tolerant" 
of people and opinions. As term limits have produced more inexperienced 
lawmakers, he says, "I've had to readjust my mind" and be "more like a teacher 
. . . in order to get something done around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk show, according to the prospectus, will be "an issues-driven, 
thought-provoking program that utilizes the high public profile and personal 
magnetism of Willie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the idea of Jon Kelly, co-owner of Sacramento's NBC affiliate, KCRA-TV. 
Kelly pointed out to Brown that by becoming a TV talk star, he could stay in 
the public arena after term limits force him from the Legislature. The Speaker 
signed a five-year contract that gives him half ownership of the show. Brown 
says he still intends to run for the state Senate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's goal is national syndication. But first, to get out the bugs, it 
will run just locally for 13 weeks -- at 9 a.m. for a half-hour each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie Brown brings almost a Rush Limbaugh kind of quality," says Val 
Nicholas, the show's creative consultant. "People either love him or hate him, 
but all like to watch him. He's not your standard dry-as-toast TV personality. 
He'll say what he thinks. You can agree or disagree, but he won't be boring." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that this old veteran of countless political wars -- who turns 60 
next month and has been an assemblyman for 29 years -- still has enough dazzle 
to be recruited as a TV talk show host is a testament to his talent and 
tenacity. Brown is not a burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 He's always been more candid than cautious. For example, he offered me these 
observations on the gubernatorial candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden -- "Hurts Kathleen (Brown). He'll cause her to move to the 
left and he'll beat her up. . . . Pete Wilson must be licking his chops." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- "You have to stand for something and you have to 
let people know what you stand for. She hasn't done it. She's me-tooing. The 
quake stuff is a recent example. She screwed up on education. She had a chance 
to walk away with (the issue)." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- "Garamendi's campaign is not a 
winning campaign. He's going to have to win by somebody else doing it for him. 
. . . Kathleen could end up losing (by running poorly)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson -- "Wilson is the favorite. He's a better campaigner. The 
Democrats have not given the public a real legitimate reason today to throw out 
the incumbent. They have not offered an inspirational level of new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, Brown says, he's aware of the speculation that he secretly hopes 
Wilson will win so he can remain the Capitol's top Democrat. But that's 
ridiculous, he insists: He'd much rather have a Democratic governor to call on 
for favors, such as appointing a friend to a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting for the first few "Willie Brown" shows begins Friday, just after the 
Speaker returns from hosting a two-day education summit in San Francisco. 
Eventually, he'll go live. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an interesting thing that happens in TV," says consultant Nicholas. 
"The camera either really likes you or it doesn't. The camera likes Willie 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 As now planned, Brown will sit at a table with two or three guests. The show 
has been modeled after such programs as "The McLaughlin Group" and "Capital 
Gang," but without the sarcasm. Politicians will be "graded" and there'll be 
"predictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the prototype, the Speaker looks directly into the camera with 
a slight grin and says: "My prediction? Willie Brown's talk show will be a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 He's already a master of short, crisp sound bites.

BOAT CAPSIZES; 200 FEARED LOST OFF THAILAND

<P>
 About 200 Myanmar workers, many of them women and children, were feared dead 
Sunday after a boat taking them home capsized off Thailand, police and rescue 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers said that by late Sunday they had recovered 38 bodies, all but 
three of them women, off the southern Thai province of Ranong. 
</P>
<P>
 All the victims appeared to be illegal workers who were returning home, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Provincial Gov. Chamnong Chalerm-rat said few details about the incident were 
available. He quoted immigration officials as saying the vessel, about 65 feet 
long and 16 feet wide, had 230 registered passengers but was believed to be 
carrying more. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least more than 100 are believed killed," he said. The accident occurred 
overnight, and officials said the boat was on its way from Ranong to Victoria 
Point in Myanmar.

70,000 SUDANESE STRANDED A WEEK WITHOUT FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 70,000 southern Sudanese fleeing an intense government bombing campaign 
against rebels have been stranded for a week without food near Uganda's border, 
a U.N. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The people, gathered about 30 miles east of the border town of Nimule, are 
medically "not very badly off, but they must be very hungry," said Sally 
Burnheim, spokeswoman for Operation Lifeline Sudan's office in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnheim said bad roads and damaged bridges had kept aid workers from reaching 
the civilians who arrived Feb. 7 from their home region, which has been 
devastated by a 10-year rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees are among an estimated 200,000 people who have fled Sudan's 
southern Equatoria province to escape recent battles between government troops 
and a faction of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations, which has appealed for $280 million to help pay for aid, 
estimates that 2 million southern Sudanese need emergency aid this year because 
of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70,000 Sudanese near the Uganda border fled from the towns of Atepi, Aswa 
and Ame after Sudan's air force began bombing civilian camps Feb. 4, relief 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 110,000 people are cut off from outside assistance around the 
town of Mundri in western Equatoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive and the bombings forced most aid agencies to withdraw foreign 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which is dominated by Muslim Arabs in northern Sudan, has 
denied launching an offensive. It blames the fighting on splits among the 
rebels in the south, where black animists and Christians predominate. The 
insurgents took up arms in 1983 to press for increased autonomy.

MALARIA VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN TRIALS IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists on Sunday reported significant promise in the century-long struggle 
to develop a vaccine against malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaria kills up to a million children annually in Africa, and there are up to 
500 million cases of the disease each year globally.Moreover, the disease is 
increasingly showing resistance to drugs traditionally used to treat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists working for a special tropical disease program jointly sponsored by 
the U.N. Development Program, the World Bank and the World Health Organization 
said a vaccine known as SPf66 has shown promising results in the first phases 
of human trials in a region of Africa with rampant malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary data, to be published Friday in the British medical journal 
Vaccine, shows that SPf66 induces a strong immune response without any harmful 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 A final phase of human tests of the vaccine will determine whether SPf66 
actually reduces the number of malaria cases. If those tests are successful, a 
vaccine could be available for widespread use by 1998.

HAITI BLAST NOT SEEN DEEPENING FUEL SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spectacular explosion that destroyed the capital's main center for 
contraband gasoline sales probably will not seriously worsen Haiti's fuel 
shortage from a U.N. embargo, diplomats said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said smuggling of fuel from the neighboring Dominican Republic has 
increased recently in defiance of the embargo imposed in an effort to force the 
army to let President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication of sabotage in the explosion late Saturday, which set 
off a fire that destroyed buildings along half a block of Rue de Cesar in 
downtown Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 No casualties were reported, but authorities said Sunday that they could not 
be sure until the wreckage was searched. About a dozen soldiers guarded the 
site while firefighters sprayed water over the smoldering ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of warehouses, stores and at least one hotel were destroyed by the 
blaze, which lit up a blacked-out stretch of the city. Tens of thousands of 
gallons of contraband gasoline and diesel fuel were stored in the warehouses in 
55-gallon drums, eight-gallon plastic containers and gallon jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's already impoverished economy has suffered from the fuel embargo 
imposed in October after military leaders reneged on an agreement to allow the 
return of Aristide. He was overthrown in a bloody coup in September, 1991, 
after less than a year in power as the country's first freely elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The army has stockpiled gasoline in underground depots around the capital, but 
the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to Haitian 
citizens. With normal importers observing the embargo, Haitians have been 
storing fuel in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The embargo is the root cause of this catastrophe," said Carl Denis, head of 
the far-right National Coalition, which wants to suspend the constitution and 
hold new presidential elections to replace Aristide.

2 AID WORKERS KIDNAPED IN SOMALIA; PEACEKEEPER SLAIN

 Gunmen kidnaped two Italian aid workers Sunday, and an Egyptian peacekeeper 
was killed and another wounded in an ambush of their military convoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Chris Budge, a U.N. spokesman, said aid workers Sergio Passatore and 
Gianfranco Stefan were kidnaped at Jowhar, about 50 miles north of 
Mogadishu.They were believed to be working for the Italian charity European 
Committee for Agricultural Training. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptians were attacked on the bypass road linking U.N. headquarters in 
Mogadishu with the airport and port, both U.N. military and supply bases. The 
road was built by U.S. Army engineers so U.N. vehicles could avoid routes 
through Mogadishu that are more vulnerable to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rome, Sen. Carmelo Azzara said the captors of the aid workers demanded 
$50,000 in ransom. Negotiations were under way to obtain their release, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The taking of the two Italians was the fifth kidnaping since January as U.S. 
troops and Western allies who took part in the U.N. peacekeeping force pull 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of incidents affecting Italian troops and relief 
workers in the former Italian colony. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack raised the casualty toll for U.N. peacekeepers to 81 dead and 329 
wounded since the United Nations took over the humanitarian mission from an 
American-led military coalition last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a clan spokesman in southern Somalia said weekend battles between 
rival clans had killed 60 people and forced more than 5,000 to flee the 
southern port of Kismayu.

 You called me out to feel

 Ua nani o (The beautiful rains of) Kahana.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kahana's Song," by (copyright) Gerald Santos, 1978 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the windward side of Oahu, far from the concrete that covers so much of 
Honolulu, lies a valley whose natural beauty and serenity hark back to the 
Hawaii of long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 families who live in Kahana Valley will soon begin an unusual 
experiment. In return for the right to remain on state land, they have agreed 
to turn their corner of paradise into a "living cultural park," showcasing 
native Hawaiian traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is supposed to help revive ancient crafts and, with them, basic 
values of old Hawaii, such as hard work, respect for nature and sharing. At a 
time when many residents and tourists are seeking an authentic taste of 
Hawaiian culture, Kahana Valley State Park could offer an alternative to the 
glitz of Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot find any other example like it anywhere in the world," said Alfred 
L. Rogers, park manager. "There was no model to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 In other cultural parks, such as the Colony of Williamsburg, Va., and Old 
Sturbridge Village, Mass., the craftspeople and guides who re-create a bygone 
era are paid professionals. They don period dress for their jobs and at the end 
of the day return to their own homes away from the historic exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiians living in Kahana Valley don't have that option. Their homes are 
in the park; their work is a condition of their lease. To remain in the valley, 
each household must spend 25 hours a month on cultural activities. Residents 
may raise taro, the Hawaiian staple; weave mats; teach hula; play ukulele, or 
engage in any of 100 practices identified by the state as distinctly Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahana's concept is looser and more low-key than the historic museum towns. 
Residents will live their normal lifestyle, reporting to their jobs outside the 
valley and relying on modern conveniences at home. While working in the park, 
they may wear what they wish and use updated tools if necessary. Fishermen who 
throw nets, for example, use monofilament line instead of the natural fibers 
favored by their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahana is one of the few remaining valleys on this island that hasn't been 
subdivided. In ancient times, its residents worked together, drawing all the 
necessities of life from the land and the ocean. Today, its tiny population 
includes blue-collar workers and a state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the park date back to the late 1960s, when the state bought the lush 
5,000-acre valley and threatened to evict residents to make way for a theme 
park. Outcry from the public halted those plans. Instead, residents offered to 
create a living cultural park if they were allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing years of bureaucratic hassles, many of the kupuna , or elders, 
who came up with the idea have died. Some of their children are less enamored 
of the notion, and a few have openly resisted it. But in December, the state 
finally recorded 65-year leases with all residents, many of whom trace their 
roots back generations in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Dela Cerna, 79, says she welcomes the chance to help revive her 
heritage. "I'm glad the state bought the valley," she said. "I don't want it 
destroyed. If some millionaire had it, who knows what would happen? 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the culture is really important -- weaving, quilt making, planting 
sweet potatoes, wrapping fish to cook," she said. "These things are dying 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents say they resent the state's interference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like being mandated to do it as a condition of being here," said 
Ron Johnson, a firefighter whose grandmother was a hula master. "I'd do it out 
of aloha (love), not because we had to." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next several months, work requirements have been waived for most 
residents while they bring their ramshackle homes up to state code. Many are 
relocating and building anew, with state help. The park schedules a few 
activities from time to time for visiting school groups, but no one can say 
when it will be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, visitors stop by the wooden orientation building at the base of the 
valley to pick up maps of hiking trails. They can make their own way to the 
remains of a Hawaiian temple and trace the outlines of an ancient fishpond in 
Kahana's broad, placid bay. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are lucky, they may come across Boy Govida knee-deep in his taro 
patch, or pounding boiled taro by hand to make poi, the traditional staple. He 
has made some concessions to modernity. "I put the taro in the Osterizer before 
I pound it," he said with a grin.

ISRAELI SECRET POLICE OFFICER SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arab gunmen killed an Israeli secret police officer and wounded two others in 
an ambush in the West Bank on Sunday, the Israeli army said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A General Security Services (commonly known as Shin Bet secret police) man, 
Noam Cohen, was killed this afternoon, and two other workers of the service 
were wounded," an army spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During a GSS operation this afternoon in the center of Ramallah, there was 
shooting from an ambush at the GSS personnel who were in a vehicle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A caller to an international news agency said Qassem, the military wing of the 
Muslim fundamentalist group Hamas, claimed responsibility for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We send this military operation as congratulations to the Palestinian people 
on (the Muslim holy month of) Ramadan," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources had earlier said the incident occurred at the Beitounia 
junction in the Ramallah area. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the shooting, a man with his face drenched in blood was seen by 
reporters just outside Beitounia being evacuated by ambulance. Beitounia itself 
was crowded with troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said it believed that at least three guerrillas armed with automatic 
weapons took part in the close-up attack on the Shin Bet men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis returned fire, but the gunmen escaped. The army immediately 
slapped a curfew on the area and conducted wide searches. Israeli military 
censors prevented full publication of the details for more than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a Shin Bet man was killed was in January, 1993, when assailants 
bludgeoned and stabbed to death an agent while he was waiting for an informant 
in a Jerusalem apartment.

ROBBERS KILL 3 IN MISSOURI CONVENIENCE STORE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three convenience store employees were shot to death during a robbery, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Fred Jones, 58, was found in a walk-in cooler at Casey's General 
Store around 1 a.m. The bodies of Mary Bratcher, 46, and Mabel A. Scruggs, 57, 
were found in a restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 All three had been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know how much money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratcher, the store's manager, had apparently gone to the store Saturday night 
to help close up. Neither Jones, a new employee, nor Scruggs was familiar with 
the closing routine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no security cameras in the store, and the alarm system had not been 
activated, Deputy Police Chief Carroll Highbarger said.

EX-HOMELESS MAN NOW RUNNING SHELTER; COUP: KEITH MITCHELL ONCE STAYED AT 
CAPITAL'S LARGEST CENTER FOR THE DISPOSSESSED. HIS JOB THERE IS BEING WATCHED 
CLOSELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He came to the District of Columbia's largest homeless shelter a few years ago 
dirty, desperate and broke, a hapless former drug dealer who had been sleeping 
for months on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Keith Mitchell is running the place. 
</P>
<P>
 In a coup that has at once amazed and concerned advocates of their cause, 
Mitchell and a small band of allies have just begun presiding over what is one 
of the most famed havens for the homeless in the United States: the 1,400-bed 
shelter opened in a downtown building a decade ago by Mitch Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been celebrated in a television movie, been bankrolled by celebrities 
and for years has led the fight against homelessness by staging elaborate 
protests and hunger strikes. But few moments in the shelter's history are as 
intriguing as its latest. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, it is being led by a bum it helped redeem. 
</P>
<P>
 That extraordinary change occurred only a few weeks ago, when the Community 
for Creative Non-Violence, which has managed the shelter since it opened, voted 
Carol Fennelly out of office. Fennelly, a longtime companion of Snyder's and 
one of the country's most prominent advocates for the homeless, had been 
running the shelter since his suicide in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 She has since packed up and left. So have a few veteran staff members. All 
eyes now are on Mitchell, a 38-year-old former computer programmer whose stable 
life in Washington's black middle class crumbled four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The District government and some advocates for the homeless -- who each badly 
need the shelter to succeed -- are watching the changing of the guard warily. 
There are doubts about how well Mitchell can manage such a large facility and 
questions about whether he will fundamentally alter how it is run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is a protege of Snyder's and Fennelly's. Because he had an easy 
rapport with others at the shelter and showed an avid interest in wanting to 
help, they began assigning him tasks soon after he arrived. He has spoken 
across the country at fund-raisers for the homeless. And a few years ago, he 
even became an elected advisory neighborhood commissioner, representing a small 
downtown area from Union Station to the shelter on Second and D streets NW.

 A woman accused of trying to kill an abortion doctor has provided details 
linking herself to abortion clinic arsons around the country over the past 
three years, the Wichita Eagle reported.In a series of letters and interviews 
with the newspaper, Shelley Shannon provided details that suggest she was 
involved in several arsons or knows who was. Shannon, 37, of Grants Pass, Ore., 
was charged with attempted first-degree murder in the Aug. 19 shooting of 
George Tiller outside his Wichita clinic. Tiller was slightly wounded.

 A Maryland inmate awaiting a gas chamber execution has agreed to have his 
death videotaped so that a fellow inmate can argue that the method constitutes 
cruel and unusual punishment, the National Law Journal reported. The weekly

Baltimore has approved the videotaping of the execution of convicted murderer 
John Thanos, who is scheduled to die this spring in Maryland's first execution 
since 1961.

POWER CREWS IN SOUTHEAST STRIVE TO RESTORE SERVICE

 More than a quarter of a million Tennesseans and thousands elsewhere in the 
Southeast still had no electricity Sunday as crews labored to replace power 
lines brought down by thick layers of freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Whaley of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency estimated that 
128,000 households, or more than 250,000 people, were still waiting for workers 
to clear broken tree limbs and reconnect power lines.Power had been restored to 
about 535,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynchburg, Va., remained under an overnight curfew Sunday for the third 
straight night. The city had no street lights, and businesses had no alarm 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia utilities reported an estimated 156,000 customers still without 
lights Sunday, and about 6,000 customers awaited reconnection in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, parts of the Northeast, still digging out from last week's heavy 
snowfall, got a thin coating of ice Sunday. But for the first time in weeks, 
the region had no heavy snow forecast for the foreseeable future.

MOST STATES SEEN GETTING MORE UNDER HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORGAN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There would be sharp differences in the amount of new federal money going to 
individual states under President Clinton's health care plan, and states that 
are now the most restrictive in granting medical assistance to the poor 
generally would be the biggest winners, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most states would end up with more federal health care money than 
they get now, and pay less out of their own coffers for the medical bills of 
low-income people, the Urban Institute concluded in an analysis commissioned by 
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding appears to be in conflict with New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's 
statement last month that the Clinton proposal would cause "definite, 
measurable and almost immediate" losses -- before the state began to benefit, 
in the third year after implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Urban Institute study of 27 states, conducted by John Holahan 
and David Liska, if the Clinton plan took effect now, New York would be able to 
reduce its spending on the Medicaid program for the poor by $79 per resident 
and would capture $92 a person in additional federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies would be mixed with state contributions and the mandatory 
payments that all employers would have to make for their workers, and the 
aggregate would be used to help the poor and near-poor buy insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each state's share would be figured under a complex formula that attempts to 
lock in the amount that it was paying toward the jointly financed federal-state 
Medicaid program in 1993 and adjusts this amount annually for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 While concluding that all but Louisiana and New Hampshire of the 27 states 
studied would benefit from more federal subsidies in the Clinton health reform, 
the Urban Institute study provides evidence that the plan does treat states 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New York would get more federal payments as a result of the subsidies 
flowing in to buy health coverage for the low-income population, the state 
would not gain nearly as much as those with far less generous Medicaid 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama, New Mexico and West Virginia would gain $212, $246 and $232, 
respectively, in federal payments per resident -- more than twice as much as 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the difference is the requirement that states continue to pay a 
direct subsidy for those enrolled in welfare, but not for other poor and 
near-poor. The federal government -- along with employers for working poor -- 
would pay the subsidy costs for the non-welfare population. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, states with narrow eligibility for welfare assistance and low 
percentages of people on the welfare rolls would have high percentages of poor 
and near-poor people eligible for direct federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, The formula that establishes state contributions to the pool 
of funds for the poor and uninsured generally requires states with the biggest 
and most generous Medicaid programs as of 1993 to make the biggest payments to 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparities can be seen in comparisons between New York and California, 
the two largest providers of health care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 California spends $233 per person on its Medicaid (MediCal) program compared 
to $615 in New York, highest in the country after the District of Columbia and 
Louisiana. Federal subsidies to California under health care reform would 
increase by $117 per resident, compared to New York's $92.

TEEN STABBED TO DEATH AT BACHELOR PARTY; VIOLENCE: A MAN AND WOMAN ARE ARRESTED 
AFTER AN ARGUMENT OVER A STRIPPER'S TIP TURNS DEADLY. 
</P>

<P>
 A Laguna Hills man and a Covina woman were arrested Sunday after an argument 
over a stripper's tip ended in the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old at a 
bachelor party, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Stinson and his girlfriend, Jennifer Biedrycki, both 20, were arrested 
at her relatives' home hours after the stabbing at a house in West Covina, and 
were booked on suspicion of murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who lived in West Covina, died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. 
Police were withholding release of his name until his family had been notified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was adult entertainment at this bachelor party and someone put down a 
tip," said West Covina police Lt. Darrell Myrick. "Someone either took the tip, 
touched it, or inadvertently moved it. The two (Stinson and the teen-ager) 
started fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 The two were separated, but as the party was breaking up Sunday morning just 
after midnight, Stinson and the 17-year-old began fighting again, and the 
teen-ager was stabbed at least seven times in the arms, chest and shoulder, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrick said he did not know the identities of the intended bride and groom. 
Friends of the bride had planned to go to a bar that evening, he said, but when 
some of them were turned away because they were underage, they went to the 
bachelor party and were there when the stabbing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina police questioned about 40 guests before making the arrests, 
Myrick said. Biedrycki was somehow involved in the argument that led to the 
stabbing, he said.

 The couple were arrested about 9 a.m. Sunday. Stinson "knew the police were 
waiting for him when he went" to Biedrycki's relatives' home, Myrick said. "He 
gave himself up without incident." Both were in custody at the West Covina 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 30 minutes after the stabbing, a 15-year-old youth was killed when a 
West Covina gang member fired three shots into a rival gang member's car, 
Myrick said.

 "All of last year we had just four murders and here, within a half-hour, we 
have two people dead," he said. "It was a bad night."

POLICE FIND WAYS, WORDS TO AID MUGGED TOURIST; CRIME: A NIGHTMARE THAT BEGAN 
WHEN A FRENCHMAN GOT LOST IN WILLOWBROOK HAS A HAPPY ENDING. HE SAYS HE WOULD 
BE WILLING TO VISIT LOS ANGELES AGAIN.

 Willowbrook at 11 p.m. is not a common tourist destination. But that's where 
Michel Poipou found himself meandering when he got off a bus that he belatedly 
figured out was not headed toward Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he knew it, the French tourist was in a chokehold, bashed in the face 
and relieved of his money, his traveling bag and his plane ticket by two thugs, 
police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who arrived at Figueroa Avenue and 152nd Street on Saturday night 
found that the disoriented traveler spoke no English. 
</P>
<P>
 They called on Officer John Zambri, who had studied French in hopes of taking 
a European vacation, to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Zambri and his partner, Officer Auston Price, spent the next 12 hours ferrying 
the penniless Poipou, 39, to the airport and fighting the airline bureaucracy 
to make sure he got a ticket, explaining to the Northwest Airlines staff the 
gory details of why Poipou couldn't pay the $50 lost-ticket fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Steve Gardner of Silver Lake -- a teacher of French -- heard of 
Poipou's problems on the radio Sunday. Determined that Poipou not leave without 
some more pleasant Los Angeles experiences, Gardner called the police and 
offered to put Poipou up and show him around. But the Frenchman said that 
although he appreciated the offer, he'd take a rain check and catch his flight 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 So Zambri and Price walked Poipou to his Northwest flight at Terminal 2 -- his 
passport safely in his sock, as it had been throughout the ordeal -- and said 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty happy," said Price. "We made sure he was comfortable and told him 
he could rest assured he'd be welcomed back and taken care of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Zambri said the success of their night's work showed in Poipou's parting 
words: "He said he had no reservations about coming back."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: HOW TV NEWS SPIRALED INTO 'TABLOIDGATE'; TELEVISION: 
'FRONTLINE' EXAMINES THE STATE OF JOURNALISM WHEN RESPECTABLE MEDIA GET INTO 
BED WITH TAINTED TABLOIDS WHILE COVERING THE LIKES OF MICHAEL JACKSON AND TONYA 
HARDING.

<P>
 The media scandal of the 1990s is Tabloidgate , a crossing of genes resulting 
in a homely journalistic hybrid whose shared interests range from Michael 
Jackson to Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 This alliance of Tainted Tabloids and Respectable Press in the cause of banner 
headlines has produced an alien, grotesquely formed multi-being that includes 
television newsmagazines, a fast-propagating subspecies of which there are now 
so many varieties you can hardly keep count. 
</P>
<P>
 You see some of them feasting on the world's richest troubled entertainer in 
"Tabloid Truth: The Michael Jackson Scandal," Tuesday's "Frontline" documentary 
on PBS (9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15).  
</P>
<P>
 "Tabloid Truth" is producer Thomas Lennon's and reporter Richard Ben Cramer's 
sardonic tell-all account of the media who now tell all. The program traces, 
step by step, the story that still threatens to hijack Jackson's career and 
notes the strategies of such rival predators as "Hard Copy" and "A Current 
Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's a whiz-bang hour that you watch with fascination, there's 
nothing pretty about lions tearing apart a wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
 What begins with a free-lance reporter giving information about Jackson to 
KNBC-TV Channel 4 immediately becomes the global pursuit of the decade, one 
luring the hordes of Fleet Street and all the other global blood sniffers. 
Awaiting them here are U.S. print and TV tabloids and the Legitimate Press, and 
soon this pride of competing big cats and their scavenging tag-a-longs are 
hunting en masse, one undistinguishable from the other. 
</P>
<P>
 On the screen are photogs in L.A. aiming their telescopic lenses like 
Son-of-Sam snipers and just-arrived hungry British tabloiders, hearts pounding 
and young eyes shining with excitement, as if this were their Normandy Landing. 
On comes the rest of the cast, the warring lawyers and private eyes, the paid, 
greedy informants from Jackson's own camp, the coattails hanging on to other 
coattails -- and, of course, the Dragon Lady herself, LaToya. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the tabloids, it doesn't matter if it's true," someone volunteers. "If 
you've got someone to say it's true, that's what matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the stalkers some time ago began following the scent of other prey. 
Last Thursday night, for example, saw Dueling Tonyas on the syndicated "Inside 
Edition" and the CBS News program "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung," each wielding 
its very own "exclusive" interview of the Lillehammer-bound skater. Under 
normal circumstances, you'd have given trash-savvy "Inside Edition" the edge, 
except that Chung had prepped herself by spending the week grubbing it out rink 
side with the other paparazzi in Portland. No stranger to hardball, it was "Eye 
to Eye" herself, after all, who earlier had gotten Heidi Fleiss to tell America 
about her new line of jammies. 
</P>
<P>
 As her network's Tonyalogist, Chung occupied the expert's chair on "CBS This 
Morning" Friday. "What was the pressure like on this human being?" asked a rapt 
Harry Smith. Who knows, maybe next time Harding will come in and get quizzed 
about Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, KCAL-TV Channel 9's award-winning news used a big chunk of 
Harding's "Inside Edition" interview on Wednesday while also reporting rumors 
-- disclosed on the syndicated "Hard Copy" -- that she had signed to pose for 
Playboy. It was not the first time that material from the two tabloid programs 
had been featured on a Channel 9 newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 The hybridization is much broader, though. So much so that when it comes to 
some topics, the Dueling Dianes -- Dimond of "Hard Copy" and Sawyer of ABC's 
"PrimeTime Live" -- seem almost interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A magazine writer preparing an in-depth story on Michael Jackson spoke 
glowingly to me of "Hard Copy" the other day, raving about its grit in pursuing 
those allegations that Jackson sexually molested a 14-year-old boy. While 
notably unimpressed by The Times coverage of Jackson, the writer was genuinely 
moved by the way "Hard Copy" operatives had strode, camera rolling, right up to 
the front door of a woman who supposedly had vital information about Jackson 
that she didn't want to divulge. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? "She slammed the door right in their faces." 
</P>
<P>
 This was news? "At least they tried," the writer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's it, they tried . Thus the failed effort to get a story 
becomes a story, implying that there is something suspicious about a person who 
wishes not to speak to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The "tabloids are getting more like us" line was echoed by a CBS News producer 
I spoke to recently. Actually, they've hardly budged. It's the Respectable 
Press that's done the joining, the forest coming to Dunsinane. 
</P>
<P>
 That Great White among sharks, Steve Dunleavy of "A Current Affair," gloats on 
Tuesday's "Frontline": "They don't laugh and sneer at our style now." Adds "A 
Current Affair" anchor Maureen O'Boyle: "We're now competing with the same 
people who at one time were going, 'Naughty, naughty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Along with that trend, connoisseurs of "naughty" have surely noted the upswing 
of TV commercials for tabloid newspapers and appreciated the symbolism of 
National Enquirer now running spots during Channel 4 newscasts -- another 
instance of an advertiser buying time on compatible programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lest anyone think that handing his accuser a load of cash would 
spare Michael Jackson further embarrassing media exposure, "A Current Affair" 
delivered a wake-up call Thursday night by having performers re-enact the 
depositions of the 14-year-old ("He then started kissing me") and others in 
"the notorious sex scandal" that we've all grown to love and cherish. Not that 
"A Current Affair" was being insensitive, having altered some of the graphic 
language to "make it suitable for television viewing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cynical age of Tabloidgate , what isn't suitable for viewing?

SALES COLD EVEN AS 'ACE' STAYS WARM; BOX OFFICE: DESPITE HOPES THAT THE OSCAR 
NOMINATIONS WOULD FUEL TICKET SALES, THE EAST COAST'S ARCTIC BLAST SLOWS 
WEEKEND MOVIEGOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whatever hopes Hollywood had that last week's Oscar nominations would make the 
box office sizzle were chilled over the weekend by an arctic storm system that 
paralyzed the Eastern states, causing movie attendance to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month after Southern California's earthquake shut down one of the 
country's major moviegoing markets for several days, the Eastern blizzards cost 
the nation's box office 15% to 25% over the weekend, according to preliminary 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even as the snow was turning to freezing drizzle on the East Coast, 
officials at major Hollywood studios said the box office wasn't as bad as might 
have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Bros. comedy "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" pulled in an estimated 
$9.5 million, topping the list for the second week, while the Alec Baldwin-Kim 
Basinger action drama "The Getaway" from Universal -- a remake of the Sam 
Peckinpah original -- grossed an estimated $6 million to take second place 
during its debut weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blank Check," a Disney film about a boy who lives it up on $1 million after a 
crook gives him an unsigned check, debuted at $5.4 million for third place, 
while "My Girl 2" from Columbia Pictures saw $5.1 million in ticket sales 
during its first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three new openings were really hurt by the weather," said Jeff Blake, 
Columbia's president of domestic distribution. "Many theaters were closed 
Friday in New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Boston. It was really 
horrible. While there was some recovery Saturday, it was not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the top 10 were "Schindler's List" (Universal) with $5 million; 
"Philadelphia" (TriStar), $4.4 million; "Mrs. Doubtfire (Fox), $4.2 million; 
"My Father the Hero" (Touchstone), $4.2 million; "Grumpy Old Men" (Warner 
Bros.), $2.8 million; and "In the Name of the Father" (Universal), $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials said any boost the Academy Award nominations might give 
attendance will likely have to wait until next weekend, the three-day 
Presidents' Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List," the Holocaust drama that reaped 12 Oscar nominations -- 
including best picture and best actor (Liam Neeson) -- saw only a 7% gain at 
the box office over the weekend even though Universal increased the number of 
screens it was on from 350 to 784 the weekend before Wednesday's announcement 
of the nominations. Universal also had increased the number of screens for the 
Oscar-nominated movie "In the Name of the Father" from 176 to 495. It had taken 
in $1 million a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Piano," the Miramax film that received eight Oscar nominations -- 
including best picture and best actress (Holly Hunter) -- took in $1.3 million 
on 610 screens as compared to $787,000 a week earlier on 401 screens, while 
Columbia's "The Remains of the Day," which was nominated for best picture as 
well as best actor (Anthony Hopkins) and best actress (Emma Thomson) grossed 
$500,000 on 250 screens, up from $229,000 the prior week on 174 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros., meanwhile, gambled that an Oscar nomination could breathe 
renewed box-office life into its already successful thriller "The Fugitive." 
But the Harrison Ford film, which went out of wide release late last year, 
pulled in only an estimated $800,000 despite being on 1,010 screens.MOTION

 "Teachers' Lounge" has set a new Laguna Playhouse attendance record for a 
non-musical production. Playhouse executive director Richard Stein says John 
Twomey's original comedy was seen by roughly 11,000 playgoers, or 96% capacity 
for the entire run (Jan. 11-Feb. 6). The previous record-holder was 
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

STRINGING TOGETHER JAZZ AND NEW BEATS; MUSIC: GUITARIST RONNY JORDAN, WHO PLAYS 
THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT, BLENDS THE TRADITIONAL WITH FUNK, HIP-HOP. 'NOW'S THE 
TIME FOR NEW IDEAS AND A NEW DIRECTION,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronny Jordan grew up in London listening to such mainstream jazz guitarists as 
Wes Montgomery, Grant Green and George Benson, saxophonist John Coltrane and 
trumpeter Miles Davis. But simply retracing the giant steps of his predecessors 
isn't enough for this guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's little point in doing what they did. It's pretty much been covered," 
said Jordan, 31, who has been playing guitar since he was 4 and jazz since he 
was 12. "I respect the great jazz people of yesteryear, but I do feel now's the 
time for new ideas and a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, whose septet plays tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 
and Tuesday at Ole Madrid in San Diego, has long been enamored of blending jazz 
vehicles and improvisation with today's rhythms, particularly funk and hip-hop 
beats. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's been quite successful at it. His 1992 debut album, "The Antidote," 
has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide. His latest, last year's "The Quiet 
Revolution," has sold about 300,000 copies so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems clear that if you're going to fuse jazz with a contemporary style, 
it would be hip-hop," Jordan said Friday by phone from a hotel in Hollywood, 
one stop on his 22-city U.S. tour. "I've thought this since 1980, when I heard 
the first rap and hip-hop records by the Sugar Hill Gang and Afrika Bambaataa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz and hip-hop can go together, because hip-hop is just a beat," said 
Jordan. "But I feel this blend has to be done by a jazz musician, because no 
matter what style of music you play, if you solo, it ends up pretty much jazz. 
I also figured it had to be done by somebody young, who's not stuck in the old 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of musicians talk up this kind of won't-play-mainstream game -- in some 
cases, only because they've failed to master the arduous ins-and-outs of 
be-bop-based jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Jordan. On recordings and in person, the guitarist makes it clear he can 
play the fluid, snappy lines we've come to expect from journeyman improvisers. 
So his decision to enter new territory can be seen as sincere, as well as 
pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played strictly straight-ahead music for about a year, from 1988 to 1989, 
in small underground clubs in London," he said. "It just wasn't enough for me, 
musically. I think that jazz should be dance music, for both the head, and the 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The other factor in Jordan's opting for a blend of music that would appeal to 
his contemporaries is the old bottom line: making money. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan admitted that his days of straight-ahead playing didn't earn him a lot, 
so he looked for a way of breaking through to a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 That break came via "So What," the anthem of modal jazz by Davis that he 
recorded on his classic 1959 album, "Kind of Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing that tune on a jam session and at the end I dropped in some 
funk licks, and, I thought, 'Hey, this could work,' " he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He whipped up a demo with a hip-hop rhythm and sold it to Island Records owner 
Chris Blackwell in July, 1991. By Christmas, his first single, a rap called 
"Get to Grips," had landed on the British pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, "The Antidote," was released four months later with an extended 
version of "So What." Jordan felt the tune carried a stern message to jazz 
purists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any mix of jazz and contemporary rhythms is going to be controversial," he 
said. "The purists had slayed people like Wes Montgomery, George Benson, Donald 
Byrd when they went in a commercial direction. I knew what I was doing was 
commercial, but it was like saying to the purists, 'So what?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "I've got to be a realist. You sign with a major label, the 
objective is to sell units. That's it. If you don't, you get dropped. And if 
you do, you have to go out and promote yourself, try to sell yourself, and try 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jordan feels his direction allows him to reach young people with a 
variety of elements. His rap tunes are his way, he said, "of making a social 
statement, of getting kids to reflect on where their lives are going." And his 
jazz-based numbers are designed both to please, and to educate, audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want younger people to respect jazz a lot more," he said. "I want them to 
become aware of the people who have influenced me. And I also want to present 
jazz without its serious image. It's the music of the street, and it's become 
too elitist." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, who acknowledges that music is a never-ending learning process, hopes 
he can develop into a singular stylist. In the meantime, he's irked at people 
who compare him to his idols. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's terribly unfair," he said. "I regard myself as a disciple of Wes and 
George. Being compared puts unnecessary pressure on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't ever be as good as George Benson, but I can be a good Ronny Jordan, 
and that's what matters." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ronny Jordan's septet, with rapper Radical MC, appears tonight at 8 at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $10. (714) 496-8930.

COUNTERPUNCH: THESE WOMEN WERE DREAMERS AND DOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAIL CHOICE, Gail Choice is an independent film and television producer, 
writer and director.

<P>
 If perseverance, determination, broken dreams and heady triumphs help describe 
the entertainment industry, then the Hollywood La Brea Gateway is a lasting 
tribute to the spirit and world-renowned allure that make up the Hollywood 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is truly subject to interpretation. When Times Art Critic Christopher 
Knight reviewed the Gateway, he lambasted it for its presentation of women, 
referring to it as multicultural sexism and much more. Yet when I looked at the 
work I said, "Hallelujah! It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I'd ever see women of color 
immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion. The Art Deco style, 
neon, glitzy, gutsy approach to the gateway design makes me think of the 
Hollywood embedded in my soul; a place of magic, wonder and imagination. But 
the mere presence of these brave, gifted women reflects the reality of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptural figures supporting the dome -- Dorothy Dandridge, Anna May 
Wong, Mae West and Dolores Del Rio -- are more than mere sex symbols or glamour 
girls. Their individual histories mark them as daring, courageous and 
determined. These enormously talented women took on a town that created false 
images in the midst of hate, racism and prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, in blasting the use of these women, offered instead Hattie McDaniel 
and Margaret Dumont, believing them to be more representative of women in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true McDaniel is an Oscar-winning legend; however, she epitomized the 
Hollywood stereotype of black women of that era. Her screen image was most 
comforting to white America and did not challenge the film industry's campaign 
of viewing the black woman as less than desirable. Dandridge's image not only 
added balance but demonstrated to Hollywood that indeed America and the world 
could celebrate a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and Del Rio faced the same challenges and prejudice on behalf of their 
cultures. West battled the age and control factor. Their beauty and 
intelligence were held against them, making it difficult to find meaningful 
work that wasn't reduced to racial stereotypes or cultural myths. 
</P>
<P>
 All four women took charge of their dreams and made film history against 
tremendous odds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dandridge, for instance, gained national and international stardom for her 
Oscar-nominated performance in "Carmen Jones" at a time when America was 
desperately clinging to Jim Crow laws and an apartheid system that also reached 
into the Latin and Asian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were dreamers and doers. And for one fleeting moment they forced 
Hollywood to deal with them on their own terms. They opened doors, challenged 
old beliefs and fought the good fight for balanced screen images. These women 
carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders with only a hint of 
fragility. In essence, they had the strength of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hats off to creator Catherine Hardwicke for her vision and courage to create a 
work of art that breaks new ground in mainstream Hollywood. She gave us a 
double treat, the magic and history of Hollywood in the form of pioneering 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 For everyone who has ever dreamed of Hollywood fame, for those down to their 
last dime but holding on. . . . For writers, producers, directors wishing to 
express their visions, and for those of us who are simply not connected or 
"just not right" for this or that, let these women be your shining beacons of 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't you, like the Hollywood of their era, hold their beauty against 
them. They are Hollywood's women of steel.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHAT MAKES A FILM 'FOREIGN'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY ONG, Henry Ong is an L.A. playwright. His play Madame Mao's Memories 
will be at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in May-June.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, "The Piano," a film from New Zealand, has been nominated for an 
Oscar as best picture while "Farewell My Concubine," a film from Hong Kong and 
co-winner with "The Piano" at the Cannes Film Festival, is relegated to a 
nomination from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences as best 
foreign language film. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the distinction is ostensibly based on language, there is something 
very insidious about categorizing movies in this manner. Generally, as long as 
a film contains English dialogue, the film is no longer considered "foreign" 
and it can rank right up there with Hollywood's best work. Doesn't this suggest 
that "The Piano" is not a foreign film but "Concubine" is? 
</P>
<P>
 But wait! In an added irony, the Academy chose to nominate "The Wedding 
Banquet" for best foreign language film. Didn't this film use mostly English 
dialogue? Never mind that "Banquet's" main characters are American (OK, so the 
protagonist is a naturalized American and the female lead an "illegal" 
immigrant). The story takes place in New York, and the protagonist's lover is a 
white American male. (I guess it could be argued that "Banquet" was made with 
Taiwanese money. But wasn't "The Piano" financed with French francs?) 
</P>
<P>
 I must conclude that in Hollywood anything Anglo is considered non-"foreign" 
while anything non-Anglo is "foreign." 
</P>
<P>
 I am disappointed -- though not surprised -- that the Academy did not see fit 
to nominate Gong Li (from "Concubine") for best supporting actress. The New 
York Film Critics were alone among various film awards groups in picking her as 
best supporting actress. No Asian actor in a "foreign language" picture has 
ever been nominated for an acting award by the Academy. European (read Anglo ) 
actors have fared better (Sophia Loren won an Oscar; Marcello Mastrioanni, 
Isabelle Adjani, Catherine Deneuve, Gerard Depardieu have been nominated). Will 
Hollywood one day extend its vision to include non-Anglo actors? 
</P>
<P>
 I know I run the risk of being criticized for political correctness. All I 
know is any segregation on racial lines is divisive and artificial. "Foreign" 
is such an ugly word anyway. The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., which also 
nominated "The Wedding Banquet" in its best foreign language film category, 
would be wise to change its name to the Hollywood International Press -- 
wouldn't that make it HIP? And all our award givers should include meritorious 
works without artificially segregating films on the basis of what is and what 
isn't foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we must make the distinction, take a hint from the Independent Spirit 
Awards. This group did not use language as its criterion and instead nominated 
"The Wedding Banquet" for best feature, and named "The Piano" (New Zealand), 
"Orlando" (Britain) and "Naked" (Britain) as foreign film nominees.

COUNTERPUNCH: CRITIC MISSED THE HUMOR AND SYMBOLISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE HARDWICKE, Catherine Hardwicke was trained as an architect at the 
University of Texas in Austin. She designed and built townhouses, subdivisions, 
office buildings and low-income housing projects before entering graduate 
school in film at UCLA. She won two major student film awards and became a 
production designer on films including Tombstone, Posse and Passed Away.

 I've survived the riots, the fires, the earthquake, a mugging at gunpoint, and 
now the aftershock of Christopher Knight! In his review, "Caution: Bad Art Up 
Ahead" (Calendar, Jan. 19), he voiced a few less-than-sympathetic feelings 
toward the Hollywood La Brea Gateway. I was not surprised -- from the earliest 
Times press coverage of the Community Redevelopment Agency project, I suffered 
untold press-crucifixion paranoid fantasies. Knight delivered beyond my wildest 
expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 My first objection to his review is that he critiques the gateway as if it 
were a piece of gallery art -- where the artist has freedom of expression. This 
shows a complete misunderstanding of the process I encountered for creating 
"public art" in this city. Despite the admirable intentions of the CRA, I ended 
up designing to meet archaic city codes, mysterious tastes of influential 
council members, unorthodox contract supervision-administration and budgeting 
systems and delays, and the agendas of countless non-elected city officials and 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the specific design restrictions were baffling: 
</P>
<P>
 * Structure could not be colored red, yellow or green (it would be mistaken 
for traffic signal). 
</P>
<P>
 * Structure could not sit on a raised platform or incorporate any steps, even 
if a ramp was provided (people could trip on steps). 
</P>
<P>
 * No benches, however small or uncomfortable, could be included (people might 
loiter). 
</P>
<P>
 * No "abstract" or "futuristic" art would be approved ("that doesn't play in 
Peoria"). 
</P>
<P>
 These and other countless roadblocks to the project were only revealed 
gradually in the extended two-year process of dealing with an enormous, 
sprawling organism -- our city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 However painfully the process influenced the structure, Knight clearly missed 
the humor and the reasons behind the final design. Vogue magazine's December 
issue describes the gateway as "a pop homage to Hollywood's Golden Age" and 
"simultaneously heartwarming and high camp." The design embraces and pokes fun 
at the glamour, the polished metallic male form of the Oscar, and the pastiche 
of styles and dreams that pervades Tinseltown. The women were chosen because 
they broke the mold -- pioneering roles for women of different cultures. Each 
woman made unique and largely unheralded contributions to our film heritage as 
actors and, in the case of Mae West, as the writer of her own material and 
creator of her own outrageous, original image. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's accusation of sexism for my use of "curvaceous silver screen 
beauties" in a "sculptural ode to a restrictive tradition of straight, female 
sexual power" was troubling. Knight explicitly condemns Hollywood for its 
heterosexual bias and lambastes my design for keeping this "pitiful drumbeat 
going." Clearly, he would denounce any work that did not express his narrow 
perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight further writes: "It is not Hattie McDaniel or Margaret DuMont who is 
doing caryatid duty." I did choose to depict four women who could be described 
as "curvaceous." While many people find the curves of the female form to be 
aesthetically pleasing, Knight is apparently keen on the robust, matronly sort 
of feminine ideal as typified by McDaniel and DuMont (fine actresses both). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it is alarming that to him, the sight of a woman like Dorothy Dandridge 
(the first African American to be nominated for best actress) is a "depressing 
. . . demeaning . . . anachronistic" experience. For our art critic, a stroll 
through the great cityscapes of Paris and Rome must be a harrowing ordeal, what 
with the countless images of curvaceous women -- some even nude! 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit to the gateway, I encountered two women on a blanket eating 
lunch under the dome, a Mexican film crew speaking with pride about how 
"Delores Del Rio is right here on Hollywood Boulevard," three Asian tourists 
posing for photographs with Anna Mae Wong, and a couple circling the piece, 
discussing each actor. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the purpose of the structure. People are interacting with it -- proud 
to discover that Hollywood was created by people of many cultures and that 
women, as well as men, can make valuable contributions.

PROTEST OVER DELAY IN AIRING CONDOM ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry youth leaders, counselors and educators gathered at the Los Angeles Free 
Clinic to rail against the CBS, NBC and Fox television networks for not airing 
a new series of government-sponsored commercials promoting the use of latex 
condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health officials unveiled the controversial campaign Jan. 4, and all 
four broadcast networks agreed to air the blunt public-service announcements, 
which were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, so 
far, only ABC has done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. youth demand that the networks show and air these PSAs (public-service 
announcements), which are really important to save lives," said Marcus 
Kuiland-Nazario, research assistant at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Landsman, 26, who has the human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
AIDS, cited ignorance as the primary reason the three networks have not aired 
the condom commercials yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a sad testimony that these kids are the only ones who realize 
what's happening," he said, referring to about 25 young people at the news 
conference Friday. "If you're 19, you don't remember a time before HIV. These 
kids have grown up in a world full of AIDS, but they're not the ones who make 
the laws and the rules. Adults are hoping that it will go away, or they're sure 
that it's someone else's problem, so they just don't show it on television." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, NBC and Fox maintain that the condom spots have been approved and will 
begin airing when time is available. That means "within a week or two" for CBS, 
and "within the next couple months," for NBC, network officials said Friday. 
Networks run such unpaid commercials at their discretion as a service to the 
community, and these are among many waiting for air time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox made a promise to schedule these PSAs (public-service announcements), and 
we will absolutely honor that commitment," said Preston Padden, executive vice 
president for Fox, the first network to air a condom manufacturer's ad two 
years ago. "Over the past several months, our public-service efforts have 
focused on another important social concern: violence. And we have been running 
a powerful series of PSAs addressing that very issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility was the general theme among the young people who spoke Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I turn on the television, I see people engaging in irresponsible sexual 
behavior," said Ailleth Tom, 19, a UCLA student and peer educator on AIDS. "But 
I've yet to watch a show or a commercial that encourages us to use condoms, to 
protect our lives. Contrary to many beliefs, airing these public-service 
announcements will not promote sexual activity in youth, but showing sexually 
suggestive material will."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CSUN OPENS TODAY AFTER LAST-MINUTE SCRAMBLE; 
EDUCATION: BY NIGHTFALL SUNDAY, SOME PORTABLE CLASSROOMS WERE NOT SET UP. CLASS 
SCHEDULING ERRORS HAD SURFACED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials at battered Cal State Northridge scrambled Sunday to piece together 
a last-minute jigsaw puzzle of classroom and parking arrangements for the 
campus's reopening this morning, delayed two weeks because of the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall Sunday, some of the more than 300 portable classrooms scheduled 
to replace earthquake-damaged buildings had not been set up, and errors 
surfaced in class scheduling. But officials promised that crews would work 
through the night, and that space would be found for all classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said they will be short only about 1,550 parking spaces -- 
instead of a shortage of several thousand spaces that loomed a few days ago -- 
after several new parking areas were hastily arranged. They also announced 
plans for a system of shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Students still were being advised to arrive an hour before their scheduled 
class times and to be prepared for general confusion and changes in class 
locations. "We have an entirely new city of a campus," said university 
spokesman Bruce Erickson. "The old one is locked up, buttoned up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students who had already moved into on-campus housing -- which also was 
extensively damaged by the earthquake -- said they were looking forward to 
today's opening of a university in portables. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to go down in the history books. It's totally unique," said Damon 
Martin, 22, a senior and resident adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the opening-day confusion was a mistake in the campus' post-quake 
class schedule -- which was published and available to students only Sunday -- 
that showed scores of art, theater and music classes meeting in a single 
portable classroom, Arts Annex 120. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said students taking such classes -- the entire School of 
Arts on-campus curriculum -- will be able to obtain correct information at 22 
information booths set up throughout the 353-acre campus. Guides also will be 
on hand at the classroom to redirect students to the correct locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, university officials announced plans to supplement the 
campus's regular police force with officers from other Cal State University 
campuses and a private security firm after a fire of suspicious origin gutted 
three classroom trailers early Sunday. Officials said they had no suspects and 
no firm cause for the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Mininberg, CSUN's vice president for administration, said as many as 
four extra officers will be on duty during the day and as many as 16 extra at 
night beyond the campus' regular force of fewer than 20 officers. The request 
for other Cal State officers went out after the fire, but CSUN had already been 
arranging for the contract officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Sunday, contractors worked on the modular buildings that will serve 
as classrooms, offices and bathrooms, since virtually all of the campus' major 
classroom buildings remain closed. Two of the bathroom trailers sit directly 
across from the recreational vehicle that serves as an office for CSUN 
President Blenda J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials said high winds in the area were hampering the delivery of 
some of the modular classrooms, which must be towed in by trucks. But CSUN 
Provost Louanne Kennedy said two small campus buildings -- the communicative 
disorders facility and arts and design center -- will be pressed into service. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred campus employees and students who will staff information 
booths attended a briefing Sunday afternoon and then walked the campus to get a 
feel for its new layout in preparation for today's expected onslaught. Although 
about 24,000 students are registered for the semester, up to 15,000 are 
expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the campus's largest parking structure, containing 2,500 spaces, 
collapsed in the quake, and much of its normal surface parking is covered with 
portable classrooms, officials were urging students to consider three new 
parking locations with about 3,200 spaces that have been arranged in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The locations are 1,500 spaces on the north campus along Devonshire Street 
between Lindley and Zelzah avenues; 1,200 spaces at the former Handyman 
hardware store on Plummer Street west of the Northridge Fashion Center; and 500 
spaces at the former Prairie Street Elementary School on Zelzah north of 
Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials said they will run free shuttles between the campus and the 
Handyman site, the most distant from campus, every half hour from 7 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Shuttles will run between the north and main campuses every few minutes 
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. The former elementary school site is part of the 
main campus and will have no shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 Mininberg said those spaces, plus the campus' remaining regular parking, will 
total about 7,640 spaces by Monday, compared to the 9,200 spaces available 
before the earthquake. By the end of the week, Mininberg said the campus will 
be about even again, when another 1,500 spaces now being graded become 
available opposite the University Tower Apartments.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; RACING ALONG THE ROAD TO RICHES; REBUILDING: 
DRIVEN BY INCENTIVES, FIRMS STRIVE TO RESURFACE THE QUAKE- DAMAGED SIMI VALLEY 
FREEWAY BY THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Midnight: From high atop a shut-down section of the Simi Valley Freeway, the 
San Fernando Valley looks serene, belying the frenzied race for dollars under 
way on the shattered roadbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get up here this time of night, and it's kind of beautiful," said Larry 
Vogel, looking down on the quiet streets of Granada Hills. No one stirs in the 
suburban community of ranch-style houses, seemingly frozen in time in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, this would be a great place to build a house, right up here on the 
freeway," he said, standing on the remains of a westbound slow lane, crumbled 
by the earthquake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I stand out here and think, let's not open the son of a bitch back 
up. Let's just build condos." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vogel has little time to ruminate. He's the night foreman for Security 
Paving, a Sun Valley company that in a venture with Reyes Construction of 
Diamond Bar won the contract to clear the rubble and resurface the freeway for 
2.5 miles from Balboa Boulevard to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can get the job done by Thursday, just 14 days for work that would 
normally take many months, the two firms will share a $4-million fee. In the 
unlikely event they beat that deadline, they get a reward of $16,000 for every 
day they finish early -- but if they run over, they lose $16,000 a day from the 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Caltrans estimates it will be about a year before the freeway is 
rebuilt, the agency hopes this interim work will make available a couple of 
lanes in each direction by Thursday -- a month to the day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The $16,000 daily penalty or bonus is not a huge amount, in comparison with 
the total contract. But the reputation of these two relatively small companies 
is on the line and they want to make that 14-day deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Vogel stands there, it's already Day 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 12:05 a.m.: After his brief break, Vogel turns back to a scene that is in 
stark contrast to the serenity of the Valley below. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge hydraulic hammer on a crane is smashing old concrete into chunks. 
Motorized loaders driven by workers wearing ear protectors hoist rubble onto 
10-wheel trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller trucks topped with yellow flashing lights scurry back and forth, 
carrying supervisors and Caltrans inspectors checking on work up and down the 
road. Nearby, laborers set 200-pound metal forms in place, pounding wooden 
wedges underneath to level them before they are filled with wet concrete mix. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole scene is illuminated this moonless night by portable light towers, 
each powered by its own gas generator. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, I didn't think I would get to be a part of the 
reconstruction," said Vogel, 42, who been doing road grading and related 
construction work for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the bigger companies would swallow up all the work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Paving is a family-run firm with decades of experience in building 
roadways and bridges in Southern California. But this is its first freeway job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close to schedule, actually maybe a little ahead," said Vogel, 
driving his pickup to check on a site. Work began even before the contract was 
formally signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up here on Thursday night, right after word came that the bid was 
accepted," he says. "By the time the contract was signed the next morning, I 
already had four stompers pounding away, making a hell of a racket." 
</P>
<P>
 Work has continued 24 hours a day ever since. During the day, new concrete is 
poured and smoothed by 24-foot-wide, mechanized screed rollers. Each night, 
workers race to prepare the ground for more concrete the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 With a work force of about 24, "we knock out the old and make room for the 
new," Vogel said. The workday for him and his crew goes from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 12:50 a.m.: Vogel stops to talk to Mike Mattivi, son of one of the owners of 
Security Paving, taking a turn on a loader. Mattivi, 21, has been working for 
the company since the week after he graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of volunteered for the night shift on this one," said the quiet-spoken 
Mattivi. Like the laborers he is supervising near the San Fernando Mission 
Boulevard crossing, he is dressed in a hooded sweat shirt over several layers 
of clothing to ward off the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Vogel, he is happy to have a crack at this big-time work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are getting hurt by this earthquake," he said, adding 
matter-of-factly: "A lot of people are getting helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel turns to Mattivi. "In another week," Vogel said, "we'll know on which 
side of that we're on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 2:15 a.m.: Tommy Mattivi, Mike's father and one of the owners of Security 
Paving, is operating a loader on the eastern end of the project, near Haskell 
Avenue, riding it into a pronounced dip in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bridges in this part were pretty much OK," he says. "It was the surface 
that sunk." 
</P>
<P>
 The older Mattivi's temper is well-known to those on the night shift, but on 
this night he's in a good mood. "It's a challenge for us, really a challenge," 
he says, climbing down from the loader to redirect some of the laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is not so much the job, but doing it by the deadline and 
avoiding the penalties. "It's like going to Las Vegas," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattivi, 47, wearing an orange reflecting vest, walks over to a freeway 
divider to eat a couple of tacos, which have long since gone cold. 
</P>
<P>
 He watches workers pull metal forms into place. Even though the temperature is 
edging into the 40s, the workers' shirts are wet with sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever think you have a hard life," Tommy Mattivi says, "come watch these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:20 a.m.: A crew of five from Reyes Construction pours wheelbarrows of 
cement into narrow forms that stretch across the Simi Valley Freeway near where 
it meets the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 They are making a "pavement notch," which is supposed to let the roadway 
expand and compress under the influence of heat, cold or earthquake. "It used 
to be three inches wide in the old freeway," says crew member Mickey Gutierrez, 
shining a light into the revolving cement mixer to check on the mixture's 
moisture content. "Now it will be nine (inches)" to give it more flexibility in 
future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, 37, was hired for this job. "I was working for a company that bid 
on the job, but they didn't get it," he said, shrugging. "I had to work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 5:35 a.m. Orestes Pena drives a 10-wheel truck onto the temporary roadway 
made for them on the freeway. He is the founder and president of the Sun Valley 
company that rented the trucks for this project to the two construction firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted eight trucks, but I only had seven drivers available because they 
are working so hard and needed to rest," Pena said. "So I jumped in." 
</P>
<P>
 The number 724 is painted in large numerals on the truck cab. "That is the 
number of the (U. S. Navy) destroyer that picked me up when I came from Cuba," 
said Pena, who fled his homeland in a small boat he secretly built in his 
apartment, following plans from Popular Mechanics magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That number is on all my trucks," he said with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mattivi, with whom he often works, Pena hopes his company turns into a 
family dynasty. "I got this truck for my son," Pena said, pointing to the 
Peterbilt 10-wheeler he bought three days earlier, "so he will be interested in 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 5:55 a.m. As dawn brings light to the sky in the east, the day-shift workers 
begin arriving, parking their cars on the on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 One struggles to fire up a portable "jumping jack" pounder, yanking the 
starter cord repeatedly. "C'mon, baby, c'mon baby," he coaxes the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from the side as he finishes his last coffee of the night is Hector 
Andrade, 34, who landed this job a couple of days earlier. "It's sad how this 
had to happen for me to get the work," he said, referring to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I don't do it, the work will go to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Mattivi makes one last check on the night's progress. "It's never as 
much as I hope to get done," he said. "But we are doing OK, very good." 
</P>
<P>
 On the western end, Mike Mattivi is also calling it a night, gazing out over 
the slowly reviving freeway under the growing light of the sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a couple of weeks, you won't be able to walk up here like this," he said. 
"But when I drive across it, I'll always be thinking, 'I helped build this 
road.' "

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; APPETITE FOR CONSTRUCTION; 2 NEIGHBORS ENJOY 
NOISY SPECTACLE OF FREEWAY REPAIR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Some neighbors might complain about living with the 24-hour beeping and 
banging, the dust, the high-intensity lights and the rumbles and vibrations 
from monstrous trucks hauling tons of quake rubble as workers labor nonstop to 
repair the shattered Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Jerry and Fritz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's darned interesting," Jerry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bussing, 66, and Fritz Yonkers, 65 -- "That's Fritz like the cat, 
Yonkers like New York" -- act these days like two small boys with a big sandbox 
in their back yard. They spend about four or five hours each day keeping tabs 
on the heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two retired neighbors, who live on Jonfin Street, a cul-de-sac that backs 
up to the collapsed section of the freeway, are the self-proclaimed "sidewalk 
supervisors" of the round-the-clock project to demolish and rebuild two 
overpasses that collapsed near the Hayvenhurst Avenue exit in Granada Hills 
during the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They've watched the trucks and cranes go by. They've learned the workers' 
routines, as well as a thing or two about "rebar," trac loaders and 
32-wheelers. And, they've acquired a taste for breakfast burritos, served hot 
off the catering truck every day at 7:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about high entertainment value. "It's like a three-ring circus out 
there," Bussing said Thursday, fresh from a nap and toting a mug of apple juice 
as he assumed his perch atop a pile of bricks stacked against the sound wall 
that separates Yonkers' back yard from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It sure beats cleaning out the garage or watching Phil and Oprah, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's educational. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a hole ram right there," Bussing explained, pointing to a piece of 
heavy equipment with a long, cylindrical attachment that brought to mind a 
giant dentist's drill. "It's got 7,500 pounds of punch. They use it to bust up 
concrete. It's very maneuverable. Last week, they had five of them suckers out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that life now is filled with small inconveniences. The short jaunt 
to the supermarket on the other side of the fallen section of the erstwhile 
Simi Valley Freeway now takes an extra five to 10 minutes. A couple of nights, 
Yonkers had to flee to his daughter's house in Santa Clarita to catch some 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the show is worth the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, the workers brought out the torches to cut the 15-ton 
steel I-beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started burning, sparks were flying all over," Bussing said. Added 
Yonkers, "It was like the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, it already takes a high tolerance for noise to live "in the shade of 
a freeway," as singer Jackson Browne once phrased it. And the neighborhood near 
the intersection of Ludlow Street and Gothic Avenue, which predates the 
freeway, is as close as anyone can get to "the 118" without having to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, construction noise is much more jarring than the hum of tires rolling 
over concrete at 65 m.p.h. Some of their neighbors -- particularly residents of 
Ludlow Street who awoke Jan. 17 to find a freeway overpass sitting inches from 
their front yards -- have found temporary quarters elsewhere, returning to the 
neighborhood occasionally to check their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stayed are those who could make their peace with the round-the-clock 
spectacle and din at their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get used to the noise," Bussing said. He has lived in the neighborhood 
since 1968 and raised five children there. "When you have five kids in the 
family, this isn't noisy," he said. "It has been a wonderful place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Deanda Giovanelli, 18, spent half her childhood with her bedroom window at the 
foot of the freeway. She said she has trouble sleeping without the lullaby of 
traffic whizzing by. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Bill, 17, is less thrilled by the construction. "It's one constant 
aftershock," he said. "You can't drive through there, it's all muddy, and with 
all that light I can't sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But his sister said the construction noise helps her sleep. Until the all-out 
repair push began, she said, "It was too quiet" in the hours after the quake 
shut the freeway. "I could hear every movement in the house, every creak. I 
slept with the TV on." 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition began within 48 hours of the Jan. 17 quake. This weekend, 
construction of the new freeway bridge begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Deanda the freeway girl," she said. "At first you say, 'Oh no, it's going 
to be all night long.' Then you get used to it. A lot of people complain, but 
you can't just leave a freeway lying there."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; FREEWAY LINKAGES REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The section of the Simi Valley Freeway linking the San Diego and Foothill 
freeways, which was closed after the Northridge earthquake, was reopened 
Sunday, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most of the transitional roads linking the freeways were also 
opened Sunday.Commuters will be able to switch from freeway to freeway without 
taking as many surface streets, said Charles Webster, regional manager of 
Caltrans' Newhall office, which oversees operations in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys. The stretch includes entrances and exits along the way 
as well as transitional roads to the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least commuters can take the 405 to the 118 and get on to the 5 or the 
210," Webster said. "It'll give them a little breather. But they'll still have 
to take some city streets to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Simi Valley Freeway west of the San Diego Freeway is still 
closed, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second lane on the southbound Golden State Freeway near the Santa Clara 
River and the Rye Canyon on-ramp to the southbound Golden State were expected 
to open by late Sunday, lessening the area's traffic bottleneck, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a portion of the Golden State Freeway between Lyons Avenue in 
Newhall and Roxford Street in Sylmar will be closed from 11:30 p.m. until 5 
a.m. Monday and Tuesday for quake-related repairs.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; FOR VALENTINE'S DAY, GIVE 
THE GIFTS THAT KEEP ON GIVING -- PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Valentine was a Christian saint who died for love, but most of us wouldn't 
want to. It's bad enough just figuring out how to celebrate the anniversary of 
the martyr's death. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least two versions of the circumstances that brought about 
Valentine's demise and eventual elevation to sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that he performed marriages for young people after Roman Emperor 
Claudius II forbade the rite, thinking unmarried men made better soldiers. 
Valentine persisted. Claudius was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Another version has the priest curing a child of blindness but being sentenced 
to death for refusing to worship Roman gods. But before his death, on Feb. 14, 
he sent a note to the young girl whose sight he had restored, offering her 
prayers. He is supposed to have signed it: "From Your Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the origin of Valentine's Day, the observance is now somewhat more 
upbeat. These days we just argue about who should give what to whom on this 
holiday. And now comes another potential gift -- an orphaned dog or cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both the East and West Valley animal shelters report that most 
displaced feline and canine earthquake victims have been reunited with their 
families, there are others who need a good home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lt. Tim Goffa of the Chatsworth shelter, reunions are still an 
occasional occurrence, but most of the pets who are going to be claimed have 
probably already been taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet Orphans in Van Nuys reports a curious upswing in the number of adoptions 
recently. "We are not sure of the reason, but people have been calling a lot," 
Diane Scripps says. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps is one of the founders of the animal adoption agency that rescues pets 
from "Death Row" at the local pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just take animals we are certain we can place because we are not a 
long-term facility," she says. "We don't want the animals in pens for the rest 
of their lives. We want them to have good homes." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that usually the animals, who are spayed or neutered, spend only a 
few days or weeks before they become part of a family. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the case with 1 1/2-year-old Chris, a golden retriever mix, and 
3-year-old shepherd mix Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps and the staff fuss over the two dogs who have been at the facility for 
about a year. "They are both beautiful and would make excellent pets. We can't 
figure out why they haven't been claimed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It is her hope that someone will adopt the dogs today as a Valentine's present 
but she warns that both of the animals love people but are wary of other pets. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a while to be processed as a Pet Orphan adoptive parent, but, 
according to Scripps, the wait is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offering a gift capable of giving and receiving love for years to 
come," she says. "There aren't many things you can give with that kind of 
guarantee." In the Wake of the Quake, a Few More Thank-You Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It's like a mantra: The quake has brought out the best in many of us. 
Neighbors are aiding neighbors and people are giving strangers a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The "helping" stories have a good feeling. With all the bad stuff happening 
out there, it's kind of relaxing to wallow in nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Here comes another round. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Schwartz, manager of TGI Fridays in Woodland Hills, says he was amazed 
twice the morning of the earthquake. First by the destruction in the restaurant 
and then by the spirit of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to the restaurant, everything that could break was broken, 
including glasses, dishes, every single bottle of liquor, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 While he stood there trying to figure out what to do first, his staff, some of 
whom were now homeless, showed up ready to work and, like the Energizer Bunny, 
just kept on working. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a couple of weeks, but we got everything picked up, cleaned up, 
fixed up and reordered," Schwartz says, adding that he will never forget the 
team spirit of the people who work with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, at Highland Federal Bank, Sheila Cook, assistant vice president, 
and Linda Kelly, operations officer, were trying to make order out of chaos on 
Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 They were so moved by the people who came by to help and customers who offered 
hugs that they took out a thank-you advertisement in a local paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Special thanks went to Richard Villarreal, manager of Reuben's Summerhouse, 
and to TGI Fridays' Schwartz, who, in spite of his own problems, sent food over 
to the women who couldn't leave the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Scripps of Pet Orphans says she wants to thank the local Sparkletts 
people for their thoughtfulness when the organization's facility was without 
water. "They donated about 500 gallons, whatever we needed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And in spite of all the price-gouging and anti-landlord stories circulating, 
Audrey Johnson, a local court reporter, has a different take on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were forced to evacuate our Sherman Oaks condo, our landlord not only 
returned our deposit, but refunded half a month's rent," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She apologizes, now that all her records are in storage, for not knowing how 
to spell his name correctly for the newspaper, but she wants to say he's a 
class guy. Watchdogs Have Hands Full as Misfortune Strikes Many 
</P>
<P>
 Not all landlords are paragons of virtue, which is why agencies like the 
Valley Fair Housing Council and the California Fair Employment and Housing 
departments have been working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Tawatao, who handles housing problems for the San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services office, says business is up sharply, as much as 
80%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we dealing with more complaints, but we are trying to get out to 
areas where there are large groups of displaced people. We are going out to 
talk to them and help them get their housing needs met," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her main concerns is to confront landlords who are taking advantage of 
people in this situation, Tawatao says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to help those with housing problems. If we can't, we'll refer 
them to someone who can," she adds. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to grapple with issues of national health and civil wars in 
other countries. Give me Tonya Harding and Michael Jackson any day."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; QUAKE WORKERS SAY THEY WEREN'T FULLY PREPARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Volunteer disaster workers met with Los Angeles Fire Department officials 
Sunday to review the volunteers' performance during the Northridge earthquake, 
concluding that they did many things right but were not fully prepared to cope 
with the temblor's devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake marked the largest mobilization of the city's Emergency Response 
Teams, volunteers trained by the Fire Department to assist in major disasters. 
Since it began in 1986, about 10,000 city residents have been trained under the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 While mostly praising one another for the job they did after the Jan. 17 
quake, the volunteers -- most from the San Fernando Valley and the Westside -- 
also cited some holes in their preparation at the meeting at San Fernando High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to know how to help others deal with the psychological impact 
of the quake," said Barbara Roller of North Hollywood, one of about 40 
volunteers present. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said that a lack of communication among the volunteers and fire and 
police departments led to confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're moving around in a disaster situation, they (other agencies) better 
know what we're about," said Paula Elefant of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained that they were trained to act as a team, but were forced to 
work alone in the chaos of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But helpful things for other disasters were also learned during the recent 
quake. Trevis Miljan of Brentwood Hills said that in her neighborhood, people 
who were not in need of assistance put up white flags in front of their homes 
to let relief workers know they were all right. The simple gesture saved relief 
workers a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to bypass those homes and help those who really needed it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials, who were pleased with the way the response teams 
operated during the quake, said they plan to adopt the volunteers' suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This obviously is the first big test of the program," said Assistant Chief 
Frank Borden, the program's creator. "I want to see how it worked, and how we 
can improve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency Response Team volunteers undergo 17 1/2 hours of classroom 
instruction on such techniques as fire suppression, shutting off utilities, and 
medical and search-and-rescue operations, said Fire Capt. Ronald Jackson.

ACTON MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYINGS OF A FATHER, SON; CRIME: THE TWO WERE SHOT TO 
DEATH SATURDAY AFTER ARGUING WITH THE ACCUSED AT HIS TRAILER, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Acton man who allegedly shot and killed a father and son during an argument 
has been arrested by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and charged with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 William Strong, the caretaker of a rural home on West Hubbard Road, was taken 
into custody Saturday night, after he allegedly killed 59-year-old Kenneth Laux 
and his 34-year-old son, Kenneth Laux Jr., during an altercation about 5:30 
p.m., said Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Diane Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 The father and son were each shot several times in the upper body and died at 
the scene, Hecht said. Neither man appeared to be carrying a weapon, Hecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had driven up to the property, where Strong lives inside a small 
trailer, shortly before the shooting occurred, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men apparently visited with Strong, then argued with him briefly 
before they were shot, Hecht said. Homicide detectives have not determined why 
the two men visited Strong, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, several neighbors restrained Strong until authorities 
arrived, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the suspect ran over to a neighbor's house and told them what had 
happened, and they decided to call police and detain him," said Sheriff's 
Department spokeswoman Benita Hinojos. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested by sheriff's deputies shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered a shotgun at the scene. Strong was booked on suspicion of 
murder at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, Hecht said.

 Police shooting -- A story in Sunday's editions of The Times incorrectly 
reported that the two Los Angeles Police Department officers who shot and 
killed Eulia Love, a black woman, in 1979 were white. In fact, one of them was 
black.
