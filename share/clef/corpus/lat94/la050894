FEAR OF FANTASY; WHY WAIT FOR THE SERIOUS LITERATURE POLICE TO BLESS YOUR 
FICTION? ENJOY IT!; FROM THE TEETH OF ANGELS, BY JONATHAN CARROLL (DOUBLEDAY: 
$22; 212 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 I tend to like prose at its most crystalline -- Nabokov, say, Colette, 
Calvino. What am I doing, then, loving the harum-scarum roller coaster of high 
imagination and lowdown manipulation built by Jonathan Carroll? He is not 
always in control of his materials, his novels of the supernatural have 
well-worn "Twilight Zone" elements. And yet I read them with a panicky thrill, 
too excited to keep reading, too excited to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 His books treat otherworldly themes, but you enter willingly because his 
characters remind you of your best, most creative friends from college -- they 
have somehow miraculously made it, become the actors, poets, scientists or 
journalists that you hoped they would be. Even at his scariest, Carroll treats 
his characters with a generosity and tenderness that makes you want to protect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Teeth of Angels" offers its enormously appealing people the 
opportunity to talk to Death, to ask it questions, to reason with it. We would 
all like a word or two with Death, we need to revenge ourselves on it. 
Carroll's audacity is high-wire and brave; I finished the book with a crazy 
feeling of revelation. I needed debriefing, reorientation. Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge suggests you should take precautions against a man who has witnessed 
powerful visions: 
</P>
<P>
 ...All should cry, Beware! Beware!  
</P>
<P>
 His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
</P>
<P>
 Weave a circle round him thrice,  
</P>
<P>
 And close your eyes with holy dread,  
</P>
<P>
 For he on honey-dew hath fed,  
</P>
<P>
 And drunk the milk of Paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 Every time I finish one of Jonathan Carroll's books (there are eight of them), 
I try to detach myself from the experience. His best books rearrange me, and as 
I make my way back to daily consciousness I start to rationalize and criticize. 
Until the realization comes: The pleasure and vertigo of Carroll's writing 
induces uncomfortable, childish feelings. I want to protect myself from the 
scary, silly thrills in his books, and I use the imperial yardstick of Serious 
Literature to distance myself from pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is the worst thing criticism can do, overlook the ecstasy of 
reading and back away from intensity. Great readers are connoisseurs of 
pleasure. If you have loved George Macdonald's "The Princess and Curdie," or 
the Oz books, or even "One Hundred Years of Solitude," you might want to deepen 
or elaborate their mysteries rather than dismiss them. Jonathan Carroll's 
fiction seduces you into creepy places, and it flabbergasts you and leaves you 
there feeling stupid and holding an empty bag. That is his gift -- why should 
the solemn part of you that hates to be afraid and hates to be fooled win in 
the end? You stay true to the original delirium, and you embrace Jonathan 
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Great reading experiences frequently come from the unsettling confusion of 
high seriousness and low cunning. When Edgar Allan Poe self-righteously 
declared that his Gothic horrors were from the Soul and not imported from 
Germany, he was only telling a half-truth. Melville, too, investigating "the 
blackness ten times black," was not above low jokes and burlesque turns. 
Jonathan Carroll's mixture of metaphysics and television is his best invention 
-- you think you're on the high road to Revealed Truth, and suddenly it's time 
for a soul-abrading commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Carroll's stories have been appearing in places like Weird Tales, the 
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Omni, you mustn't wince, but, 
rather, remember that Jorge Luis Borges' first publication in America, the 
story "Death and the Compass," appeared in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of our best and weirdest writers make their way to us through the 
thickets of science fiction, speculative fiction and fantasy. Salman Rushdie's 
first novel "Grimus" was considered science fiction; much of early Angela 
Carter was taken to be sword and sorcery stuff. J. G. Ballard lived for years 
between lurid lunar apocalypse covers, and Alisdair Gray, that bizarre Scot, 
scuttles from publisher to publisher while he awaits classification. 
</P>
<P>
 The category question is a real stickler. Despite the popularity of South 
American magic realism, and the delights of Canadian Gothic (Robertson Davies, 
Margaret Atwood), educated readers are afraid of fantasy. They wait until it 
has been dubbed Literature by the experts, by which time a good part of the 
original thrill of discovery has been eroded. A book that disturbs and pushes 
buttons -- take, for instance, Geoff Ryman's "Was" -- waits for discovery while 
safer, more organized, manicured books find their ways onto the front covers of 
the book reviews. For those who cannot wait to find themselves lost in the 
unknown, look for Wendy Walker's "The Sea-Rabbit and Other Stories," any of 
Rikki Ducornet's novels or Tom LaFarge's "The Crimson Bears." But start with 
Jonathan Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Teeth of Angels" begins with a letter from a man named Jesse who 
tells about someone he has met who has sinister dreams. In the dreams, a dead 
friend appears, offering to answer questions about death. The difficulty is 
that the answers must be understood. If the dreamer awakens in the morning with 
wounds and scars, he has been punished, he has not understood the answers, and 
he must ask better questions in the next night's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Death appears and reappears in unpredictable disguises; he changes from a 
figure in a travel agent's nightmare to a living lover of a reclusive movie 
star. Death meets the host of a popular children's show, a Pee-wee Herman type, 
and they get along well: They like each other's jokes. Death is capable of 
surrealism, and romance; he can bring you your mother's lost diaries or show 
you the birth and death of your cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is so plasmatic, Death shifts the narrative's possibilities almost 
as quickly as the changes of perspective in a John Ashbery poem. The reader 
feels the effects of the supernatural give way to the bombardments and overload 
that are the hallmarks of postmodern fiction. In England and Germany, where 
Carroll is popular, his kind of writing has been named "hyperfiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The blur of the popular and the postmodern in Jonathan Carroll's work may be 
traced to his background. He is the son of a screenwriter (Sidney Carroll, who 
wrote the screenplay for "The Hustler") and a writer and performer of musical 
comedies (June Carroll, who starred in "New Faces of 1952" and wrote the lyrics 
for the hit "Love Is a Simple Thing"). His half brother, Steve Reich, is a 
well-known avant-garde composer. There is an obvious tug-o'-war in Jonathan 
Carroll's work between the crowd-pleasing and the private, the commercial and 
the mystical, with the result that you never know where you stand, as if the 
toy makers who design Masters of the Universe had taken to mass-marketing 
Joseph Cornell boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The three books of Carroll's that I particularly recommend are his first, "The 
Land of Laughs," his third, "Bones of the Moon," and this most recent, "From 
the Teeth of Angels." The others vary in their quality from the almost great 
("Sleeping in Flame") to the too theoretical ("A Child Across the Sky"). Once 
you're hooked, though, you have to read all of them because characters and 
incidents recur -- as in Robertson Davies' Deptford Trilogy -- and these 
characters are as delightful as any I've found since the early Truman Capote 
("Breakfast at Tiffany's") or J. D. Salinger (the Glass family). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the blatant commercialism of Carroll's imagination that makes these 
novels new and different. Without it, they might be quaint and forlorn, but 
because of his naked desire to amaze, to take you on a fast, bumpy ride, the 
books are wild and disturbing. Carroll loves film director Tim Burton 
("Pee-wee's Big Adventure," "Beetlejuice," "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman"), 
but he also loves the highly intellectual Robertson Davies, Michael Ondaatje, 
James Salter and John Ashbery. He's a movie-generation virtuoso with the 
literary sensibility of a metaphysical eccentric.

VILLAIN AND GENIUS OF TIME; MASTER OF THE GAME: STEVE ROSS AND THE CREATION OF 
TIME WARNER, BY CONNIE BRUCK (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $25; 400 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas B. Rosenstiel, Thomas B. Rosenstiel, who writes about the media for 
The Times, is the author of Strange Bedfellows: How Television and the 
Presidential Candidates Changed American Politics, 1992. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even Steve Ross' final act was full of playful fantasy and elements of 
delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dying of prostate cancer, the legendary chairman of Time Warner Co. checked 
into the hospital the last time under the name George Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, of course, is the character Jimmy Stewart played in "It's a Wonderful 
Life," the Frank Capra film about a man who finds his life had meaning because 
of how he helped other people. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ross, it must have seemed a natural choice. The movie was his favorite, 
and this ingratiating dreamer, deal maker and emotionally disconnected 
manipulator imagined himself to be like Bailey: a selfless giver, a builder of 
things, a nurturer who cared more about people than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one friend also thought it was Ross' attempt at one last incredible 
deal -- this time with the Almighty -- for in the movie Bailey is saved from 
suicide by an angel for his good deeds. "He figured he was probably going to 
die, and he wanted to try to convince God he was George Bailey," the friend 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as Connie Bruck reveals in her graceful and wisely balanced biography 
of Ross, "Master of the Game," assuming Bailey's identity was not without its 
ironies. For in real life Ross was also the greed-soaked, unfeeling villain of 
the film, Mr. Potter, who used people to enrich himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a life improbable enough for the movies. Ross grew up poor in Flatbush 
and married into a chain of New York area funeral parlors. To take the family 
company public, implausibly, he merged it with a parking lot company that 
apparently was a Mafia front. From there, he moved into the movie business, 
shedding companies and friends like a reptile shedding old skin. Eventually he 
achieved the most probable of all, acquiring Time Inc., all the while making 
Time executives think they were acquiring Ross' Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Bruck explains, Ross built an atmosphere of entrepreneurial 
creativity and almost "feudal" loyalty all but vanished from corporate America. 
And he escaped prosecution for a series of scandals and improprieties that 
could have ended several careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the telling, Bruck, the New Yorker writer and author of "The Predators' 
Ball," has avoided the trap that befalls so much nonfiction today -- confusing 
biography with expose. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Master of the Game" thoughtfully, and often eloquently, weighs Ross' 
good qualities -- those of an American original and nurturer of creativity -- 
with his bad ones -- those of a man capable of unmentionable dishonesty, 
disloyalty and greed. Though not a long book, this is a serious study by a 
careful, probing and reflective writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believing nothing was impossible (and being, in this sense, a throwback to an 
earlier, more adventurous time), he was daring and bold, and he saw with fresh 
eyes. But, feeling exempt from legal, ethical and moral standards, he abrogated 
them at will." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its admirable qualities, however, Bruck's book also falls just short 
of being a definitive work about Ross or an essential tract on American 
corporate life. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bruck reveals rather is how Ross made business a kind of excellent 
adventure. He lavished his executives with freedom and wealth -- until the last 
decade he paid them more than he did himself. And he exhorted them to each day 
"dream," and then go out and do something about your dreams. "His salesmanship 
(was) so consummate," Bruck writes, "that it seemed more about the art of 
romance than about selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruck obviously admires the creative culture Ross engendered. When a record 
company executive once told Ross he was worried about expanding into a new 
music area that might lose about $10 million, Ross told him simply: "It's your 
company. If you don't think you can handle being 10 million in a hole, don't do 
it -- but it's your company." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was an amazing manipulator. Once when trying to buy a company, Ross 
discovered that his adversary had been reading a book on psychology. He had one 
of his aides read it, and they used the techniques in the book to outmaneuver 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "What had so tantalized Ross about business, from the start, was certainly not 
day-to-day operations, with its myriad details, or even the lofty overview of 
management that monitored the whole; it was, rather, what hovered, indistinct, 
about the edges of the thing -- Chimera which promised to shower gold if one 
could only give them substance." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bruck notes Ross' awesome insecurity. At the height of his career, he once 
tried to impress his wife by claiming that, using a pseudonym, he had actually 
written a hit song of the day for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way there were four major episodes that betray Ross' image as a 
romantic "builder," most of which Bruck details well, though staunch critics 
may argue she is not hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' early partners are apparently gangsters, Bruck accepts though never 
conclusively establishes, and he never fully lost his connection with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, at the height of Ross' success, Warner executives took bribes to 
invest in a Mafia-associated business near New York City, the Westchester 
Premier Theatre. Although she renders no final verdict herself, Bruck describes 
how Ross escaped conviction only by letting his best friend, Jay Emmett, take 
the rap. The two men apparently never spoke again. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, again in an apparent crime for which he was never charged, 
Ross sold off more than $20 million off his own company's stock when he knew 
that his subsidiary, Atari, was about to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 And his ultimate triumph, the merger of his Warner Communications with Time 
Inc., was an ultimate failure, Bruck suggests, both because of Ross' 
extraordinary greed and the fact that the two companies' parts were not all 
that complementary. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its sensibleness, however, the book leaves one with a feeling of 
missing pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is a sense of hollowness about Ross. He remains a distant figure. We 
are in the minds of some characters -- Ross' wives, for instance -- but never 
that of Ross himself. He "seemed never to look back" at his life, she writes. 
"Whether this persona -- caring, constant, generous beyond his beneficiaries 
dreams, an idealized father figure -- was one Ross deliberately fashioned . . . 
is not altogether clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The fault may not entirely be Bruck's. She is trying to be fair, and Ross is 
an extraordinarily complex subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruck also seems to have devoted herself to understanding events, not simply 
digging for amazing anecdotes, but as a result this is not a book so filled 
with remarkably telling details that characters simply come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, too, some key figures would not talk, among them, it seems, the 
sacrificial friend, Emmett. As Bruck writes in her source notes, moreover, Ross 
had agreed to cooperate but died before Bruck had a chance to cover the key 
events in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The other absence is the deeper question of why we celebrate and write books 
about people like Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his celebrity and wealth, what, if anything, did he contribute? Bruck 
makes little attempt to broach the topic. She does not even give us much about 
the movies or books or anything else that Ross had a hand in. Finishing "Master 
of the Game" left me feeling that our values were skewed. This is a book about 
corporate life and mergers, not, as some business biographies have been, 
shaping the culture, building a great institution or affecting the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps such social criticism is too much to ask from this fine book. But in 
the end Ross seems little more than a magnetic, fascinating guy, a deeply 
flawed and strangely appealing character. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that is much less of a testament than we might expect from our corporate 
titans. Ultimately, it seems, Ross was the master of nothing more than a game.

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT; BEYOND PEACE, BY RICHARD NIXON (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 256 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Dallek, Robert Dallek, a specialist in diplomatic and political 
history at UCLA, is the author of books on F.D.R., L.B.J. and Reagan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No politician in American history had a longer and more controversial career 
than Richard Nixon. His actions during his 48 years as a congressman, senator, 
vice president, gubernatorial candidate, president, writer and world statesman 
provoked uncommonly strong expressions of support and opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrated by some as a great peacemaker who delivered America from a nuclear 
war, Nixon has been excoriated by others as the most corrupt President ever to 
sit in the White House. Eulogized by admirers as a model of courageous 
determination, an exemplar of the self-made American who overcame much 
adversity, critics remember him as a self-pitying opportunist who permanently 
damaged the presidency and deepened the country's political cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 When commentators divide so sharply over a public figure, they take refuge in 
the observation that "history will judge," meaning, "in time, my side of the 
argument will be vindicated." But good, fair-minded history is less devoted to 
judging than trying to understand and explain. There is, of course, no 
objective, antiseptic history, no bias-free rendering of the past; 
score-settling can be as common among historians as among political advocates. 
But future generations, safely removed from the issues that stirred old 
passions, will be better able to take on the historian's task and produce 
something closer to a balanced, dispassionate assessment of Richard Nixon than 
anything biographers might write now. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will not be easy. Scholars will have a deuce of a time making sense of 
Nixon's contradictions. They will wonder about the meteoric rise to the vice 
presidency of someone whose campaigns against Jerry Voorhis and Helen Gahagan 
Douglas and response to the Alger Hiss case made him a mean-spirited political 
figure with an affinity for dirty tricks. They will struggle to explain the 
rise to the presidency of a man whose stiff, standoffish personality was 
ill-suited to a television age -- a time when charm and charisma counted for 
more than the power of someone's intellect and ideas, Nixon's long suits. They 
will be hard pressed to understand how the man some dubbed "the great American 
loser" achieved his 1972 landslide, one of the greatest in American 
presidential history. 
</P>
<P>
 On matters of foreign policy as well, students of Nixon's career will have 
some difficult questions to answer. How will they make sense of the gap between 
the early anti-Communist ideologue and the pragmatic proponent of detente with 
Soviet Russia and Communist China? How will they square Nixon's four-year 
extension of the war in Indochina with American defeat in its longest conflict? 
How will they balance the impulse to reach accommodations with Communist 
governments in Europe and Asia against the policy of overturning Salvador 
Allende's constitutionally elected, left-leaning government in Chile? 
</P>
<P>
 As for domestic affairs during Nixon's presidency, it will only add to the 
confusion. The mixture of conservative, anti-government rhetoric and actions 
with the embrace of liberal policies, like wage and price controls, 
environmental protection, school desegregation in the South and welfare and 
health care reforms, cry out for explanation. Nixon's unsuccessful nominations 
of two conservative Southerners for the Supreme Court, followed by the 
appointment of Harry Blackmun, one of the most liberal justices of the last 30 
years, further complicates the story. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the criminality of a presidential Administration supposedly so 
devoted to law and order? Why, moreover, didn't Nixon, who worked so hard to 
cover up the Watergate scandal, destroy the secret tapes that compelled him to 
give up his office? And finally, there is the puzzle of the return to 
respectability of the country's most disgraced chief executive. Was it largely 
Nixon's doing? Or was it principally the changing times? 
</P>
<P>
 Finding reasonable answers to these questions will test our powers of 
comprehension. But future biographers will have the advantage of access to tens 
of thousands of documents and thousands of recordings currently locked up in 
the National Archives. This material, which Nixon spent the last 20 years 
fighting to keep from public view, will go far to explain his motives and role 
in shaping his presidency. It will also give us insights into his character 
that the recollections of outside observers can not provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's nine post-presidential books, ranging from his memoirs, "RN," 
published in 1978, to his discussions of political leadership, Vietnam and 
American foreign policy in a Cold War and post-Cold War world, will become 
documents in the search for understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond Peace," a succinct 250-page analysis of how America must approach the 
dilemmas of the coming century at home and abroad, will be seen as Nixon's last 
will and testament, a summing up of ideas that Nixon saw as his legacy to the 
country he loved, served and mis-served in his long career. 
</P>
<P>
 The book will add to the puzzle of Richard Nixon. It is as contradictory as 
the man himself. In its analysis of foreign affairs, it is as wise and 
forward-looking as anything one could hope to see from the pen of an American 
statesman. On domestic issues, however, it is as strident and cliche ridden as 
an early Nixon campaign address. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Clinton Administration, Nixon had a clear idea of where he believed 
the country needed to go in foreign affairs. "If America is to remain a great 
nation," he said, "what we need today is a mission beyond peace," which has 
come with the end of the Cold War. And that mission must be informed by a 
recognition that we cannot do everything everywhere. " . . . We must consider 
each situation on its merits," asking, "Will our involvement be consistent with 
our values? Will it serve our interests? Will it serve the interests of our 
friends? Will it serve the interests of those directly involved." 
</P>
<P>
 With these questions in mind, Nixon prescribed an American policy for every 
corner of the globe. Russia was at the center of his concerns. America needs to 
do everything possible to advance political and economic freedom in the former 
Soviet Union. "Today's generation of American leaders will be judged primarily 
by whether they did everything possible to bring about this outcome. If they 
fail, the cost that their successors will have to pay will be unimaginably 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon counseled against thinking that Russia would become an American-style 
democracy. It won't, but we need to be patient and tolerant in allowing Russia 
to work out its own "democratic" solutions to its many problems. And while 
doing so, "we should accentuate the positive rather than dwell obsessively on 
the negative in the unfolding Russian saga." And more concretely, we and other 
Western governments should commit themselves to a kind of Marshall Plan for 
Russia and the other former Soviet states that will cost us far less in the 
long run than a new round of confrontation with a hostile Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had much good sense to offer as well on NATO, the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, the importance of Asia in America's future, especially Japan and 
China, and how unwise policies of confrontation with those Asian giants would 
be for our national well-being. Specifically, Nixon warned against allowing 
"politicians on both sides of the Pacific (from) exploit(ing) U.S.-Japanese 
trade problems to score political points on the home front." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he urged a series of steps for accommodation with both Tokyo and 
Beijing that President Clinton would do well to consider. Indeed, "Beyond 
Peace" is a fine primer on foreign policy for an Administration that is 
struggling to develop a surer grasp of world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 On domestic policy, however, Nixon's advice rarely rises above familiar 
homilies about free enterprise and the virtues of law and order. He decries the 
growth of government programs, urging instead expanded "economic freedom, which 
is the only way to assure prosperity and individual liberty; and a moral and 
cultural system that strengthens the family, personal responsibility, and the 
instincts for civic virtue." His prescriptions for arriving at such desirable 
goals seem less than persuasive. He advocates a shift from income and payroll 
taxes to a value-added tax, for example. But he has nothing to say about the 
political realities that stand in the way of so large a reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Nixon biography, "One of Us," Tom Wicker argued that this controversial 
man was in fact a reflection of our national contradictions. But the contrast 
between Nixon's understanding of international and domestic affairs suggests 
another perspective. Where unemotional, hardheaded analysis of problems count 
most in challenges abroad, Nixon had the capacity to be a first-rate leader. 
Where compassion for human suffering is a special attribute in a nation beset 
by so many domestic problems, Nixon, the cold, calculating politician, had 
little to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon and the problems of understanding he left us now belong to the ages.

ON THE TRAIL OF A HORSE; SACRED HORSES: MEMOIRS OF A TURKMEN COWBOY, BY

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a central dilemma at the heart of Jonathan Evan Maslow's intriguing 
new book, "Sacred Horses: Memoirs of a Turkmen Cowboy," an account of two trips 
to Turkmenistan, in Central Asia, where the author hoped to ride a fabled 
Akhal-Teke purebred horse across the Kara Kum Desert. When a writer sets out on 
a quest, what does he write about if the object of it eludes him? That's the 
problem Maslow encounters, and the solution he offers leaves something to be 
desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Maslow, a journalist and a naturalist, starts out his journey by claiming an 
affection for horses that dates back to his childhood. He speaks of it as a 
"powerful, mystical attraction" that he never got over. So possessed did he 
become that after graduating from college he took a job at a Vermont farm where 
thoroughbreds were stabled, and he glimpsed there what he calls the romantic 
notion underlying all of horsemanship -- "that a human and animal can work 
together as a team, blending mind and muscle in a perfectable union." 
</P>
<P>
 The romance never really left him. When he turned 40, divorced and childless, 
he hatched a dreamy plan to tackle the Eurasian steppes on horseback, failing 
to realize how difficult it might be. Though he understood that the steppes are 
a hostile environment almost unparalleled on earth, with brutal temperatures in 
summer and icy winters when big winds scour a landscape virtually absent of 
trees, he remained undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
 In this adverse climate, Maslow notes, the sturdy Akhal-Teke breed once 
flourished. Equus caballus was probably first domesticated in Central Asia, in 
fact. Evidence exists to show that herdsmen kept mares for food and milk by the 
third millennium B.C., and also mated them to stallions in season. After the 
herdsman had invented harnesses and stiff saddles, horses became an integral 
part of their nomadic lives. "Their country is the back of their horse," 
Herodotus said of the Scythians who, when mounted, were the fiercest warriors 
of the ancient world. 
</P>
<P>
 Maslow's skill at digging up such historical material and conveying it in a 
fresh and agreeable way is one of the treats that "Sacred Horses" provides. He 
goes on to tell us that the horses, all light-cavalry types, combined many 
famous breeds, but that they finally came to be known as Turkomans after the 
Turkoman tribe, who occupied a barren region to the extreme southwest -- 
Turkmenistan on the maps of the old Soviet Republic. The horses, further 
refined as Akhal-Tekes, are still bred there now, having lasted through the 
Stalin era when they were ground up and stuffed into sausage casings to feed 
the immigrants from Russia and elsewhere who were repopulating Ashkhabad in 
1948, after a devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Akhal-Tekes, then, are survivors, and Maslow celebrates their toughness, 
their racing ability -- they may be the progenitors of all modern racehorses -- 
and their astonishing endurance. In marathons, he says, they have crossed 225 
miles of the Kara Kum in just three days, without any water. The horses become 
for him what the snow leopard was to Peter Mathiessen -- a potent symbol of 
many things, including renewal -- but as he pursues them into Turkmenistan, his 
narrative falters. 
</P>
<P>
 Maslow sets off for the steppes in a spirit of optimism. He has learned some 
Russian and taken riding lessons, but he seems curiously unprepared for the 
many nuisances a traveler might meet in what was then, in 1991, still the 
Soviet Union. He isn't the most relaxed sort of fellow, either. Arriving in 
Ashkhabad as a "citizen diplomat" with a cultural exchange group, he's put off 
by the poverty, dust and rubble of that beleaguered city and insults his host 
family by sleeping through a special banquet in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he tries to play the incident for comic effect, as he does his 
clashes with petty bureaucrats and KGV agents, the humor has an unsympathetic, 
ugly-American edge to it. The director of the Turkmen Friendship Society, for 
instance, is "Korean. Striped tie, playboy sunglasses, big mole, small white 
fangs." Maslow bumps into "oafs," "eunuchs," and "old goats," and pokes fun at 
the fractured English he hears. A helpful professor is described as "an 
inoffensive toad of a man," while a bride-to-be is "not pretty to look at, but 
ample where it counted." 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on. In Maslow's view, the Turkmen people are always slurping up 
vodka and chewing through platters of food. Later, in the town of Repetek, he 
complains about having to tip a rude railroad agent, apparently oblivious of 
the fact that little bribes are the true currency in every impoverished 
country. "There was no justification for it," he says. "I might more logically 
have punched him in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 What saves Sacred Horses from sinking altogether is a more serious and 
engaging side of Maslow that manifests itself in arresting discussions of 
Soviet politics, the origins of nomadism, or the intricacies of the Kara Kum. 
He writes glowingly about the desert and also about some Akhal-Tekes he visits 
at a racetrack stable in Ashkhabad. They have lustrous, doe-soft coats whose 
"iridescence could only be compared to a beautiful tiny hummingbird." Their 
high, courageous spirit must derive, he thinks, from being "fully aware of 
their unique place in this sector of creation." 
</P>
<P>
 Akhal-Tekes are extremely valuable now and bred primarily for the racetrack, 
and it soon dawns on Maslow that he's unlikely to be able to afford -- much 
less to obtain -- a horse to carry him across the desert. The best he can 
manage is to saddle up an Akhal-Teke at a stud farm, but his account of the 
ride takes up only a few paragraphs toward the end of the book and comes as a 
profound anti-climax given the grand design of his guest. He's reduced to 
making a documentary about the horses, capturing them on film. "Central Asia 
had taught me to recognize personal limits and accept them," he says. "This is 
a hard lesson for a male." 
</P>
<P>
 One wishes that more of Sacred Horses had been about such lessons. In a 
concluding section, the author admits to feeling "a certain dissatisfaction 
with my travels in Turkmenistan," and the reader nods in agreement. There's too 
much distance between Maslow and the foreign culture he's exploring. While he 
surely treasures Akhal-Tekes and all that they represent, his wayward approach 
to them is muddled. Still, he is a gifted, intelligent, knowledgeable writer, 
and those who care about horses and horsemanship will find much to savor here.

RICHARD EDER: THE NEW OPENNESS; COLORED PEOPLE: A MEMOIR, BY HENRY LOUIS GATES 
JR. (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22; 216 PP.)  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Henry Louis Gates Jr. applied to Yale in his springtime of militancy in 
1969, he began his personal essay: "My grandfather was colored, my father was 
Negro, and I am black." Now, in a preface to his affecting, beautifully written 
and morally complex memoir, Gates addresses his two daughters: 
</P>
<P>
 "In your lifetimes, I suspect, you will go from being African Americans, to 
'people of color,' to being, once again, 'colored people.' (The linguistic 
trend toward condensation is strong.) I don't mind any of the names myself. But 
I have to confess that I like 'colored' best, maybe because when I hear the 
word, I hear it in my mother's voice and in the sepia tones of my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, a social and cultural historian who is chairman of Harvard's department 
of Afro-American studies, is not choosing politico-linguistic sides but he is 
making a point. It is a singularly open point; throughout his book Gates 
scatters the different racial terms with only seeming casualness. The author, 
along with such writers as Stephen Carter and Cornell West, belongs to a 
current in African-American thinking that might be called "the new openness." 
It does not fall along older left-right lines; it tends to strike a shifting 
center as it considers the ways in which quotas, government redress of economic 
imbalances, racially based politics and the like help and harm the advancement 
of African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no bland center, but an explosive one, based not on denying the 
contradictions but on bringing them into difficult dialogue. The civil rights 
and Black Power movements have accomplished great things, the thought goes; but 
while enlarging one part of black reality, they have -- as revolutions tend to 
do -- denied or constricted another part. In "Colored People" Gates uses not 
abstract arguments but a colorful account of his childhood to explore and 
consider the contradictions. Instead of trying to square the circle, he has 
done what circles are best suited to: put a circus in it. It is a circus of 
memory, by turns entrancing and instructive; and mustering at times an anger 
that any militant would envy. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts, as I mentioned, with his daughters. When they visited the zoo in 
Washington, he nodded to another black man; "Why?" one daughter wanted to know. 
And he begins his circus overture. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should he feel linked to another person because he shares his color? 
"Thirty million Americans are black, and thirty million is a lot of people." He 
resents having his views tactfully canvassed when a Mike Tyson misbehaves. But 
he cannot squelch a special joy in a Jessye Norman, a Toni Morrison, a Nelson 
Mandela and a Joe Louis who, asked what he would have done if Max Schmeling had 
failed to go down for the knockout punch, replied: "I'da run around behind him 
to see what was holdin' him up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be black, to know black, to luxuriate in whatever I might be 
calling blackness at any particular time -- but to do so in order to come out 
the other side, to experience a humanity that is neither colorless nor 
reducible to color." And he can admire those who say they've transcended any 
particular group attachment -- "but I always want to run around behind them to 
see what holds them up." And he has "stopped trying to tell other Negroes how 
to be black." And so: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not Everynegro." He cannot tell the story of urban blacks in the '80s 
and '90s. He was brought up in a strong family in a West Virginia mountain town 
in the '50s and '60s; a place rigorously though peacefully segregated and then 
gradually and not violently integrated. He will tell his story: privileged in 
some ways, hard and combative in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Piedmont was one of three little towns linked by the paper mill that gave them 
jobs. Shabby enough, except for a handful of mansions, it had a glorious 
outdoors of mountains, woods and streams. A quarter of its population was 
black; the rest was mostly Italian or Irish. Each group had its own 
neighborhood; downtown there seemed to be mingling but on special terms. Blacks 
could patronize the luncheonette but only for takeout. They could not own 
property and so they rented their homes. At the mill they were loaders; the 
craft unions excluded them. All these things changed gradually as Gates grew 
up. The first and most important change took place the year before he entered 
school: It was desegregated. 
</P>
<P>
 This meant that at one point Gates' two best friends belonged respectively to 
the groups "whose names ended with 'O' (Italians) and those whose names began 
with 'O' "(Irish). It meant that with his first aptitude test, scoring 487 out 
of 500, he became one of the school's princes -- eventually its valedictorian 
-- and that he was thrown into close friendship, which suffered strains and 
distance as the the years passed, with the school's brightest -- white -- girl. 
It meant that the same society that discriminated against him was also a source 
of support and encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Television showed white faces, though such shows as "Leave It to Beaver" 
provided an image of middle-class ease that a family such as Gates' could 
decide to fight for. When a black figure did appear, it was a neighborhood 
sensation. " 'Colored, colored on Channel Two' you'd hear somebody shout. 
Somebody else would run to the phone while yet another hit the front porch 
telling all the neighbors where to see it," he writes. There was the federal 
backing of integration; grudging under Eisenhower, picking up under Kennedy. 
Something changed, Gates writes; Kennedy put an image of steel on the screen, 
and it was steel for the blacks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying that James Meredith will definitely enter the University of 
Mississippi; and saying it like he believed it (unlike Ike), saying it like the 
big kids said 'It's our turn to play' on the basketball court and walking all 
through as if we weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the memoir is Gates' portrait of his family, and its placement in 
a black society whose strength, richness and self-confidence thrived in the 
darkness of segregation. What oppression doesn't kill it can make stronger. One 
of the reflections that runs through the book suggests how much was lost, along 
with the gains, when integration came. There is a splendid description of the 
annual picnic of the black mill workers; a free and festive occasion that 
wilted when it was assimilated. There are beautifully told passages about the 
black churches, gospel music and hell-raising, and a brilliantly moving 
recollection of old-style funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' mother was a remarkable woman who gave up school to work and send 
several of her brothers to college. She kept her house and two sons 
immaculately turned out, insisted on excellence -- Gates' brother became an 
oral surgeon -- and proper food. "A slab of fatback or a cupful of bacon 
dripping or a couple of ham hocks and a long simmering time were absolutely 
essential to a well-cooked vegetable," Gates writes. She was in demand at 
funerals for her golden-tongued elegies; Gates' father wondered aloud if 
perhaps someone else had been substituted for the corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Sr., a kind, sardonic man, worked as a loader and janitor, but he came 
from a well-to-do light-skinned family. His portrait is intriguing but barely 
sketched in -- young Henry was his mother's boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of their vibrant, segregated black world her message to her sons was that 
they must strive and excel in the white world. She became the first colored 
officer of the PTA; she dressed meticulously for each meeting and spoke out 
sonorously. It was nothing like compliance, as Gates startlingly shows: 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important of all, for me, was that she did not seem to fear white 
people. She simply hated them, hated them all with a passion she seldom 
disclosed." There was fierceness running through her, for all her propriety, 
but it came at a cost. When Gates was 12, his shining mother slipped into a 
depression that was to last the rest of her life. It might have shattered him 
but it didn't. He took up the fierceness, and it runs through his lovely, 
haunting memoir; through its humor, its tenderness, its evocation of a time, a 
place and a society. A Chance to Work Out Your Grief 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Louis Gates's mother was buried in a formal Episcopal ceremony in the 
new integrated cemetery. In "Colored People" he writes:  
</P>
<P>
 I hate that cemetery. Not because of the lack of aesthetic appeal; not because 
it's integrated; but because . . . the Power isn't there. When you go up on 
Radical Hill, up past where Sherry Lewis used to live, enter the gate, and take 
the dusty road to the colored cemetery -- now, that's a cemetery . All the 
markers have different shapes, and the graves are laid out whopper-jawed . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is where the old souls come to hide, resting till the Day of the Lord. 
Falling out over graves, like I once saw Mr. Bootsie do when I was a boy, 
listening to Mama perform her eulogy. Please, please -- just one more look, 
don't take her yet, just one more look, was all he said, shouting and whooping 
and hollering and falling out all over his mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
 You had a chance in a colored funeral. You had a chance to work out your 
grief. You didn't have to be in a hurry with it, either. You could touch it, 
play with it, and talk to it, letting it work itself up in its own good time . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 At Mama's funeral . . . I wanted the church to be hot, with the windows 
closed, those paper-colored funeral home fans spreading the steam rather than 
cooling things down. I wanted starched collars to wilt and straightened hair to 
kink up and "go back." . . . I wanted her to know that I had tried and that I 
loved her like life itself, and that I would miss her now that she was gone. I 
wanted to be sad in that dark, holy place, and I wanted that sadness to last.

HUMBLE TO THE CORE; I. ASIMOV: A MEMOIR, BY ISAAC ASIMOV (DOUBLEDAY: $25; 562 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Swanwick, Michael Swanwick won the Nebula Award in 1992 for his 
science fiction novel, Stations of the Tide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isaac Asimov was by anyone's standards a bit of an eccentric. His fiction 
chronicled the fate of galaxies. Yet he had fantasies of owning a subway 
newsstand and living within it. He was a rationalist and yet deathly afraid of 
air travel. The memory of a stray cat he had to chloroform in college, and the 
guilt, haunted him all his life. His idea of a good time was to sit in a 
windowless room and write all day. He insisted that he was self-centered. Yet 
the sole virtue he would claim for himself as a writer was that he was 
prolific. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Russia, Asimov was brought to Brooklyn by his parents at age 4. As a 
child he soon realized that his prodigious intellect set him apart. He only had 
to hear a fact once to know it forever. At age 5 he taught himself to read. He 
began writing at 11 and by 15 had graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But then his brilliant promise began to sour. In college he found himself only 
one bright student among many. His grades slipped into mediocrity. He married, 
not happily. World War II interrupted his education (he was by his account a 
less-than-competent researcher for the Navy.) When he returned, he found that 
the nature of chemistry had changed beyond his understanding. He had to 
struggle to obtain his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949 he reached nadir. He had a family to support, a degree that nobody 
wanted, a poor record as a researcher and he could not find a job. He was, in 
his own estimation, an abject failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, though he did not know it then, his fortune was already made. 
Eleven years before, as a brash 18-year-old, he had walked into the office of 
John W. Campbell, editor of "Astounding" and a man who saw untapped potential 
in the despised genre of science fiction. In Asimov, a fiendishly bright 
youngster who read omnivorously and loved 19th-Century novels to the near 
exclusion of contemporary literature, he found the precise tool for his 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Campbell's tutelage, Asimov produced works of enormous importance to the 
evolution of the genre. He wrote "Nightfall," an archetypal tale of a planet 
whose orbital mechanics brought nightfall only once every thousand years, 
whereupon society collapsed in violence and madness. He wrote the ingeniously 
logical robot stories with their famous Three Laws of Robotics. Most of all, he 
wrote the "Foundation" trilogy, about the fall of a galactic empire and the 
millennium-long struggle to shorten the Dark Ages through the science of 
"psychohistory." 
</P>
<P>
 When Asimov first met Campbell, science fiction was a pulp genre distinguished 
largely by the wretched quality of its prose. Eleven years later, though 
recognition lagged, science fiction was no longer an inferior version of "real" 
literature. It was something different, a separate literary line with aims and 
virtues that more respectable literature lacked. The callow young Asimov would 
have been perfectly willing to write pulp. Campbell raised his sights and gave 
him a task worthy his talents. Together they made a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to Asimov that he might someday make a living as a writer, 
however. In those 11 amazing years, he had earned just $7,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a fan of his fiction, he obtained a position at Boston University. 
There, he made two discoveries that were to change his life. The first was that 
he was a natural-born speaker, a man who could rouse a roomful of bored 
undergrads to laughter and applause. The second was that he had an astounding 
facility with nonfiction. He could explain anything to anybody and make it 
entertaining. Either talent was enough to earn him a living. Together, they 
made him famous. 
</P>
<P>
 I was once at a Science Fiction Writers of America banquet where the keynote 
speaker, displaying an alarming ignorance of her audience, began by praising 
"Star Trek" and then wasted several hours on New Age pseudoscience. Asimov was 
scheduled to speak second. He got up before a hostile and resentful audience 
and made a beautifully timed joke about his own vanity. Everyone laughed. He 
then spoke for three witty minutes and sat down. The applause was thunderous. 
The evening was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a glorious demonstration of skill. And it was -- the good doctor's 
protestations to the contrary -- not the act of a vain man. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Asimov undervalued himself. In "I. Asimov" he wrote that 
"Nightfall" was not his idea, that it was poorly written, that he didn't think 
it was a very good story, but that if it was a good story then he was writing 
over his head. One of the most popular writers in science fiction, he refrained 
from writing novels for 15 years, convinced the times had passed him by. Then, 
when "The Gods Themselves" won both acclaim and awards, it was another 10 years 
before he could be persuaded to try again. Editors would coax work from him by 
appealing to his strong sense of loyalty. He invariably claimed that he'd 
responded to flattery. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps what Asimov mistook for conceit was gregariousness. He took a child's 
delight in praise. When Doubleday held a party to celebrate the 40th 
anniversary of his first book, an untimely heart attack threatened to keep him 
away. He contrived to escape the hospital and presided over the affair from a 
wheelchair. Still, it's telling how little of the praise lavished on him over 
the decades he cared to include in his memoirs, and how much he had for others. 
"I shall never cease marveling," he wrote, "over my good fortune in meeting so 
many wonderful people in the course of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 A brilliant mind, great ambition, and early failure is a sure recipe for a 
curmudgeon. And what a curmudgeon Asimov could have been! His wit and skill at 
repartee were legendary. But he (consciously, I suspect) chose to go the other 
way -- toward friendship, loyalty, warmth and affection. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quick to forgive, and ready to see the best in anyone. He hated bigotry 
in all forms. He loved to laugh and joke and sing in public. He never forgot a 
favor. He doted on his second-and-final wife, Janet, and on his daughter Robyn. 
He seems to have been a genuinely nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asimov believed that the source of his success as a science writer was that he 
was a generalist, someone who knew a considerable amount about almost 
everything. But I think his respect for people of all stripes was equally 
important. In all his hundreds of books, he never condescended to his readers. 
He liked them. They were his friends, and he knew it, and so did they. 
</P>
<P>
 "I. Asimov" is organized in rough chronological order, by topic, which makes 
it particularly well suited for those who like to dip in and out of a book. It 
includes a complete listing of his many novels, collections, anthologies and 
volumes of nonfiction. And it is quintessential Asimov. Those who enjoyed his 
chatty, lucid and intelligent style elsewhere can buy this book with total 
confidence. Those who valued his company when he was alive can find solace here 
and the comfort of the one thing he had which he knew was worth leaving to his 
friends, both met and unmet -- his words.

'MOMMIES' IN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE WILLENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day that I'm to interview Marilyn Kentz and Caryl Kristensen -- "The 
Mommies" -- turns out to be a perfect one. Like a lot of real-life mommies, I 
often feel my life is a sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9:15 a.m. I have accidentally tossed my car keys into the garbage can and 
am on my hands and knees when the mommies arrive. I challenge these real-life 
cul de sac neighbors-turned stand-up comics-turned TV stars to find the humor 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
 They saunter into my house and run smack into my daughter's "whoopsie daisy" 
doll, a life-size newborn whose bloodcurdling scream and twisting head occur 
simultaneously. "My god, it's the Exorcist meets Winnie Mandela," roars 
Kristensen upon seeing my politically correct choice. "Can we use her for an 
episode?" asks Kentz. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm starting to warm up, especially when they instinctively start tidying up. 
I tell the mommies about the previous night when both my children had 
unexpectedly fallen asleep by 8. I was wild with elation. Should I bathe? Watch 
a video? Read? Eat a pint of ice cream? By 10, I was exhausted with indecision 
and secretly hoping I might hear a childish cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold, they were doing an episode called "Home Alone" on just such an 
incident. "We're trying to create a realistic picture of all the emotions a 
mother goes through in a day," says Kristensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers still may be jarred by the mommies' obviously limited acting ability, 
not unlike Ms. Arnold when she started. But their humor and well-earned 
wrinkles hit home. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving mine, they oooh, ahh and cuddle with my baby who's being bathed in the

BOULEVARD DU MONTPARNASSE, BY MARY JO SALTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, in a doorway in Paris, I saw 
</P>
<P>
 the most beautiful couple in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 They were each the single most beautiful thing in the 
</P>
<P>
 world. 
</P>
<P>
 She would have been sixteen, perhaps; he twenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Their skin was the same shade of black: like a shiny 
</P>
<P>
 Steinway. 
</P>
<P>
 And they stood there like the four-legged instrument 
</P>
<P>
 of a passion so grand one could barely imagine them 
</P>
<P>
 ever working, or eating, or reading a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Even they could hardly believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hands gripped his belt loops, as they found each 
</P>
<P>
 other's eyes, 
</P>
<P>
 because beauty like this must be held onto, 
</P>
<P>
 could easily run away on the power 
</P>
<P>
 of his long, lean thighs; or the tiny feet of her laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought: now I will write a poem, 
</P>
<P>
 set in a doorway on the Boulevard du Montparnasse, 
</P>
<P>
 in which the brutishness of time 
</P>
<P>
 rates only a mention; I will say simply 
</P>
<P>
 that if either one should ever love another, 
</P>
<P>
 a greater beauty shall not be the cause. 
</P>

 CHILDREN FIRST: What Our Society Must Do -- and Is Not Doing -- For Our 
Children Today by Penelope Leach. (Knopf: $22; 303 pp.) Penelope Leach is the 
British Dr. Spock; armed with her classic "Your Baby & Child," or more 
recently, "Babyhood," I can say with some confidence that it is possible to 
live through your baby's first year. But while the tone of these first books is 
purposely calming and forgiving, "Children First" is a call to action, 
demanding first that readers consider the inevitable trade-offs they are making 
in raising their children, and secondly, the failure of most societies (with 
the exception of Sweden) to prioritize or even recognize the interests of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 On another level, it is an appeal as well for children's dignity and their 
basic rights; not to be neglected or beaten or otherwise denied their 
childhood. Her feelings about day care are tempered only somewhat (full time is 
just not good for infants, or, for that matter, 2- and 3-year-olds), her 
suggestions for national policy changes, under the shadow of Sweden's 18-month 
leave, 6-hour workday until your child's eighth birthday, and other universal 
legal entitlement's are equally hard-hitting. Her conclusion that we simply do 
not value parenthood enough should keep us awake at night.

 THE STATE OF THE WORLD'S CHILDREN 1994 United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) 
(Oxford University Press: $8; 87 pp.) Now that the term "National Security" has 
been broadened to include natural resources and our children's future, this 
report, published annually, is an even more integral piece of the puzzle (along 
with the "State of the World" report on the environment, published annually by 
World Watch in Washington). You will not drown in overwhelmingly depressing 
statistics; you do not have to read with one hand covering your checkbook. Just 
consider it background, context-creating information for the news you read 
everyday. The producers of this year's report have bent over backward to give 
equal time to progress made on several fronts: significant reduction in the 
five major child-killing diseases; pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, tetanus and 
whooping cough; polio is close to being eradicated; iodine deficiency, a 
leading cause of mental retardation, could soon be brought to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bad news, it simply becomes increasingly embarrassing that we are 
not giving the resources needed to put an end to diseases like diarrhea, which 
kills 1.5 million children each year and can be cured with a packet of oral 
rehydration salts. Another 1.5 million children have been killed over the last 
10 years in armed conflicts, with 4 million disabled, maimed or brain damaged. 
This year's report focuses on the deepening effects of poverty, population 
growth and environmental degradation on the developing world (the PPE spiral), 
suggesting ways to meet minimum human needs, to fight poverty, to encourage 
family planning, and to create environmentally sustainable growth. The question 
is no longer whether meeting these needs is possible (this report and others 
give many examples of very poor countries, like Bangladesh, where 80% of the 
rural residents now have access to safe drinking water), the problem is making 
these issues political priorities.

 THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS: A Letter to My Children and Yours by Marian Wright 
Edelman (Beacon: $15; 121 pp.) This is a special second edition, with a new 
preface by the author, of a book that was, and actually deserves to be, on the 
best seller list.It's about as straightforward an effort to make a personal 
experience useful to others as you're likely to find, and it has that purity of 
heart, that unconditional love in its delivery that betrays at least one of its 
author's identities: Mother. Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund, 
and one of this country's leading advocates of children's rights, finds many 
reasons to be hopeful in her new preface: the Family and Medical Leave Act, a 
new federal policy to insure free immunization to every uninsured child, and a 
Family Preservation Act designed to prevent child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this book are Edelman's 25 lessons for life, and the final 
section is an appeal for the future of our children, containing the now-famous 
quote: "Welfare queens can't hold a candle to corporate kings in raiding the 
public purse." Edelman has three sons, one of whom, Jonah, wrote the foreword, 
and I suppose I would add another measure of success to Edelman's list, namely, 
if your own children love you this much and are this proud of you, you've done 
something right.

 I enjoyed reading your articles on secretaries and have seen most of the shows 
you highlighted (TV Times, April 24).But I do have one bone to pick with you. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third paragraph of the story you say, "In honor of National Secretaries 
Day on Wednesday ..." We celebrate Professional Secretaries Week the last full 
week in April and Professional Secretaries Day on Wednesday of that week. This 
is all because of Professional Secretaries International, founded in 1942.

 James Michener and James Clavell do have the same first names, and they both

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1985 Commando (KTTV Sunday at 5 p.m.), a sleek, slam-bang adventure 
fantasy, offers an array of heroic exploits by an avenging American hunk, 
played in this instance by Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former U.S. strike leader 
whose 11-year-old daughter (Alyssa Milano) is kidnaped by a deposed South 
American dictator. Directed with jolting efficiency by Mark Lester. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Academy (KCOP Sunday at 5 p.m.) has spawned a seemingly endless string 
of sequels, each usually worse than the last, making it hard to remember how 
funny the 1984 original was. A big-city police department receives a mandate to 
broaden its standards of admission, resulting in a wide range of types turning 
up to wreak havoc during training at the academy. Leader of the pack is Steve 
Guttenberg, a parking lot attendant who survives the course in spite of 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1991 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (CBS Sunday at 8 p.m.) doesn't 
compare with the 1938 Errol Flynn version, it is an enjoyable mishmash, 
directed good-naturedly by Kevin Reynolds and starring a likable but-all-too 
American Kevin Costner (who's upstaged by Alan Rickman's deliciously evil 
Sheriff of Nottingham). 
</P>
<P>
 As a director, Danny De Vito, in the 1987 Throw Momma from the Train (KTLA 
Sunday at 8 p.m.) is as explosive as he is an actor in this raucous, hilarious 
1987 takeoff on Alfred Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train." With Billy Crystal 
and Anne Ramsey as Momma. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, Susan Sarandon's Louise and Geena Davis' Thelma grabbed 
audiences much like Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford's Sundance 
Kid in the dynamic 1991 Thelma & Louise (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a female 
buddy-road movie written by Callie Khouri and directed by Ridley Scott. There's 
much that's ambivalent, contrived and even dubious about this contemporary 
feminist adventure fable, but's it's so highly charged and stunningly acted 
that it's involving and vastly entertaining anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Verhoeven's 1987 RoboCop (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.) is ferocious 
comic-book fare, starring Peter Weller as a slaughtered Detroit cop whose head 
and heart are mounted in a robot to create the ultimate crime-stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the Law (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.), the 1988 cop thriller that launched 
martial arts star Steven Seagal, is something of a standoff. It's steeped in 
grimy Chicago atmosphere and hard-bitten energy but veers off into action-movie 
cuckoo land filled with the paranoid one-against-a-hundred cliches. Seagal 
plays an ex-Green Beret and CIA trouble-shooter turned Chicago cop, taking on 
all manner of drug-related corruption.

WHEELS OF MISFORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm a professional bicycle mechanic with more than 20 years in the trade. 
However innocently the mountain biking phenomenon may have started, I'm here to 
report that it has become just one more destructive, wasteful toys-and-money 
game, featuring a lot of overblown "high technology" being slung around by a 
bunch of feckless white guys ("The Pedal Wars," by Jenifer Warren, April 10). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy with the mountain bike cause. I have watched 
it grow from its inception, and from an industry insider's vantage point it 
still looks like an invasion of barbarians to me. Bicycles should be, as we 
used to say, part of the solution, not part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL COMPTON 
</P>

<P>
 "Pedal Wars" made one gaffe: Tensions in Southern California between hiker, 
equestrian and biker are not easing -- they are accelerating. As a board member 
of the Santa Monica Mountains Trails Council for seven years, I have watched 
while biking groups have tried to teach safety rules. But the message hasn't 
gotten through. Hikers and equestrians take their lives in their hands when 
they use a trail frequented by bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren notes that compromises are being struck. But the more the trails 
council tries to give bikers access to trails, the less these trails can be 
safely used by hikers. Once bikers start using a trail, it becomes impossible 
for anyone else to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the bikers have the fire roads and other four-track trails. There are 
many, many miles of them to use for their adrenaline rush. Just give me back my 
silent, sylvan trails, where I can be close to nature without being scared out 
of my wits. 
</P>

 Five years ago a hike in the San Gabriel Mountains was an effective antidote 
to the stresses of our mechanized urban culture. Nowadays, a hike on all but 
the most remote trails is invariably a nerve-shattering experience from which 
one returns feeling emotionally exhausted. Mountain biking provides thrills, 
all right -- nothing can compare with the adrenaline rush of having to dodge 
four or five mountain bikes careening around a blind turn. When we can no 
longer take a simple walk in the woods without having to worry about getting 
run over, our society has become that much more impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID LEMON 
</P>

<P>
 "Pedal Wars" is a prime example of how we are slowly but deliberately 
destroying the very environment we are trying to embrace. We do this by first 
building a simple hiking trail. Then equestrians use it to ride horses. 
Climbers, skiers, parasailors, hunters, fishermen and other outdoor enthusiasts 
see it as "access" to pursue their outdoor activities. What finally ends up 
happening is that more trails are built to satisfy the needs of all. This 
defeats the original purpose, which was to restrict human impact on the outdoor 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedal wars will continue to exist as long as we have trails. More trails may 
end one skirmish, but soon some other specialized group will want access and 
another war will begin. So we need to make what trails we have accessible for 
all to use, or abolish them. I suggest the latter. 
</P>

 Warren should see the miserable conditions that local hikers endure in 
Southern California due to the increasing hordes of bicyclists who clog 
mountain fire roads and trails. Any "compromise" is at the expense of hikers, 
who are repeatedly traumatized by incessant pressure from speeding mountain 
bikers. Curtailing these abusers with speed limits, ranger patrols, closure 
signs and radar will not work in our immense areas. At the very least, bike 
riders should be banned from all single-track trails.

 I have been hiking since I was 8 years old. When I was a child I had a problem 
with motorcycles and a fear of being run over by them. Now I have to deal with 
mountain bikes. I hike to let go of stress and adrenaline that build up in 
daily life. If the trails are full of adrenaline-junkie mountain bikers, how 
will I accomplish this? But I do think some sort of compromise should be 
reached. This is America, after all, and the bicyclists should have a place to 
ride, too.

 The problems for mountain bikers in Orange County may not be as great as they 
are for those who ride Mt. Tamalpais, but loss of trail access in county and 
state parks is a serious problem for us. The most recent loss is a wonderful 
trail at Whiting Ranch, a beautiful county park near El Toro. As usual, rangers 
and park officials are arguing that safety is their concern. However, their 
action is disproportionate to the accidents that have occurred. Officials do 
not close access to city streets when a road cyclist is injured or close parks 
to equestrians if they fall off their horses. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to preserve access to the few remaining trails is for mountain 
bikers to respect other users, help maintain and repair trails and become 
politically active. Mountain bikers in Orange County who want to become more 
involved can call Concerned Cyclists of Orange County, also known as SHARE, at 
(714) 22-3334.

 MARY CASSATT: A Life by Nancy Mowll Mathews (Villard: $28; 383 pp.) She was a 
master of the tender touch; in her paintings of mothers and children the hand 
on the cheek or the tiny arms around the neck or the kiss on the shoulder are 
serene and voluptuous.It is this touch that one author, writing in the journal 
Camera Work in the early 1900s, said "endows all her figures with the energy of 
life." In 1866, at age 21, Cassatt fled her well-bred and well-heeled 
Pennsylvania family to paint and study painting in Paris. A stipend from her 
parents only enhanced her determination to focus on painting exclusively, to 
travel to the French countryside, to paint what she wanted (peasants and local 
people), to reject fashionable trends in painting (including her initial 
rejection of Impressionism), and to sneer at the tyranny of the Paris Salon. 
After some success and some rejection, and a brief interval of trying to live 
again in Pennsylvania, Cassatt returned to Europe, this time to Italy, where 
her career and her reputation were established. The goal of the artist, she 
wrote, is to "exhibit and sell, to achieve fame and fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassatt did not not marry; indeed, it appears from this biography that the 
closest she came to a lasting romantic relationship was the influence Degas had 
on her painting. She did not have children but spent a great deal of time with 
her brothers' children (much of it painting them). We are left still curious 
about this part of Cassatt's life, but in the end Mathews leaves us with a 
clear understanding of Cassatt's evolution as a painter, of her independence 
and determination. The paintings leave little doubt that she experienced the 
joys of motherhood.

 THE GODS OF GREECE by Arianna Huffington (Atlantic Monthly Press: $35; 144 
pp.). Arianna Huffington, who wrote the text for "The Gods of Greece," is 
herself Greek, and this handsome book contains her illuminating interpretations 
of the ancient deities of her homeland.As a child, the French artist Francoise 
Gilot was similarly intrigued by the Greek myths, and this book reproduces 70 
stunning drawings, paintings and prints inspired by them. All aim at conveying 
the essence behind familiar masks, rather than at mere physical description. 
"Alone by the Sea," for instance (see above), depicts Artemis, goddess of the 
wild. A tree and a cliff tower over her, and the sea stretches beyond her to 
the horizon, reducing her featureless face and distant figure to a scale 
appropriate to someone who lives at one with nature. But her red gown and her 
relaxed yet dynamic pose identify her as a force to be reckoned with.

 The recognition that emerges from this remarkable collaboration is that the 
Greek pantheon forms a sophisticated psychological system, one perfected 
centuries before the birth of Christ, one that continues to offer important 
insights into the complex nature of a human being and his or her proper 
relation to the cosmos. Lisa Alther

<P>
 THE FOURTH INSTINCT: The Call of the Soul by Arianna Huffington (Simon & 
Schuster: $22; 269 pp.) The first instinct in Arianna Huffington's thoughtfully 
conceived worldview is the instinct to grow -- its instrument is the senses; 
the second instinct is the need for self expression, the instrument is dialect; 
the third instinct is the sexual drive, its instrument is intuition; and the 
fourth instinct is love of others and the search for meaning outside oneself -- 
its instrument is knowledge and the ability to identify with another. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this book, based on Huffington's own experiences (which range wildly 
from birth and childhood in Greece, to a rather fancy British education, to the 
dining rooms of New York society, to Washington), is dedicated to examples of 
places where the fourth instinct makes itself heard, as well as those parts of 
a modern life from which it is conspicuously absent. American culture in 
general looks perilously thin as far as the fourth instinct is concerned; the 
rubble heaps of science, religion, art, death and community are all picked over 
for shards of the fourth instinct. Hopeful phrases like "under the reign of the 
fourth instinct," and "in the next millennium" are meant to make us feel that 
civilization can and is evolving to a point that honors and nurtures our 
ability to love and have compassion for others. But as a concept, laid out in 
this way, the fourth instinct remains strangely unexplained and unintegrated, 
kind of like God.

FROM PHILLY TO BEL-AIR AND BACK AGAIN

 "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" is going home to Philly. 
</P>
<P>
 How long he'll stay is up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're a fan of NBC's popular Monday night sitcom starring Will Smith 
(a.k.a. Grammy-winning rap music artist Fresh Prince and Will on the show), you 
know it's a big deal why he left home in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The story has been played out in the show's opening theme for four seasons: 
Will got into a hassle in a basketball game with some street tough and his mom 
protectively whisked him off to live with his rich uncle in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's going back. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 23 episode, "The Philadelphia Story," is the finale to what promises 
to be a major month for "Fresh Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 It all begins Monday with a show featuring special guest star Ben Vereen as 
the father who walked out on Will and his mom. It's a half-hour that Smith, 25, 
calls "the most powerful 'Fresh Prince' ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his home in Los Angeles, Smith -- who won raves for his starring 
role in last year's film version of "Six Degrees of Separation" -- says it was 
the first real opportunity to test himself since the movie. "I discovered a new 
level of depth in my acting ability," says Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a dry eye in the house at the end of this show." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept, like many others on "Fresh Prince," began with Smith, who says 
Vereen's warm persona made him the perfect choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you just like him," says Smith. "I thought that was very important 
to see in the character who plays Will's father, and to be able to see where 
Will got it from. And then, also, because he's been gone for 15 years. In order 
for the audience not to hate him for having done what he did to Will, I thought 
that he really needed to be a character who was someone you could listen to ... 
before you passed judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Will's father, a trucker, returns, inviting his son along on a 
cross-country trip, by the end of the episode he has left his son behind -- 
disappointed yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting commentary about fatherhood," says Smith, explaining that 
for all intents and purposes, Uncle Phil (James Avery) is Will's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a really, really warm story," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week involves a bit more traditional sitcom fun as Donald Trump 
and Marla Maples-Trump stop by after Uncle Phil and Aunt Vivian (Daphne Maxwell 
Reid) put their house up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith reports back that "Marla was great" but that "Don could use a little 
work." Smith had originally hoped to have "Beverly Hills, 90210" producer Aaron 
Spelling and his family stop by, too, because there has been a running joke on 
"Fresh Prince" about the Spellings' living next door. But the Spellings weren't 
available.) 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, though, it's the return trip to Philadelphia that's most likely 
to be the freshest "Fresh Prince" ever. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Will's cousins Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) and 
Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) resist. "Yuck, Philadelphia," says Ashley, when the 
idea of a family trip is brought up. "We might as well be staying in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as you might expect, Will's homecoming isn't immediately ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, he finds out -- because he skipped town rather than fight -- 
that the locals have named a chicken sandwich after him. So Will decides to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gotta get my rep back," Smith explains. "And the only way I can get my rep 
back is to beat up the guy who beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
 The season will end and begin with the show still set in Philly, which Smith 
gives a winking, 50-50 chance of staying put. (But don't count on it.)

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; NOW ENTERING 'WEINERVILLE' ON 
NICKELODEON, WHERE THE PUPPETS ARE PEOPLE TOO

 Sticking his head through a hole in a wall has worked out quite nicely for 
comedian and performance artist Marc Weiner. Now in its second season, 
Nickelodeon Weinerville continues to bring Weiner's half-man/half-puppet 
learning adventures to the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner, whose cartoonish sets have openings for a human head and a puppet 
body, has turned a onetime gag into skits that he says "entertain, while 
getting a message in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Weinerville include Dottie, the town's popular mayor; Boney, the 
disgruntled dinosaur; Baby Jeffrey, every mother's nightmare, and Socko, the 
tough guy. All the characters are played by Weiner, who occasionally has an 
audience member join in. The show is shot live at the Nickelodeon studios near 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Several celebrities will be joining Weiner this season, including Dr. Joyce 
Brothers, Melissa Joan Hart ("Clarissa Explains It All"), Mary Hart, John Tesh 
and Harry Smith. "My goal is to get very celebrity-'Weinerized,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Past shows have dealt with teaching kids about safety, the political system, 
environmental issues, Hollywood and even dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nickelodeon Weinerville" airs weekdays at 3:30-4 p.m. and Sundays 2-3 p.m. on 
Nickelodeon.  
</P>
<P>
 Conservation is a serious message to television's Jack Hanna, but animals' 
innate ebullience lends a light side to his Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures, now 
in its second season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's ever set up," he says from his office at the Columbus Zoo in Ohio, 
where he's director. "On last week's show, 'Water Babies,' there's a point 
where a whale blew water all over my face and it was really funny. You can't 
script an animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, whose "ZooLife" ran for two years in syndication, has been the director 
of the Columbus Zoo for 16 years. Education and entertainment go hand-in-hand 
for him. Summing up the show he says, "We try and teach the conservation 
message in an entertaining way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Adventures" expands the original "ZooLife" format, which was set exclusively 
in zoos and featured Hanna interacting with the animals. "Adventures" will 
travel throughout the world this season with planned excursions to Africa, 
Australia, the Guatemalan rain forest and the Galapagos Islands. Hannah also 
gets a bit closer to home in the United States, with visits to Alaska, Florida 
and the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show's a way to point out that because of people, animals have problems," 
he says. "What I'm trying to do is show how we can alleviate that; it's hard to 
do in a fun way, but the animals help us out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures" airs Saturday at noon on KABC. For ages 4 and 
up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's special "Mother and Child: A Mother's Day Celebration" explores the 
bond between mother and child from conception through the early years. The 
Learning Channel airs The Mystery of Birth, Cesarean Section and Babywatching 
(9 a.m. to noon, and noon to 3 p.m.). For parents.  
</P>
<P>

 A super hero will be hangin' with the homeboys this week as The New Adventures 
of Captain Planet (Friday 6:30-7 p.m. TNT, 7-7:30 p.m. TBS, 7:30-8 p.m. Cartoon 
Network; Saturday 6:30-7 a.m. KTLA) addresses issues of today's kids and gang 
violence. " 'Teers in the Hood" focuses on events at an inner-city school after 
a teacher is shot during a gang war. The Planeteers go undercover and back to 
school to infiltrate the gangs and catch the criminal. Infused are the civil 
rights messages of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Neville Brothers' song 
tribute to Rosa Parks, "Sister Rosa." For ages 4 to 12.

 START A GARDEN edited by Mary Yee (Chronicle Books: $9.95; 111 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). The arrival of spring inspires even urban 
residents to get back to the soil, and this colorful installment in Chronicle's 
"Do It!" series offers simple instructions for planting flowers, herbs and 
vegetables. Yee sensibly sticks to easy-to-grow plants: People who want to 
transform the back yard into a mini-Xanadu can consult more technical volumes. 
The small format makes the book easy to slip into a pocket during a gardening 
session or a trip to a the nursery.

 It was gratifying to see the article by Kathleen Maloney on GO, the strategic 
board game (Palm Latitudes, April 10).It was a little misleading, however, to 
indicate that only rocket engineers and professors can enjoy the occasional 
game of GO. It is for everyone who likes the challenge of complex board games, 
and players come from all walks of life. As in any game or sport, it may not be 
the most intelligent who wins, but the one who works and plays hardest to be a 
winner.

 HER OWN PLACE by Dori Sanders (Fawcett: $9; 243 pp.). Sanders' well-crafted 
novel depicts the circumscribed world of Mae Lee Barnes, a black woman in rural 
South Carolina whose life spans much of the 20th Century.Barnes embodies her 
own vision of family values: After her husband abandons her, she works hard to 
provide for herself and her five children. A perfectionist, she expects her 
children to meet the rigorous standards she sets for herself, complaining that 
one daughter has been "spreading layers of makeup on her face, as if she were 
competing with a seven-layer pineapple cake." But Barnes also learns to accept 
the many changes she witnesses in a warm, humane portrait that never slips into 
treacly self-righteousness.

 DUTCH MODERNE: Graphic Art From De Stijl to Deco by Steven Heller & Louise 
Fili (Chronicle Books: $16.95; 132 pp., paperback original). Heller's 
attractive survey of graphic design between the wars continues with this 
examination of Dutch logos, posters, advertisements and magazine covers. The 
tension between the adherents of the more eclectic, decorative Wendigen style 
and the more formal De Stijl (the style) produced a strikingly diverse body of 
work. Although equally elegant, many of these designs appear less angular than 
their American or French counterparts.

 THINKING OUT LOUD by Anna Quindlen (Fawcett: $12; 287 pp.). In this collection 
of her columns, the Pulitzer Prize-winning political commentator furiously 
defends Anita Hill, castigates the Ancient Order of Hibernians and others who 
seek to limit the civil rights of groups to which they don't belong and 
dismisses Clarence Thomas' ingenuous statement that he never discussed the most 
pressing legal issue of his day.Although a fervent defender of abortion rights, 
Quindlen acknowledges other points of view, concluding: "In short, there are 
many talking points. It is simply that we have not talked. We have taken 
stands, and stood." The intelligence of most her columns makes it all the more 
disappointing when she stoops to Erma Bombeck-esque banalities about how men 
would starve without women showing them how to defrost dinner.

THE CRIME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's about time someone exploded the crime statistics myth as Katherine Dunn 
did in "Crime and Embellishment" (April 10). 
</P>
<P>
 During my tenure as a staff member of the Criminal Justice Committee in the 
state Assembly during the early '80s, politicians were also attempting to 
inflate crime numbers for partisan advantage. This was in the face of experts 
testifying that the only reliable crime statistic was the homicide rate -- 
because you could actually count the bodies. The fact is that the reporting 
system for these statistics is so flaky that any group can "prove" just about 
any point that serves its interests. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dunn is trying to open our eyes to something we just don't want to see. Tell 
your representatives in Congress that you want a study done on Surgeon General 
Joycelyn Elders' bold yet practical suggestion that drugs be legalized as a 
first step in regaining safety in our communities. Pull the plug on the 
profits, and you will see the scum who allow innocent people's blood to be 
spilled in the name of greed go down the drain.

 In a society where many are crying "Wolf!" Dunn's piece was a calming

Los Angeles is truly one of the best cities in the world.

 I have lived in Koreatown for 10 years now, and 20 years before that in 
Manhattan, on the Upper West Side, which Time magazine once described as a 
"high-crime interracial neighborhood," and I never had reason to think my 
neighbors were dangerous. On the contrary, I, like Dunn, am amazed that the 
majority of Americans, in spite of their crowded, frustrating city lives, do 
not kill each other. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember a professor in college who reminded us that "crime statistics" 
always go up at budget time, and Dunn's research supports that. Fear of each 
other is an easy way for government to make spies of us all.

 Dunn's article makes one wonder what never-never land she inhabits. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely it's not the world where drugs are pushed openly in schoolyards and on 
residential streets. Surely it's not where cars are stolen and homes 
burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
 The world my friends and I live in is a place where one does not venture out 
after dark and where one learns to be wary of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 I, too, have learned that "statistics" lend themselves to be bent to meet 
one's need.

 I have worked in the field of adolescent care for the past 25 years. When I 
first started, kids who came to placement facilities were sent because they 
took hubcaps and the occasional car. Let me now describe the kind of student 
that we deal with today. They have been abandoned, abused and sexually 
molested. Unlike the children of decades ago, they do not fight with their 
fists. They fight with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not believe the research done by Victor E. Kappeler, Gary W. Potter and 
Mark Blumberg for "The Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice" that was cited 
in Dunn's piece. I believe what I see. What I see are more and more angry, 
sociopathic kids who will do anything. The research may show that there is no 
formidable increase in violent crime, but does it take into account the random 
nature of these acts?

 I have just returned from an intense three-week tour of Southeast Asia and I 
was fascinated by the incredible insight in James Fallows' article ("Boom Times 
in Bangkok," April 10).It should be required reading for Warren Christopher and 
others running the State Department. Asia is indeed in the dynamic phase of its 
historical evolution. Given its boiling, restless entrepreneurial energy, the 
next century will indeed be an Asian one.

 SUNDANCE: The Robert Sundance Story by Robert Sundance with Marc Gaede (Chaco 
Press: $12.95; 300 pp., paperback original) and CRAZYWATER: Native Voices on 
Addiction and Recovery by Brian Maracle (Penguin: $10.95; 285 pp.). Alcohol may 
well have caused the deaths of more Native Americans than all the diseases 
European settlers brought to North America. Robert Sundance, a member of the 
Lakota Sioux tribe, gained fame and notoriety from the suit he brought against 
the Los Angeles Police Department that lead to reforms in the treatment of 
public inebriates. His gritty autobiography discusses the preparations for his 
case and includes horribly vivid descriptions of the DTs. It's easy to mourn 
the loss of this obviously intelligent man to booze, but Sundance's accounts of 
his casual participation in theft, assault and gang rape make it difficult to 
accept his portrayal of himself as both a hero and a victim. Maracle spoke to 
dozens of members of various Canadian tribes about alcohol and addiction to 
collect these unhappy stories of abuse, injury, destruction and murder. He 
concludes his study with a call for Native Americans to stem the crisis of 
substance abuse: "The ultimate resolution of native alcoholism will require a 
combination of spiritual, cultural, social, economic and political action. In a 
sense, it means that we, as native people, have to become reborn."

THREE ON THE TOWN: OFF THE SAME BOAT; SETTLING OUR DIFFERENCES BEGINS WHEN WE 
LEARN WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON

 When I was a child, slavery was rarely discussed in my family circle, and then 
only askance in ominous whispers. Rarely was an explanation given for the 
obvious comminglings of African, Native American and Caucasian blood that 
stained our gene pool. And if a young'un got bold enough to ask the awful 
question "What are we?" some testy elder would snap, "We're American like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 In my South-Central classrooms, slavery eluded the textbooks and the teachers. 
But in the schoolyard, it festered as some horrible, mysterious secret. During 
Saturday matinees of "White Cargo," "Huckleberry Finn" and "Gone With the 
Wind," it evoked embarrassment, frustration and rage. And in the pulpit, it was 
encoded in recountings of Moses leading the children of Israel out of Egypt -- 
the subtext being an impassioned hope that all present-day residuals would be 
left at the banks of the Jordan if nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 But even rarer was the mention of whites in that context. Except for John 
Brown, and an occasional Quaker, the notion of whites being victimized, lynched 
or sold as chattel was largely ignored till the civil rights movement forced 
national debate. Partly to temper black righteous indignation and partly to 
correct the sin of omission, "indentured servitude" was brought to the 
ideological table. 
</P>
<P>
 A footnote in the settlement of North America in the 1700s, indentureds were 
an underclass of orphans, petty criminals, political/religious prisoners and 
sons of poor landowners. Bound by law or by choice to a four- to five-year 
term, they were promised freedom and 50 acres of land (a wee bit more than 40 
acres and a mule). Because of these parallels to slavery, indentured servitude 
sometimes proves to be an effective device for fostering dialogue in 
communities where conflicts between urban blacks and the descendants of the 
immigrant Irish remain at issue. Underneath the cacophony of accents, tangle of 
bloodlines and cultural gridlock, L.A. boasts at least one family that proudly 
claims indentured servitude as part of its heritage and has the document to 
prove it: 
</P>
<P>
 "This Indenture Witnesseth, that Valentine McMenamin, Born March 13th, 1882 by 
and with the consent of Mrs. Catherine McMenamin, His Mother hath put himself, 
and by these present doth voluntarily and of his own free will and accord, put 
himself Apprentice to The John B. Stetson Company of Philadelphia, to learn the 
art, trade and mystery of Felt Hat Finishing and after the manner of an 
Apprentice to serve the said John B. Stetson for and during, and to the full 
end and term of his Apprenticeship, which will be the 8th day of December A.D. 
1903 next ensuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said masters expected Valentine Patrick to not gamble, frequent ale or 
playhouses, to remain unmarried and generally "behave himself as a faithful 
apprentice ought to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Valentine worked the woolen mills as a "blue-arm," so named for 
the dye used to make military uniforms. Then, as an indentured servant, he 
received $2 a week during his 1899-1903 term. And while, according to grandson 
David, he considered the conditions repressive, they provided a trade. At the 
end of his service, he was given a gold watch (now a family heirloom). "Freed," 
he stayed three more years for journeyman's pay. Determined to make his 
fortune, he purchased a six-shooter, "retired" and went west. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine the Hatter established his downtown chapeau emporium at 942 South 
Hill. Business boomed, sustained by May 15, Hat Day (when the swells doffed 
beaver for the straw of summer). But when postwar L.A. went hatless, Val was 
forced to abandon fedoras for cowboy hats. His elite clientele included Roy 
Rogers and Dale Evans, William (Hopalong Cassidy) Boyd and Gene Autry. Val 
never got rich, but before his death in 1951, he managed to put one son, John, 
through Occidental College. Grandson David recalls an introspective man who 
loved to drive up to Angeles Crest just to spend time alone. When asked if 
being descended from an indentured servant had any specific ethnic or cultural 
impact on himself or other family members, David thought it over briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. "I see myself as just an American."

CRIMINAL PURSUITS

 K IS FOR KILLER (Holt, $22.95, 285 pp.) is the 11th in Sue Grafton's hugely 
and deservedly successful alphabetized series about investigator Kinsey 
Millhone of Santa Theresa (Santa Barbara using an alias). The book stormed onto 
best seller lists even before its official publication date, and Grafton is 
already hard at work on the 12th title ("L," for Lethal, Larceny, Liar, Loser, 
Locksmith, Lamentations?). 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of a series always is to sustain freshness and surprise, keeping 
what makes the series work but not simply falling into repetition. Dick Francis 
changes protagonists with almost every outing. Ross Macdonald let Lew Archer 
evolve from something close to the traditional tough private eye to a sensitive 
observer capable of anguish and regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Grafton has obviously opted for the Macdonald mode. Millhone doesn't age much 
but she grows wiser, quieter, more feeling. And she confronts ever more 
ambiguous life situations requiring ever harder moral choices. "The problem," 
Millhone says, "is that so often the law seems pale in its remedies, leaving us 
restless and unfulfilled in our craving for satisfaction. And then what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then what, indeed, and never more so than in the new novel, in which a mother 
begs Millhone to investigate the death of a daughter whose badly decomposed 
body had been found almost a year earlier. The police never came up with even a 
faint clue to the killer, the case not so much closed as abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Millhone quickly finds that the daughter's life was more complex than mother 
knew. She had a part-time office job, but she was also a hooker turned 
high-priced call girl with high-placed clients and a steely-eyed drive to make 
her pile and live as a free and independent woman ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Grafton is an expert plotter, placing the dead girl at the center 
of a tangle of people and events, and the resolution, when it comes, is both 
quiet and jolting. The author's command of the first person form, with both its 
rewards (the ability to probe deeply into Millhone's thoughts and emotions) and 
its challenges (everything must happen to or be discovered by Millhone, no 
godlike voice-overs to help advance the tale) continues to grow in strength and 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Grafton will want to push on to " 'Z' Is for Zeitgeist" is uncertain 
and doubtful. The pleasant present surprise is that even within its limits of 
time, place and character, the series has not yet begun to exhaust its 
possibilities or its excitements. 
</P>
<P>
 For a wildly different first-person voice, there is the bungling burglar 
Bernie Rhodenbarr telling about his ludicrous capers in Lawrence Block's THE 
BURGLAR WHO TRADED TED WILLIAMS (Dutton, $19.95, 258 pp.). In his Matthew 
Scudder books, Block is one of the most serious of crime novelists. When he 
chronicles Bernie (this is his first appearance in a decade), Block is one of 
the funniest, ranking with Donald E. Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie has been out of action, running a used-book store. But, like a smoker 
who never quite conquers the yearning to light up, Bernie is a sucker for a 
tempting score, where the ability to pick locks is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the present plot, which is of a Swiss watch complexity, Bernie is conned 
into knocking over an apartment, obtaining much cash and a cache of baseball 
cards but discovering a well-drilled corpse in the bathroom along the way. Why 
the cops are on to Bernie in such a hurry is a good question, one of several. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie's love interest grooms dogs and has her own off-speed take on life. The 
gent himself is enough to give burglary a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Ramos, a Latino lawyer in Denver, last year introduced Luis Montez, not 
so coincidentally a Chicago lawyer in Denver, in "The Ballad of Rocky Ruiz," an 
outstanding debut. Montez returns in THE BALLAD OF GATO GUERRERO (St. Martin's, 
$18.95, 183 pp.), and it is again both a good, swift mystery and a sharp and 
telling look from within at being a minority in an often-hostile majority 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez is at least slightly more secure and solid than he was a year ago, but 
success seems a fragile veneer over deep trouble. The story is a long flashback 
from trouble: A nightmare in a rural nightclub in which a tejano performance is 
interrupted by gunfire, and Montez and a couple have to flee across the desert, 
pursued by killers. There is a noisy crash and then silence. Talk about a socko 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are Montez's boyhood pal, the Gato Guerrero of the title, and the 
love of his life, who is unfortunately the wife of a brutish and jealous 
gangster. There are other problems: troubled and angry clients and old family 
wounds that won't heal. THe book is entertainment that is also a revealing 
slice of social history. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Grant's Catherine Sayler is another of California's remarkable crop of 
women investigators created by women. Sayler is partnered in a small San 
Francisco agency specializing in sniffing out business crime. In A WOMAN'S 
PLACE (Scribner's, $20, 261 pp.), fourth in the series, Sayler goes undercover, 
working as a communications expert in a software firm that recently merged with 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The assignment is to identify and root out the sources of sexual harrassment 
(not all of it overt) that have left the women on the staff enraged and 
alarmed. There've been lewd messages on the computers, dirty pictures left on 
desks, then an escalation to unfunny practical jokes and ultimately the vicious 
murder of the firm's top female executive, a tough boss who had riled or 
humiliated most of the men in the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's portrayal of the lower levels of sexual harrassment rings true. "I've 
been threatened and even shot at," Sayler says. "What I can't take is the stuff 
that gets handed out every day in office all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 What is on view at last is not harrassment seen as traditional insensitive 
male conditioning and good old boy joshing, or even as disguised anger at women 
as competitors or bosses; there's a sexist psychopath taking aim at Sayler 
herself in a long and teasing stalk. Not yet as well-known as Grafton and 
Millhone, Grant and Sayler are worthy companions, and the present book is 
clearly heartfelt. 
</P>
<P>
 The fecundity of Evan Hunter, who is also Ed McBain, approaches the 
incredible. McBain's books run into the several dozen, and as Hunter he has 
written 19 novels, starting with "The Blackboard Jungle" 40 years ago. The new 
one, CRIMINAL CONVERSATION (Warner Books, $21.95, 398 pp.) has already been 
bought as a potential Tom Cruise film. 
</P>
<P>
 A young deputy district attorney in New York is wiretapping the new head of a 
major crime family. (The attorney sent his father to prison for life.) 
Listening to the tapes and watching a video surveillance, he discovers his wife 
is having a passionate affair with the mobster. It is, as they say, a surefire 
plot. The wife doesn't know who her lover really is; the lover's ambitious 
underlings tumble sooner than the lover does to hubby's line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all of Hunter-McBain's work, the story moves at high speed, carried by 
stretches of very readable dialogue. The plot is straight-line but not without 
embellishment: The wife is a dedicated teacher at a girl's prep school; her 
most promising pupil a black scholarship student trying to survive with a 
crack-addicted mother in Harlem. By the standards of much recent fiction, 
Hunter keeps the love affair more implicit than explicit, and it really does 
contain a high quotient of love. 
</P>
<P>
 Another double-name author is Frances Fyfield, who is also Frances Hegarty, or 
vice-versa. An attorney who works in the Crown Prosecution Office in London, 
she is by any name a superior writer, not yet nearly well enough known in this 
country. She creates women protagonists who are unlike any others in their 
sometimes battered independence, their offbeat points of view and their 
sometimes eccentric behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In PERFECTLY PURE AND GOOD (Pantheon, $20, 218 pp.), Sarah Fortune is sent by 
her law firm to tidy up the will of an eccentric family living on the east 
coast of England. There is a local back-story. A beautiful woman committed 
suicide by drowning a year earlier; her grieving husband followed her to town 
and then evidently walked into the sea to follow her in suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is something else. The mother pretends to be batty but isn't; 
teen-age daughter is crippled by her low self-esteem; one brother commits cruel 
practical jokes and dreams impractical dreams; a doctor son is a glum 
workaholic, trying to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Fortune," Fyfield writes, "recognized no moral principles other than thou 
shalt be kind, few instincts which were not positive and no incontrovertible 
fact other than that men leave in the end." The author adds later that Fortune 
"eats like a delicate wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a ghost, who is of course not a ghost but a madman trying to right 
imagined wrongs and taking aim at Ms. Fortune, who has meanwhile done more good 
than Mary Poppins and, unlike Ms. Poppins, turned cartwheels on the lawn in the 
nude. She is an enormously appealing, unconventional and affecting figure in a 
distinctly unconventional thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconventional always is another English author, Peter Dickinson ("The 
Glass-Sided Ants' Nest," "The Poison Oracle"), and THE YELLOW ROOM CONSPIRACY 
(Mysterious Press, $18.95, 261 pp.) qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly couple hear an ancient scandal being joked about on a quiz program 
and are enraged and moved to memory. They were part of the scandal, and at the 
heart of it was a murder which, at this late date, each still thought the other 
had committed. Now, looking back in alternate chapters, they recreate the 
family history that led to the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was one of five daughters of a fairly well-to-do country family, 
down-market from the Mitfords, but interesting all the same. The man was one of 
the swains who clustered about for games and other sport. The real world 
intruded in the form of World War II, in which both of the narrators did 
intelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were a mixed lot, including at least a couple of terrible bounders, 
and not for the first time, greed, evil and blackmail, with wartime echoes, 
precipitated the murder. At that, the murder is almost the least of it; the 
best of it being Dickinson's evocation of another time, another place and a 
colorful set of women (especially) and relationships. The book is its own slice 
of social history, and Dickinson's glimpse of old lovers at twilight is sweetly 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish Troubles, a bloody present and a bloody past, sundering families 
from generation unto generation, are a fertile field for novels. The latest, 
unusual in its linkage between Manhattan and Dublin of today and yesterday, is 
Thomas Adcock's DROWN ALL THE DOGS (Pocket Books, $20, 341 pp.). It is the 
third appearance of an NYPD detective named Neil Hockaday, although the novel 
is so densely steeped in Irish history as to seem very little like one of a 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockaday's Irish-born father had brought his bride to New York, gone into the 
U.S. Army in World War II, disappeared while stationed in London and is 
presumed dead, having left his widow to rear young Hockaday alone. Now the 
detective is summoned to Dublin by his father's dying brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then, is the suicide of an old Irish priest in New York somehow related to 
Hockaday's own past. Or, come to that, the death of another man in a bomb blast 
in the house of a fellow cop, who disappears, or the death of an ex-Dublin cop, 
an IRA fund-raiser. And why do death and deception and ancient angers follow 
Hockaday to London? Adcock spins a fine and tangled yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for a father, or for the truth about a father, has seldom been 
quite so violent. Adcock knows Irish history and the Irish anguish, and his 
dialogue lets you hear by turns the soft brogue of Eire or the nasal snarl of 
pure Manhattan. It is an unusual and engrossing book. * Times Link: 808-8463

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE UP; COSMIC ZAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Whitley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He chases balls of fire by day -- and fireballs by night. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter George Zay was named "the most active amateur meteor observer in 
the world" for 1992 by the 500-member International Meteor Organization in 
Belgium.That year, he spent 218 hours observing meteors; last year, he logged 
460 hours, sending his findings to the meteor group. 
</P>
<P>
 Zay, 47, got interested in astronomy in the seventh grade ("I had aspirations 
to be an astronaut") and his fascination with it never waned. Six nights a 
month, from sunset to sunrise, he spots fireballs, plots their course and 
searches for new showers from the wooden observatory he built in Descanso, 
about 40 miles east of San Diego. "I get pretty excited every time I see one," 
says Zay, who lives in La Mesa with his ("very tolerant") wife and two kids. "I 
saw 74 last year, almost one each night." 
</P>
<P>
 His observatory is equipped with 10-inch and 4-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain 
telescopes, powerful 14x100 binoculars, cameras, an FM radio, "a little pantry 
cabinet" and a cot (with electric blanket, of course). "After midnight, until 
about 3 a.m. -- closer to sunrise -- is the ideal time for observing," he says. 
"I listen to the radio -- to keep my mind active to stay awake -- and record 
data every half hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Zay shares his observatory with schoolchildren and sponsors the Astronomy Club 
at Lemon Grove Middle School. "I show the students constellations and the 
telescope videos -- and quiz them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it fascinating trying to figure out what's out there and how it 
interacts with Earth." But he says that spending long, lonely nights gazing 
into the stars might not be for everyone. "It is like watching grass grow."

ARMENIAN MEMORIAL; RISE THE EUPHRATES, BY CAROL EDGARIAN (RANDOM HOUSE: $22; 
416 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Espey, John Espey's most recent book is Major Heresies, Minor 
Departures (University of Calif. Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the 1915 massacre of more than a million Armenians by Turkish 
soldiers is this engrossing novel's controlling force, both the narrative 
itself and today's headlines give Hitler's cynical question -- "Who after all 
speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" -- the lie. As Carey 
Goldberg reported last month in the Times, ever since the break-up of the 
Soviet Union, the Karabakh, Armenians have been fighting to free their tiny 
stronghold in the Caucasus Mountains from the control of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 This ongoing struggle highlights the narrative line of "Rise the Euphrates," 
which centers in the memories of Casard, the grandmother of the fictional 
narrator, Seta Loon, now 33, as she re-creates the past and advances into the 
present. Seta's father is an "oder," an outsider, and his marriage to Araxie, 
Casard's daughter, has given an added bitterness to Casard's accounts of the 
past as Seta and her brother and sister grow up in the town of Memorial, Conn. 
Memorial contains a well-established Armenian community dedicated to preserving 
as much of their traditional past as they can. The three children find 
themselves caught between loyalty to this living past and the America of their 
schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Seta is Casard's favorite and confidante. Her grandmother communicates to her 
the guilt that Casard feels for having escaped from the Turks on the banks of 
the Euphrates. Time and again Casard asks Seta to guess what her true name is, 
never willing to give the answer to this secret. Only after her grandmother's 
death is Seta certain of what it must have been. But until then, Seta must deal 
with her mother, Araxie, her apparently bland non-Armenian father, and her own 
mind and body as she begins to grow into womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Araxie herself must deal with her own loyalties, most particularly with the 
partial break that her marriage has caused. Edgarian handles all this with the 
skill of a professional juggler, taking up one theme after another while the 
rest is not merely suspended in the air but changed by the current action 
before it re-enters the central matriarchal line of narrative. For this is 
essentially a world controlled by its women as the older ones do their best to 
preserve the past and their daughters and granddaughters face a future seen 
always in comparison with that past. 
</P>
<P>
 Seta's personal story provides an active commentary on all these conflicting 
forces. Scarcely realizing what she is doing, she betrays one of her Armenian 
girlfriends as a way of entering the in-crowd of her schoolmates. Eager for 
sexual experience, she is first attracted to an Armenian boy. Later, the son of 
an Italian family proclaims his anonymous affection by painting her name in 
conspicuous spots all over Memorial. When he finally declares himself, they 
meet at first in secret and later she is accepted by his family. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time George Loon, Seta's father, has moved out of the house, and Seta 
is angry to find that the tightly knit Italian family thinks of her as an 
orphan. George has left because Araxie has been unfaithful. He takes an 
apartment in town, keeps in touch with his children, most particularly with 
Seta, whose "difference" is accented by this physical separation of her 
parents. But this is not the end of George's and Araxie's story, which must be 
left to the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Seta crosses the continent to California, where she goes to 
college and does not return to Memorial for 15 years. Once there, with a new 
life beginning in and for her, she is welcomed by "the old ones" just as she 
was bidden farewell by them on her departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rise the Euphrates" is a novel that takes a little time to engage the reader 
in all of its complexities, with its detailed concentration on what is 
essentially Armenian in every sense -- religion, food, social conventions, 
dress. What is given here is only an indication of both the self-contained 
world that it creates within another, often hostile, world, and its main 
characters as they deal with anger, guilt, and -- ultimately -- hope. Casard's 
secret name summarizes all of this, but one must read what goes before its 
revelation to earn this knowledge.

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; GETTING YOUR GOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ivy Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing like looking your prospective meal right in the eye, as I 
discovered when I went to the Goat Ranch in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd always bought my meat the old-fashioned way: prepackaged and without a 
personality, but here I am, peering into a pen full of apprehensive goats. I 
put my hand out to pet one, but these aren't like the goats at the County Fair, 
who nuzzle you for corn or candy. No, these guys run away when people approach, 
and no wonder: Every week more than a hundred of their buddies vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 I gulp and select a sluggish, bony, awkward one who's missing a horn. It's 
hard to select a cute goat when its destination is a barbecue. I'm asked if I 
want to keep his blood, head or skin. When I decline, One-Horn is led away to 
have his neck slit. I'd noticed that the air was laced with a terrible, sour 
odor, and I soon found out why: Inside one of the buildings, they're burning 
the fur and skin off my goat. I realize I have pretty much screwed up my karma 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of minutes, I'm handed a box packed with nine pieces of One-Horn. 
At home, my boyfriend is in charge of cutting the meat from the bone, which 
sounds deceptively simple. But One-Horn, it seems, has a taste for the ironic: 
As Greg struggles with the stringy flesh, a leg bone gores his hand. But soon 
the goat is in small chunks. We make curry and kabobs, and later the house is 
full of 30 guests who discuss the moral implications of One-Horn's fate as they 
lick their plates clean. 
</P>
<P>
 I choke down just one piece of meat. It's greasy and rubbery and it seems like 
an awful lot of work, physical and emotional, for very little return. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sticking with vegetables. They don't stare back at you. They don't cringe. 
And eating salad means never having to say "I'm sorry." Ivy Brown

PALM LATITUDES: BOTTOM LINE; THE COLOR OF MONEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dead white guys may have a monopoly on U.S. currency portraiture, but black 
Americans are making an appearance on other financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal checks are among them, but when Ty Canady went looking for them, she 
didn't like what she saw: "They featured tiny black and white pictures.You 
couldn't even tell they were black." 
</P>
<P>
 Canady, 23, thought she could do better. So she rounded up her brother and a 
friend and founded AfrocenCheck, a San Diego-based business that makes checks 
featuring color portraits of figures such as Harriet Tubman, W.E.B. DuBois and 
Booker T. Washington. Three banks, two in San Diego and one in Brooklyn, offer 
AfrocenChecks, and more than 300 people have purchased them, Canady says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people of all different races who have ordered the checks -- not just 
African Americans," says Senta Johnson, 24, an assistant controller for a trust 
company. "I love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Canady, who grew up in South-Central L.A., hopes to expand to include other 
ethnic groups. "I'd also like to have the checks include Native Americans, 
Asian Americans and Jews," Canady says, "and eventually expand to a 'unity' 
check featuring a leader from every ethnic group." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, though, she's content that AfrocenChecks are making a statement. 
"These checks," she says, "symbolize the economic power of the black dollar."

BREVITY'S RAINCHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Kipen 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We showed up once at a party, not a masquerade party, in disguise -- he as 
Hemingway, I as Scott Fitzgerald, each of us aware that the other had been 
through a phase of enthusiasm for this respective author. I suppose by then I 
was learning from (Richard) Farina how to be amused at some of my obsessions . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas Pynchon 
</P>
<P>
 Two men's deaths will change my life, though I have never met them. No adult 
would call them old -- one is 57 today, the other not much older -- so it may 
be ghoulish even to think about their mortalities. But young children think 
about their parent's deaths, and not because their parents are old, either. 
Rather because life would be unbearable, and therefore irresistible, to imagine 
without them. Vin Scully and novelist Thomas Pynchon are not my biological 
parents, yet the first taught me how to talk, and the second won't stop 
teaching me how to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an eventful spring for Pynchon obsessives. First came his unlikely 
transubstantiation into a subplot on an episode of "The John Larroquette Show." 
In a script reportedly vetted by Pynchon himself, Larroquette refused to 
believe that his reclusive favorite author was on CD-swapping terms with his 
fry cook. The music in question, at Pynchon's suggestion, was by Texas-based 
acid rock legend Roky Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had Pynchonians besieged their local music stores with Erickson 
reserves ("I know you've never sold one before, just hold it till I get 
there!"), than the real buzz bomb hit: In 1996, Holt will publish a new novel 
by Pynchon. 
</P>
<P>
 1996! Two whole years! Never mind that 17 years had elapsed between his last 
two novels, "Gravity's Rainbow" and "Vineland." Pynchonians are greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, like an answered prayer, came word that Catalyst Records was issuing 
a new Spike Jones retrospective CD, with a cover by "Maus" artist Art 
Spiegelman and all-new liner notes by . . . Thomas Pynchon. Back to that phone! 
("Hold it till I get there! No, that must have been someone else . . . .") 
</P>
<P>
 I now hold in my hand these same sacramental liner notes, the first public 
utterance from Pynchon since last year's NYT Book Review cover essay on sloth. 
If there's any justice, "Spiked!" will earn Pynchon, that most musically aware 
of novelists, his first Grammy. Maybe he'll even accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Halloween candy, enjoyment of Pynchon's essay is inevitably tainted by 
the knowledge that there won't be any more for months and months. Also like 
Halloween candy, it's wonderful, liberally laced with Pynchon's patented 
broke-back syntax and shotgun similes. 
</P>
<P>
 Along comes Pynchon, just when you thought the next person who weighed in on 
political correctness -- waggling fingers miming quotation marks in the air -- 
ought to get his knuckles broken. Putting the subject of Jones' 
now-unfashionable dialect humor into humanely mocking perspective, Pynchon 
finds: 
</P>
<P>
 "More than enough material for that interesting subset of folks actively 
looking to be offended . . . this will require the sort of listener who either 
wants to wince with embarrassment or can find in vintage bigotry quaint refuge 
from the more virulent forms encountered in our own era." Yes, but whose side 
is he on? Our side, always, whoever we are. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalysts's Tim Page -- chief music critic for Newsday on Pynchon's native 
Long Island -- has clearly read Pynchon's intro to the 1984 short story 
collection, "Slow Learner." In it Pynchon explained his philosophy of 
surrealism with this quote from Spike Jones Jr.: "One of the things that people 
don't realize about dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a 
gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Pynchon's perfect-pitch surrealism must be the only one of his prodigious 
gifts missing from the liner notes to "Spiked!" Signal among these gifts is his 
amazing, Baedeker-detailed sense of time and place. His loving thumbnail 
evocation of the anarchic bandleader's postwar L.A. recalls his sure feel for 
'60s Houston, on view two years ago in his equally warm-hearted introduction to 
Donald Barthelme's posthumous oddments. 
</P>
<P>
 Say this for the man, today, his birthday, of all days: His mom sure taught 
him the importance of a proper thank-you note. So did mine. David Kipen

SEARCHING FOR ORDER; CONSIDER THIS HOME, BY GREG BILLS (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $21; 
CLOTH; 318 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Antonya Nelson, Antonya Nelson's most recent book is the collection of short 
stories, Family Terrorists (Houghton Mifflin). She is a professor of literature 
and creative writing at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Bills' first novel, "Consider This Home," uses as its epigraph a line 
from the Talking Heads' song "This Must Be The Place." The line Bills doesn't 
use, from the same song, is the one that creates the bridge -- a powerful and 
ironic one -- between this novel and the Book of Mormon. David Byrne's lyrics 
posit a "guess that this must be the place," where Brigham Young once declared 
with assurance, "This is the place." It's the uncertainty of Byrne's qualifiers 
that gives rise to Bills' novel, an uncertainty that extends to include us and 
to distinguish us from our ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 In alternating point-of-view sections, the author tells the story of young 
Daron, the product of a teen-age coupling, and his mother, Kath. Daron's 
central objective is to discover who his father is; Kath's desires are more 
nebulous. She is teetering on the fence of her Mormon faith, her ambivalence 
about it clear in some ways, very unclear in others. Ostensibly, she has 
fallen: fleeing her family and church, living in Las Vegas, drinking coffee. 
But her upbringing exerts itself in mysterious ways, ways Bills will not let 
Kath easily dismiss. The author understands the deep-seated emotional hold 
childhood experience has on adults; he never condescends to trivialize it. 
</P>
<P>
 The book begins with a journey home, mother and son on the road traveling 
toward their respective fathers. Travel is frequently evoked in "Consider This 
Home," whether characters are questing for a new home or escaping the old (they 
are often doing both). In the way Brigham Young searched for confidence that 
he'd found "the place," Greg Bills' characters also look for signs that they've 
found home. But they cannot claim the same God-sent guarantees and are more 
tentative in their declaration of homeland or home. They are grappling with 
life's central enigmatic dilemmas -- birth, sex and death -- without coming to 
any firmer conclusions than the rest of us. History -- their own and the 
ancestral -- haunts them; the visions of childhood do not subside. Their true 
lives take place in the imaginative and the literal, in the sightings of angels 
in trees and in the construction of tiny rooms in their hearts where they seek 
shelter. It is an anguishing moment when Kath realizes, about her son, she "can 
no longer tell what Daron is feeling and she worries about him, alone inside 
his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Daron is an important point-of-view character because he illustrates for the 
reader the integrity of children's feelings. One can relive his parents' 
youthful personalities by comparing them to Daron's. And one can feel hopeful 
that Daron's life, as it continues forward, will be one salvaged from the 
ruins, that the legacy of terrors will end. 
</P>
<P>
 Daron is also a good guide. As he navigates Mormonism, the reader is invited 
into the religion in incremental measure, oftentimes horrified, other times 
amused. Add Greg Bills to the growing cadre of writers presenting humanized 
Mormonism to those of us untutored in its nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 The author is interested in other conjured worlds besides Mormonism -- the one 
of Las Vegas, the one of television. The western landscape is as much a 
character in this book as anyone else, and its two-sided nature couldn't be 
more clear than in these polar settings of Sterling, Utah and Las Vegas, Nev.: 
small-town religious repression versus Sin City, U.S.A. The natural world is 
lovingly rendered, both the secular and the non-secular landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness of this book is that its plot depends upon a demon and a 
long-held secret about him, elements that take the novel one step away from 
realism and two steps closer to melodrama. That evil people inhabit the earth 
few of us would dispute; whether this novel requires a satanic character is the 
issue. And though some secrets are explicably and necessarily kept in this 
book, the one Kath keeps seems more convenient than convincing. Since Bills has 
so beautifully served Kath and Daron to the reader, has so beautifully 
suggested the menace of a repressive upbringing, it seems unnecessary to 
deliver the apocalyptic crisis. The author has played evenhandedly with his 
characters up to this point, asking the reader to judge them rather than doing 
so himself, but then tilts the scale, thereby undoubtedly losing the very 
readers he should be seeking to persuade. 
</P>
<P>
 This reservation aside -- it's a relatively minor one -- the reason you should 
read "Consider This Home" is that it's so well written. Bills' language offers 
moment-by-moment delight, and 10-year-old Daron is one of the most memorable 
consciousnesses I've had the pleasure to inhabit in recent fiction. You 
couldn't ask for a guide with more integrity or astuteness of vision. His 
struggle to create order and story out of his disordered, narrative-resistant 
life is utterly heart-rending. He is Greg Bills' great gift to readers.

 Comparing Roseanne to Helen Hayes? Well, Rozen does work for People.The Book 
Review is my last hope and chance of reading something literary in the Los 
Angeles Times and you have a book reviewer writing slang in the context of the 
review: "disses"; "c'mon." If you don't require your book reviewers to have a

Please write in English, some of us still speak it. If I wanted a foreign

SOUL MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the excellent critique by Michael S. Kimmel in his review (March 27) 
of Thomas Moore's two books, "Care of the Soul" and "Soul Mates"; If several 
years in a monastery qualifies anyone to be a theologian, it accounts for 
Moore's skimming the surface with his observations about soul values, 
characteristics and desires. 
</P>
<P>
 In downgrading the use of the mind and the intellect, Moore is denying one of 
the greatest gifts possessed by man. Not that mind alone can move us forward 
but a spirit of inquiry and a willingness to entertain other concepts may lead 
us into the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancement of civilization comes only from a renewed search for better 
understanding and that creativity and productivity that derives from a rigorous 
application, testing and experiencing of what we believe about ourselves as 
living souls. 
</P>
<P>
 EUGENE J. DEAN, SANTA MONICA 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where anything resembling a pattern, a commonality within the soul of 
humankind, is thought possible, men like sociology professor Michael S. Kimmel 
put their faith in government instead. According to Kimmel, Moore's ideas about 
the importance of our relationship to others, if accepted, would depoliticize 
every day life, which Kimmel says means destruction of "the vision of politics 
as the promise of collective action to transform the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he is quick to mention the evils of Reaganomics and the backwardness of 
conservatism, it is plain that, for Kimmel, collective action means giving 
power to a few people in government with the appropriate moral outlook who know 
what's best for everyone and who can then change the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A philosophy that says the soul thrives on connection, that the soul needs 
other people, could upset this grand plan. What if we started caring for one 
another? An impossibility, says the professor, nothing more than a nostalgic 
longing for the mythic past, a sop for the downwardly mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, there is a small window into Kimmel's heart. Although he is 
committed to the view that all of us are separate, and thus in need of a 
unifying collective action, he talks about the hard work of psychoanalysis 
"that some of us believe is necessary to clear away the layers of defensive 
armor." I take it that he is aware that the unconscious part of us is at least 
similar if not actually connected. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimmel says the downwardly mobile seek solace "because the rewards of wealth 
and power are no longer available" and didn't work anyway. Where has he learned 
this crippled view of life? Who has given him the platform from which to preach 
it? Today, people pay him and others of like mind to define reality, but who 
will pay them tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 MARGARET MORELL, BUENA PARK 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kimmel was informative in "Soul Man", until he concluded that Moore "wants us 
to feel good, not do good." But Moore knows that good feelings can make for 
good actions. Witness his deed as an author. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimmel's is the same argument that asserts that a belief in the unity of 
things make us amoral or indiscriminate. Or that meditation is stupor. Or that 
home is not the real world. Actually, wakefulness and activity follow from 
rest. And life at home echoes abroad. Understanding empowers the individual, 
which is hardly without social consequence. Kimmel's is a purely intellectual 
reading. He mistakes the sign for the road, a classic symptom of lack of soul. 
</P>
<P>
 THOMAS M. CUSHING, AVALON 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Something obviously happened to Kimmel on the way to his Ph.D. in sociology: 
He lost the ability to recognize the soul, in the analysis of the work. Often 
happens to the over-educated, formalized intellectuals, the very point Moore is 
addressing in "Care of the Soul" 's section of "Ideas With Soul"!

CROSSING REPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was more than a little perturbed to see the orchestrated series of letters 
by Times "readers" from areas such as Oakland, San Francisco and Berkeley about 
my review of Bay Area writer Kim Chernin's book, "Crossing the Border: An 
Erotic Journey." The letters not only grossly misread my review but also 
presented argumenta ad femina , attacking both me and my own work. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if these Bay Area readers had read my review more dispassionately 
instead of with the intent of coming to the aid of a friend whose book had not 
received an overwhelming accolade, they would have understood better what I was 
trying to say. Surely no objective reader could have called my review 
"vitriolic" or an "attack on (Chernin's) life." What I clearly meant to suggest 
in my opening paragraph, which refers to the possibility that Chernin "deserted 
her eight-year-old child," was that was one construction that Chernin herself 
puts on her having left for Israel without the child. The next paragraph 
obviously points out that the book is about memory and our mature 
interpretation of the acts of our youth. It begins "Or did she (desert the 
child and commit all the other peccadilloes for which the mature Chernin often 
castigates herself in the book)? The review points up Chernin's focus in the 
book on the cloudiness of memory, as the Times editor was astute enough to see 
in titling it "Clouded Hindsight." 
</P>
<P>
 The points that Bader and Rogin make in their letters -- about the memory's 
construction of the past and about how people whom we guiltily and 
egocentrically fear we've mortally wounded in our youth may turn out to go and 
live full lives after all -- are precisely the points I make in my review. Did 
they read the review -- or did they read only Chernin's request to them to come 
to her "defense"? But even more outrageous than the willfully gross misreadings 
of my review and by the letter writers is their attack on me and my own books. 
My very complex presentations of historical romantic friendships are reduced to 
statements by one Friend of Chernin that my writings "argue for the absence of 
women's sexuality before the 20th Century" and that the notion of sexuality in 
women even in the 20th Century "also runs against (my) grain." Anyone familiar 
with my work such as my history of lesbianism in 20th Century America, "Odd 
Girls and Twilight Lovers," would know how absurd that point is. But, alas, 
most of your readers will not be familiar with my work, and hence I am held up 
to ridicule by that correspondent, which seems to be given further 
justification by another Bay Area letter writer who accuses me of being "a 
representative of the sex police." 
</P>
<P>
 My ability to write a review of a book such as Chernin's is also called into 
question by one of the letter writers who accuses me of "personal antipathy." 
So far from being prejudiced against the book at the outset, as the letter 
writer suggests, I desperately wanted to love it, having had my own experiences 
on an Israeli kibbutz decades ago, and I was so vastly disappointed that I did 
not love the book that I considered even declining to write the review. 
</P>
<P>
 I did write it, however, fulfilling what I believe to be the responsibility of 
a reviewer -- not to rave indiscriminately about a book, but rather to tell the 
reader what it is about and to suggest why it does or doesn't succeed. In my 
opinion, "Crossing the Border" failed not because it is an "immoral" book, as I 
am falsely accused of having written, but because it is often tedious -- a much 
graver sin for a book than immorality.

STYLE: GARDENS; JUST ADD WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout history, garden-makers in hot, dry climates have known the 
preciousness of water. On a baking day, its presence, however paltry, can bring 
relief. The very sound of it cools us, whether it trickles through a rill or 
showers in recycled torrents down a rocky wall. Like Persian pleasure gardens, 
residential L.A. landscapes are often built around water judiciously used. Some 
feature swimming pools, reflecting ponds, even streams. The more modest might 
have a fountain or a spa. In others, water is symbolized in the "dry stream 
bed," a fluid array of stones that looks almost like the real thing. Going With 
the Flow 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer cooling power, the sight and sound of spouting water may be second 
only to a plunge in a pool. Which is why father and son Charles and Stephen 
Kanner of Kanner Architects in Westwood endowed their family home with enough 
flowing features to suggest what Stephen calls "a land of a thousand lakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mandeville Canyon property already had a trout pond and a natural stream 
when the Kanners moved there in 1959. Its wooded half-acre also featured exotic 
trees -- palms, loquats, macadamia nuts -- as well as an orange grove and 
coastal canyon natives. What it needed, though, were a couple of spills closer 
to home, where they could be seen and heard on a sunny dining patio and from 
windows placed to capture the outdoors. In the courtyard, Charles built a 
fountain, using terra-cotta waterline pipe to echo the roof tiles of his 
Spanish Colonial house. His wife, Judith, planted the openings of the pipes 
with baby's tears, which now overflow onto the bricks in a verdant stream of 
their own. Next, the Kanners modified their existing pond, setting a spa into 
it for a tiered effect. The pond, like another small pool by the front door, is 
planted with papyrus and waterlilies and flashes with mosquitofish and 
goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 As if these rippled currents weren't enough, two years ago, the Kanners added 
a lap pool, which gleams, like a long pane of glass, in a wild palm-and-fern 
grove. As beautiful as it is -- reflecting a tangle of greens from the tropics 
-- it's also useful when distant water isn't enough to kill the heat. The 
Coasts Are Clear 
</P>
<P>
 When Laird Koenig, a writer and frequent traveler to Japan, looks out the 
windows of his Brentwood house, he sees a scene that reminds him of Kyoto. 
Gravel and greenery flow like water into the landscape, which is set with 
boulders and ancient Japanese millstones. To further cool the scene, water 
itself splashes into a rock bowl modeled on a tsukubai -- a traditional 
hand-washing basin. Sunlight feathers through fronds of Henon bamboo ( 
Phyllostachys nigra 'Henon' ) onto a verdant bank of ferns. Simple, spare and 
formal yet suffused with shaggy naturalism, Koenig's garden links his '60s-era 
wood-and-glass home with the wildness of an adjacent hillside. Though it looks 
authentic, it combines traditions of Japanese garden-making with a sensitivity 
to the California setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just lift a landscape out of its context and plunk it down," says 
the garden's creator, designer Katherine Fukami Glascock of Landscapes Designed 
in North Hollywood. Moss, for example, a common material in Japanese 
landscapes, dried up in the sun here, so Glascock introduced an eye-fooling 
substitute: green carpet ( Herniaria glabra ) . In place of stone lanterns, 
which she and Koenig found cliched, she used Arroyo lanterns, reinforcing the 
connection between California Craftsman and Japanese aesthetics. Water, of 
course, sparingly used, belongs to both traditions. And while her bamboo and 
ferns would be right at home in Kyoto, Glascock's additions of ornamental 
grasses, Mexican evening primrose ( Oenothera berlandieri ) and sweet olive ( 
Osmanthus fragrans ) thrive in Koenig's canyon and tie the garden to its 
locale. The Spa That Refreshes 
</P>
<P>
 However useful it may be, an outdoor tub isn't always a thing of beauty in a 
garden. One solution is to disguise the spa as a reflecting pool and build an 
outdoor room around it. Add flowers and a spilling fountain and you have what 
Los Angeles landscape designer Janice Tidwell created for Steven and Jeri de 
Souza of Santa Monica: a place for water gazing as well as soaking in the 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple rectangle edged with 18th-Century French cobblestones and lined with 
green glass tile from Brazil, the pool is formal yet rustic, reflecting the old 
Victorian box tree ( Pittosporum undulatum ) that arches overhead. The fountain 
sluices down a playful boulder-and-brick wall, which Tidwell designed, in 
California Craftsman style, with Santa Monica artist-mason Chuck Simmons. 
Linking the area to the De Souzas' 1912 Craftsman house, the designers' 
off-kilter interpretation suggests a storybook grotto. This delights the De 
Souzas, two screenwriters who often wander outdoors in search of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Tidwell's plant palette ensures that the couple's serenity is never static. 
Her choice of white-blooming greens changes constantly with the seasons: Winter 
paper white narcissus makes way for spring tulips, summer tuberoses and 'Casa 
Blanca' lilies. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a hot spell, the pool is the garden's real star. "We're used to 
Southern California as being all sun and brightness," Steven de Souza says. 
"Here, it's always cool and quiet."

VENETIAN BLIND; FLORIAN DEFINITELY SPEAKS ITALIAN -- BUT THE MENU DOESN'T 
EXACTLY SHOUT VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the way to Florian, a 6-month-old restaurant named after the celebrated 
18th-Century coffeehouse on St. Mark's Square in Venice, I went over my 
favorite Venetian dishes in my mind: baccala mantecato (salt cod whipped with 
milk or cream), sarde in saor (fresh sardines marinated in a sweet, vinegary 
sauce), tiny cuttlefish stewed in their ink, risi e bisi (rice and fresh peas), 
fegato alla veneziana , arguably the most famous of Venetian dishes -- calves' 
liver cooked with onions and a splash of vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one of these classic Venetian dishes was on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is lovely, however. I'm charmed by the beautifully painted panels 
of still lifes and pale attentuated torsos (near the ladies' room, a 
disembodied hand tweaks a rosy nipple). Old-fashioned wall sconces and silk 
shades edged with braid cast a soft light that is reflected in round, bejeweled 
mirrors. With only a slight suspension of belief, the decor, inherited from the 
previous tenant, Tryst, suggests a restaurant on one of the watery city's back 
canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, though, I have trouble understanding why Florian considers 
itself a Venetian restaurant. The menu includes dishes from all over Italy -- 
from Rome, Sardinia, Bologna, Milan, Tuscany and Naples -- while only a handful 
of true Venetian dishes make the cut: pasta e fagioli , a fish soup, pasta and 
risotto cooked with various combinations of seafood -- and tiramisu, of course. 
The menu is the culinary equivalent of Venetian gondoliers singing "O Sole Mio" 
or "Santa Lucia" for so long that few visitors are aware the songs extol 
Naples, not Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 A restaurant's decor, music and menu all do their part to create the illusion 
that, for this evening, we really are in Tuscany or Provence or New Orleans, at 
least in spirit. Call the place Mediterranean. Call it Italian. Call it 
Venetian. Call it whatever you like, but the food should bear more than a 
passing resemblance to its namesake cuisine. If the kitchen concentrated on 
authentic Venetian cooking (hard to find in Venice, admittedly) and cooked it 
well, Florian would have my heartfelt respect. Instead, we get many of the same 
old standbys.  
</P>
<P>
 That said, Florian serves decent, but certainly not memorable, Italian food. 
What sets it apart is the charming setting and the professionalism of the 
ever-present Tancredi De Luca, previously maitre d' at Toscana. Chef Enrico 
Trova gives a number of dishes a California twist. Mostly this consists of 
turning every other plate into a salad. An antipasto of bresaola , a ruddy 
cured beef, and Parmesan shavings is heaped with arugula leaves, and the subtly 
delicious swordfish carpaccio gets its bit of greens, too. Penne alla 
arrabbiata , a classic dried pasta dish, is dressed up with grilled chicken, 
which makes about as much sense as adding poultry to Caesar salad.  
</P>
<P>
 I liked both the wonderful rustic pasta e fagioli and the rough-textured 
minestrone. Pastas have their ups and downs. The spaghetti alla bottarga , made 
with pressed gray mullet roe and tossed with toasted bread crumbs and arugula, 
has a faint tang of the sea. Tagliatelle ai profumi delle Langhe was a 
disappointment, not for the fragrant sauce of porcini and vegetables but for 
the quality of the pasta itself. These heavy noodles little resembled the 
glorious, tender and silky tagliatelle from Piedmont. The risotto Billy Wilder 
is a confetti of colorful vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 The mixed grill of seafood with lemon and capers is consistently one of the 
best dishes on the menu. A breaded Milanese-style veal chop comes with oily 
thick-cut potato chips for a cholesterol-clogging main course. The lamb in 
bread crust arrived more or less medium-rare, but less than appealing wrapped 
in a soggy white-bread blanket. On the other hand, osso buco , gentle in flavor 
and texture, is a respectable-enough version. 
</P>
<P>
 Florian is very pleasant weekdays at lunch, when you can order from an 
extensive menu of cold and hot stuzzichini , described as little dishes to 
mix-and-match tapas-style. With the French doors open, the glare of the light 
along La Cienega comes close, very close, to the quality of light reflected off 
the water in Venice. Nibbling on half a dozen little dishes -- 
grilled-chicken-and-potato salad perfumed with balsamic vinegar, prosciutto 
with sliced pear, a thin-crusted pizza topped with fresh arugula and pecorino 
shavings -- the illusion was good enough that I almost expected to hear "Santa 
Lucia." 
</P>
<P>
 Florian Ristorante, 401 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 289 - 1600. 
Open nightly for dinner and Monday through Friday for lunch. Full bar. Valet 
parking. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $45 to 
$80.

ON THE RECORD: HISTORICALLY CORRECT MOZART -- AND MEHTA'S VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a decent interval since the overkill of the Mozart bicentennial, the 
composer's major operas are again appearing on recordings, perhaps to satisfy a 
consumer demand for ever-more "authentic" performances. Or perhaps just for the 
sake of novelty, there being a thin line between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been shown since the first, simplistic 1970s notions of what Mozart 
really wanted, one scholar's historical accuracy is another's flawed research. 
We still don't know what's authentic, and probably never will. Which is no 
reason to stop seeking what sounds right to our ears. 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy aspect of the search for a performing style stripped of Romantic 
encrustations is the increasingly frequent practice of combining modern 
instruments (including human voices) and the most pertinent gleanings of 
scholarship, exemplified by the "Cosi fan Tutte" conducted and edited by master 
Mozartean Charles Mackerras (Telarc 80360, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's profoundly serious comedy is led with tremendous verve -- not 
necessarily synonymous with speed -- by Mackerras, without pushing the drama or 
his singers' abilities beyond their natural boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor's sharply inflected reading, spiffily executed by the Scottish 
Chamber Orchestra, frames the work of an intelligent cast, headed in this 
instance by Alessandro Corbelli's raffish Guilelmo -- that's the way it's 
spelled in Telarc's printed materials and accordingly pronounced "Gweelelmo" by 
the cast, without explanation in the otherwise thorough annotations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hadley's eager Ferrando is delightful and, while Gilles Cachemaille 
lacks the crusty edge of an ideal Alfonso, his graceful vocalism is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The women provide vivid characterizations and, in each instance, some flawed, 
but not fatally so, vocal production. Felicity Lott's fiery Fiordiligi lacks 
security at both extremes of the improbably wide range demanded by the 
composer, a situation exacerbated by her overly ambitious ornamentation. As 
Dorabella, Marie McLaughlin's darker soprano has its tremulous moments, and the 
very bright soprano of Nuccia Focile, a spirited, un-minxish Despina, turns 
strident under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, however, the cast projects an uncommon feeling of ensemble, 
particularly in the recitatives, whose alternating banter and reflectiveness 
here propels the action rather than impeding it, as is often the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornamentation, including appoggiaturas, is not applied dogmatically at every 
cadential opportunity but -- with the exception noted -- for expressive effect, 
to state the case rather broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 It all adds up to richly satisfying entertainment that captures the opera's 
elusive pathos without obscuring its sparkling humor: a more successful 
production overall than the recent Archiv edition (437 829, 3 CDs), expertly 
conducted and played by John Eliot Gardiner and his period-instrument English 
Baroque Soloists, but with a cast distinguished only by Rodney Gilfry's likable 
Guglielmo, in the familiar spelling used here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Sony's new "Le Nozze di Figaro" (53286, 3 CDs) recalls a time 
before any of us lost sleep over whether Mozart would have been satisfied with 
the interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Figaro" plushly played by a fine, largish-sounding orchestra, that of 
the Maggio Musical Fiorentino, under the relaxed, affectionate, 
singer-accommodating baton of Zubin Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
 A notable aspect of this production is that it has been cast by someone with 
the extraordinary notion that every singer should be able to sing Mozart's 
notes accurately and securely. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading women are superb, with Marie McLaughlin this time a distinctly 
adult Susanna, devoid of soubrette mannerisms, Karita Mattila a grandly 
dignified Countess, and Monica Bacelli a sexily smoldering Cherubino. 
</P>
<P>
 The men likewise are uncommonly solid, although stolid might better describe 
Michele Pertusi's well-sung but unaccountably somber Figaro. Lucio Gallo is, 
however, a believably wrathful Count, chastened, but hardly into impotence, by 
the final curtain. The smaller roles, male and female, have been cast with 
comparable care. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the further we're removed in time from the 1958 London Records "Figaro" 
(now on mid-price CDs), the more modern it seems, largely because of the fleet, 
uncannily illuminating conducting of Erich Kleiber, who was also blessed with 
the Figaro of Cesare Siepi, still unmatched for charm and vocal 
resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 For those unable to tolerate London's faded sonics and the rather awful Count 
of Alfred Poell, Mehta and his strong cast provide a viable, sonically 
up-to-date alternative.*

 PICTURES AND PROKOFIEV: Mussorgsky: "Pictures at an Exhibition." Prokofiev: 
Sonata No. 6. Dickran Atamian, piano. Lyra House LHL 1003. RCA Victor awarded 
Atamian -- winner of the 1975 Naumburg Competition at the age of 19 -- a 
recording contract when he was age 22.The pianist's performance of Sam 
Raphling's reduction of Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" was issued, but RCA 
never released other major works he recorded. These hail from that era. 
Atamian's unique interpretations abound with color, force and imagination, but 
the same individualism that can work to hypnotic effect occasionally serves to 
disjoint sections. In "Pictures," he breaks chords between hands when a more 
granitic sound would be advantageous, and adds a quirky left-hand tremolo to 
the closing Grave of "The Great Gate of Kiev." Prokofiev's Sixth Sonata also 
emerges sensitive and powerful, if not always wholly connected. SUSAN BLISS

<P>
 Call this a summit meeting of two of the most important guitarists in 
contemporary jazz. Similar encounters have not always been known to produce 
impressive outcomes, but this one, for the most part, works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Scofield and Metheny are different enough in style to generate contrasting 
improvisations, yet similar enough in intensity and manner to create a coherent 
musical composite. The individual soloing -- especially on tracks such as 
"Quiet Rising," the boppish "No Matter What" and the Rollins-esque title tune 
-- is superb, juxtaposing Metheny's crisply articulated, elusive lines against 
Scofield's somewhat more hard-swinging melody-stretching. In the few instances 
in which interaction takes place -- the thematic statement of "No Way Jose" and 
occasionally behind each other on the slower numbers -- Scofield and Metheny 
blend with surprisingly symbiotic ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its many good qualities, however, this can be very thorny music. Stark 
and largely empty of ornamentation, it is, like a Beethoven string quartet, 
complex creativity reduced to its essential minimum. The result can be a 
demanding experience for the listener, but one which is richly rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). DON HECKMAN

 "ORIENTALE." Nathaniel Rosen, cello; Doris Stevenson, piano. North Star 
Records NS 0027.Subtitled "Romantic Music for Cello," this collection revolves 
around a style typified by Granados' sensual Spanish Dance No. 2 -- 
"Orientale," in Piatigorsky's transcription. Rosen's late mentor remains a 
major influence here; Piatigorsky transcribed seven of the 17 pieces, and 
composed an eighth. His "Syrinx," for unaccompanied cello -- in which Rosen 
turns in a mysterious, eerie performance -- hold up well against Debussy's 
famous flute solo. Backed by Stevenson, who provides compelling partnership, 
the cellist highlights his virtuosity throughout this repertory, tempering 
acrobatics with long cantabiles, as in Tchaikovsky's "Valse Sentimentale" and 
Saint-Saens' inevitable "Swan." SUSAN BLISS

 TRUMPET WORKS: Sergei Nakarjakov, trumpet; Alexander Markovich, piano. Teldec 
9031-77705-2. Nakarjakov -- 15 years old in 1992 when he made this recording -- 
presents surprisingly mature technique and interpretation in a potpourri of 
idiomatic works.Many of these selections highlight virtuosity over musical 
content: Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee"; Dinicu's "Hora Staccato" 
and Jean-Baptiste Arban's standard, "The Carnival of Venice," all provide 
acrobatic flights deftly assayed by this Russian-born Israeli. Nevertheless, 
the trumpeter tempers fiery showmanship with a canny sense of style. He proves 
himself as comfortable with jazz-influenced pieces as he seems with 
19th-Century encore archetypes. He also turns in a convincing, sometimes 
compelling performance of a sonatina by the French composer Jeanine Rueff. 
Markovich accompanies with appropriate flair, empathy and technical finesse.

 As it travels through its modest peaks and not so deep valleys, this album is 
a bit of a disappointment. While Blanchard has never been known as primarily a 
melodic player, his work in that area with his quintet -- which plays May 26-29 
at the Jazz Bakery -- has become increasingly appealing.Funny to say, then, 
that there's too much pure melody here, too many literal renditions of such 
songs as "Detour Ahead," "Don't Explain," "I Cover the Waterfront" and nine 
others, all but two taken at slow tempos.

 Blanchard, ordinarily a crackling, no-holds-barred soloist, seems constrained 
by these dirge-like tempos and plays with an unusual languidness. The 
accompaniment -- mostly Gil Evans-ish strings and woodwinds arranged by Miles 
Goodman -- does little to liberate the trumpeter. "What a Little Moonlight," 
taken briskly, is a notable exception, and the leader is nicely on fire here. 
</P>
<P>
 The album breathes with more life when Jeanie Bryson comes in to offer vocals 
on five tracks. Singing in a straightforward, intimate manner, Bryson floats 
over the up-tempo charge of "Moonlight," is suitably ironic on "Detour Ahead" 
and is sultry and bluesy on "Fine and Mellow."

 Recorded in 1986 and released only in Japan six years ago, these companion CDs 
are a silver anniversary re-creation of the Eric Dolphy-Booker Little Quintet's 
celebrated recording at the Five Spot in New York. The original 1961 Mal 
Waldron-Richard Davis-Ed Blackwell rhythm section impeccably prods and supports 
the young lion front line of Blanchard and Harrison, at that time leading their 
own quintet shortly after leaving Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's darting, fluid alto sax and Blanchard's forceful trumpet wisely aim 
for putting personal stamps on a repertoire drawn exclusively from the 1961 
date rather than imitating Dolphy and Little. Davis' double-time bass and 
Blackwell's inimitable rhythmic force impress on "Aggression" from "Remembered 
Live" while Blanchard and Waldron's piano shine on "Number Eight" from "Fire 
Waltz." "Remembered Live" is the stronger set by a hair -- "The Prophet" and 
"Aggression" still sound particularly fresh and vital after nearly 35 years.

 ** Gerald Albright, "Smooth," Atlantic. Perhaps popularity is making Albright 
-- a talented hornman with a juicy sound on alto, tenor and soprano saxophones 
-- lazy.This date doesn't really deliver. On top of punchy R&B grooves and in 
between the here-then-gone vocals provided by the likes of Lalah Hathaway and 
Will Downing Jr., Albright offers predictably melodic, safe solos that, for the 
most part, fail to engage the listener. More stuff with whammy, like the 
opening of "Anniversary," where Albright sashays over a sax choir over-dub, is 
needed.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: THAT'S SHOW BIZ

 Some people were sure Madonna's career would suffer after her X-rated 
appearance on David Letterman's TV show. Obviously these people don't buy her 
records--but others still do. Her single "I'll Remember" is No. 2 on The Times' 
Southern California pop singles chart and No. 6 nationally. Reba McEntire 
dominates the country chart with two albums--her new one, "Read My Mind," which 
debuted at No. 1, and "Greatest Hits Vol. 2." (No. 6). The new top pop single 
in this region is "Regulate," by Warren G. and Nate Dogg, which vaulted up from 
No. 11. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,42,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last Week 1

ALBUM REVIEW; ***; PRETENDERS; "LAST OF THE INDEPENDENTS" ( WARNER BROS. )

 Chrissie Hynde's career trajectory has been too close to Orson Welles' for 
comfort: one of the greatest debuts ever, followed by gradually diminishing 
returns. Fortunately, her sixth marks a modest but healthy reversal of the 
downward slide that culminated in 1990's dispiriting "packed!" The first few 
"Last" tracks are winningest -- more moody than ferocious, but suggesting the 
tense grandeur that was the Pretenders at their early best. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually things do weigh down in Hynde's recent penchant for "adult 
contemporary." But in tougher moments she's got enough attitude for 10 riot 
grrrls and a child-bearer's feisty pride on top of it; it's a return to 
incidental-feminist form. Hear "I'm a Mother," her weakest melody but most 
audacious lyric -- "I'm the vessel of life / I've got the trauma to prove it / 
When it's time for me to labor for you / Everybody move it" -- and know there's 
nothing to add but, Yes'm . 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

POP EYE: JUST CALL PRINCE'S LATEST COLLECTION 'ROM 'N' ROLL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bruce Haring 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've got your compact disc player. You might even have a digital compact 
cassette player. So why buy a CD-ROM player? 
</P>
<P>
 For one, it's the only way to hear "Interactive," a new song from Prince 
(we've sworn off the symbol -- forever). It's on a new CD-ROM by the singer, 
titled "Prince Interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, which will be released June 7 by Prince in association with an 
Irvine multimedia firm called Graphix Zone, features the new song plus samples 
of 52 other Prince songs and three video clips: "Diamonds and Pearls," "Gett 
Off" and "Endorphinemachine." 
</P>
<P>
 Like interactive products from David Bowie, Todd Rundgren and Peter Gabriel, 
the disc allows users to remix the music and vocals of songs and review all 
sorts of Prince trivia. The disc retails for $59.95 (about the price of most 
CD-ROMs) and will be available at music and computer stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 11 million CD-ROM drives expected to be in U.S. homes by the 
end of the year, record companies are falling over themselves to be first on 
the block with new product. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the way this summer or fall: 
</P>
<P>
 * Compton's New Media, a Carlsbad firm, is putting together "Imagine," a 
CD-ROM that allows you to pore through hours of music and biographical data 
concerning John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Vid Grid" CD-ROM, a puzzle game similar to the popular vidgame Tetris 
that is built around the use of various rock videos. It'll be issued by Geffen 
and Jasmine Multimedia with Microsoft technology.  
</P>
<P>
 * An Aerosmith CD-ROM that features a plug-in guitar, where the user follows a 
game that ultimately leads to a chance to play with the band. Details are yet 
to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 On a budget scale, Yes will issue the first CD-ROM single in July. The disc, 
which is expected to retail for under $10, can be played in an audio CD player 
or through a CD-ROM drive. Audio cuts include the single "Walls" and a B-side 
to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimedia portion of the single will offer outtakes from the group's new 
album, "Talk," and interviews pertaining to the single. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD-ROM (the name means compact disc read-only memory ) is a disc 
resembling its audio cousin. They can only be played on CD-ROM "drives" that 
are found on many new computers and can be added to older ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But is this new product the future -- or is it the quadraphonic sound of the 
'90s? 
</P>
<P>
 Problems over which computer format to support (the IBM compatible or Apple's 
Macintosh) still exist. And there's also the question of whether to purchase 
other interactive platforms that attach to television sets, such as 3DO and 
Philips' CD-I. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is absolutely the time to get a CD-ROM drive," says Christian Joerg, vice 
president of new technologies at BMG in New York, though he notes, "one has to 
walk a fine line between hyping and reality. The reality is that the hardware 
is building up, so the demand for software is increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 Joerg anticipates that the first platinum CD-ROM (1 million units sold) will 
become reality next year. "You're already seeing in the game-oriented area 
sales of 500,000 units," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five, six years ago, hard drives were an option on computers," says Norman 
Beil, head of business affairs at Geffen Records and the idea man for Vid Grid. 
"Now we take it for granted. By the end of the year, people will say, 'How can 
you have a computer without a CD-ROM drive?' " Bruce Haring

 HOT RAP: To most pop fans, Nas' debut album came out of nowhere to enter the 
pop charts at a robust No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Who had ever heard of this 20-year-old from Long Island? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a lot of rap fans had heard of him -- and that's what Columbia 
Records was counting on for the collection to make a big splash. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been a buzz growing around the rapper -- at least in the Northeast 
-- since 1990 when he rapped on a single, "Live at the BBQ," that attracted 
lots of attention on the underground rap circuit. But the breakthrough for Nas 
was his track "Half Time" on last summer's "Zebrahead" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 To capitalize on the interest, Columbia planned to rush the album out in 
March, but it got pushed back a month even though reviews started appearing in 
various rap publications around the original scheduled release date. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that rap fans were reading something they couldn't buy proved to be 
an unintended sales booster. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the positive stories in the rap press -- like the incredible review in 
the Source magazine -- really had people revved up," says Columbia spokesman 
Miguel Baguer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bootleg tapes, concentrated in New York, also helped spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids had two to six tracks of the album long before it came out," 
Baguer says. "People would come up to him a month before it came out and tell 
him they loved this song or that song. The number of tapes out there may have 
been in the thousands.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some executives were nervous about the bootlegs because they were scared we'd 
lose a whole bunch of sales. When you're a debut artist, however, bootlegging 
can get your name out there a little faster -- if your stuff is really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the label is faced with rebuilding: The album dropped to No. 28 
in its second week. Dennis Hunt

 AND ONE MORE THING: If you plan to see the Rollins Band in concert this 
summer, don't expect to hear any songs from "The End of Silence" or any of the 
band's other old albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Leader Henry Rollins, who has been a striking underground presence since 
joining Black Flag in the early '80s, says the plan is for the band to play 
only new songs, including those featured in the just-released "Weight" 
album.The group, which is now touring Europe, will play at a KROQ-sponsored 
concert on June 11 at Irvine Meadows before starting its U.S. tour in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rollins isn't swearing off his old songs as David Bowie did a few years 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a new member in the band (bassist Melvin Gibbs), they felt the thing to 
do was to look forward and play the songs they'd written for the new record," 
said Rollins Band manager Richard Bishop. "But that's not to say they won't 
play old material in the future."*

 William Wyler's 1946 film from Robert Sherwood's script struck a deep and 
lasting note in audiences. It masterfully tells of the homecoming from World 
War II of several very different men living in the same small city and who face 
challenges adjusting to civilian life.They are banker Frederic March (left), 
soda jerk Dana Andrews (right) and nice guy Harold Russell, who now has hooks 
where his arms and hands used to be and is afraid to face his fiancee (Cathy 
O'Donnell). The great homecoming scene between March and Myrna Loy, who plays 
his wife, was inspired by Wyler's own return to his wife, the late Margaret 
Tallichet. With Teresa Wright (pictured), Virginia Mayo and Hoagy Carmichael 
(AMC Sunday 6 and 11 p.m.).

RESTAURANT NEWS: DIVE! TORPEDOES CENTURY CITY PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't even open to the public yet, but Steven Spielberg's new deli Dive! 
created havoc last Sunday in the Century City Shopping Center. While hundreds 
of angry would-be shoppers and moviegoers cruised the crowded parking lot, a 
practically deserted valet section stood chained off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were dozens, if not hundreds of blocked-off spaces sitting vacant," 
said one parking-space seeker. "It took me 20 minutes to find a space." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has had a small valet parking section for several years, but last 
week about 100 new valet spaces were added to accommodate an anticipated 
increase in traffic for the celebrity-backed sub shop, which was scheduled to 
open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard enough complaints about the big parking problem from my customers and 
managers that I drafted a letter to the mall first thing Monday morning," says 
Desmond Young, general manager of the busy AMC multiplex located near the valet 
parking lot. "I just had a meeting with the mall (Tuesday) voicing my 
displeasure with what was implemented. (The management) didn't give the tenants 
adequate notice or an adequate explanation of what they were trying to 
accomplish. I'm trying to look for better words than shoved down our throat. " 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Varela, general manager of Stage Deli in Century City, says that 
parking has always been a problem, and now more space devoted to valet parking 
due to the opening of Dive! will just make a bad situation worse. "I asked the 
mall what its plans were for Memorial Day weekend. 'The Flintstones' will 
playing here, you've got a major new tenant with all its public relations, and 
Bullock's and Broadway will be having Memorial Day sales," he says. "It's 
annoying. It's aggravating. But unfortunately there's not a whole lot we can do 
about it but voice our concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Gelson's marketers were also miffed at the parking situation. "It's 
inconvenient for a lot of shoppers in here," says assistant store manager 
Sergio Vasquez, "but there's nothing they can do, and there's nothing we can do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Calcaterra, retail manager for the Century City mall, can't see what all 
the fuss is about. Sure they've added more valet parking spaces because of 
Dive!, he says, "but it was the first day of a new system so obviously we are

 "(Dive!) will attract the kind of customer who is willing to spend that extra 
money for valet parking but they are also going to be at the mall and I'm sure 
that when they leave Dive! they're not going to go home -- they will shop." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great things about this mall is that we do provide a large amount 
of free parking," says AMC's Young. "To have a lot of those spaces converted to 
valet parking is against what we think this place is all about."

 CLOSING: Ciao Chow Express, the offbeat fusion of Italian and Chinese cuisines 
that Remi owner Jivan Tabibian opened seven months ago in Long Beach's Pine 
Square, has called it quits.

 ON BROADWAY: All those nasty rumors about Broadway Deli are false, says 
co-owner Bruce Marder. The Santa Monica deli -- now in its fourth year on Santa 
Monica's 3rd Street Promenade -- is not up for sale and co-owner Michel Richard 
has not sold his interest in the restaurant. "Michel consults on the food," 
says Marder, "and (co-owner) Marvin (Zeidler) and I do the wine shop." But the 
owners have made a few changes recently including reopening the wood-burning 
ovens (which were closed after the deli stopped baking many of its own breads), 
adding a coffee bar and a long table with newspapers and magazines, and 
reducing the grocery inventory. "Santa Monica's not like New York, where you go 
to a produce store and then stop by Balducci's for some cheese," says Marder. 
"People out here shop at the supermarket, and maybe do some impulse buying." So 
Broadway Deli now specializes in olive oils, vinegars, pastas, cheese, cookies, 
crackers . . . and other impulse items. 
</P>
<P>
 Marder also plans to to make a few changes at his West Beach Cafe, which 
celebrated its 15th anniversary in February. "I'm going to cover the patio with 
rollaway glass, change the menu and then lower the prices," he says. "I am 
going to become a rustic Italian/ French/ American/ Jewish restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 CHEFS MOVES: Arnaud Briand, who cooked Le Bernardin in New York and then at 
Caesar's Palace, will be heading back to New York to take over the kitchen at 
the luxurious Rainbow Room nightclub/restaurant on the 65th floor of RCA 
Building in Rockefeller Center.*

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ABBONDANZA IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "To share a more passionate and satisfying experience with a group of friends, 
you'd pretty much have to get naked," read the ad for Dominick's East Village 
in Long Beach. How could I resist? As we arrived, an obviously sated trio made 
their way down the steps. "We shouldn't have ordered three portions," one man 
groaned. Two of them, I couldn't help noticing, were toting doggie bags large 
enough to actually transport a canine. Packed and ready to go, these bona-fide 
shopping bags sat on table after table as diners lingered over their espresso, 
listening to nostalgic southern Italian songs from a courtly older gentleman's 
accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 The family-style retro-Italian-American restaurant is the latest dining 
concept from University Restaurant Group, which also owns Water Grill downtown 
and four other local restaurants. The site is that of the group's 555 East 
steakhouse, which closed briefly for renovations and reopened on April 25 -- ta 
dum! -- in a Little Italy guise with white-clothed tables, dark wood paneling 
and period photos of Old Blue Eyes, la Sophia, Lollobrigida and Anna Magnani. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that Dominick's serves expansively large portions is quite possibly an 
understatement. Tables are outfitted with Lazy Susans, the better to pass those 
big platters of spaghetti with meatballs, lasagna and osso buco. "Portions are 
very large," the waitress warns. We managed the mixed antipasto of cold cuts, 
jumbo stuffed artichoke and baked clams casino, but began to flag halfway 
through our hefty half-order of al dente spaghetti. Not to mention the equally 
large half-order of overcooked chicken with rosemary or the scampi with capers 
and lemon.  
</P>
<P>
 With wine, tax and tip, our bill came to over $40 a person (but then we had 
all that take-home). Family-style dinners for eight or more are the best deals: 
$18.95 per person includes your choice of two dishes from each menu category. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dominick's East Village, 555 E. Ocean Blvd. (at Linden), Long Beach. (310) 
437-0626. Pasta and entrees $9.50 to $23.95. Family-style dinners for eight or 
more $18.95 per person. S. IRENE VIRBILA

X, 'BITES' AND HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "When 'X' Doesn't Mark the Spot," by Patrick Goldstein (April 24): 
</P>
<P>
 After reading your article, I was reaffirmed in my beliefs about Hollywood's 
inept idea of what we so-called X-ers are and believe in. So, Hollywood, this 
is who I am. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a 23-year-old junior at Cal State Northridge. My major is radio/TV/film. 
I'm a Republican who voted for Bush twice. I believe in a woman's right to 
choose, the Constitution and Little League baseball. I believe Lincoln was our 
greatest President, and people are born good. I believe that power can corrupt 
and that corporate America doesn't give enough back. I also believe in the 
power of the volunteer, and that one man or woman can make a difference. I 
don't care what's politically correct or who wore what at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 I listen to "alternative music" as well as classic rock. I choose death before 
disco and hate "The Brady Bunch." I watch "Sports-center," "Seinfeld" and "Jon 
Stewart." I prefer the '80s to the '70s. I drive a beat-up VW. I'm a member of 
the Surfrider Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund. I feel all hippies grew 
up to be planet-destroying yuppies who only look out for themselves. I prefer 
Tim Burton, Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper over Tom Cruise and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, this is me, and for everyone like me there are 20 who aren't. If 
you think a simple marketing plan will bring all of us in, you're as wrong as 
we are different. Instead of trying to find this generation's "Graduate" or 
"American Graffiti," just make a film that is realistic and doesn't insult us 
with overgeneralizations. 
</P>
<P>
 RYAN J. GOODMAN 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Simple question: Why don't Generation X-ers see Generation X movies? Simple 
answer: Hollywood insults our intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too much to ask for an interesting, maybe even stimulating, film about 
us, about anyone? One can't expect the impossible. One can't expect Hollywood 
to remove its slick, glamorized, commercialized gold lenses and create 
original, insightful, imaginative work. One can't expect Hollywood to prize art 
before the dollar. Keep dreaming. We want art, but Hollywood doesn't make art; 
art isn't a lucrative industry. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't see Hollywood's stupid films, because we know they're stupid. 
Hollywood has disappointed us too many times with the painfully embarrassing 
and formulaic crap they call movies. Of course there are exceptions, but good 
films are rare, bad ones are ubiquitous. Ditto for television and its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If a movie features Johnny Depp, Christian Slater or Winona Ryder, regardless 
of its content, it's a "Generation X" flick. If we cannot escape this label, 
let's at least define it responsibly. Hollywood treats us like a gimmick. Is it 
so mysterious, then, that we refuse to see its garbage? 
</P>
<P>
 If the studios want our money, give us quality. It makes no difference whether 
a movie is about Generation X, geriatrics, Germans or Gumby. A great film's 
themes transcend its particular subject and story line. 
</P>
<P>
 SHERRY WALSH 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 There's a no mystery to why Generation X movies aren't selling. This is a 
generation on hard times in a way that mirrors the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we remember the important "social commentary" pictures of that era, but 
by and large they were not popular successes, because then as now, troubled 
audiences crave not a rehashing of their problems but an escape from them -- 
whether in the guise of "Gunga Din" or "The Fugitive." Perhaps the purveyors of 
Generation X Angst should run Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels" and learn a 
little more about what depressed people want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, when box-office dollars started dropping after the crash of Wall 
Street, the studios were quick to respond to audiences' need for a better 
entertainment deal by cutting ticket prices and instituting double features. 
Today, exhibitors have, instead of cutting ticket prices, cut their own 
throats, by giving more and more of the business away to the video stores. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I am a 29-year-old cultural historian with, as yet, a merely clinical interest 
in Generation X fare. I would also like to offer some tips on why films like 
"Reality Bites" leave audiences cold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '80s, baby boomers used movies such as "The Big Chill" to 
romanticize the '60s and to define youth itself as a moral and generational 
attribute -- theirs. Unfortunately, Generation X -- both movie-makers and 
moviegoers -- bought into this formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Young people are characterized on screen as moral and emotional 
ciphers, pawns of the ultra-conventional love-triangle plot (e.g., Winona 
Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller), while actual twentysomething filmgoers 
prefer movies about the '60s. Young people in Generation X films are not young 
people. They are old, cynical people who look like androgynous adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative self-scrutiny is required here, Hollywood. The important questions 
are: When the status of being "between high school and getting married" is 
common among fortysomethings no less than twentysomethings, what happens to the 
meaning of youth and age? And what happens to relations between the sexes? 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma of Generation X, effectively represented via comedy, drama or 
whatever, would focus not on love triangles or "overeducation and 
underemployment" but upon the struggle over the meaning and status of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 ANNE-MARIE SCHOLZ 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 After racking my too hip and jaded brain, I'm wondering if the reason no one's 
going to these Generation X movies -- and I hope you'll pardon my overeducated 
and underemployed post-baby-boomer cynicism -- is because they're bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reality Bites" executive producer Stacey Sher didn't make "a really good 
movie for people who can't afford to see it." She made a shallow and creatively 
bankrupt borefest that deservedly fell prey to substandard word of mouth. 
Studio heads and producers shouldn't blame cable TV, VCRs or high ticket prices 
for poor box office. The blame lands squarely on their own shoulders for 
green-lighting inferior product. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called youth films like "The Graduate," "Five Easy Pieces," and "MASH" 
appealed to audiences of all ages because of brilliant writing and innovative 
direction. That's right, amazingly enough, it was the talent that made those 
films popular. Mike Nichols, Bob Rafelson, Robert Altman . . . Ben Stiller. 
Maybe the generation everyone's aiming for simply feels it deserves better. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT TILEM 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 For me, at 28, the prospect of enduring two hours of Angst- ridden 
pseudo-intellectuals is about as exciting as watching "thirty-something" 
reruns: Oh, boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the characters in movies aimed at my generation are ex-hippies without 
the ponytail. They wallow in self-pity, rejoice in LSD flashbacks and wonder 
how the ideas in their "little red book" turned into tanks in Tian An Men 
Square. The whiny brats of "Reality Bites" are no different from the 
bed-hopping boomers of "The Big Chill," and Hollywood should rid all of us of 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather see films that embody the qualities that will carry us through the 
Clintonian future we face: independence, self-reliance and a strong sense of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 For my money, I'll rent "Rudy," "Working Girl," "Swing Kids" and "Flashdance." 
They may not be classics, but at least they offer a bit of heroism in an age 
when we need all the heroes we can get. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOTT HOLLERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 As I read your list of films made for Gen X-ers in the past five years I was 
surprised that the most successful one was omitted. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about a major blockbuster that has spawned a sequel, embraces the 
slacker subculture, has strong ties to campy '70s TV as did "Reality Bites" and 
the others on your list, and caused people of my generation (and the ones above 
and below) to flock to the theaters across the land and even abroad. Of course 
I'm speaking of "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
 Although I loved "Reality Bites," it seems pretty clear that the post-boomers 
or whatever you want to call us would rather pay $7.50 for some lite comedy 
than shell out hard-earned cash to wallow in mid-20s Angst . We can do that at 
home for free. 
</P>
<P>
 EJ KAVOUNAS 
</P>
<P>
 Playa del Rey 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Goldstein tried to discover why the twentysomethings of today aren't 
going to see the movies targeted toward them, specifically "Reality Bites." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Goldstein failed at his task and in fact unknowingly restated in the 
format of his piece what I see as the main problem. He carefully arranged his 
quotations to fit in convenient thought categories and put trite headlines 
above each. 
</P>
<P>
 What Goldstein doesn't realize is that's what kept people away from "Bites." 
There was so much Diet Coke drinking and commercial jingle quoting in this film 
that it was rather offensive to anyone of that age group. 
</P>
<P>
 I was born in 1973 and raised on microwave dinners and prime-time television, 
but I have tried to transcend these things through reading and creating. What 
the makers of "Reality Bites" have portrayed is people who have been broken by 
the '70s and '80s. I think we are stronger than that, and I certainly think 
that anyone at my age is capable of reading a full-length article without 
kitschy titles to help them through it.

 No matter how often we've seen it, if it's done right -- as this 1992 film was 
-- there's something endlessly watchable about violence-prone young lovers 
fighting off a fatalistic universe. Borrowing its title (here shortened to one 
word) and some broad concepts from Joseph Lewis's 1949 film noir classic and 
"Bonnie and CLyde," first-time director Tamra Davis and writer Matthew Bright 
have brought an empathetic approach to this latest version.Its small central 
California town setting is so drab and listless that many of its males view 
16-year-old Anita (Drew Barrymore, right, with Ione Skye) as their primary 
source of entertainment. Anita is a study in isolation and despair when she 
begins a pen-pal relationship with an equally bereft prisoner (James LeGros) 
who has a violent past (Showtime Thursday at 10:05 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes, charming and believably athletic, are the 
Laurel and Hardy of the half-court game, a couple of champs at pick-up 
basketball.Graced with good humor comic energy, they overcome sizable script 
problems and turn Ron Shelton's 1992 film into a sassy and profane urban fairy 
tale that finds laughs in some very clever places. As Harrelson's "Jeopardy!" 
junkie girlfriend, Rosie Perez emerges as a screen original. With her 
high-pitched squeal and wacky elocution, she sounds like a barrio Betty Boop 
with a touch of Elmer Fudd (HBO Friday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; POLLY BERGEN PULLS A LOVE TRIANGLE OUT OF STORAGE FOR 
NBC MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, Emmy Award-winning Polly Bergen ("The Helen Morgan Story," 
"Winds of War" and "War and Remembrance") had two feature films in development. 
Neither was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one at Warners and one at Metro," recalls Bergen, who made her movie 
debut opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in 1950's "At War With the Army." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had written both stories, but there's a big leap from writing a story to 
getting a screenwriter or a TV writer who can bring that story to life in a 
script. In both cases, I was not thrilled with the scripts as they came in. One 
film, in fact, the studio accepted the script and wanted to film it. I owned 
the rights and hated the script, so I just pulled the project." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bergen soon pulled out of the producing biz. "I ended up getting married 
and got involved in a lot of business, so I ended up putting (the stories) 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 But last year Bergen, 64, felt the urge to produce again. "I suddenly decided 
that I really wanted to get into it seriously now at this point in my life and 
at my age. I started pulling out projects." 
</P>
<P>
 One was a love story, "Leave of Absence," which, Bergen says, is her personal 
favorite. "This was one I had not attempted to sell before. It was strange, 
because I realized I could not play (the character) because almost 18 years had 
passed. I knew it was a very solid story." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen thought about selling it as a feature. "Suddenly, I thought, 'Why go 
through that?' I think it's much more interesting as a television film. There 
aren't many movies being made for TV which are like this film. It's really an 
adult love story. It's every man's dream and every woman's nightmare. By and 
large, they don't do love stories for television. They do car chases, they do 
child abuse, they do murders, they do robberies. I think it's about time we did 
some of these. I'm just thrilled that one of the early ones is going to be 
mine.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave of Absence," which airs Wednesday on NBC, stars Brian Dennehy as a 
happily married man, Blythe Danner as his loving wife -- the role Bergen 
envisioned for herself -- and Jacqueline Bisset as his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a study of people, none of whom you want to end up being the heavy," 
Bergen says. "Yet, there are things in the story that automatically say that 
this person is a good guy and this person is a bad guy. But there are no good 
guys and no bad guys. There's just life. It is what we have to deal with every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen says she came up with the idea after discovering via her own life 
experiences and those of others she's known that a person can be in love with 
two people at the same time for entirely different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this story is about," Bergen says. "I don't want to give the 
story away, but this is a guy who is an honest guy. The minute he goes to bed 
with (Bisset), the very next day he goes to his wife and says, 'I am having an 
affair.' He is devastated by his own action, but is incapable of not committing 
the action. It becomes this terrible story of three people who are caught up in 
passions that none of them can change. Then, natural events in life change 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she was no longer right for the lead, Bergen, who is co-executive 
producer, has a small part in her film. "I play my mother," she says, laughing. 
"I play the mother of the character I originally wrote for myself. I play 
Blythe's mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen says she didn't have any intention of being in the movie. But the 
writer, Betty Goldberg, had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made her mind up she was going to write a part in it for me," Bergen 
says. "When she turned in the script I read it. She said, 'I want you to play 
the mother.' I said, 'No. I don't want to act in it because I am going to be 
producing. I don't want my attention to be divided. Ultimately, the director 
said, 'Polly. You are perfect for it.' And I was perfect for it, because it had 
been written for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave of Absence" airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on NBC.

FOCUS; GOSSETT, P.I.; NBC MOVIE OFFERS A DETECTIVE WITH CHARM AROUND THE EDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a lot of Louis Gossett Jr. in Ray Alexander, the detective-restaurant 
owner he plays in "Ray Alexander: A Taste for Justice." The thriller, which 
also stars James Coburn and Ossie Davis, premieres this week on the "NBC Friday 
Night Mystery Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is the owner of Ray's Backyard Cafe, an eclectic San Francisco 
restaurant. Though the establishment is Alexander's pride and joy, it's also a 
cash guzzler. To make money, Alexander takes on high-risk, high-profile private 
investigator jobs while Uncle Phil (Davis) manages the restaurant. Alexander 
does his PI work for noted San Francisco attorney Jeffrey Winslow (Coburn). 
</P>
<P>
 "All the things I love, I do in this," says the winner of an Emmy ("Roots") 
and Oscar ("An Officer and a Gentleman"). "I have my friends around. I cook. My 
dream is to have a restaurant. I think that's going to happen by the end of the 
year. I think it's going to be in Arizona. That's where I got my offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching "Ray Alexander" to NBC was a piece of cake, says Gossett, who has a 
production deal with Viacom. "My partner is Perry Simon, who is the head of 
Viacom. He used to be at NBC. We went straight up to the main people and we 
pitched it." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-executive producer Dean Hargrove ("Perry Mason," "Columbo") believes 
Alexander is a unique private investigator. "We think that he's a very engaging 
character," Hargrove notes. "There is quite a bit of humor. I came up with the 
notion and took it to him. He felt that it was something he was very 
comfortable with. We went from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove also wanted to create a character with whom everyone could identify. 
"Columbo is very much an Everyman," he says. "I wanted to get a character that 
people could relate to that has the same problems that everybody has." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossett fleshed out Alexander. "He really created a character as he got into 
it," Hargrove explains. "He gave the guy a lot of humor and a style -- in terms 
of humor, the way the guy operates and the kind of moves he gives him in his 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie also explores Alexander's unique evolution into a PI. A social 
activist in the 1960s, Alexander was president of the Black Students Union at a 
fictitious San Francisco college. "The cops didn't like me, so they framed me," 
Gossett says of his character. "I was found guilty of killing a cop. I was in 
prison for four years and then a hotshot lawyer took my case and proved my 
innocence. I became a PI for him. He was one of those long-haired lawyers and 
now he's very famous and very rich. I saved up enough money for the restaurant, 
but I don't charge my friends. So we need money all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's real interest, says James Coburn, is cooking. "I hire him to do 
some investigation, but he really doesn't want to do that. He would rather look 
for the perfect soft-shell crab recipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Coburn's Jeffrey Winslow is described as a high-octane defense attorney, "but 
what he turns out to be is kind of a wise-ass with a lot of charm and he seems 
to knew where everything is," says the former "Our Man Flint." "He's gone from 
being very idealistic to almost a cynic, but not quite." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossett and Coburn have been friends for nearly 30 years, but "Ray Alexander" 
marks the first time they've worked together. The men, Coburn says, have a 
great relationship. And so do Alexander and Winslow. "They have a relationship 
that has to do with understanding each other, where we can play up each other's 
faults and flaws and play with each other. That's fun because when you are 
working with a great actor like Lou, you just look at each other and have a 
smile on your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence is kept to a minimum in "Ray Alexander." "There's always a little 
action," says Gossett, who also is executive producer. "But there's more wit. 
More of his personality. My personality. I get a chance to be a little funny. I 
think it is kind of a breath of fresh air how he handles things." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Coburn: "It's more using the mind rather than using the guns. If the 
characters are good, the audiences don't need all of this running around 
shooting, killing and stabbing." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Gossett and company plan to make two more "Ray Alexander" 
movies for NBC's "Mystery Wheel." "If NBC wants more, it will be my pleasure," 
Gossett says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of each episode, "we are going to have somebody famous sing 
in my restaurant," Gossett says. "We just finished with Ray Charles, so that is 
a nice little charm thing. We can get all of my friends in the music business 
to come through." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray Alexander: A Taste for Justice" airs Friday at 9 p.m. on NBC.

PROFILE; MOLLY'S TRAVELS; ACTRESS WHO LIVES IN PARIS STARS IN U.S. MINISERIES 
AS A NEW WORLD SURVIVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Molly Ringwald is alive and well and living in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago she was everyone's favorite all-American teen-ager, thanks to her 
winning performances in John Hughes' popular comedies: "Sixteen Candles," "The 
Breakfast Club" and "Pretty in Pink." But two years ago the actress packed her 
bags and left Los Angeles for the City of Light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Paris a couple of years ago to work," Ringwald explains. "I was 
just so happy there. It was during the summer and the sun goes down at 10 at 
night. The whole city just seemed alive. I wanted to see what it felt like 
living outside of America and get a different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringwald acknowledges it's been a bit tough playing the expatriate role, 
mainly because of the language barrier. But she's currently going to French 
class four hours a day. "I am getting to be fairly bilingual. Living in Paris 
has its own set of problems I have to deal with, but those problems, compared 
with living in L.A., to me are much better. Living as a celebrity or a famous 
person in L.A. can really get you down after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 And she desperately craved a a normal life. "The films that I did were 
released in France, but they didn't have the impact, obviously, they had here 
because all of the John Hughes films were so American. So I can walk around and 
just be normal. I can breathe ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringwald's in Los Angeles to visit her family and promote her latest project, 
"The Stand." ABC's ambitious eight-hour miniseries of the Stephen King novel 
chronicles a future world where a deadly flu has wiped out most of the 
population. The survivors are divided into two camps: those who seek a new 
beginning on Earth and those who are loyal to a satanic demon in blue jeans 
named Randall Flagg (Jamey Sheridan). Ringwald, Gary Sinise, Ray Walston, Rob 
Lowe, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee are among the benevolent survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 This late afternoon, Ringwald is nursing a cup of coffee at the Bistro Gardens 
in Studio City. She's definitely grown up. In fact, at age 26, there's an air 
of European sophistication about the actress these days. Her hair, which she 
dyed red in the '80s, is back to its natural dark brown. Her trendy, often 
outrageous, clothes have given way to a tailored, stylish look. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting up a cigarette, she acknowledges she "kind of just turned off" inside 
during her heyday. "Life was happening around me. I can't really say how much I 
felt, because I couldn't. It was overwhelming. I was just caught in a tornado 
that was going very fast and uncontrollably. It was nothing I planned. I am 
glad (the movies) did well." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, she says, their success "kind of stunted me. Everything 
came to a screeching halt when it was time to grow up. That's hard. It's hard 
enough to grow up, anyway. The normal thing is to work your way, to train, to 
prepare yourself for what you want to do. You are not supposed to accomplish it 
at that age. I had to deal with growing out of those movies and growing up. It 
was tough. If I hadn't moved to France, I would have gone somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Her post-Hughes films, including "Betsy's Wedding," "The Pick-Up Artist" and 
"King Lear" have not performed well at the box office. But Ringwald doesn't 
regret making any of those films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a million different people telling me what I should do," Ringwald says 
matter-of-factly. " I think I need to do what I feel like I should. Those films 
(I did) were interesting to me. Some of them didn't turn out the way I wanted 
them to turn out. I don't so much regret the choices that I made. There was a 
reason for it. Maybe now, maybe knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have made 
the same choices. But I think everything is a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringwald laughs. "Let's face it, actors are severely overpaid anyway. It's not 
like I need to make a film and have it make a ton of money. That's not what I 
need to survive. I think what I need to survive is to do things I feel good 
about, that are interesting to me, and I feel like I am challenging myself, 
like I am working myself." 
</P>
<P>
 And she doesn't necessarily mean just acting. "If I can sit down and write and 
express myself in any way artistically, I feel like it is worthwhile," Ringwald 
says. "I've always been writing since I was young. My mother told me there were 
three things I excelled at when I was young and that was singing, writing and 
acting. It just happens that one of them took off and I became known as that. 
But writing is something that interests me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringwald has continued acting since moving to Paris, but in very 
non-commercial projects, including a French-English production called "Seven 
Sundays," which, she says, will be released here later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringwald took the decidedly high-profile "The Stand," she says, because she 
needed to balance the non-commercial "with things people see. People get very 
testy with me sometimes when they see me on the street. They say, 'Why haven't 
I seen you in something?' They are mad because I was such a staple in people's 
minds. I thought this would be a chance to do something people would be able to 
see, and then I can still do all the other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen King's The Stand" airs Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 9 
p.m. on ABC.

RETRO; RICHARD DEAN ANDERSON; PRODUCING MACSEQUELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mac is back! 
</P>
<P>
 "MacGyver," that is. 
</P>
<P>
 When we last saw our intrepid hero two years ago, he was riding off into the 
syndication sunset after seven seasons on ABC. "MacGyver," which starred 
Richard Dean Anderson, was a most unusual action-adventure series. Mac was a 
former Special Forces agent working for a think tank; he used his amazing 
intellect instead of brute force to right wrongs and defend the world every 
week from the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to popular demand, Anderson, 44, has reprised the role that made him 
famous, making two ABC movies with his alter ego in the title. The first, 
"MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis," premieres Saturday. Shot in England and 
Greece, the Saturday matinee-type adventure finds Mac on an archeological dig 
to locate a legendary fortune. Anderson, who also is executive producer of the 
movies, will be seen later this year in "MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota native got his first big acting break back in 1976 when he was 
cast as Dr. Jeff Webber on the ABC daytime drama "General Hospital." Before 
"MacGyver" he also appeared in the short-lived CBS series "Seven Brides for 
Seven Brothers" and "Emerald Point, N.A.S." The co-founder of the Hollywood 
Celebrity All-Star Hockey Team, Anderson has also starred in the TV movies 'In 
The Eyes of a Stranger" and "Through the Eyes of a Killer." 
</P>
<P>
 The easygoing actor discussed "MacGyver," as well as the trials and 
tribulations of being a producer, with Times Staff Writer Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the "MacGyver" movies come about? 
</P>
<P>
 After the series was canceled, the audience reaction was such that ABC came to 
Paramount, who came to me and asked if I would be interested in doing what is 
known as a "wheel" on the same level as "Columbo." They wanted me to do six of 
them. I said, "How about if we start with two?" 
</P>
<P>
 Once the series was canceled, it was kind of a matter of taking steps forward 
(in my career), as opposed to laterally or backward. My partner and I had 
negotiated this deal with Paramount to develop and produce and star in my own 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The two "MacGyver" movies were the first production entities my company, gekko 
film corp., produced. We were in charge of all aspects of production, from 
script to post-production. Also, I love Europe so I told the writers to write 
(the settings in Europe). 
</P>
<P>
 How do you like being a producer? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in a position that, I think, every actor may aspire to be. I'm sort of in 
control of my fate. I get to develop and star in my own projects. It's kind of 
a two-edged sword situation. I'm finding, having been in this for more than a 
year and a half, the political aspect, the bureaucracy and the salesmanship are 
a real pain. The upshot of it is that I'm discovering or reinforcing the notion 
that I'm more a blue-collar man than white-collar. I like having a call sheet. 
I like having cameras around. I like having that communal feeling of having a 
crew and being in actual production. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it fun to step back into MacGyver's shoes after more than a year away? 
</P>
<P>
 It was nice. It was a very comfortable situation to know the character so 
well. I didn't have to worry about that aspect of it, so I could spend more 
time behind the camera and dealing with the production aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think "MacGyver" has remained so popular in syndication because he used 
his brain to solve problems and get out of dangerous situations? 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, that was part of the hook because it was atypical TV hero stuff. 
There was something charming and attractive about that sort of almost Everyman 
doing extraordinary things. There must be something very universal about that 
because it translates to different languages, different cultures. It has been 
in 71 different foreign markets for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you feel about being satirized on Fox's "The Simpsons?" Marge's 
sisters, Patty and Selma, love to watch "MacGyver." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two things that I'm convinced made my career complete. The first one 
was being sent up in Mad magazine. They did a spoof of "MacGyver" called 
"MacGimmick." They absolutely skewered us to death and they were right on. I 
was ecstatic because it's my favorite magazine since childhood. I actually sent 
them a letter thanking them. The second thing that has made my life complete is 
being on "The Simpsons," or actually referred to on "The Simpsons" by the two 
sisters to the point where I would love to be on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you going to do another series? 
</P>
<P>
 I have to. It's part of my deal (with Paramount). I am actively looking. We 
have one in development now being written which we will shop around. We shopped 
around a similar concept to all the networks and nobody wanted to buy into it. 
The concept dealt with the feared "J" word -- journalism. It had to do with a 
crime reporter. We found through our research and reactions from all the 
networks that journalism doesn't sell. People are not sympathetic to 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma I have come across of late, at this stage in my career as a 
producer, is that (the networks) want women-driven, family-oriented shows. 
Subsequently, trying to find a concept that works for me personally, being a 
guy. ... I'm not adverse to adventure. It's my favorite format. But time 
marches on and you want to try other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC; repeats 
of "MacGyver" air weekdays at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on USA.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JUDY ROSENER: CORPORATE SURVIVAL DEMANDS FULL USE OF 
A DIVERSE WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ROSENER, JUDY ROSENER is a professor in the Graduate School of 
Management at UC Irvine. She is co-author of Workforce America! Managing 
Employee Diversity as a Vital Resource. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the country, organizations are restructuring, re-engineering and 
reinventing -- buzzwords that describe a desire to become more flexible and 
adaptable. These efforts are a response to technological advances and a global 
marketplace in which traditional organizational structures, power 
relationships, work arrangements and leadership styles are being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, most corporations have had hierarchical structures with 
vertical power relationships, 40-hour workweeks, face-to-face supervision and 
top-down decision making. Efficiency was more highly valued than flexibility 
because efficiency implied productivity; indeed, efficiency and flexibility 
were seen as incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, flexibility is directly tied to corporate survival. Business alliances 
require structures that look more like spider webs than pyramids. And 
computers, cellular phones and fax machines make it possible for employees to 
work in a wide variety of settings, shattering the notion of working in one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 As organizations become more horizontal, management is more likely to be 
collegial, consensual and consultative. And as power becomes more diffused, 
managers will need to find new ways to supervise and monitor employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the buzzwords of organizational change have become part of the 
corporate lexicon, there remains widespread resistance to change. This is 
understandable. Sharing power, control and information is a new experience for 
many executives, which is why off-site or home-based work and self-directed 
teams are still the exception to the rule. The inability to observe employees 
directly means the empowerment of others and building trust -- skills not often 
taught in business school -- have become important. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as corporate leaders struggle with information, power and control issues, 
shifting demographics require that they also deal with cultural diversity. But 
while most corporations see "reinventing" as a corporate economic imperative, 
cultural diversity is seen as a social equity concern of lower priority. To 
recruit and retain the best and the brightest, organizations need to make all 
employees -- regardless of sex, skin color, physical condition or sexual 
orientation -- feel valued and fully utilized. However, the financial costs of 
not doing so are poorly understood. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Re-engineering and diversity issues are not perceived as related. 
Making corporations more adaptable to rapid change is the responsibility of 
CEOs, while addressing the issue of cultural diversity is the responsibility of 
the company's human resources department. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the two have a symbiotic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have to do with the competitive advantage of using people effectively. 
Both require similar change strategies -- issue awareness, organizational 
audits, philosophical change, modified policies and practices, evaluation and 
monitoring. By definition, efforts to make organizations more flexible make 
them less tied to traditional rules and performance measures and more inclined 
to policies and practices that are inclusive rather than exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, as executives become more like spiders in the middle of a web 
than captains on a ship, they are confronted with the need to value diversity 
in work arrangements as well as management styles. No longer can they depend 
only on those who look and act like them. As performance increasingly is 
measured in terms of team rather than individual behavior, cooperative rather 
than adversarial relationships and output rather than "fitting in," managers 
must think and act in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charles Schwab brokerage firm understands the link between addressing 
diversity issues and achieving organizational change. Hugo Quackenbush, senior 
vice president, says that as Schwab steps back to review its business 
processes, it configures the desired outcome to include the power of a diverse 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Schwab has discovered that the most efficient way to handle its 
customer transactions is in large, central telephone centers. In setting up the 
centers, the firm has incorporated on-site training of Latinos and African 
Americans -- people who don't usually regard the brokerage business as a career 
opportunity. That's because Schwab doesn't see diversity as an affirmative 
action issue. It sees it as a way to take advantage of an underutilized labor 
pool and gain a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 As organizations such as Schwab start measuring success in terms other than 
assimilation, there is an unleashing of human potential. When employees are 
given freedom to work in the ways most comfortable for them, they become more 
innovative and productive. It is no surprise that firms that adopt flextime and 
flex-place policies are those where diversity is seen as a resource rather than 
a problem. They are also the firms with low absenteeism, low turnover, high 
productivity and high worker loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate leaders who understand and build on the symbiosis between increasing 
corporate flexibility and addressing cultural diversity will have an economic 
advantage over those who do not. For the two issues are compatible -- they go 
hand in hand. Treating them together in an overall corporate change strategy is 
not only socially desirable, it is efficient and fiscally responsible.

MANAGED-CARE COMPANIES NEED TO WISE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Weinberg, executive vice president of WellPoint Health Systems, was 
quoted in "Study Says California HMOs Spend Up to 31% on Overhead," (April 7) 
as saying, "The No. 1 goal of managed-care companies is to negotiate lower 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this quote accurately sums up the attitude of many, if not most, 
administrators of managed-care businesses.It's a shameful attitude. Listen up, 
Weinberg! The No. 1 goal of anyone involved in health care should be quality, 
compassionate health care. I know that is not what they teach you in MBA 
school, but that's what we learn in medicine and nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need astronomical CEO salaries, expensive ad campaigns, multiplying 
managed-care bureaucracies and mean-spirited "gatekeepers" who act more like 
"goalies" trying to stop rather than deliver health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Until you and your ilk get these simple facts straight, you are going to cause 
nothing but misery for the patient and trouble for yourselves. Consider, for 
example, the jury award of $89 million against Health Net for denying a medical 
service to its customers that it provided to its executives. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better features of the proposed Clinton plan is that it would allow 
the consumer to jettison a health plan like yours for squandering 31% of income 
on non-medical expenditures and move on to a more responsible care provided 
without penalty.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW CO-OPS DIFFER FROM CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. What are the essential differences between a condominium and a cooperative? 
Are there any inherent advantages to one over the other? R.S.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The major difference between a condo and a co-op comes down to ownership. 
When you buy a condominium, you actually purchase the unit you will inhabit. At 
the same time, you either get the right to use the common areas of the complex 
or a fraction, or share, of that property equal to your proportionate interest 
in the project. When you buy into a cooperative, you are purchasing a share in 
a corporation that owns the building housing your unit. At the same time, you 
receive a long-term lease on "your" unit and the right to use the common areas 
of your building. 
</P>
<P>
 Is one any better than the other? Not really. However, you will find it more 
difficult to find and purchase co-ops in California. Why? Because there are 
fewer co-ops than condos in the state, and lenders are not as equipped or as 
accustomed to making loans on them. In addition, because foreclosing against 
delinquent cooperative buyers could be more difficult, mortgage rates are often 
higher for co-ops in California than for condos. Given these realities, 
developers naturally choose to build a project whose financing and sales will 
face fewer potential obstacles -- so the relative dearth of co-ops in the state 
is perpetuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, there is no significant advantage to one type of housing over the 
other from a legal or regulatory standpoint. However, the California Assn. of 
Realtors advises that there can be significant distinctions in the treatment of 
the two in the zoning ordinances of individual communities in regard to such 
things as parking, rent control and open-space requirements. Before making a 
purchase of either type of home, you would be wise to look up the community's 
applicable zoning laws. Transferring Equity in the Family Home 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My parents and I jointly own a home that is held in their name only. Now I 
would like to get my money out of that home to purchase another for me and my 
family. Is there any way I can use my ownership of my parents' home as 
collateral for the purchase of my own home? -- K.M.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. A lender is highly unlikely to accept your proposition. After all, your 
name isn't even on the deed of your parents' home. What kind of collateral is 
that? Furthermore, a lender will want you to have an equity stake -- that means 
making a down payment -- in the house you are purchasing. Your best bet is to 
persuade your parents to cash out your investment in their house. Assuming your 
parents have sufficient equity in the home and the income to handle the 
payments, they could get the money to pay you off fairly easily through a 
mortgage refinancing or even a home equity loan. Moving 401(k) Funds Without 
Tax Penalty 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When I quit my old job several years ago, I left my 401(k) account with my 
former employer. Now I would like to withdraw this money and manage it myself. 
How can I do this? Are there any restrictions as to how it can be invested? -- 
J.D.P .

 A. Quitting a job is one of the few ways taxpayers have of gaining access to 
their 401(k) savings accounts before age 59 1/2 without paying an 
early-withdrawal penalty. However, you must understand that in order to avoid 
such penalties -- a 10% levy on the principal by the Internal Revenue Service 
and a 2.5% fee due the state of California -- your 401(k) funds must be 
transferred to an individual retirement account. Although IRAs are subject to 
the same early-withdrawal regulations as 401(k) accounts, taxpayers are allowed 
to manage IRA accounts on their own without direct or indirect involvement of 
an employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Be advised that under rules effective in January, 1993, taxpayers cashing out 
of a previous employer's 401(k) or other qualified pension plan will be slapped 
with a 20% withholding tax on the disbursement if they take possession of the 
money rather than have it transferred directly to another qualified employer 
pension plan or individual retirement account. This means you must first decide 
where you want to establish your IRA account and then have your former employer 
transfer your 401(k) proceeds directly into your new IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, you would be wise to establish a separate IRA for your transferred 
401(k) funds. You do not want to mingle these funds with other IRA accounts, in 
case you might later want to transfer the money into a 401(k) plan offered by a 
new employer to take advantage of the special five-year or 10-year 
income-averaging allowances you may be eligible to claim. (Withdrawals directly 
from IRA accounts do not qualify for income averaging.) 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of investments may you make with your self-directed IRA? Your 
choices are almost unlimited. You can't put your money into collectibles, such 
as coins, art, precious metals or antiques. And you certainly wouldn't want to 
invest in tax-free municipal bonds, because IRA earnings are already tax-free 
and there's no sense in accepting lower earnings for a benefit you don't need. 
Beyond that, you can deposit your IRA into virtually any type of investment you 
want through a brokerage firm, bank, savings and loan, credit union, insurance 
company or financial services company.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: FOR MOMS, WHO KNOW WHAT TRUE LOVE IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, I will probably make dinner for my mother, tell her that I love her and 
that it thrills me to see her with my daughter -- her grandchild -- to whom she 
is so tenderly devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 I will probably thank God my mother is alive after a critical illness last 
year, then snap at her when she gets on my nerves. I will probably wonder how 
the emotions of a seemingly sane, loving daughter can zing between love and 
irritability without good reason, like a pinball in play. 
</P>
<P>
 And I will probably be stung by remorse, until I remind myself that passion, 
in all its forms, is what this most primal of connections is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
 There is never any real resolution between mothers and children, nor should 
there be, I suppose, because this great roller coaster of a relationship is 
eternal. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen my mother hovering at death's door. Or maybe it was death hovering 
at hers. Such moments suck the adult right out of you, leaving only a teary 
child pleading for her mommy.  
</P>
<P>
 My pleas, fortunately, were answered. And I promise I will try not to snap at 
her today. 
</P>
<P>
 As I gratefully spend the day with my mom, I would also like to offer my 
appreciation to a laundry list (how appropriate) of mothers I know, all of whom 
have taught me a thing or two about love. 
</P>
<P>
 So Happy Mother's Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Kathleen, a motherless child, who gave birth to a beautiful boy one year 
ago: You struggle every day with the memory of your own mother, who killed 
herself when you were only 8, and you prove every day, with your fierce love 
for your son, that children can triumph over legacies of pain. You inspire me. 
</P>
<P>
 To the teen mothers at the Business Industry School in Los Angeles, young 
women who have taken on the greatest responsibility of all, and often by 
accident: By staying in school and taking advantage of the extraordinary 
child-care center on your campus, you are proving that the circle can be 
broken. You are living examples of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 To Julie, pregnant now with a boy, who has decided that parenthood must not be 
missed, even if there is no man with whom to share it -- at least not right 
now: You can't possibly know the struggles and turmoil that await you as a 
single mother, but the goodness and generosity you have shown your friends over 
the years will surely be repaid when you need them. And you will need them. 
</P>
<P>
 To Kathryn, the frustrated mother of an adolescent girl all but abandoned by 
her affluent father: Your fight for what is rightfully your child's -- 
thousands upon thousands of dollars in back child support -- now spans oceans 
with his move to another country. Yet you persist, while facing poverty, 
illness and a callous legal system that has let you down time and again. Your 
tenacity will, and must, be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 To Janie, who has known financial struggles that would make mere mortals weep: 
Although the demons prowled at your door, you created a safe, magical cocoon 
for your 4-year-old daughter, a spirited, loving child with an imagination as 
big as her mother's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 To Guillermina, who came to this country illegally at 15 to give her unborn 
children a better life: Terrified but determined, you crossed a river that rose 
to your chin and nearly suffocated in the trunk of a car to get here. You are 
legal now, you own a home and pay your taxes. And you are the mother of two 
beautiful American girls, who are sure to be proud of you when you finally tell 
them your story. 
</P>
<P>
 To Saundra, who came home from work one terrible day to find that her toddler 
son had been caught in gang cross-fire, shot in the head: Your faith in the 
Lord and your dedication to your son's recovery have meant the difference 
between a half-life and full one for this astonishing, resilient little boy. 
</P>
<P>
 To Janice, whose beloved sister died suddenly and unexpectedly last month, 
leaving two children alone in the world but for her: Your decision to raise 
your nephews, while still caring for your ailing mother, is the very definition 
of selflessness and courage.  
</P>
<P>
 To my grandmother, Annie, who even at 89 is a mother lion with her three cubs, 
aging lions themselves of 70, 65 and 56: Two weeks ago, when the natural order 
turned on its head, I took you to see your son -- my father -- recovering from 
a heart attack. How I wish I'd had a camera to record that precious moment of 
concerned motherhood -- you, with your walker, and Dad with his IV pole, 
inching down the hospital hallway together. 
</P>
<P>
 And to all mothers, wherever you are, may today be full of love and laughter . 
. . and may your children hold their tongues.

BLAST AT WATCHDOGS NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the April 28 Laugh Lines: I just thought of something funny. What if I 
cancel my subscription to your paper? 
</P>
<P>
 You'd probably get as big a kick outta that as I did from your yuk-yuk article 
"I Just Called . . . to Say . . . 'Save the Scoot Frog!' " by Tony Kornheiser.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm far from understanding the humor behind Kornheiser's belittlements of 
social, political and environmental concerns and those making the effort to aid 
on these issues facing each one of your readers. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of worthless sarcasm is quite characteristic of a society that has 
brought about the necessity for a company like Working Assets. 
</P>
<P>
 It may do Kornheiser some good to investigate Working Assets a little further, 
broaden his scope past the point of self, and then maybe he'd find what Working 
Assets is based on -- integrity, care and concern.

GUNS HAVE NO PLACE IN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is possible The Times would appreciate thanks and a positive reaction to 
the new Life & Style section. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as I turned to this much heralded debut (April 25), I was immediately 
faced with the image of "Terminator II," complete with automatic weapon at the 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Must we be propagandized into thinking violence is popular and fashionable? 
Marginal behavior is so easily influenced. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only the duty of all concerned of our citizenry, but especially the 
news media, movies and television, to bear some responsibility toward the 
Herculean burden of establishing the aura of a more secure, sane society if we 
hope to survive as a nation.

DIVORCED DADS AREN'T GETTING A FAIR SHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, The Times prints another tired, one-sided article about "deadbeat 
dads" ("If Support Isn't Paid, Kids Feel the Effects," April 21). In three full 
columns, there is one small paragraph giving the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of all custody awards go to the mothers just because they are 
women and don't work. The district attorney's office prosecutes fathers for any 
non-payment of child support, no matter how small, but refuses to enforce 
violations of visitation orders, no matter how atrocious.  
</P>
<P>
 If mothers were forced to work and pay child support as often as fathers, if 
fathers were given custody as often as mothers, if visitation was enforced as 
rigidly as support, perhaps the system would be perceived as fair.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps then, kids would get all they deserve: two parents who share equally 
in custody and support.

'SIRENS' NOT SILLY, BUT A SPIRITUAL STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ireally must disagree with Robin Abcarian's casual dismissal of the movie 
"Sirens" in her article "Nightmare at the Multiplex: Killer Popcorn" (April 
27). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that I, too, am female and do not have "gravity-defying" 
breasts, I found the movie to be delightful and informative. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole point of the movie was Christianity's dismissal of women as 
spiritual beings, and I found myself moved to tears at the baptismal scene at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie celebrates nature and women's bodies, which have been linked 
throughout Christianity as something to be controlled and despised.

NRA STAUNCH DEFENDER OF SECOND AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Paula Poundstone's piece ("The Good Old Days? Somebody Stole 'Em," Laugh 
Lines, April 25) she makes the false statement regarding the Old West that 
"they didn't have the evil NRA then because nobody was against guns to begin 
with."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the National Rifle Assn. was incorporated in 1871 during the 
relatively brief period between the Civil War and the turn of the century that 
we think of as the "Wild West" period. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during this era that attempts were made to disenfranchise and leave 
defenseless newly freed blacks by not allowing them to possess firearms as all 
other Americans could. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Poundstone's flippant claim that "nobody was against guns" is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the very composition of the Constitution, potential tyrants, elitists, 
racists and simpletons who crave total government control have been trying to 
abolish our guaranteed Second Amendment freedoms.

MEN MUST ENGENDER GREATER INDIVIDUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Uncarnal Knowledge" (May 2): Human beings are many things. They are their 
profession, their political party, their gender, their citizenry, their 
ancestry, their religion, someone's spouse, someone's child. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on and on. It is unfortunate that men identify themselves first 
and foremost, if not completely, with their gender. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that is why men find it hard to have friendships with women. 
Their gender overshadows their individuality. A male encounters another male -- 
competition; a male encounters a female -- sexual tension. 
</P>
<P>
 We are individuals, and individuality should be the first thing we identify 
ourselves with. If we could put our gender second or third, I think our society 
would be a little less sex-mad and a little less uptight overall.

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY; A BENEFIT WHERE THE MAJORITY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dictionaries have dozens of definitions for social . Most fit Los Angeles. 
We're a very social city. And spring is lush with gregarious crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 A Singing Senator: Tuesday evening, U.S. Senate Majority leader George J. 
Mitchell (without his Canadian bride-to-be Heather MacLachlan, who was on a 
flight to London) got the Julius Award from USC's School of Public 
Administration amid Broadway tunes and a Disney tilt to the evening (Mickey and 
Minnie Mouse in centerpieces, Disney party favors) orchestrated by trustee 
Stanley Gold with help from Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 An applauding audience of 575 (including Malcolm Currie, Forrest Shumway, John 
Bryson, Ilene Gold, Jane Eisner, Bill Keck with Ann Campbell, Jane Pisano, 
Yoshi Honkawa, Cliff and Judith Miller, and Irwin and Sue Russell) raised 
$425,000 and loved it when Mitchell was prodded into "leading the majority" in 
a sing-along of "Hello Dolly." And they adored it when House Speaker Tom S. 
Foley (who had been having cocktails with Lew and Edie Wasserman) dropped in 
unexpectedly. Pisano introduced Mitchell as a role model. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Sisterly Emotions: At the Beverly Hilton, it was an emotional moment when the

UP ALL NIGHT: SOCIAL CLIMES; IMPULSE POWER

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Martians landed in Griffith Park and demanded to know what the point of a 
city like Los Angeles could possibly be, we'd do well to guide them immediately 
to the Troy Cafe in Downtown's Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Troy is at once a neighborhood hangout and a hot spot, a place that 
manages to feed the Angeleno soul without a trace of the stylish pessimism that 
plagues other with-it L.A. hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 An unpretentious little storefront across the street from MOCA's Temporary 
Contemporary, the Troy has eight tables, brick walls, an espresso bar and a 
corner stage. The service is living-room friendly, and the coffee is cheap and 
strong. (Even the infamous "Turbo Coke" comes spiked with a shot of espresso.) 
</P>
<P>
 A rack of magazines inside the door offers everything from dog-eared copies of 
the New Yorker and Vanity Fair to Coagula, a bi-coastal art journal. But why 
read when good conversation abounds? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who walked through the door on a recent Saturday night seemed to know 
Sean Carillo, who started the Troy in 1990, giving in to a rash impulse that 
turned out to be dead on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was driving down the street and I saw the For Rent sign," he says. "A week 
later, we opened for business. I'd never done anything like this before. I was 
a film editor. But I had never felt particularly welcome in other places, so I 
needed to open my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo, who grew up in East L.A., co-founded the Troy with his wife, Bibbe 
Hansen, who was reared in New York's Greenwich Village in the 1950s, the 
daughter of an artist. The menu features a picture of Hansen and the late Andy 
Warhol superstar, Edie Sedgwick, dancing at a loft party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Troy is home to scores of Downtown and Eastside artists, students and 
ex-New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend's performance by Angela Vogel, followed by the Lost Soul Rebels, 
brought in a diverse crowd of regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend performances also draw a steady stream of newcomers who come for 
the music and stay for the inexpensive cappuccino and priceless atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The booking policy is based entirely on my subjective opinion," Carillo says. 
"That keeps me sane because I'm here every night. I book everything but poetry. 
I really can't stand poetry and I hate spoken word even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the prohibition on "public kvetching," as Carillo calls readings, 
anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be as diverse and eclectic as the space warrants. We have a guy 
coming up who's going to play some pre-Columbian instruments. I've had 
all-percussion bands. Then there's the usual rock, jazz and acoustic." 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo sighs. "But you have to be careful with singer-songwriters with 
guitars, because they're often people who used to do spoken word." 
</P>
<P>
 Joking aside, Troy is a place where the process of self-examination is as 
important as self-expression. The rotating art exhibits have included a 
policeman-painter's personal view of the 1992 events at Florence and Normandie. 
</P>
<P>
 Other talents Troy has fostered include the comedy group Culture Clash, the 
Illegal Interns -- four teen-agers who run a popular cable TV show in East L.A. 
-- and the singer Beck, who is Hansen's and Carillo's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while institutions on the Downtown scene fold or move, succumbing to 
riots, earthquakes or recession, Troy quietly persists, a necessary place. In a 
city so riven by prejudice and profit, there is more to Troy's appeal than the 
mingling of races and ZIP codes under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place where the sense of L.A.'s potential as a renaissance town is 
very much alive.

THE BUZZ: SOCIAL CLIMES; BLUES CLUB OPENING SAFER WITH SHAFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At the House of Blues' official opening last week, there was an unexplained 
45-minute pause between Isaac Hayes' performance and the appearance of Dan 
Aykroyd with the Blues Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, a platoon of Scottish bagpipers marched through the room, but 
that could hardly be called bluesy. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out the 1,000-strong crowd was waiting for Paul Shaffer. A private 
plane had been dispatched to Palm Springs, where the bandleader of "The Late 
Show With David Letterman" was attending a wedding. When he arrived, the show 
went on. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of having Shaffer at the opening could be explained two ways: 
He was an original member of the Blues Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 And he'd been at the opening of the other two House of Blues establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 We're told that the restaurant-club's owners, strong believers in the 
spiritual, thought it a good omen if Shaffer was there when the third opened 
its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a spokesman for the House of Blues downplayed the idea that having 
Shaffer was superstitious, he did say it was "definitely sentimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks But No Thanks: One person to take off the list for the job of director 
at the L.A. County Museum of Art is Tom Krens, the director of the Guggenheim 
Museum in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Krens says that during a lunch in Los Angeles "somebody asked if I 
would be interested," he was not officially approached about the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The art world is rife with these kinds of rumors," he says. "I have no 
intention of leaving here. After all, I was born in Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Got Money to Spare?: Also in the museum world, now that UCLA is operating the 
Armand Hammer it will be interesting to see what happens to one of its 
partially completed sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Right off the Lindbrook entrance is an unfinished, potentially 
state-of-the-art movie theater. The sloping shell is there, but the theater 
wasn't completed because funds ran out during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 This would make a perfect locale for movie premieres because party-bound 
guests could exit directly into the Hammer courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of high-profile structure a philanthropist donating funds for 
completion would love to have his name on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although if someone else's name ever went on a plaque in the Armand Hammer 
Museum, it might be the ultimate irony in the individualistic millionaire's 
life.

A TALE OF TWO AFRICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Clough is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and 
author of Free at Last? U.S. Policy Toward Africa and the End of the Cold War 
(Council on Foreign Relations). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, Washington was forced to turn its attention back to Africa, a 
continent that many U.S. policy-makers believe should not be a major U.S. 
concern. As has so often been the case, the pressure on officialdom came from 
stark and poignant pictures. This time, however, the pictures carried a mixed 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 From South Africa, aerial photographs of whites and blacks standing together 
patiently waiting to vote, in lines that seemed to twist and turn for miles, 
conveyed hope and the promise of a new era. From Rwanda, scenes of a sea of 
brutalized and terrified refugees fleeing from genocidal violence spread 
despair and fear of an unfolding apocalypse that could engulf much of the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the democratic triumph in South Africa, the Clinton 
Administration more than doubled U.S. aid, to $200 million next year. Reacting 
to the tragedy in Rwanda, it stepped up its humanitarian efforts and began 
searching for ways to support an African peacekeeping force that could end the 
carnage. These moves boosted the behind-the-scenes campaign of a handful of 
officials who care deeply about the continent, including National Security 
Adviser W. Anthony Lake, to get the Administration to think seriously about 
Africa. But given history, there is good reason to question whether these 
tentative moves will bring about a much-needed revolution in U.S. relations 
with the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1950s, when most African states began to gain their 
independence, U.S. policy has moved with depressing regularity through cycles 
of calculated neglect and event-driven activism. During the Cold War, the 
catalyst for action was fear that Moscow would profit from civil unrest and 
conflict. That was the case in the Belgium Congo (now Zaire) in the 1960s, in 
Angola in 1975-76 and throughout the 1980s, and in the Horn of Africa in 1978, 
to name a few. Beginning with the Biafran civil war in 1967-69, another 
recurring force for intervention has been the specter of starving children, 
which prompted large-scale relief efforts in the Sahel in the early 1970s, 
Ethiopia in 1974-75 and, more recently, in Somalia. A final factor has been 
racial conflict, as illustrated by the U.S. reaction to the protests against 
white rule that began with the Soweto uprising in 1975 and escalated 
exponen-tially in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of such pressures, every President since Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
with the exception of Richard M. Nixon, ended up reluctantly mounting at least 
one high-profile intervention in Africa. Only Presidents John F. Kennedy and 
Jimmy Carter seriously attempted to deal with the underlying causes of Africa's 
crises -- and neither achieved many lasting successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has Washington failed so miserably? One of the most important reasons is 
the way in which the foreign-policy Establishment conceives "the national 
interest." For them, it is mostly a matter of protecting economic and security 
interests against foreign threats. Where interests are not threatened, they 
argue, there is little cause for involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the passing of the Cold War, this approach to the national interest 
takes on dangerous risks. It blocks policy-makers from recognizing the deeper 
human interests and psychological impulses that are compelling them to get 
involved in areas of Africa that they would prefer to ignore. In today's world, 
the gravity of threats to U.S. interests is increasingly difficult to discern. 
Most important, the revolution in information, communications and 
transportation, coupled with the emergence of a host of globally oriented 
movements and organizations, have changed the policy-making equation. Public 
attitudes are determined more by personal and group relationships than by 
calculations of interests. 
</P>
<P>
 For a small but influential segment of American society, the election in South 
Africa was not a distant event. For the millions who supported the 
anti-apartheid movement, Nelson Mandela's victory is a personal triumph. Many 
helped to raise funds for his political campaign, while others traveled to 
South Africa to help educate voters and monitor the elections. That two of Bill 
Clinton's chief campaign advisers, pollster Stanley B. Greenberg and media 
consultant Frank Greer, worked on the Mandela campaign, that one American 
lawyer-activist, Gay McDougall, was appointed to South Africa's Independent 
Election Monitoring Board, that former New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins was 
at Bishop Desmond M. Tutu's side when the latter went to the polls and that 
many of America's leading news celebrities were on hand for the elections -- 
all demonstrate the degree to which U.S. and South African politics have become 
intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Rwanda, the changing realities are best reflected in the 
personal drama that took place when Alison Des Forges, an American historian 
and human-rights activist, desperately attempted to rescue a prominent Rwandan 
human-rights activist, Monique Mujawamariya, trapped in Kigali. The personal 
bonds linking the two women are symbolic of the close connections that now 
exist between many Americans in the human-rights movement and their foreign 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The events in South Africa and Rwanda, therefore, matter for reasons that have 
little to do with narrow national interests. They matter because they strike a 
chord deep in our souls. Americans are heartened by the triumph of racial 
justice in South Africa because they see it as part of a larger struggle 
involving many of them. Their sympathies are aroused by the horrors of Rwanda 
because they comprehend the humanity and have the ability to share the pain 
reflected in the eyes of Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they underestimate the power of these kinds of forces to generate 
pressures for responses to crises in places where no discernible U.S. interests 
appear endangered, Washington policy-makers are less and less able to predict 
where and when they will respond to foreign developments. As a result, they are 
increasingly finding themselves in the position of being urged to intervene in 
situations they have neither anticipated nor prepared for. For example, 
thinking in terms of strict strategic interests encouraged the Bush 
Administration to believe it could disengage from Somalia, after the Soviet 
threat had receded. Consequently, it failed to take early action to avert the 
political and humanitarian crisis that developed in the early 1990s -- and the 
United States ended up paying a high price for its mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign-policy Establishment's attempt to demean, or ignore, Africa's 
current plight involves more than high-sounding rationalizations about where 
the national interest lies. It is also highly irresponsible and immoral. The 
United States and other major powers have played a critical role in creating 
the circumstances that spark the continent's crises. The persistent effort to 
attribute conflicts in Africa to deeply seeded tribal animosities is a 
convenient way to deflect blame for policies that aided and protected 
dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping Africa off the global agenda is going to get more difficult. 
Demography alone dictates that Washington and the rest of the world's major 
powers take African developments into account. For example, as of 1991, the 
population of Sub-saharan Africa was less than 500 million, while the total 
population of all advanced industrial countries was about 800 million. By 2025, 
this balance will change radically. The African population is projected to be 
more than 1.2 billion, while the population of the advanced industrial 
countries will be 10% higher than where it is today. If Africa remains 
impoverished and conflict-ridden, its troubles will inevitably be exported. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's only real choice is to begin a serious attempt to learn from such 
tragedies as Rwanda and Somalia to head off the impending tragedies in Kenya 
and Zaire, all the while strengthening and building on the triumph represented 
by the South African election.*

THE LITTLE BIRD THAT PUTS TWO POLITICIANS TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hugh Hewitt, Hugh Hewitt, a natural-resources lawyer, is co-host of KCET's 
Life & Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Judge Stanley Sporkin of the U.S. District Court in Washington struck the 
California gnatcatcher from the threatened-species list, he preserved the 
integrity of the listing process incorporated in the Endangered Species Act. 
The decision sent a small temblor through the world of natural-resources law. 
</P>
<P>
 But for California politics, it was a huge shaker: The races for governor and 
for the U.S. Senate will surely feel the impact of the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced his decision, in March, 1993, 
to list the gnatcatcher as threatened, Sen. Dianne Feinstein had been in her 
new job for two months. Gov. Pete Wilson was preoccupied with workers' 
compensation reform and a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's move sequestered up to 400,000 acres of sagebrush and coastal slopes 
in areas including Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties to 
protect the songbird. Various home-construction and public-infrastructure 
projects took a beating, but Feinstein could safely distance herself from these 
effects because she had just arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, as well, could afford to ignore the listing. His appointees embraced 
Babbitt's offer of a partnership to solve the problems generated by the 
listing. Quick action toward a compromise that would allow some projects to 
move forward was promised by all. 
</P>
<P>
 Right up until Sporkin's decision Monday, the feds and lower-level state 
officials were proclaiming progress. The reality, of course, was quite 
different. Paralysis had set in. Thousands of jobs that would have been created 
in the home-building industry did not materialize as layer after layer of 
complicated rules and regulations was piled upon proposed compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Communities Conservation Planning program, as the fed-state effort 
is called, took on a life and momentum of its own. For example, the staff of 
the city of San Diego, urged on by federal and state regulators, proposed a 
conservation plan that would have set a goal of preserving more than 90 species 
in addition to the gnatcatcher. Computer models broke down estimating the cost 
of such an undertaking; the plan was sent back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County officials, stung by the Interior Department's five-year 
record of failure to approve a Stephen's kangaroo rat recovery program, looked 
at the $30 million in "rat taxes" that had been extracted from landowners since 
1989 and politely turned down a similar fed-state effort in the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Interior Department's choices of species to list -- the Delhi 
sands flower-loving fly in Ontario, for example -- seemed ready-made for 
lampooning. When last autumn's fires destroyed homes that could not be 
protected by cutting fire breaks for fear of harming rats, public opinion began 
turning against the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Sporkin decision, which specifically rebuked Interior for 
relying on data it refused to share with the public. The withheld data had been 
used to support two contradictory conclusions, one that required protecting the 
bird, one that did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior will no doubt appeal to restore the gnatcatcher's protected status. 
Which brings us to politics: What will Wilson and Feinstein do this time 
around? 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of standing by as his staff was rolled again and again by the 
feds, Wilson's decision should be self-evident. Citing the 3 million 
gnatcatchers that live in Mexico and the huge tracts of open space already 
permanently set aside throughout the bird's range, the governor should oppose 
the bird's re-listing, even to the point of requesting Atty. Gen. Daniel E. 
Lungren to launch a preemptive strike at any such federal move. Should Interior 
pursue its campaign, he should demand that the federal government buy outright 
the land it deems critical to the bird's survival. And Wilson should press the 
attack in vote-rich Riverside County, where disgust with the millions spent on 
the Stephen's kangaroo rat has reached fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's choice is more difficult. Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) is already talking up what he regards as the imbalance between 
economic sense and environmental extremism. With some recent research showing 
that the devastation of the state's timber industry was the result of faulty 
data on the spotted owl, Huffington's message may resonate in the north as well 
as in the south, should he win the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has already paid her dues to environmentalists by pushing through 
the gigantic Desert Protection Bill. She can afford to demand that Babbitt move 
slowly to re-list a bird so clearly abundant below the border. She would be 
especially accountable if Interior successfully urged Babbitt to use his 
"emergency" listing powers to bypass public review of any attempt to restore 
the bird's protection. Feinstein can -- and should -- at least demand a full 
and fair consideration of all the data, and feel no restraint in calling for 
Babbitt to resist invoking emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a huge reservoir of support in California for fair-minded 
conservation efforts -- the purchase of private lands of environmental value 
for fair price. But the wheel has turned, and landowners and taxpayers are 
weary of environmental extremism and its use of regulatory terrorism. For 
Wilson, this shift presents an opportunity to reclaim his standing among key 
constituencies. For Feinstein, it's an unwelcome but unavoidable test of her 
claim to "moderate" credentials.*

THE NATION; THE DISABLEDS' WORST ENEMY -- THEIR PROTECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is past president of the Los Angeles 
Criminal Bar Assn. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rachael V. Santos cannot enter Atlantic Boulevard Post Office. Bibliophile 
Warren Mooley cannot get into the public library. Nor can Attorney Michael 
Dooner get into court. Why? Four years after Con gress unanimously passed the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the law's most flagrant violator is government 
itself. Indeed, its enforcement of the law with respect to itself betrays a 
cynical arrogance and hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the enforcement apparatus is intentionally set up so that 
nobody watches the watchers. Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * City building inspectors who recently cited a San Fernando Valley strip 
club's shower prop as a disabilities violation (because it was inaccessible to 
potential handicapped strippers), simultaneously ignored thousands of 
violations in the city's own buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although the City Council found money to restore City Hall's faded murals, 
the disabled cannot see them because the building itself remains inaccessible. 
This is equally true for the branch city halls in Van Nuys and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than two years ago, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn warned the 
council that the city could face federal charges unless it significantly 
improved access to its buildings. Since that time, nothing has been done, and 
the Justice Department has not uttered a peep. 
</P>
<P>
 * While former county Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon spent $6.1 
million on remodeling his imperial offices in the Kenneth J. Hahn Hall of 
Administration -- ironically named in honor of the wheelchair-bound former 
supervisor -- the building had no toilets for the handicapped. Today, county 
headquarters has two. 
</P>
<P>
 * Able-bodied LAPD officers regularly park their cruisers in the blue zones 
reserved for the handicapped around Civic Center so they will not have to walk 
an extra block to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * None of the county's 43 court facilities meets the law's requirements, 
which, incidentally, did not stop judges from recently spending almost $9 
million on every security toy imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, judges ordered removal of the only two accessible handicapped 
parking spaces under the downtown Criminal Courts Building, because they wanted 
more convenient parking for -- themselves. The official rationale for 
reclaiming the spaces: "judicial security." 
</P>
<P>
 * In four years, California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren has not filed a 
single lawsuit to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act, or its state 
counterpart, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which makes an ADA violation also a 
violation of state law. Lungren's publicly announced plan leaves enforcement to 
local building inspectors, which is like leaving the family's nut supply with 
Chip and Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws that apply to you and me also apply to the people who run the city, 
county and state. But while Mayor Richard Riordan's Pantry restaurant is 
handicapped-accessible, his office is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Gloria Molina, elected as 
reformers, have ignored their disabled constituents in county facilities. The 
Board of Supervisors is already two years tardy in completing a federally 
mandated "access transition plan" for the Justice Department, and no one seems 
to know, or care, when the plan will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has no Americans with Disabilities Act compliance officers -- in 
violation of federal law -- and it continues to discriminate in hiring. It 
recently refused to hire a talented, though mildly retarded gardener because 
the man did not know the Latin names of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The county makes handicapped doctors crutch five blocks from the parking lot 
to the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. And any disabled young lawyer who 
wants a career with Dist. Atty. Gilbert L. Garcetti or Public Defender Michael 
P. Judge will need a strong bladder, as well as ability and perseverance: 
Neither office has lavatories for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody inspects government buildings to ensure compliance. The county's 
Handicapped Access Appeals Board no longer meets at the Public Works Building 
in Alhambra because the building that billets the building inspectors is itself 
inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the nation's largest criminal courthouse, the Criminal Courts 
Building, has no handicapped toilets, an inaccessible cafeteria and an entrance 
that lacks only a moat to make the building totally disabled-proof. One could 
complain to Presiding Judge Robert M. Mallano, but his courtroom in the Civil 
Courthouse is similarly inaccessible. So is every jury box in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with respect to the disabled, the judiciary fluctuates between benign 
neglect and open hostility. On the ground of "dignity," a former presiding 
judge of the juvenile court opposed lowering the judges' benches six inches 
during construction of the new Children's Court to make them accessible. 
Instead, he recommended the expenditure of $250,000 for motorized lifts. As one 
courthouse wag commented, "If the judges need an extra six inches, maybe it 
should come out of their own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of judicial insensitivity were the recent hearings held by the 
chief justice's Commission on the Future of the Courts, which invited the 
disabled community to address access problems in the legal system. The 
commission, of course, selected an inaccessible site for the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, four years after passage of the most sweeping civil-rights law since 
1965, California's appellate courts have decided a grand total of four 
Americans with Disabilities Act cases. Probably the quickest way to get the 
California Supreme Court's attention on an access case is to point out that San 
Quentin's gas chamber is handicapped-inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a private employer, merchant, real-estate developer, theater 
manager or restaurateur, you probably spent substantial time and money during 
the last year acquainting yourself with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Your business may have altered bathrooms, changed seating, modified work space, 
installed ramps or provided additional handicapped parking. In short, the law 
forced you to provide an accessible workplace or public accommodation at your 
expense for the public good. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector must demand that government also obey the law. After all, 
the handicapped are the one minority group who everyone eventually gets to 
join, if they are lucky. Because, as we get older, the only alternative to 
becoming disabled is being dead.*

 When I was in fourth grade, Sister Theresa asked my class to draw pictures of 
what we wanted to be when we grew up. It was 1962, and I at Blessed Sacramento 
School in Trenton, N.J. I drew a nun, a mommy and a teacher. These were the 
jobs I had seen a woman do. 
</P>
<P>
 In my professional life, I have worked as a union organizer, in two state 
governments, as a presidential advance woman. I am now the owner of my own 
communications company. Growing up, I watched my mother painting portraits -- 
and I'm still in awe that she also managed to cook, clean, raise five children, 
be a wife to my father, take care of her mother, teach other people's children 
and find time to register voters and volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 This vision of my mother and the countless other involved women I've met 
inspired "Take Our Daughters To Work" day and a new campaign, "Picture What 
Women Do," on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective of "Take Our Daughters to Work" is to make girls "visible, 
valued and heard." This international public-education campaign was created to 
respond to alarming studies that show adolescence taking a serious toll on 
girls. The onset of the teen-age years all too regularly brings loss of 
confidence, eating disorders, physical and sexual abuse, negative body image 
and neglect. Other studies show girls receive less attention than boys in the 
classroom and less encouragement about their future. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months before I saw this data, I was at a benefit dinner. The keynote 
speaker, in his remarks, read a poem written by his 11-year-old daughter. His 
recognition of her in front of an audience of 3,000 overwhelmed me. His evident 
regard for what she had to say made me remember how important it was for me, as 
a child, to be acknowledged and taken seriously. I thought about this as I read 
the research data on girls. What resulted was "Take Our Daughters to Work." 
</P>
<P>
 The program has produced many success stories. Last year, one group of girls 
attended a board meeting at Acacia Mutual Life Insurance in Washington. The 
subject was how the company should invest its money. A board member asked the 
girls what they thought about a life-insurance company investing money in 
tobacco companies. The girls said it was silly for a company that insures 
people's lives to put its money into something known to kill people. After the 
girls lobbied their parents for months, company officials decided to heed the 
wisdom of their daughters and stop investing in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of strength, care, ambition, love and sense of community that 
women bring to their work are seldom acknowledged, let alone rewarded. On May 
17, women participating in "Picture What Women Do," developed with Lifetime 
Television, will record their daily lives by having their husbands, friends, 
children, partners and co-workers photograph them in their homes, on the job 
and in their communities. It will be a portrait of contemporary women. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, how to value women and what they do -- or rather, how to direct 
attention to the value that women's lives possess -- is the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls get the message in adolescence that they are supposed to be sweet -- and 
quiet. Their looks and appeal to boys are most important. But they discover 
almost as soon as they enter the work world that if they want to succeed, they 
must be aggressive, powerful and well-paid. I've sought to redefine success, to 
redefine value -- to let women be like women. "Picture What Women Do" and "Take 
Our Daughters To Work" generate a lens through which women can regard women as 
they truly are, a lens through which girls can envision their womanhood with 
excitement, not endless conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 1 million girls punched the clock at offices and opera houses, retail 
stores and news rooms, hospitals and universities on "Take Our Daughters To 
Work" day. This year, more than 3 million went to work around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Metrolink offered free rides to girls commuting with an adult. 
Seven fathers from the Department of Street Lighting hosted 10 daughters, 
repairing street lights in a maintenance yard. The Watts Health Foundation 
showed the ins and outs of running an urban community health center. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Take Our Daughters To Work" is about the future of women, "Picture What 
Women Do" is about the present. It will give women an opportunity to record for 
themselves, for girls, for the men and boys in their lives the choices we have 
now and the things we still want to change. But more more than just two special 
days of recognition for the lives women lead is at stake. The goal is a 
continuing dialogue toward improving the quality of the lives of women, men and 
children.*

THE WORLD; LOS ANGELES' GANG CULTURE ARRIVES IN EL SALVADOR, COURTESY OF THE 
INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Luis J. Rodriguez, Luis J. Rodriguez, the author of Always Running: La Vida 
Loca, Gang Days in L.A. (Touchstone Books/Simon & Schuster), recently visited 
El Salvador. He and Donna DeCesare, a photographer, are preparing a paper for 
Duke University on how deported L.A. gang members are affecting life in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by tin huts and seated near the blue and yellow flames of an 
outdoor fire, the 18-year-old member of an L.A. tagging crew seemed from 
another world. Inside a small makeshift funeral parlor was his mother -- in a 
coffin. Her lifeless face was visible through a glass window. Gang members, 
believed to be affiliated with a Los Angeles street gang, had allegedly shot 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not Los Angeles; it was San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager had just come from Los Angeles to a country he only sporadically 
visits, although from a war zone he is a part of: You can see it in his face, 
his clothes, his short-cropped hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now the wars back home recognize no borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The tagger's story is not a curiosity. Although the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service cannot deport someone for simply being a "gang-banger," 
it is increasingly singling out teen-agers who fit the description in the 
predominantly Central-American enclaves of Pico-Union, Koreatown and Hollywood. 
This practice apparently has grown since the 1992 L.A. rebellion, in which 
Latino immigrants were significantly involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Since the mid-1980s), changes in the law, including the addition of 
aggravated felonies, have allowed the federal and state governments to work 
hand-and-hand in deporting as many of these people as they could," claimed 
Andres Bustamante, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles. "There is definitely 
more aggressiveness by the INS to seek out and deport these youth." In 1992-93, 
about 400 adults alleged to be gang members were deported, most of them to 
Mexico. Forty were sent to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is causing severe strains in countries such as El Salvador, where 
many of the so-called "gang-bangers" are exiled. Salvadoran officials say they 
do not understand the L.A. gangs, who are foreign to them, and they blame U.S. 
immigration policy for the rapid growth of such gangs in their country in the 
last two years. During the recent national elections, most polls conducted by 
the Salvadoran media showed that the rise of juvenile delinquency, much of it 
privately attributed to L.A. deportees, as the No. 1 electoral issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's your country's fault," a member of El Salvador's new national police 
force told me during a sweep of L.A. gang members. "(You) create the problem, 
and then send it back to us." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are legal grounds for detaining and possibly deporting some 
of these teen-agers. But because many of them lack legal representation or have 
no knowledge of their rights, they are sent to countries they know little about 
simply because they were caught dressed like "gang-bangers" and without proper 
documentation. Most of these kids had been in the United States since 
childhood, even infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 One result is that Los Angeles is now everywhere in San Salvador, an 
exhaust-filled city of some 2 million people. The graffiti of L.A. barrio gangs 
-- including Mara Salvatrucha, Eighteenth Street, White Fence and Florencia 
Trece -- can be found on walls throughout the city. The placasos (individual 
gang names) on many San Salvador walls could be those on any wall in Los 
Angeles: Negro, Oso, Scoobie, Flaco, Chuco. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeboys have merged with local street and school gangs, which 
Central Americans call maras . Skirmishes between rival L.A. barrios have 
already occurred. One recent incident between L.A.-based gangs reportedly 
claimed nine lives when a hand grenade was thrown into a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also the clashes between two worlds. Recently, a Salvadoran police 
officer burned and then cut off the "homeboy" braid of a deported Los Angeles 
youth. In a Salvadoran prison, I met a California vato who was serving 25 years 
for a rape/murder he says he was convicted of only because of his hard-style 
L.A. look. Another prisoner I met is the most feared and respected leader in El 
Salvador's largest prison, mostly because of savvy picked up on L.A.'s mean 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 One tragic case I encountered involved a 25-year-old deportee who had been 
convicted of attempted murder and sent to the Youth Training School, a 
California Youth Authority facility in Chino. He had been an exemplary student 
at a Los Angeles high school before being picked up by police, which he claims 
was a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he did exceedingly well at the training school. In the five years 
the youth served, he obtained a high school diploma (and was chosen class 
valedictorian), a welding certificate, several awards, and an Associate of Arts 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to a teacher at the school, INS agents showed up as soon as the 
youth's sentence was up. Although teachers and others who knew the youth wrote 
glowing letters on his behalf, the INS demanded a large bond from his family, 
who couldn't afford it. The young man was exiled to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend time and money on these young men -- $32,000 a year to house and 
educate them -- then the INS comes and takes them away," the teacher said. 
"They've done that to several of my students. If we're not going to keep them 
in this country, as citizens, after all the trouble of educating them, why 
bother?" 
</P>
<P>
 I ran into the youth in Usulutan, El Salvador. He was unemployed and living in 
a colonia along a dirt road. Without proper, and sometimes expensive, legal 
assistance, he will be condemned to a life of want in a country he may have 
been born in, but hardly knows. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of undocumented immigration in the United States is complex. When 
crime and gangs are thrown into the mix, it is even more intricate. There are 
no simple solutions, and the "solutions" being implemented may only aggravate 
injustice. Simply to rid ourselves of "gangs" by deporting them to countries 
with fewer resources, less knowledge of the dynamics of U.S. social relations, 
and often less justice, is no solution.*

THE WORLD; INSIDE DOPE ON THE U.S. PLOT TO INFILTRATE FRENCH! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bruce McCall, Bruce McCall is a frequent contributor to the New Yorker. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The MacDonald's on the Champs Elysee was almost deserted at 3 a.m. as I sat 
browsing through a paper while waiting for my contact so we could start 
littering the place with People magazines and National Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the front-page Le Figaro article hit me like a Charlotte de 
Pommes Sauce Abricot in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Government of France," it declared, "is officially supporting efforts to 
prevent further infiltration and pollution of the French language by imported 
English words and phrases." 
</P>
<P>
 So it had happened. We'd finally pushed them too far. Now there was sure to be 
-- Uh, oh! Here came three of the French Academy's roving black-robed word 
goons, heading straight for the restaurant! Reflexively, I buried my telltale 
Anglo-Saxon face in the paper and scrunched down. Fool!! Why had I chosen a 
"Mighty Ducks" jersey to wear today? Idiot! No hope of covering it up with a 
Paris Review! 
</P>
<P>
 Whew!! Just another sweep to rip the Smashing Pumpkins concert and "Cops and 
Robbersons" movie posters off kiosks. Still, a close call. Could I stand the 
torture if they found me out? The round-the-clock pummeling of Piaf and Johnny 
Halliday over the P.A.; the only reading matter de Beauvoir's letters to Sartre 
about Camus and Camus' letters to de Beauvoir about Sartre and footnotes, 
footnotes, footnotes; forced to see "The 400 Blows," 500 times. 
</P>
<P>
 How long before I'd crack and our whole massive plot fall apart like a used 
Renault? Yes, we'd drugged Depardieu with California wines so he'd do 
English-speaking movie roles. The EuroDisney caper cost a fortune, sure, but 
"Have a nice day" was now part of their language. They might even uncover our 
prized double agent, Jerry Lewis, taking their praise and awards while swamping 
their lingo with half-wit English double talk that the poor fools lapped up 
like creme brule. 
</P>
<P>
 Mon Dieu! This campaign of ours to take over French, word by word, ran all the 
way back to the '20s and Gertie Stein's network of English-language moles 
disguised as expatriate writers and artists, boring away at their language from 
within. How long before they figured out that all those Sorbonne "exchange 
students" were, in fact, our agents, planting Danielle Steele and Judith Krantz 
novels between the volumes of Voltaire and Zola in the library, getting their 
orders and their supplies from a certain back room at Harry's Bar? 
</P>
<P>
 What were they going to do now? Make French travelers abroad wear earmuffs? 
Change the name of Paris Match to Paris Mzprfz? Seal off the Channel tunnel? 
</P>
<P>
 But regard the nondescript little man who'd just entered the MacDonald's and 
sat down at the next table, pretending not to notice me. A French teacher? 
Maybe they'd already intercepted my contact and her armload of English-language 
publications. Too bad. Nice kid. But she knew the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 No time for sentiment. I had to go underground. I paid my bill and, steering 
clear of Avenues Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, headed for the Metro.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; CHARLES SCHUMER; VANQUISHING THE NRA WITH HIS 
ASSAULT-WEAPONS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gayle Pollard Terry, Gayle Pollard Terry is an editorial writer based in the 
Washington bureau of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who led the surprisingly successful 
fight in the House of Representatives to ban 19 military-style assault weapons, 
is not exactly a stranger to guns or the National Rifle Assn. He won an NRA 
marksmanship badge and certificate for target shooting when he was a kid 
attending summer camp. The only target practice the tenacious Schumer takes 
these days is dead aim at the powerful gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 To snatch his latest victory from the supposedly certain jaws of defeat, 
Schumer got plenty of help from President Bill Clinton, who worked the phones. 
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a Texan and a hunter, Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno and other members of the Administration mounted a full-court press. 
More help came from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Though senators rarely 
deign to work the House floor, Feinstein took that step to help Schumer 
buttonhole elusive votes. She had a lot at stake. Feinstein was the lead 
sponsor of the Senate's semi-automatic assault-weapons ban, which was approved 
along with the rest of the comprehensive anti-crime package. That legislation 
must now be reconciled with the House version. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time the pragmatic Schumer has beaten back the 
politically potent gun lobby. Thanks to his political acumen and America's 
growing frustration with violent crime, he also prevailed last November, when 
he engineered an upset victory for the Brady Bill, which had languished for 
years in Congress. It requires a waiting period of five days between the 
purchase and delivery of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer maintains his crime watch from his post as chair of the Crime and 
Criminal Justice Subcommittee, part of the House Judiciary Committee. All crime 
bills must past him. But getting guns and crooks off the streets are not his 
only passions. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly ambitious, Schumer has his eye on a gubernatorial race in New York 
when Mario M. Cuomo is no longer in the picture. At 43, Schumer may seem a bit 
young for the state's top political job but he's always been precocious. He 
finished Harvard at 20 and Harvard Law School at 23. The year he got his law 
degree he was elected to the New York State Assembly. At 29, he was elected to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A family man, Schumer divides his time between Washington and his home base in 
Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife and two daughters -- "the rock of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You won. How did you beat the odds?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There were a lot of things. A lot of sweat and hard work, some good 
strategizing. Also, faith, a little faith in the system that sometimes it can 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did White House muscle help?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The President was invaluable. When the President starts talking about 
something, it makes a difference. I went to him two weeks ago and said, "The 
only way we can win this is if you get involved." I told him we might not win 
but he decided to get involved because he thought it was the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the ban on assault weapons primarily symbolic?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's in between symbolism and a panacea, a cure-all. It will do some good. 
They (assault weapons) are only 1% of the weapons out there, but according to 
an ATF (Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) survey, they are used 
in 8% of the murders. They are relatively new on the scene. So the ban actually 
is going to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also some symbolic value. The symbolism is that the NRA (National 
Rifle Assn.) can be beaten. That members can stand up to the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have Americans reached a critical junction on crime?  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . Americans are crying out to government at all levels: Do something! 
It's interesting. I've felt this all along. But (Friday's) Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News poll shows this. ("By 50% to 30%, Americans think the country 
is on the wrong track . . . and it comes right to drugs and crime.") 
</P>
<P>
 . . . People are angry and dispirited about government because of a failure to 
do something about crime . . . . This is government's primary function -- to 
keep us safe -- and when large percentages in the country don't feel safe, they 
start asking: What am I paying my taxes for? What is government all about? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does this victory weaken the political grip of the NRA?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It speaks not so much that the NRA is weakening but the opposing forces are 
stronger. A member of Congress has and still does pay a price for voting 
against the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a member pays a price for voting with the NRA, too. In many districts, 
the price is higher when a member votes with the NRA than against the NRA. The 
public is outraged . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Members knew when they went back to their districts their opponents would use 
this (a vote with the NRA), saying the members were more interested in special 
interests than in the general interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it harder now for politicians who are against gun control to make that 
argument?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's all gradual, and every little step helps. It wasn't that the NRA was a 
monster yesterday and now they are laying on the ground. But their relative 
importance declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The NRA almost won. Won't they ratchet up their firepower for the omnibus 
crime bill?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I do not think they will. If they're smart, they won't, because both houses 
have spoken, and the American people have really spoken. If the NRA is smart, 
they'll stop advocating extremist positions, come to the table and negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will that battle be as tough?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think so. I think assault weapons will be in the bill, and the 
Senate will not filibuster. The American people faced them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the police corps remain in the package?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The police corps is iffy. I'm for it. I don't think it's a big thing. It's 
OK. I think the cop-on-the-beat program is far more important and more 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . I've put in a little program that I think is far more important. It 
allows community groups and church-based groups to recruit police officers. 
That would be more effective than the police corps in terms of getting 
minorities into the police department. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Democrats getting tougher on crime?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. A number of things have happened. The approach that we've crafted in 
the crime bill -- which is tough on punishment and smart on prevention -- is 
the right message on substance and politically. The Democratic Party was always 
there on crime, but in the past we let the ideologues on the left dominate. The 
Republicans may still let the ideologues on the right dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will you persuade members of the Black Caucus to approve the expansion 
of the death penalty?  
</P>
<P>
 A: More than half the Black Caucus voted for the crime bill. My argument is: 
a) we are going to try to make it fair with the racial-justice provision 
(allows Death Row inmates to challenge an alleged pattern of bias in the 
application of capital punishment); and b) I will argue the majority of black 
people, polls show, are for the death penalty . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What African American people are most upset about is a bill aimed just at 
punishment. They want punishment but they also want hope . . . so that another 
generation of young African Americans won't spend the rest of their lives in 
jail . . . . This is a centrist argument -- one that has an appeal in the 
richest of suburbs and the poorest of inner cities . . . . Crime can be a 
unifying argument -- not an argument that people use as a code for us vs. them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you support "three strikes, you're in for life"?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. There, I think, the left makes a mistake. If you look particularly at 
the state levels, violent repeat criminals are not punished enough. The average 
murderer is sentenced to 17 1/2 years but serves six. The average rapist is 
sentenced to 10 years but serves about three and a half. The average mugger is 
sentenced to five years and serves little more than one. 
</P>
<P>
 I, on the other hand, don't think we should be putting first-time drug 
offenders in jail for five years. It's a waste of resources . . . . In the 
crime bill, we put in an escape valve for first-time drug offenders. If they do 
drug treatment and stay clean, they can avoid a prison sentence. This is 
rationing resources, balancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws have been passed willy-nilly. There was a war-on-drugs . . . 
mandatory sentences for drug use. I support the death penalty for the kingpin, 
the guy at the top, but I don't think you should throw a drug offender in jail 
for five years, and let a mugger out after a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will preventive steps like the midnight basketball league proposed in 
the House crime bill stop drive-by shootings or robberies or other violent 
crime?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because kids have a place to go. I spent my evenings playing basketball at 
a school that was open. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But you wouldn't have been out on the streets committing crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know what I would have been doing, but the point is to have 
something to do.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is crime a burning issue only in urban areas like your Brooklyn district 
and Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was up in a wealthy suburb of Syracuse, and they were talking about 
crime. It's everywhere. Some places, it's worse than others, but it's 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Americans a little safer today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They will be considerably safer when the whole crime bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you ever been a victim of crime?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Many times. I was mugged and fought back and got 12 switches in my eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the guy have a gun?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. It was a bunch of kids in a nice neighborhood back in the '70s. They 
probably had too much to drink. I was with my girlfriend. She was my fiancee. 
She's now my wife. They tried to grab her purse. I fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was held up at gunpoint right by our house in Brooklyn. That was the 
most frightening to me. That happened seven or eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent experience was, my car was broken into four times before it 
was stolen. That can drive you nuts -- the repetition. I'd wake up every 
morning and put on my jeans over my pajamas to run down and see if my car was 
still on the street. That's not a pleasant way to live. It was stolen a year 
and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I passed an auto-theft bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: To increase the penalties?

 A: The most important part of the law is that parts of all cars have to be 
marked . . . . When you go to a repair shop, the mechanic can either get the 
part from Detroit or a used part . . . . Most cars are stolen for parts not for 
joy-riding. This requires the repair shop to call a toll-free number (to make 
sure the part isn't stolen) or risk losing their license. I had to fight to get 
that passed, too. I had to fight John Dingell (Democratic congressman from 
Detroit).

 Q: You're a fighter?

 A: Let me tell you a little story about the first job I had. I was running a 
mimeo(graph-duplicating) machine. It was summer. I was 13 or 14, and I'd get in 
there at 9. I had this job. A lot of my friends were out at the beach or having 
fun. I'd look at my watch at 9:10. I'd look at my watch at 9:15. I'd look at my 
watch at 9:30. I swore I wanted a job that wasn't boring. This isn't boring.*

HUFFINGTON'S ADS ON SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your recent "analysis" (Ad Watch, April 8) of my television ads attacking 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein for inflicting a $27-billion tax increase on 
Californians, with her vote last year for the Clinton tax bill, was filled with 
faulty logic and misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, I point out that the National Taxpayers Union ranks Feinstein as 
the eighth-biggest spender in the U.S. Senate. The Times says, oh well, 
Huffington is "the seventh-highest spender of California's 22 Republican House 
members." This is a ludicrous and intentionally misleading comparison. Using 
your logic, given that Feinstein is a bigger spender than her Senate colleague 
Barbara Boxer, our commercial should have called Feinstein the "No. 1 spender 
in California's Senate delegation." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein ranks as the eighth-biggest spender of 100 U.S. senators, and I rank 
as the 352nd of 439 House members.  
</P>
<P>
 Your paper then belittles the legitimacy of the National Taxpayers Union 
ranking because, it writes, "the group acknowledges that its criteria could 
penalize prolific legislators." This is hogwash. One can be a prolific 
legislator and sponsor legislation that controls, or reduces, spending. As the 
NTU wrote me, The Times completely misrepresented their statement. The only way 
their study "penalizes" legislators, they wrote, is "reporting the amount of 
spending they would like to add to the federal ledger. If being prolific means 
sponsoring numerous spending increase bills, we merely report it to the public, 
who can then make their own informed judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein sponsored 31 bills tracked by the NTU's congressional budget 
tracking system -- which, overall, would have cost taxpayers an additional $42 
billion. My legislation, overall, would have saved the government $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times tries to dismiss the $27-billion cost to Californians of the 
Feinstein-supported Clinton tax bill cited in our ad as somehow inconsequential 
because "it is based on a study by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative 
think tank." The Heritage Foundation obtained, through a Freedom of Information 
Act request, an internal U.S. Treasury report prepared for the President, which 
detailed the state-by-state impact of the income tax hike contained in 
Clinton's tax plan. That U.S. Treasury report reveals that the cost to 
California of the personal income tax hike alone would be $22.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The other two major components in the Clinton tax plan -- the gas tax hike and 
the tax on Social Security recipients -- are estimated by Heritage to cost $2.6 
billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Not only was our ad based on lower 
estimates than some groups are giving, the estimated overall cost to California 
of the tax bill even since we aired the ad has now increased to $37 billion.

CHOIRMASTER'S SLAYING IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Sadly, personal experience moves me to write to second Kevin Starr's 
response to the David John Falconer murder in Los Feliz: Living in Los Angeles 
renders us all "at-risk" of being victimized by violence (Commentary, April 
28). I am a native Angeleno, and had long considered myself too young, too cool 
and too savvy to be personally affected by the nefarious specter of crime. 
Although my apartment had been burgled once and it always seemed open season 
where my car was concerned, the fact that such incidents occurred when I was 
not present helped me to depersonalize the situation. That changed two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner one pleasant April evening, my girlfriend and I were out for a 
walk around my Los Feliz neighborhood (four blocks from the convenience store 
where Falconer was slain) when three guys and a large gun cornered us. Were 
they the same three who killed Falconer? Probably. It's a nice neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As the subject of the assault, for me the experience was vaguely surreal -- I 
had never been that close to a handgun that big. For Yolanda, who was held 
aside and watched, it was terrifying. We got off easy -- I lost $10, my wallet 
and some pride. Then, a week later, the riots/uprising/rebellion occurred, and 
I became a bona fide paranoiac. Rather than Starr's "social and psychological 
solipsism," the most distinct feeling I had was of nihilism: Modern society had 
imploded. I was torn between arming myself, wreaking sociopathic havoc, and 
packing up and moving to Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I stuck it out and two years later, I remain paranoid, unarmed and 
(mostly) law-abiding. (However, I have moved from Los Feliz.) As Starr 
suggests, I never feel completely safe and am always hyper-aware of my 
surroundings. I play little tricks now and then to keep my phobia in check, but 
it will never dissipate completely. Is this any way to go through life? If you 
live in this city -- hell, any, for that matter -- there is no choice. Still, I 
love L.A. Sucker that I am. 
</P>

<P>
 * Starr asserts that Los Angeles "is becoming one level, bloody playing field" 
where everyone "is equally liable to being cut down by murderous strangers." 
This is utter hogwash. Every criminologist, every cop, and everyone who bothers 
to look carefully at the world around them knows differently. The probability 
of being murdered is enormously higher if you are a young, poor, person of 
color than if you are white and middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unconscionable for Starr to vent his anger, fear and grief while hiding 
behind the cloak of academic responsibility. The hysteria he promotes compounds 
the direct damage done by crime. It amplifies mistrust, feeds racism, and 
degrades social cohesion. It encourages people to call out the National Guard, 
suspend the Constitution, search every home, seize every gun, and cage everyone 
who appears threatening.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a shame that he has contributed to the problem he bemoans.

 * I never met David John Falconer, the choirmaster and teacher who was 
murdered at a convenience store on his way home from choir rehearsal. But in 
1990 I wrote letters to 30 churches in Los Angeles, trying to get donations of 
choir robes for a Gospel chorus I had started in a residence for 110 children 
who are wards of the court. Falconer was the only one who responded. "We have 
30 robes -- maroon, all sizes -- you're welcome to them." I sent him a photo of 
our kids performing -- so proud in their robes. He was a blessed man who made a 
difference.

HONORING CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I couldn't help but react with amusement and sadness at George Ramos' column 
"Campus Conflict: Students Given Lessons in Strategy" (April 25) regarding the 
disagreement on how best to honor Cesar Chavez. Chavez's legacy to me was that 
he was a man who sacrificed all of his waking life so that others could live 
and work with dignity and pride. 
</P>
<P>
 I see both sides have come up with suggestions that neither honor nor carry on 
his beliefs and hopes. For USC to simply put up a "plaque" to honor him is 
disappointing. On the other hand, for La Raza Political Action Committee to 
demand a renaming of a "patch of grass" is equally disappointing.  
</P>
<P>
 May I suggest that administrators and students at USC work together to create 
a more fitting tribute to Cesar Chavez by taking advantage of all the fine 
qualities that this great university has to offer. Perhaps USC officials and 
members from La Raza could take time out from their busy schedules and venture 
out into their local neighborhood schools and lend them a helping hand! As a 
teacher, I know I welcome any help one wants to give me.  
</P>
<P>
 To me helping others, especially those who need it the most, would be a more 
fitting tribute to Cesar Chavez than a "plaque" or a "patch of grass."

SIX LOCAL PROPOSITIONS ON JUNE BALLOT DESERVE 'YES' VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six local propositions appear on the June 7 ballot in Los Angeles County. 
Because each fulfills a special need in the affected community, The Times 
supports all six. 
</P>
<P>
 ALTADENA -- PROPOSITION A: Authorizes an annual special assessment for five 
years to provide funds for the Altadena Library District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, the two-library district lost about a third of its revenue when the 
state eliminated a special augmentation fund. The state also shifted some of 
the library district's property tax funds to education. The district's total 
revenue loss last year was $430,000. As a result, it has cut library hours, 
laid off workers and dipped into its reserves. Without new funding, the main 
library soon will be open only four days a week and the branch library just two 
afternoons a week. Other programs will be cut too. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the special assessment for the average homeowner would be $29 per 
year for five years. For homeowners with annual incomes of less than $15,000 
there would be no assessment. For commercial properties, the cost, depending on 
the parcel's size, would be $59 or $79. The assessments would raise $430,000 
per year and restore library services to about what they were in 1991-92. The 
assessment "sunsets" in five years unless renewed. It requires a two-thirds 
majority. Vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 HAWTHORNE -- PROPOSITION B: Provides for the issuing of $15 million in 
Hawthorne School District bonds to fund safety and other improvements to school 
facilities. The bonds would make the district eligible for state matching 
building funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest tax rate any property holder would be assessed to fund the bonds 
(to repay the principal and interest) is estimated at .02% of assessed 
valuation. This peak in the tax rate probably would occur in fiscal year 
1995-96. The district, whose trustees placed the measure on the ballot, is 
presently debt-free and has not asked the community to issue school bonds since 
1963. The measure requires a two-thirds majority. Worth your vote. 
</P>
<P>
 DOWNEY -- PROPOSITION C: Amends the City Charter to make the date of municipal 
elections the same as state general elections in even-numbered years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current charter, municipal elections are conducted at the same time 
as the statewide primary, now held in June of even-numbered years. Beginning in 
1996, for those years when the presidential primary takes place, the state 
primary will be held in March. What this means for Downey is that because the 
terms for three city districts coincide with presidential election years, their 
elections will occur in March. Elections for the other two districts would 
continue to fall in June of their election years. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition C, proposed by the City Council, would provide for municipal 
elections on the same day as state general elections in November of 
even-numbered years beginning in 1996. The measure would extend terms of 
present council members by five months. A reasonable proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA -- PROPOSITION D and PROPOSITION E: A referendum on Santa 
Monica's Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP). 
</P>
<P>
 A group opposed to the plan, Citizens for a Better Civic Center, put the 
measures on the ballot in the hope that the public would vote "no" and thus 
turn back the CCSP. The City Council unanimously adopted the CCSP, which 
establishes design and zoning policies, last November. The plan grew out of the 
desires of the city, county and the RAND Corp. (Santa Monica's third-largest 
private employer) to upgrade their facilities. The CCSP evolved through an open 
and extensive public process. It is a blueprint for a mutually beneficial 
public-private partnership. Among the community benefits is the trading of 
surface parking for parks and landscaped open space, as well as new and 
affordable housing and space for a modern police facility. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND would pay $14.9 million for public improvements, including a park behind 
the Civic Center and a public square on donated land in front of City Hall. The 
city would spend $12.2 million to build a parking garage, with the money coming 
from tax revenue earmarked for transportation uses. Opponents maintain the plan 
is environmentally reckless because the development is too big and would create 
gridlock. The increased traffic should be lessened by certain street 
realignments, including an extension of Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A "yes" vote on Proposition D approves the adoption of the plan. "Yes" on 
Proposition E amends the city's general plan. Approval on both is needed to 
implement the plan. We recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA -- PROPOSITION L: A city ordinance instituting a five-year 
library special tax to maintain current services at South Pasadena's one 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced state funding has cost South Pasadena about $900,000 in the last two 
years. The city faces a deficit of $216,000 at the end of the 1993-94 fiscal 
year. The City Council wants to avoid continued tapping of reserve funds. The 
Police and Fire departments already have been trimmed. The library special tax 
would raise $219,500 next year. Homeowners' costs would range from $28 to $48 
per year, depending on a home's square footage. Low-income homeowners would be 
exempt. The cost to commercial property owners would start at $24 per quarter 
acre, with a $96 limit. If in any year the library budget is reduced from its 
present level, the special tax must be similarly reduced. The measure needs a 
two-thirds majority. We urge a "yes" vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Voters have shown past willingness to approve taxes and measures that are 
tailored to specific needs of their communities. Clearly, each of the six local 
propositions on the June 7 ballot meets that description.

PERSPECTIVE ON BEHAVIOR; A BETTER FIX ON LIFE'S ROAD MAP; WE'D HAVE A MUCH 
HEALTHIER SOCIETY IF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAPPINESS AND 
PLEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN COHEN, Stan Cohen is a commercial real estate developer and occasional 
writer who lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How many social problems that we confront today trace their origins to a total 
lack of understanding of the difference between pleasure and happiness? They do 
share a basic common denominator: They are both human experiences fundamentally 
energized by a blend of physical, emotional and intellectual gratification. 
Where they differ is in their impact on human behavior and the subsequent 
effects on society. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask anyone -- child or adult -- what he or she wants most in this world, and 
the answer is likely to be "happiness," or "to be happy." Follow up by asking 
what that means, and the response is likely to be exceedingly vague, along the 
lines of "to feel good about myself and my life," echoing a recurrent theme of 
popular psychobabble. Anything more specific will usually center on material 
possessions or transient experiences: "to buy a new house," perhaps, or "to 
lose 30 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion grows that even among our best educated and most advantaged 
younger people (and perhaps a good many of their elders) there is a lamentable 
inner void when it comes to a meaningful definition of true happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Try this one on for size: Happiness is making steady, measurable and 
observable progress in achieving the long-term goals that are part of a 
lifetime plan. Happiness is rooted in some combination of the most basic 
desires for a good life that nearly every functional individual holds: to love 
and be loved; to successfully raise a family; to share ample quality time with 
friends and loved ones; to be enjoyably engaged in a gainful pursuit, one that 
fully employs and continuously expands one's skills, has purpose, earns fair 
recognition and provides rewards that are economically and/or emotionally 
satisfying, and to be a valued and respected member of one's community and 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 In each respect, this definition underscores the understanding that happiness 
is not a destination, but rather a journey of progressive fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 More particularly, it is a definition that offers a set of criteria by which 
every day -- in fact, just about every waking moment -- can be calibrated. The 
degree to which a person is occupied in activities deriving from these pursuits 
and furthering his or her life's goals is the real calculus of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, pleasure can be defined as a discrete enjoyable experience, 
subject to each individual's perception of what is enjoyable. Pleasure is the 
fruition of any activity or event that internally arouses an acute emotional 
response: delight, laughter, excitement, rapture, physical gratification, 
sensory stimulation, camaraderie, favorable recognition and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 Wholesome pleasure often contains a strong component of play, and play is an 
important ingredient in many aspects of happiness. The difference lies in how 
play furthers a larger purpose. As an example, playing with a child may evoke 
great pleasure, but under the heading of sharing quality time with a loved one, 
it takes on a more deeply rooted, longer-term significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasure can be as exalting as listening to a symphony or completing a 
marathon; it can also be as dangerous as using drugs or stealing a car. 
Although most people would recoil at putting drug use or car theft in the 
category of pleasure, that is an important element for those who engage in such 
nefarious activities to gratify a craving for excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasure is material and transitory; happiness is spiritual and lasting. 
Pleasure is superficial; happiness is deeply embedded in the psyche. Infants 
and children experience pleasure; it requires insight and maturity to 
experience true happiness. Despite their distinctions, however, both happiness 
and pleasure, in proper balance, are vital to mature emotional and intellectual 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit of happiness is a positive force. Those who organize their 
aspirations in accordance with a lifetime game-plan based on attaining 
goal-oriented happiness become the achievers and producers in our society. They 
lead constructive and fulfilling lives in their homes, in the workplace and in 
their communities. They are the volunteers who are the backbone of every civic, 
religious, educational and charitable group. They provide the moral fiber that 
holds society together. 
</P>
<P>
 Those bent on pursuing pleasure without the insight or the will to progress 
beyond that level can undermine the very foundations of our society. They are 
unable to adjust to the responsibilities of school, family life, occupation and 
the many other demands that society makes on its members. Devoid of a 
long-range outlook and motivating goals, they lack the capacity to cope with 
deferred gratification. Consequently, their self-centered actions often inflict 
great damage on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, we have neglected to properly instruct our young people in the 
pursuit of happiness. Without that crucial understanding, they mistake pleasure 
for happiness, and continue to fling themselves with reckless disregard into 
potentially self-destructive activities. The results can be seen in a long and 
ever-growing list of social ills that bedevil us -- substance abuse, violent 
crime, gang wars, educational failure and unemployability, babies born out of 
wedlock, sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gap between the happiness-seekers and the pleasure-seekers continues to 
widen, the adversarial nature of their differences becomes more apparent to 
each. They are revealed and sharpened in every dangerous confrontation, ranging 
from carjackings and muggings to hate crimes and drive-by shootings. Once-felt 
sympathy for the disadvantaged is now rapidly evaporating in the face of a 
looming fear of diminishing personal security. 
</P>
<P>
 Much needs to be done to teach youngsters how to understand and accept 
responsibility for devising and implementing a realistic plan for their own 
happiness. They need to be taught how to set attainable fulfilling goals for 
themselves, how to plan for the future, and how to find a healthy balance 
between happiness and pleasure. Such an effort grows increasingly imperative if 
some measure of stability is to be restored to our troubled society.

THE STATE; LOS ANGELES' 'SPIRITUAL' SHADOW GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden is a senior fellow at the Institute for 
Leadership Studies, Loyola Marymount University, and author of Surviving Power 
(Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sprawling character of the city and a growing sense of separation from 
elected political leaders and governmental institutions are causing Angelenos 
to look closer to home for leadership and community. And where they are finding 
them may have ramifications for the kind of society in which we want to live. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by scholars at USC and UC Santa Barbara concludes that since the 1992 
riots, neighborhood churches and synagogues are, in effect, filling the 
leadership vacuum, in many ways becoming a kind of shadow government to the one 
increasingly distrusted by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of coalitions and covenants that cut across denominational lines, 
these churches and synagogues are working together on such stubborn 
neighborhood problems as gangs and crime, education, health care, small 
business and job training. They are acting as major outlets for food 
distribution in the inner city, and are equally involved in drug-abuse programs 
and as refuges for the homeless. In all these activities, there is a strong 
influence of the spiritual. Links to Establishment institutions are weak. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any serious division in the religious community in Los Angeles, it 
is between what could be called the ecclesiastical "haves" and the 
ecclesiastical "have-nots." In this case, between those who have a voice in the 
city -- the Rev. Cecil L. Murray, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, Rabbi Harvey J. 
Fields, for example -- and those pastors and rabbis who do not get quoted in 
the media. The latters' lack of visibility matters, because with name 
recognition comes the opportunity to raise money and do more. 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary upsurge in activity on behalf of the poor by the city's 
religious community is partly due to the withdrawal of other institutions, most 
notably government, from the responsibility of caring for them. Another reason 
may be simply the times we live in -- times that see more and more people 
turning back to core values after a period of rejecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Madison T. Shockley Jr. of the Congregational Church of Christian 
Fellowship notes that the reincarnations of the civil-rights movement and the 
liberal peace movement -- the black-power movement and the new left, 
respectively -- were essentially "unchurched." This generation of unbelieving 
and unconnected individuals now have children, and they are increasingly 
considering the effects of their spiritual neutrality on their families, on 
their "moral sense," as James Q. Wilson has noted. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the answer to a yearning for a spiritual dimension to life and a 
greater sense of community is found in religious institutions. But they are 
also discovering that this is not enough, that secular institutions need to 
recognize that the heartbeat of society resides in the neighborhoods, in the 
fellowship that reaching out to others provides.

 A recent national poll conducted by DYG, Inc. for the Healthcare Forum 
Leadership Center, concluded that more than half of all Americans believe they 
can have an impact on their communities, that there is "a new confidence and 
willingness to get involved." This confidence stems, in part, from their belief 
that they have to take matters into their own hands because government is 
failing (only 24% placed their confidence in local government, 19% in state 
government and 16% in Washington). 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this new-found willingness to make a commitment grows out of a fear that 
society has gotten out of hand -- something we saw so clearly in April, 1992. 
Maybe it springs from the mindless materialism of the last 20 years and the 
recognition that government turned its back -- and the rest of us didn't seem 
to care very much. Maybe we should just blame ourselves as individuals and stop 
worrying about a scapegoat. Whatever the reason, the revival of a civic role 
for the city's religious institutions could be a harbinger of an urban spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The task for secular institutions is to follow their lead and develop ways to 
come back to where individuals feel a connection to community. Local government 
needs to figure out a way to reinforce and back up the work of the city's 
churches and synagogues that does not infringe upon church-state boundaries. It 
needs to encourage links among institutions that enable communities to learn 
about each other, and, eventually, to build coalitions with each other. While a 
stronger voice at the top is needed, an active, stable base at the bottom is 
indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy asks of its citizens certain duties, but is unrealistic to expect 
anyone to assume responsibility unless they have a way of exercising it. Voting 
is important, but even more important is the day-to-day actions of small 
communities coming together, reaching out and taking care of the business of 
living for themselves and each other. That's where citizenship really counts. 
That's a building block of a civil society. Government needs to catch up and 
learn a "spiritual" lesson or two.*

STAGE WATCH: MARK TAPER FORUM SEASON HAS A CARIBBEAN ACCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of Caribbean-flavored epics will bracket the Mark Taper Forum's 1994-95 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The season will begin with "Floating Islands," Eduardo Machado's two-part 
Cuban series, and end with a West Indian-oriented dramatization of Homer's "The 
Odyssey" by Derek Walcott. 
</P>
<P>
 In between will be Christopher Sergel's adaptation of John G. Neihardt's 
"Black Elk Speaks," Jon Robin Baitz's "Three Hotels" and the U.S. premiere of 
Terry Johnson's "Hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup (initial date is the first preview): 
</P>
<P>
 * "Floating Islands" (Oct. 5-Dec. 11). The first half ("The Family Business") 
of this four-play cycle consists of "The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa" and "In 
the Eye of the Hurricane" and follows several Cuban families from 1930 through 
Castro's revolution. It will be part of the subscription season. The second 
half ("After the Revolution") includes "Fabiola," set in Cuba in 1960-62, and 
"Broken Eggs," set at a Cuban American wedding reception in Woodland Hills in 
1979. It will be offered as a bonus to subscribers. Artistic director Gordon 
Davidson said that the different subscription status of the two parts is no 
reflection on their value; it's just that it was impossible for this one epic 
to take up two subscription slots without "impeding other work." 
</P>
<P>
 Taper associate artistic director Oskar Eustis, who leaves next month to 
become artistic director of Trinity Repertory Co. in Providence, R.I., will 
return to direct Machado's epic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Black Elk Speaks" (Jan. 3-Feb. 26, 1995). Sergel spent 20 years dramatizing 
Neihardt's book about an Oglala Sioux holy man who had witnessed Little Big 
Horn and Wounded Knee. Several versions of Sergel's efforts were staged over 
the years. Sergel died while this latest version was in rehearsals last summer 
at Denver Center Theatre Company, but his wife, Gayle, and director Donovan 
Marley, who's also the company's artistic director, supervised the completion 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver company will revive it next fall, after which the production will 
be imported to the Taper, featuring an all-Native American cast -- including 
some from Los Angeles. It will be the first Taper mainstage production to focus 
completely on Native American themes. In exchange for "Black Elk Speaks," a 
Taper production will appear in Denver sometime in the next two years -- this 
part of the agreement is "what makes it affordable," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Three Hotels" (March 12-April 30, 1995). Baitz's trio of monologues about 
an American businessman who sells baby formula in developing countries and his 
stressed-out wife was seen on public television in 1991, winning Baitz a 
$25,000 Humanitas Prize. The stage version opened in New York at the Circle Rep 
in 1993, directed by Joe Mantello (Louis in "Angels in America"), who also will 
stage the Taper's production. Ron Rifkin ("The Substance of Fire") was in 
"Three Hotels" in New York and will probably repeat his performance here. 
Earlier this year, San Diego Repertory Theatre presented the play's West Coast 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters are two of the same ones who were in his 1989 play "Dutch 
Landscape," one of the Taper's all-time fiascoes. Davidson sees the newer play 
as the end of "a successful journey" that started with the earlier one. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hysteria" (May 7-June 25, 1995). Terry Johnson's eight-actor play about an 
encounter between Salvador Dali and Sigmund Freud won an Olivier Award as best 
comedy for its 1993 staging at the Royal Court Theatre in London. The same 
director, Phyllida Lloyd, probably will stage it here. It's not to be confused 
with Tracy Young's "Hysteria," a 1992-93 production that's being revived by the 
Actors' Gang, opening Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Odyssey" (July 16-Sept. 3, 1995). Walcott, who won the 1992 Nobel 
Literature Prize, adapted his 1990 epic poem "Omeros," a Caribbean retelling of 
"The Odyssey," for the Royal Shakespeare Company. It opened in Stratford in 
July, 1992, then reopened in London last summer. The Taper production will use 
American talent. Walcott is best known to veteran Taper audiences as the author 
of "Dream on Monkey Mountain," which played the Taper stage in 1970; he wrote 
1974's "The Charlatan."*

 HE'S BACK: Former President Richard Nixon's place in history seems to be 
growing more secure in the days after his funeral. A Wall Street Journal/NBC 
poll begun three days after the burial found that Americans ranked him the most 
important President of the last six in office. And a whopping 73% said his 
presidency was "on the whole good for America.". . . . But his popularity does 
have its limits: John F. Kennedy still swamped him in the poll by a margin of 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 BABIES: Planned Parenthood of Orange County now considers curbing teen 
pregnancies to be its most critical priority. . . . From 1982 to 1992, the 
county experienced a 62% increase in teen births, and organization officials 
see the trend continuing. The problem will be underlined this week at the 
group's annual fund-raising luncheon, keynoted by Alexander C. Sanger, grandson 
of founder Margaret Sanger. Says spokeswoman Sherri D. Zack: "We need to start 
taking a more active role." 
</P>
<P>
 MOM'S COOKING: Antonio Cagnolo, owner of Antonello Ristorante in Santa Ana, 
likes to take the advice of his mom, Pina, especially at this time of year. . . 
. Every year for Mother's Day (D1) he flies her in from Italy to help develop 
new recipes and offer tips on the old. "When she comes here, there's no 
escaping," says Cagnolo, 42, who credits his interest in fine food to his 
mother's cooking. This year's critique began with her arrival several weeks 
ago. Says the restaurateur: "She puts me through the wringer." 
</P>
<P>
 CHEAP LABOR: In Corona del Mar, Carmelo's Ristorante is looking closer to home 
for help. . . . To benefit Corona del Mar High School, restaurant owner Carmelo 
Manto invited 16 students to provide service, some cooking and live music for 
100 guests. The results: $880 for school activities and a new singing duo -- 
called Tim and Mike -- now performing on Sundays. As for the rest: "They were 
great," Manto says. "I believe this summer I'll hire some of them."

 CRIME STATISTICS: Los Angeles Police Department figures show the hot spots for 
violent crime in the San Fernando Valley (B2). . . . Behind the numbers, 
though, are the stories. An area in Van Nuys, for example, has a high number of 
reported rapes because attackers target prostitutes who frequent the area (B1). 
Violent Crime in the Valley 
</P>
<P>
 There were fewer violent crimes* in the LAPD's Valley Bureau's five divisions 
from Jan. 1 to April 30 than in the same persiod last year. 04,14,07,07,10 1993

 NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS: It was a sad Mother's Day weekend for Marcee Murray of 
Phoenix, as she spent a second day Saturday excavating family treasures. She 
retrieved whatever papers and mementos she could from the Northridge Meadows 
apartment that collapsed in the Jan. 17 earthquake and killed her mother, 
Beatrice Reskin. . . . After three hours of crawling on her belly through what 
was a first-floor apartment, Murray pulled her knees up to her chest and 
sobbed. "It's part of the healing, knowing that we have her things," Murray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 TOWN FOR SALE: It's been several days since the tiny town of Gorman went on 
the market, and still no sale. Lots of inquiries but no offers, said Greg Beer 
of Sands Commercial Real Estate, though he added that the current owners are 
overwhelmed by the attention the sale has drawn. . . . And what does he 
consider Gorman's biggest selling point? Having "your own little kingdom," Beer 
said. Yours for a cool $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 EISNERLAND: A magic kingdom with a twist is columnist Scott Harris' modest 
proposal for the town of Gorman. In an open letter to Disney Chairman Michael 
Eisner, Harris suggests a theme park tribute to the American way, with 
everything from Fatcat City to Schmoozeville (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 LAST-MINUTE RUSH: If you intend to give a Mother's Day card but haven't gotten 
around to buying it yet, take heart. Several Valley shops have extended their 
hours to accommodate last-minute shoppers looking for that special something. 
And who are these procrastinators? "Mostly men," said a Burbank saleswoman. . . 
. According to Hallmark, mothers will receive about 150 million cards this 
year.

FOUR ORDINARY MEN REMEMBER WHEN THE WORLD HELD ITS BREATH; WORLD WAR II: FIFTY 
YEARS AFTER D-DAY, VETERANS -- AMERICAN, GERMAN AND JAPANESE -- RECALL A 
DESPERATE TIME.

<P>
 In June, wildflowers invade the Illinois prairie. Rose bushes explode in red 
along the Rhine. In Tokyo, in an old man's garden, plums drop from their 
branches, a sweet springtime barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 June brings memories too. Of another spring, when the world stood still, held 
its breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Of a gray morning -- just yesterday? -- when an untested American lieutenant 
splashed ashore in France to fight for a continent, and a teen-age German 
corporal leaped into his boots to meet him. Of a day -- can it be 50 years? -- 
when a hard young Marine called "Smiley" hit the beach on an island called 
Saipan, and a green young sergeant from Kyoto leveled his gun sights to stop 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men's lives, four memories intersecting on the battlefields of man's 
greatest war, a struggle that left up to 60 million dead, a clash of arms that 
shaped today's world. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs are only four stories among hundreds of millions of people swept up in 
that global tide. But they can tell us much about how it was, about the evil 
men can do. They can tell us, too, about peace, about twists of history that 
make friends from enemies, make partners, allies, customers. Even future 
husbands for future daughters. 
</P>

<P>
 Nauvoo was where Lyle Scheetz went for a good time, a town wedged between the 
Mississippi mud and a green ocean of Illinois corn. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1941, and farm boy "Smiley" Scheetz, 6 feet tall and all-American 
handsome, was a year out of high school. The Depression was still on, the 
Scheetzes barely scraped by, but all you needed was a dollar for a Saturday 
night -- a tenderloin sandwich and chocolate milkshake at Rouse's, maybe a hand 
of cards, and jitterbugging at the parish-hall dance. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, one Sunday afternoon, the music stopped. Out for a drive with 
Virginia, his best girl, Lyle heard it on the radio: Japanese planes had bombed 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of America, Lyle Scheetz was unprepared for war. But the 
Japanese made up everyone's mind for them. "I felt I'd have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 He rode up to Peoria in June of '42 to enlist in the Air Corps. They didn't 
like the look of his tonsils. Downhearted, Lyle stepped outside. Across the 
street stood another recruiting station, a big poster in the window: "Join the 
Marines and See the World." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By spring of '42, the troublesome student from Kyoto prefecture was pushing 
his luck at Tokyo's National School of Foreign Languages. Military training was 
compulsory, but Takeo Yamauchi was skipping the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kameoka, his hometown, Takeo played soldier like the other boys. But 
through his teen-age years, swayed by a free-thinking older brother, he grew 
uneasy about Japan's militarism and the war against China. By the time he left 
high school, he was "half-socialist, half-emperor worshiper." And when Japan 
attacked Pearl Harbor, uneasiness turned to despair. Takeo had read about U.S. 
industrial power. "I knew we would lose." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, after being drafted into the Imperial Army, 21-year-old Takeo 
Yamauchi, bespectacled, scholarly, confused, allowed himself to be whipped into 
shape as a disciplined soldier of the emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he was trying to please his shopkeeper father, the father who would 
one day erect a tombstone for his soldier son. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Miller, Joseph E." was a veteran by the time the bombs fell. 
</P>
<P>
 His turn had come one Tuesday night in February '41, when Capt. Grimaldi stood 
before the National Guard unit in West Haven, Conn., with "good news." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're all going to be inducted in the U.S. Army." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe, a 22-year-old toolmaker and Tuesday night sergeant, could handle it. He'd 
grown up rough and ready, one of five kids of a poor young widow. He hadn't 
gone beyond high school. Maybe the military would be good for him that way. But 
it meant leaving his bride of three months. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Jeannette followed him to the training camps down South. They talked 
about the future, about kids. "We were so in love." Then he shipped out, and 
she was left to wait, and pray, and someday read in the paper about the hero 
from West Haven. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Egon Nuess' mother wouldn't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was just 16. His 37-year-old father, a reluctant draftee, was already 
fighting in Hitler's army on the Russian front. She wouldn't let her boy 
enlist. Never. 
</P>
<P>
 In Roebel, his north German village, young Egon had been a member of the 
Hitler Youth, like all the boys. Then local Nazis tried to enroll the bright 
youngster in their elite academy. But his grandfather, an old farm worker and 
leftist, said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Nazis impressed Egon. In his isolated world, the "People's Radio" 
was all-important: the Hitler speeches, the martial music. "Today Germany 
belongs to us," they sang. "Tomorrow the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no Jews around Roebel, but Egon believed the radio when it said 
Jews were exploiting good Germans. He was so proud, at 13, when his great 
nation went to war. And too proud, at 16, to listen to his mother. On Oct. 20, 
1942, Egon Nuess volunteered for Hitler's armies. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, the father was dead in the east, and the son was headed west, 
to France. June 6, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Utah Beach, Normandy 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Miller, first lieutenant, 4th Infantry Division, had trained three years 
for this day -- Officer Candidate School, amphibious training, Raider courses. 
</P>
<P>
 He could handle anything. But his anti-tank platoon couldn't handle 
seasickness. After two days aboard a landing craft in the English Channel, they 
were begging for an enemy shore. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:20 a.m. on D-day, Miller and the 12th Infantry Regiment bore in, third 
wave to hit Utah Beach in history's greatest amphibious invasion. First off 
when the ramp dropped was a three-man Jeep. It nosed straight to the bottom -- 
in 15 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the hell in closer!" the Yank lieutenant screamed at the British 
boatmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 German artillery fire crashed around them. A U.S. ammunition barge exploded on 
their right. But Miller's men got their shaky legs down in France, on a beach 
where American dead still lay from the first wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Under mortar and sniper fire, they towed their 57 mm anti-tank guns inland and 
dug in. It was bloody going -- a half-dozen wounded in a 30-man platoon. And 
the frightening German artillery barrages made the sleepless night hell. Some 
of Miller's green GIs sobbed in their foxholes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost cracked myself," he recalls. "I decided, no way was I going to live 
through this war. But I thought, if you're going to go, at least take a few of 
them with you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The siren wailed at 1 a.m., jolting Egon Nuess into action. 
</P>
<P>
 In D-day's earliest hours, American paratroopers were dropping onto Normandy's 
pastures. Nuess' 9th Parachute Regiment, 150 miles to the west, was soon on the 
move, by foot and truck, through the pre-dawn darkness, toward the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old lance corporal, trained by elite paratroopers, was unafraid. 
But even the veterans couldn't foresee the cruel conflict about to engulf them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the road into Normandy, they came under nerve-shattering fire from Allied 
planes. Some of Nuess' comrades curled up in terror. "They cried for their 
mamas," he recalls. "They were all 17 or 18 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 In the towns, they trudged beneath bodies of Frenchmen hanging from telephone 
poles, Resistance fighters strung up by the German SS. Nuess shuddered. The 
grim gray German columns pushed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, his anti-tank company plunged into battle along Normandy's St. 
Lo-Bayeux road, against an American armored assault. And in days and weeks of 
close-quarter fighting, Frau Nuess' boy became a combat veteran, setting up 
behind thick hedgerows, covering anti-tank teams as they fired their 
rocket-propelled grenades, watching American Sherman tanks explode in flame, 
watching his countrymen fall. And slowly pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
 Near St. Lo, they took a stand at a farmhouse. A grenade blast blew down a 
wall, killed two comrades and buried Nuess, deafening his right ear. They 
pulled him out, stood him up. The retreat resumed. Hitler's "Fortress Europe" 
was being surrendered foot by foot, soldier by dead soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's 4th Division first swung west to capture Cherbourg, then southeast to 
spearhead the St. Lo offensive, the "breakout" from the deadly hedgerow 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Leveled towns, broken bodies of Germans and Americans, bloated carcasses of 
cows and horses -- Miller grew hardened to the Norman landscape. And the 
fighting grew ever more vicious, with little quarter given. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, an American tank sergeant machine-gunned six of Miller's German 
prisoners as they sat eating K-rations. "Sons of bitches knocked out one of my 
tanks! Burned my men to a crisp!" he screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 The lieutenant knew it was wrong. He took names. But "the same thing happened, 
I'm sure, against Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 At Mortain, German Panzer divisions counterattacked, and Miller and his 
gunners helped hold the line. The Germans pulled back. But American losses 
mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 One night a German plane dropped a flare directly over one of Miller's gun 
positions. Bombs followed, killing all nine men in the squad. "Sgt. Cartwright. 
A hell of a good soldier. What a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mornings, in his wet foxholes, his filthy fatigues, the lieutenant 
would roll over, look up, see American B-24s on their way to bomb Berlin. "I'd 
say, come on, God bless you, get this war over with." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Joe Miller, it had just begun. June 15, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Beach Red, Saipan 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast came early on the landing ship that day, 12:45 a.m. But it was good 
-- steak and eggs. "New Zealand breakfast," Lyle Scheetz called it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine corporal had learned to appreciate a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd Marine Division liked the Illinois farmer's size. They made him a 
machine-gunner. After training in California and New Zealand, he was shipped to 
Guadalcanal in late 1942, for some on-the-job training in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Japanese army's dying weeks on the 'Canal, Scheetz learned that the 
enemy attacked bravely, even suicidally. He also learned that they were not a 
Marine's only problem: On Guadalcanal's remote front lines, he went from a 
solid 198 pounds to 147 on one C-ration meal a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But 76 hours on "Bloody Tarawa," 10 months later, was still worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The landing boats couldn't clear the reef on that Pacific atoll, so squad 
leader Scheetz and his men had to wade 600 yards through murderous Japanese 
fire to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Philips was the first he lost, shot through the head. Then Brown and Bright. 
Then the fellow from Texas and the one from Colorado. Tarawa was taken, but his 
I Company had more than 50% casualties. The stench of Japanese and American 
dead reached pilots flying overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it was Saipan, his third campaign, a key stepping stone to Japan. And 
Scheetz's 6th Marine Regiment soon was aboard a flotilla of amphibious 
tractors, headed for a beach code-named "Red." H-Hour was 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a trench 300 yards in from Beach Red, in a moonscape of craters left by 
U.S. battleship barrages, Sgt. Takeo Yamauchi waited. 
</P>
<P>
 He had reached the Japanese colony just a month earlier with the 136th 
Infantry Regiment, sent to help make the island an "invulnerable bastion." 
</P>
<P>
 Saipan's defenders knew they were next on the Americans' list. But Yamauchi, 
fresh from training in the homeland, wasn't prepared for what he saw on June 
13, a vast U.S. fleet assembling far offshore in the morning sun -- a "city at 
sea," he recalls. He couldn't stand up; his legs grew weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely at noon, the naval guns opened up. Yamauchi and his 13-man squad 
clung to the bottom of their trenches, terrified by the deafening blasts, 
choked with earth, but surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the morning of June 15, a shout went up, and Yamauchi looked out. The 
Americans were coming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The amphibious tractors clambered over the reefs and chugged in toward shore. 
They were under fire -- but, thank God, not like Tarawa, Scheetz thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines scrambled out of the vehicles, regrouped, began moving across the 
narrow beach. Then, Scheetz remembers, "they hit us with everything they had." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Yamauchi did give them everything he had. 
</P>
<P>
 His squad opened up with their bolt-action rifles and light machine gun. 
Yamauchi believes he shot at least one Marine dead. But by midafternoon the 
landing force wiped out the forward Japanese positions and were within 100 
yards of Yamauchi's trench. That's when a battalion officer ordered him to 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It was lunacy, Yamauchi knew, but he had no choice. He shouted, "Let's go!" 
and leaped out of the trench. Almost instantly he dropped behind some rocks, 
under withering Marine machine-gun fire. He looked left and right: Only two of 
his men had followed him, and one lay dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleeding from a graze wound on his neck, Yamauchi scrambled back to his squad. 
"Too many bullets, too many bullets," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Yamauchi's entire regiment counterattacked. His platoon was kept 
in reserve. Silent squads slipped over his trench, headed for the American 
lines. Suddenly the darkness exploded in Marine gunfire and red streaks of 
tracers. The Imperial Army's 136th was being mowed down or driven into headlong 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeo Yamauchi, in his trench, decided he was one young Japanese who wouldn't 
get himself killed for his emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scheetz remembers that first night clear as day: "Banzai" charges, no sleep, 
no food. "And still I wasn't tired. Nerves, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The first 24 hours were devastating. He lost half his squad, dead or wounded. 
The air support the 6th Marines expected wasn't there. It took days to get 
Marine tanks ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 But they inched inland day by day, finishing off pockets of Japanese. And 
Scheetz, promoted to sergeant, showed the way for his men. "I didn't get shook 
up, not like some of them who swore they wouldn't make it through the campaign, 
and they didn't. I was coming back home." After all, he had left Virginia with 
a diamond ring. 
</P>
<P>
 He had his close calls. Twice he was wounded by shrapnel. And one day, as he 
checked out a foxhole, an enemy soldier popped up behind him. Before Scheetz 
could react, another Marine's bullet dropped the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup was gruesome. The Marines had mastered the use of the flamethrower 
and dynamite for finishing off holdouts in caves and bunkers. In the end, fewer 
than 2,000 of the 30,000 Japanese defenders survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, enraged by Japanese atrocities, had made the Pacific a 
no-holds-barred war. Today, Scheetz wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The generals decided we wouldn't take prisoners. But there were some who 
wanted to live, to surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 Takeo Yamauchi, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had joined the chaotic Japanese flight inland. Survivors tried to 
reorganize in the hills, but were spotted repeatedly by American planes, bombed 
and scattered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sun and tropical downpours, Yamauchi wandered through valleys littered 
with the blackened, swollen bodies of his countrymen. Twice he was wounded. He 
had to dig out the shrapnel with his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, Japanese die-hards mounted a last suicidal charge against the 
Americans. More than 4,000 were slaughtered. Yamauchi straggled northward, 
toward Saipan's greatest horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 11, at the island's northern tip, he crawled into a cave where 
soldiers cowered with Japanese women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nights, he could hear soldiers' ritual suicides outside: "Banzai" 
shouts -- "May the Emperor Live 10,000 Years!" -- followed by grenade 
explosions. Farther off, unknown to him, Japanese civilians were leaping to 
their deaths from seaside cliffs, panicked by fears of American "atrocities." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cave, a dozen babies cried from hunger. A senior sergeant, fearing 
detection, ordered them silenced, or killed. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother left with her infant. But in the muffled darkness Yamauchi could 
hear the other distraught women, sometimes with a soldier's help, strangling 
their own babies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the end for Yamauchi, the confused young student who had 
"half-worshiped" the emperor. He got away in the night, to wait for the rising 
sun, to surrender, to take his chances with the Americans. September, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Langenfeld, Germany 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's armies were disintegrating. Bloodied, moving only at night through 
the French countryside, soldiers gathered in makeshift "fighting groups." 
</P>
<P>
 On a road in Belgium, American tanks caught up with Fighting Group Hapke and 
Cpl. Egon Nuess. The outgunned Germans scattered, and their Capt. Hapke 
surrendered. But Nuess escaped and headed east with other stragglers, through 
Aachen, over the Rhine, to a small town called Langenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 All but 20 of Nuess' 200-man company had been killed, wounded or captured in 
the three-month rout. But at Langenfeld the paratroopers were regrouped and 
readied for the Third Reich's final military adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Langenfeld, too, at a farm-resthouse, the war-weary Nuess met a pretty 
young worker named Annelore. He soon left Langenfeld, but she wouldn't leave 
his mind. Dec. 16, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Berdorf, Luxembourg 
</P>
<P>
 In the long drive through France, Joe Miller's platoon got just one break, a 
memorable one -- two August days in Paris, after the 4th Division helped 
liberate the City of Light. The GI celebration is frozen forever in a photo in 
the regimental history, a snapshot of Miller's men thronged by Frenchwomen. 
"Boy, they sure loved us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was on to bloody new battles, at the Schnee Eifel ridgeline on the 
Belgian-German border, and the Huertgen Forest. A mortar blast wounded Miller 
-- shrapnel in the face -- but he stayed with his men. 
</P>
<P>
 By late November, the division needed a rest. Instead, Joe Miller got another 
place in the regimental annals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th was assigned to an "inactive" stretch of front in Luxembourg. In the 
town of Berdorf, Miller turned the tiny Parc Hotel into a platoon post. "Beds. 
A shave. Hot meals!" 
</P>
<P>
 But things quickly got uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are those ours out there?" someone asked one morning. Miller raised his 
binoculars: Infantrymen were pouring through the fields, and they weren't 
"ours." It was Dec. 16. Hitler had launched the great counteroffensive that 
became known as the Battle of the Bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller got on the radio and called back his outlying gunners. They were vastly 
outnumbered, but they'd make a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunfire from the holed-up Yanks pinned down the Germans as they tried to pass 
through town. The enemy turned mortars and tank guns on the hotel, blowing off 
the roof. But the defenders simply moved downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Germans found some unexpected help. It was GI payday, and an Army 
paymaster suddenly showed up, driving his Jeep right into the Germans' arms. 
They marched the captured lieutenant down to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys had better surrender!" he shouted. "They're all over the place!" 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had other ideas. "I thought they'd kill us." His men fired from the 
windows, and a half-dozen Germans fell. The American, unwounded, scrambled into 
the hotel. And for four more nights and days, the siege went on. 
</P>
<P>
 The GI machine-gunners and sharpshooters kept the roads dangerous for the 
Germans. The holdouts even laid a ring of empty bottles outside the hotel, an 
early warning system for nighttime assaults by "Jerry." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd hear the noise, open fire and throw grenades. And every morning there'd 
be dead Germans outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's men ended up five miles behind the advancing German lines. Finally, 
on the fifth night, American armor punched into Berdorf and rescued the 
infantrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 An Associated Press story flashed word back to the States of the "fortress 
hotel." After months of dread and intermittent letters, Jeannette could read 
about Joe in the New Haven Register. And worry still more. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the line, 4th Division holdouts like Miller had slowed the 
Germans, contributing to the offensive's collapse. But the cost of the Bulge in 
American lives was heavy -- 19,000 dead, including scores of captured GIs 
slaughtered in cold blood by German troops. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the huge GI army in the west and the Soviets in the east closed in on 
the Third Reich, evidence emerged daily of still greater crimes, of the Nazi 
genocide of millions of Jews, the "enemies" in a German country boy's simple 
world. December, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 German-Belgian Border 
</P>
<P>
 The waste of war had changed Egon Nuess' view of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Bulge fighting, his unit came under attack as it held a pillbox on 
the Siegfried Line, near the Belgian border. The Americans pulled back, but 
left behind a fallen lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuess helped the captured man, wounded in the arm, back to an aid station. 
Along the way, U.S. artillery fire poured in. The American -- instinctively? -- 
threw himself on his German escort to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His name was Lieutenant Stein," Nuess recalls. "Before the war, he was a 
police officer in Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
 They exchanged addresses, but in the confusion of the weeks that followed, 
Nuess lost it. His single-minded purpose then, as the Reich crumbled, was to 
get back to Langenfeld, and Annelore. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in April, near the Rhine, Nuess and a half-dozen other soldiers 
were captured by Americans. But he managed to escape, to cross the Rhine, to 
finally reach the Langenfeld farm. He took off his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war ended for me April 16, 1945." 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, American troops found him and shipped him off to an internment 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four, Takeo Yamauchi was the last to go home. And there, in Kameoka, he 
found his tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1945, after 16 months in prisoner-of-war camps, he sailed into 
Yokosuka harbor and telegraphed his family. A tearful sister met him at Kyoto 
train station. The family was mortified. He was supposed to be dead in Saipan. 
They had held a funeral, and his father made a speech to the townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was bewildered," said Yamauchi, now 73. "He might have preferred 
that I were dead." 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Tokyo, married, reared a son and daughter. Over the years, he 
worked for a leftist pacifist group, an economic research organization and as 
an academic. Today, he and his wife, Sumiko, live in a sedate middle-class 
district, in a small house with rock garden and plum tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most Japanese, the socialist Yamauchi is uncomfortable with the 
U.S.-Japanese partnership that has helped make his country an economic 
superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Japan is now achieving by economic power what it couldn't achieve 
before by force -- domination of other Asian countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has never forgiven those responsible for the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emperor should have been hanged as the No. 1 war criminal," the old 
Imperial Army sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Lyle Scheetz what the war was about and the emperor springs to his mind 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody didn't fight, hard to tell what kind of country we would have had 
if you let Hirohito take over." 
</P>
<P>
 But the old Marine recently had to update his views of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came home to Illinois, Scheetz had a fine postwar stake, $3,000 in 
Marine poker winnings. He settled into farming, gathering up 430 acres down the 
road from Nauvoo. Corn, wheat and soybeans -- beans whose price was long kept 
nice and high by Japanese importers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at 73, he relaxes in retirement with Virginia in their 1950s prairie 
farmhouse, renting the land to their three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have a daughter, Linda, a high school teacher who came to her father 
not long ago with the news that she was marrying a college professor, a 
foreign-born fellow. Actually, a Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheetz smiled at the memory. "Fifty years ago, I kind of hated them," he 
said, but "they were just like Americans, sent to fight and have one job to do, 
surviving." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the old machine-gunner says he might take a look at a Japanese car 
next time. His "Semper Fi" sticker might look just right on the bumper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the war did have its good side, Joe Miller reflects. 
</P>
<P>
 When the infantry officer hung up his uniform in Connecticut, he told his 
factory boss he could no longer settle for a workbench job. He left for a sales 
career, rising to general sales manager for a tool-and-die company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war taught me to be confident, and open, and an optimist," said Miller, 
76. 
</P>
<P>
 But the war's many victims may have included his Jeannette, he fears. She 
suffered three miscarriages in the late 1940s. He wonders whether the tense 
months of wartime waiting had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 They adopted two little boys and prospered through America's boom years. In 
1982, he retired to Florida's golf courses. Seven years later, Jeannette died. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, in the mid-1970s, Miller went back to Germany, this time on a friendly 
scouting mission, looking for a business partner. "I have great admiration for 
the German people." 
</P>
<P>
 "But, you know," he said, "they're a militaristic people in a way. Hitler had 
to be stopped. Otherwise, we'd be 'achtung'-ing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the old infantryman wonders: Do young people really understand? "When I 
talk about the war, my daughter-in-law just kind of shrugs her shoulders," he 
said. All that blood. All those tears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Egon Nuess looks out his window onto Hardt Street, the road that brought 
American tanks -- so long ago? -- up from the Rhine, into Langenfeld. Today, 
the sleek Mercedeses of a new Germany roll down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Nuess settled in Langenfeld with his bride. She bore a 
daughter, and the bright young man from the north found a calling, tax 
consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost his beloved Annelore six years ago. But at 68, Nuess still runs his 
busy firm and delights in seven grandchildren, including a 17-year-old girl 
studying in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-corporal first learned of the Holocaust months after the war. But he 
doesn't evade responsibility for Germany's crimes. "I accept guilt. I live with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He, like the others, finds lasting lessons in the war: the need for democracy, 
not Nazi-style narrowness and nationalism; the need for friendship among 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memory of war, for the warriors, will always be deeply personal, a 
memory of dreamlike images, of strange moments that somehow don't fit the 
script of history, of random faces, living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The face of the German officer who, surrendering, proudly informed Miller he 
had a wife and daughter in Chicago. The Marine who amazed prisoner Yamauchi by 
carrying a wounded Japanese woman in his arms. The buddy who lost a leg 
fighting beside Scheetz and went on to deliver mail for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Or are these the memories that truly get to the heart of things? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think about that day on the Siegfried Line, and Lt. Stein," said 
Egon Nuess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's well. I hope he's at home, with his family in Ohio."

 To human visitors, the apple orchard at the Rodale Institute Research Center 
smells of damp soil and ripe fruit. But to a certain brown moth, it's awash in 
a dizzying sexual perfume that leaves him reeling -- and unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called mating confusion," said horticulturist Terry Schettini. "The poor 
guy doesn't know where to go." Unable to find a mate, he can't produce larvae 
to feed on the apples. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: no wormy apples. And because the trick is done with insect sex 
attractants, not pesticides, there are no toxic residues on the apples. 
</P>
<P>
 The organic apple orchard is a work in progress. But Rodale's scientists have 
shown they can raise corn and soybeans without pesticides, and bring in as many 
crops as farms that use chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years these findings might have been ignored in the dusty halls of the 
Agriculture Department. But there's been a change of heart in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration -- prompted partly by a National Academy of 
Sciences report warning that pesticide residues could be harming American 
children -- has proposed a package of reforms aimed at reducing pesticide use 
on 75% of the country's farm acreage by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Agriculture has gotten the message. Suddenly, "Agriculture 
is on the side of the table that says it's a good idea to reduce the use of 
pesticides. That's a major breakthrough," said Allen Jennings of the 
Environmental Protection Agency's pesticide office. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, advocates of organic farming were about as welcome at the 
Agriculture Department as boll weevils in a cotton field. Production was the 
focus, and no one quite believed that farms could still rack up impressive 
yields without pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a brief interlude, during the Jimmy Carter Administration, when 
organic farming research gained a toehold at USDA. In 1980, Garth Youngberg, an 
Agriculture Department planner, issued a report concluding that many pests 
could be controlled without chemicals -- and that organic farming could be done 
at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of interest in that report, a huge amount of interest," 
Youngberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 His superiors responded by eliminating his job. "Just the statement that 
organic farming was feasible was enough to get Garth Youngberg fired," said 
Rhonda Janke, Rodale's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, however, and Janke and her colleagues are no longer 
thought of as unrealistic zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Rodale people are fairly objective," said Richard Amerman of the 
USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville, Md. One sign of the change 
in attitude: Amerman's agency now stations one of its own researchers at 
Rodale's experimental farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodale has compromised too. It no longer takes an all-or-none approach to 
pesticide use. Recognizing that many farmers may be unwilling to discard 
pesticides overnight, the institute is working with a network of private 
farmers to help them meet the lesser goal of reducing pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't tell farmers what to use and not to use," Janke said. Experiments in 
pesticide-free agriculture are confined to the institute's own fields. "We feel 
that researchers should take more risks than farmers. We get paid at the end of 
the week whether we get a crop or not, and farmers don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, though Rodale and other organic enthusiasts may have moderated their 
aims, they have not moderated their view that chemicals represent a menace -- 
or that the trend in chemical use is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 30 years, U.S. pesticide use has tripled, and the use of 
synthetic fertilizers has doubled, according to the World Resources Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain washes many of those chemicals into the nation's rivers and lakes, making 
agricultural runoff the leading cause of pollution of lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. farm programs have not only failed to protect the environment, they've 
actually encouraged soil erosion and pollution, the World Resources Institute 
concluded in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are paid subsidies according to how much they produce, independent of 
the effect on the environment. Furthermore, they are not reimbursed for, say, 
planting ground cover to control soil erosion and restore soil nutrients. 
That's a key feature of Rodale's cropping systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, decades before these problems became apparent, J. I. Rodale bought a 
dilapidated, 68-acre farm 60 miles north of Philadelphia to try out some of the 
ideas he was espousing in his new magazine on organic gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine, now called Organic Gardening, blossomed into the Rodale Press, 
the publisher of Prevention magazine and other magazines and books. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm grew to be the Rodale Institute, a nonprofit research and educational 
institution. (Rodale Press contributes money to Rodale Institute, but the two 
are separate.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodale Institute's largest study of organic farming began in 1981, when 
researchers began a side-by-side comparison of conventional farming and organic 
alternatives. The experiment was designed to show whether organic farming could 
be commercially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the researchers rejected earlier studies by the chemical industry. "The 
chemical companies would run experiments and withdraw all pesticides and 
fertilizers and get, say, 10% of the normal yield," Janke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conclusion, said Janke, was, "We're all going to starve to death without 
pesticides and fertilizers." 
</P>
<P>
 Janke and her colleagues decided the companies were right -- to a point. "You 
can't grow corn, soybeans, corn, soybeans and withdraw pesticides," said Janke. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to getting rid of chemicals, Janke said, was to change the crop 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Rodale organic cropping systems, rye grass is often used to hold the 
soil. Legumes like red clover and hairy vetch are planted in between corn and 
soybeans to prevent soil erosion and to put nitrogen back into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In some systems, the entire corn plant is harvested and the stalks are allowed 
to ferment -- producing animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went cold turkey when we withdrew the chemicals, and we did have a yield 
decrease before the organic nitrogen kicked in," she said. "Since '84, though, 
all three systems have yielded the same" in corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The organic systems have other advantages too, she said. "We think the 
nutrient system's tighter in these systems, and we'll have less nitrogen 
leaking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitrogen, a critical nutrient on the farm, is a disruptive pollutant when it 
drains off the farm, spurring the growth of choking weeds and algae in lakes 
and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment, said Janke, "turned USDA around." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean, however, that all corn and soybean farmers can swear off 
pesticides tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The change may require an investment in new equipment, for example. It is also 
likely to require much more intensive management of the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 In conventional crop systems, farmers spray on a predetermined schedule with a 
mixture of chemicals recommended by the county extension agent. Farmers can 
plan weeks and months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In organic and reduced-pesticide systems, farmers must actively monitor the 
fields, said Michael Sands, another Rodale scientist. 
</P>

 "Some people call it reading the ecosystem," he said. "How many weeks do I 
have? What's the rainfall? How does my crop look? How much nitrogen is in the 
soil? . . . That takes a bit of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Agriculture Department, researchers are trying to figure out how to get 
the word out to farmers. "You have to distinguish between the rhetorical 
discussions about organic farming and what happens in the field," said Larry 
Elworth, who specializes in pesticide policy.

EXTENT OF FAY'S SUFFERING IN FLOGGING DISPUTED; SINGAPORE: FATHER SAYS 
CONVICTED VANDAL WAS 'BLOODIED.' AUTHORITIES DENY 'WILD ALLEGATIONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Controversy flared Saturday over how much American teen-ager Michael Fay 
suffered during a flogging he received as punishment for vandalism, with the 
government denying his family's claims that the youth was "bloodied." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's American lawyer, Theodore Simon, asserted after taking part in a 
conference call with a U.S. consular official who visited the youth in prison 
Friday that Fay's "flesh was ripped and broken and that there was horizontal 
slashing and cutting." Simon said blood ran down Fay's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 But a statement issued by the Singapore prisons department Saturday rejected 
what it called "wild allegations and misinformation" by Simon and the youth's 
father, George Fay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore statement claimed that Fay shook hands with the prison official 
who flogged him after the punishment was meted out, smiled and walked back to 
his cell on his own. It quoted Fay as telling U.S. diplomat John Coe that while 
the caning cut his skin, "there were a few drops of blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Coe nor U.S. diplomats have publicly commented on Fay's appearance or 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 George Fay quoted Coe as saying that the teen-ager had "been bloodied" by the 
four strokes of the rattan cane, which he received as part of his sentence for 
spray-painting cars. The original sentence of six strokes was reduced by order 
of Singapore's Cabinet as a goodwill gesture to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could barely listen as he described how he saw one 2-inch-wide slash which 
looked more severe than the others, where he apparently received more than one 
hit of the cane," the elder Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's mother, Randy Chan, did not give details of the briefing she received 
from U.S. officials but added: "I'm extremely disturbed. I'm extremely upset. 
This was torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay is now serving a four-month jail term imposed as part of his sentence. He 
also paid a $2,230 fine.  
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore authorities issued an unusually detailed account of the caning 
and the subsequent meeting between Fay and the consular official. Requests by 
Fay's family to visit him or to send a doctor to treat him have been turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement was apparently based on an account of the conversation between 
Fay and Coe from two prison officers who were within hearing distance. The 
statement said Fay "was observed to be quite cheerful and in good spirits. He 
smiled and laughed during the interview. He sat on a chair shortly after the 
interview started and remained seated throughout the rest of the interview." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's father had maintained that his son stood during the entire meeting and 
walked with difficulty. He said his son was in continuous pain.  
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore statement said Fay told Coe that the caning "was not as bad and 
horrifying as described in the press."  
</P>
<P>
 Fay may be released as early as June 21 with time off for good behavior.

FRIENDS WITH DOWN'S SYNDROME SHATTER MYTH; DISABILITIES: WITH HELP OF THEIR 
FAMILIES, PAIR WROTE A BOOK THAT TELLS HOW THEY LEARNED TO ACHIEVE WHEN THERE 
WERE ONCE NO EXPECTATIONS FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Mitchell Levitz and Jason Kingsley were born, their parents were advised 
to institutionalize them. After all, their parents were told, little could be 
expected of their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had Down's syndrome, a genetic disorder that carries with it a degree of 
mental retardation and the stigma of being unable to learn. Emily Kingsley says 
she was even encouraged to tell people her baby had died in childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sets of parents rejected such counsel and reared their sons at home. 
Kingsley, now 19, and his best friend, Levitz, 22, are examples of how wrong 
old medical advice can be. 
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of their families they have written a book, "Count Us In. Growing 
Up With Down's Syndrome." They tell how they learned to achieve when there were 
once no expectations for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad my parents made the tough decisions when I was young," Levitz said. 
"People didn't think that we were capable. . . . We can learn. We can make (the 
same) choices as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same hopes, feelings, goals and dreams as everyone else," 
Kingsley said. "We want people to know what it means to be us. We are not just 
people with Down's syndrome. We are individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder; a person is born with 47 chromosomes 
instead of 46. The disorder affects approximately 5,000 births a year in the 
United States, according to the National Down's Syndrome Society. It estimates 
there are 250,000 affected people in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people with Down's syndrome have IQs that fall in the mild to moderate 
range of retardation, according to the society. Children with the disorder are 
educable to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of institutionalizing such children are long over, said Daniel 
Crimmins, acting program director for developmental disabilities at the 
Graduate School of Health Sciences of New York Medical College in Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society has changed to say an institution is not the best place for any 
child," Crimmins said.  
</P>
<P>
 When Kingsley and Levitz were born, there was already a movement among 
educators and social workers to work with Down's syndrome children. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical profession lagged behind, Crimmins said, but within the last 15 
years it recognized that these children can learn and can do a great deal 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the life-limiting aspects of Down's syndrome, including certain 
congenital heart problems, can now be corrected through surgery, giving hope 
for a normal life span, according to Crimmins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley and Levitz were lucky. Levitz's mother, Barbara, was a teacher of 
special needs children. Kingsley's mother was a writer for "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Levitz and her husband, Jack, started the Parent Assistance Committee 
on Down's Syndrome in their hometown of Peekskill, N.Y. After Jason was born, 
Emily and Charles Kingsley learned of the Levitzes and reached out to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a bond of friendship between the families and especially 
between Jason and Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Both mothers say the key to success was early intervention. "The idea was to 
try everything," said Emily Kingsley, even if it meant putting Jason in a tub 
full of Jell-O when he was 6 months old to enhance his senses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason made his television debut at age 15 months on "Sesame Street," and 
Mitchell appeared regularly as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Ganz Cooney, the co-founder of the Children's Television Workshop which 
started "Sesame Street," said in a foreword to the book that the show had been 
looking for ways to include children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' education wasn't without hardship. Both were placed in mainstream 
classes in school. Levitz admits he was often teased and made fun of because he 
speaks slower and takes a little longer to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 But his two younger sisters along with the rest of his family offered 
sufficient support to get him through the rough spots, and then he helped 
Kingsley. 
</P>
<P>
 The book reproduces the often idiosyncratic syntax of the young men's speech. 
In their introduction, the mothers explain that they did not edit the quotes 
because they didn't want to camouflage their sons' disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is the cumulation of three years of dialogue between the two young 
men and their families, and it is often brutally honest. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitz asks his father how he reacted when he learned of his disability. Jack 
Levitz replies, "Well, I cried. Big time. I was very upset." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he worried his son wouldn't be able to master Hebrew to have a bar 
mitzvah. Levitz says one of his proudest moments was undergoing that Jewish 
religious ritual at age 13 "because it was my father's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts to enhance the rights of the disabled comes at a time when 
public awareness of the problem is increasing, they say. Federal and state laws 
now help protect such rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitz recently moved into an apartment of his own and works for the 
Westchester Assn. for Retarded Citizens. He's a member of a citizens advisory 
panel for the county Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley is still in high school and talks glowingly of his girlfriend, Tami, 
who lives in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to tell people to erase their negative attitudes. Get to know 
people," Levitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our abilities, we should change it to Up syndrome," Kingsley said.

CHOLERA OUTBREAK SWEEPS SOMALIA 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday that a cholera epidemic in 
Somalia had killed nearly four times more people than was usual in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures issued by the U.N. agency showed 7,472 cases registered by May 5 out 
of an estimated population of 3.5 million. They showed 285 people had died from 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know 15 major population centers are affected but in fact it is clear it 
is now all over the country," said WHO spokesman Valery Abramov. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera is a bacterial disease normally caused by impure water and sanitation. 
Abramov said the epidemic in Somalia appeared to have been made worse by 
undernourishment and the movement of people displaced by fighting.

CHIEF TAKES POLICING INTO HIGH-CRIME URBAN AREA; LAW ENFORCEMENT: TOP COP IN 
PORTLAND, ORE., PUTS COMMUNITY POLICING INTO ACTION WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE BUY A 
HOME IN A SEEDY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN 'EYE-AWAKENING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As night falls, Portland Police Chief Charles Moose enjoys the evening in his 
newly renovated house, and light fades through the leaded windows of his dining 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the prostitutes arrive, looking for business in one of the city's 
more crime-ridden areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think six months ago I would have been in the camp that said street 
prostitution has pretty much gone away on Martin Luther King Boulevard," Moose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he knows differently. Because last year, Moose and his wife, Sandy, 
paid $80,000 for this two-story bungalow, a vacant rat trap across from a 
boarded-up house and an abandoned weed-covered lot in a neighborhood notorious 
for pimps, gang members and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to put the philosophy of community policing into action, to show 
his officers that they could have a positive influence in the city's problem 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to tell whether the example is catching on. "To me, it doesn't 
make any difference where he lives," said one officer, Leo Painton. "I don't 
think anyone else cares where he lives. Somebody can choose to live wherever 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
 But it certainly has made a difference in Moose's life. For much of his 
career, Moose lived in the suburbs, a traditional haven for police officers and 
other city officials -- a place where inner-city problems are someone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through that phase of trying to hide because I was a police officer, 
and it never did feel good," he said. "So this may be risky or whatever, but it 
certainly feels better than hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 Gang graffiti sprayed on a tree in the front yard greeted the Mooses when they 
made the move in November. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, the 39-year-old chief confronted two men sitting on some steps to a 
nearby ballpark smoking crack, a move he later said "probably wasn't smart." 
The two men left without being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of what he sees does not warrant emergency response. That includes the 
prostitutes, who use his street to negotiate deals "I think it would be safe to 
say on a nightly basis," he said. "It's just that not every night I'm up here 
peeping through the blinds." 
</P>
<P>
 Moose said watching prostitutes ply their trade has been an "eye awakening" 
experience. But that's not to say he's been oblivious to the problems of the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose worked the streets of Portland's bleakest neighborhoods as a patrolman 
and a lieutenant. His beat included the Iris Court public housing project, 
which he later turned into a laboratory of sorts to test ideas about community 
policing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 108-unit north Portland complex had deteriorated for more than a decade 
into a cesspool of crime, poverty and illiteracy where residents had no sense 
of safety and little idea of how to care for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the experiment, experts on economics, education, public safety, 
housing and nutrition went to the complex. Police set up an on-site station, 
then went door to door asking people about their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, reported crime was down 55%, residents were no longer afraid to 
go out at night and officers no longer dreaded making calls there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portland Police Bureau now uses a similar approach it calls Operation 
Target, where police draw a circle on the map, ask neighbors about problems, 
assign officers to solve the problems then report back to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is, we've gone to the community and asked them what they think we 
should be working on. And then when we bring that to closure, go back and 
report that this has been done," Moose said. "Then you move to the next block." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's own block seems to be showing improvement. The boards have come 
off the windows across the street. Neighbors are no longer afraid to keep their 
doors and windows open. An older woman recently thanked the chief for making 
her feel safe enough to start walking outside again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope nothing happens to her. But I also didn't have the guts to tell her 
it's probably no safer today than it was yesterday simply because I'm here. But 
she feels like it is, so she's going to get out. She's going to use her 
neighborhood," Moose said. "So is that real? Is that perceived? It's good." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood where Moose lives is not the seediest in town. Residents take 
pride in their success in cleaning it up and object to what they consider 
unfair characterizations of it as an urban sinkhole. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the dregs of society didn't inhabit the neighborhood when Moose moved 
in, they were usually not far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a lot of gang shootings. There were a few crack houses," 
said Ulf Spears, 29, who has lived in the area three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, said neighbor Askia Geigle, "It's, like, I hardly ever see any Crips. 
Every time I come out of the house, I see a cop coming up the street." Geigle, 
17, shares a back yard with the Mooses. "Just to have him right there, it's 
made me feel more secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Moose said his biggest fear is that something will happen to force him and his 
wife to move out, sending a message that the neighborhood is beyond hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate that happening, but there are times when you think how 
tragic that would be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1993, the couple took a vacation to Arizona. Rather than relax, 
however, Moose spent the week waiting for a call that the house had been broken 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back and everything was fine. I was just kind of stunned," he said. 
"And so far nothing's happened. Everything's cool, I guess."

URBANITES GET DANDER UP AFTER TAKING GANDER AT CITIFIED CANADA GEESE; WILDLIFE: 
POPULATION OF BIRDS HAS MUSHROOMED 50-FOLD IN A DECADE. FLOCKS HAVE INVADED 
GOLF COURSES, SCHOOLS, SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANTS, ALMOST ANY PLACE WITH GRASSLAND 
AND A BODY OF WATER. 
</P>

<P>
 Jetliners thunder overhead. Cars whiz by. It's a far cry from the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hubbub doesn't faze several hundred Canada geese that have made their 
home in a shallow pond surrounded by highways and hotels on the approach to 
Washington Dulles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The flock has lived here for nearly 10 years, despite numerous attempts to 
relocate it. The swan-size, gray-and-black birds forage on highway median 
strips or waddle among airport motels looking for guests willing to part with 
their breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds are part of a mushrooming community of Canada geese believed to be 
descendants of birds raised by humans years ago. They don't mind people, 
machines or noise. They don't migrate; they find a spot and stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade that citified geese have been multiplying, wild flocks in the 
Atlantic flyway have declined by a third. Two reasons for the decline, experts 
say, are several poor nesting years in the arctic and reduced habitat caused by 
human encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, ironically, urban flocks of varying size have settled in 
cities all over the United States and in parts of Canada and the British Isles. 
The birds have moved onto golf courses, corporate ponds and school campuses -- 
almost any place with open grassland and a bit of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiring and graceful in the air, Canada geese on the ground are noisy and 
messy. The only thing that distinguishes the city dwellers from their country 
cousins is temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 In small numbers, the domesticated geese delight nature-starved urbanites. But 
without the greater dangers of living in the wild -- predators and food 
shortages, for example -- urban geese populations have exploded. East Coast 
cities alone are home to more than a million Canadas, 50 times more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been allowed to reproduce and reproduce," said Martin Lowrey, 
Virginia director of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Office of Animal Damage 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
 As flocks grow, so do complaints. Canada geese have fouled beaches, 
contaminated drinking-water supplies, created aviation hazards, ruined 
wetland-restoration projects and infrequently attacked humans who didn't offer 
them food or came too close to their goslings. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited hunts have been tried, especially on golf courses, where geese tear up 
greens. But most urban flocks live in areas that are too populous to allow 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of other anti-goose techniques have been explored: prohibiting feeding, 
replanting roosting areas with high grass that makes the birds wary of 
predators, crisscrossing wires over ponds to hinder takeoffs and landings, 
harassment by trained dogs, tethered balloons painted with huge eye spots and 
the use of explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most efforts have met with little success. "These geese don't care what you 
do, they just stay," said Lowrey, whose office is inundated with complaints 
about 30,000 Canada geese that live in the densely populated Virginia suburbs 
outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Most complaints, he said, are minor. But some are serious. Guests at an 
Alexandria hotel have been bitten by irritable geese. Feces from a flock of 
1,200 geese that roost at a Fairfax County sewage-treatment plant recontaminate 
water newly purified for re-release into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints increase every year, said Lowrey. But there's only so much his 
agency can do. Migrating birds, including Canada geese, are protected in the 
United States under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, whether they actually 
migrate or not. Any efforts to control Canadas, from culling flocks to forcing 
the birds to leave on their own, must be approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all hostage to the service," Lowrey said, echoing a complaint from 
local officials who deal with seemingly intractable Canada goose problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Wildlife officials admit that they've been overly cautious about 
issuing permits to control Canadas. They're concerned that efforts to control 
urban geese will counter efforts to recover wild flocks, a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to address both problems, the service has put strict bag limits on 
geese taken during the regular hunting season, while at the same time allowing 
special goose-hunting seasons during a few warm weeks in the spring and fall 
when migratory flocks remain in the arctic. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's almost impossible to please everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters say the bag limits are too strict. "Now people don't think we have any 
geese," said Randolph Murphy, who runs a hunting-guide operation in Tilghman, 
Md., on the Chesapeake Bay. "They've ruined a million-dollar business on the 
Eastern Shore." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials complain that special seasons do little to get at the toughest 
situations, which occur in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee may be the only state that has profited from the new regulations. 
Promoting itself as a goose-hunters' paradise, the state transports nuisance 
birds from urban areas to huntable lakes just before the special season opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "An unmitigated outrage," said Holly Morgan, a wildlife activist in Arlington, 
Va. "They'd never get away with it anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife professionals look down their noses at people like Morgan, but 
activists play an increasing role in wildlife debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, urban goose problems have been a problem mainly along the 
Atlantic flyway and around the Great Lakes. But rapidly multiplying urban 
flocks are spreading to the Midwest and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers in Reno, Nev., and Northern California have begun goose battles. New 
flocks are turning up all along the Northwest coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Wildlife Service, under increasing pressure to do something, this 
spring will consider policy changes that would allow cities or counties to 
decide how to handle nuisance geese situations. 
</P>

 "I think we can craft something that will address the issue before it becomes 
a nationwide problem," said Paul Schmidt, chief of the service's Office of 
Migratory Bird Management. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin Lowrey doesn't have much hope for community-based solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you let the whole community decide, nothing happens," he said. "The 
people dealing with the problem are always a minority. The others always vote 
in favor of the geese."

PLAN BLAZES APPALACHIAN TRAIL'S EXTENSION TO CANADA; ENVIRONMENT: THE FAMOUS 
FOOTPATH, WHICH CUTS THROUGH 14 STATES BEFORE ENDING IN NORTHERN MAINE, WOULD 
CONTINUE INTO NEW BRUNSWICK AND QUEBEC UNDER THE PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 A plan to extend the 2,150-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine 
another 250 miles into Canada was unveiled as an Earth Day initiative by former 
Gov. Joseph E. Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous footpath, which cuts through 14 states before ending at mile-high 
Katahdin in northern Maine, would continue into New Brunswick and Quebec under 
the Brennan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new northern terminus would be at the summit of 4,180-foot Mt. Jacques 
Cartier, which marks the end of the Appalachian range in the spectacular 
Chic-Choc mountains of Quebec's Gaspe Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The 250 additional miles would encompass a broad range of terrain, including 
spruce-fir forests of Maine and New Brunswick and the potato country of 
northern Maine's Aroostook County. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan, a former two-term governor who is a gubernatorial candidate this 
year, met with reporters at his Portland campaign office to outline the trail 
extension proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the project, which is not dependent on his election, would help to 
strengthen the ties between Maine and its neighbors in Quebec and New 
Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trail will be a symbol of our new commitment to work together as 
neighbors, to sustain and enjoy our common environment and to celebrate the 
grandeur of the landscape that ties us together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he put no price tag on the project, Brennan noted that the existing 
trail was a volunteer effort and predicted that the extension would not be 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Startzell, executive director of the Appalachian Trail Conference in 
Harpers Ferry, W.Va., said he was unaware of Brennan's plan but noted that 
proposals to extend the trail in both directions have surfaced at various times 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good people of Alabama have pointed out to us that the natural terminus 
of the Appalachian mountains is Alabama, not Georgia," said Startzell, who also 
cited periodic efforts to have the trail extend into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 A group in Quebec, he recalled, had approached him about a year ago with the 
idea of running a side trail from western Maine's Rangeley area through Lac 
Megantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Startzell said any decision to extend the trail will be based in large part on 
the thinking of the conference's member clubs that build and maintain its 
various sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he indicated that an extension from either Katahdin or Springer 
Mountain, Ga., would not be undertaken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two terminuses are well ingrained in our history. Our articles of 
incorporation refer to Georgia and Maine. So it would certainly be a leap from 
our tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting strong Canadian interest in the extension, Brennan read a 
memorandum of support from Denis Losier, New Brunswick's minister of Economic 
Development and Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a tremendous opportunity to link by footpath two countries 
already linked in so many other ways," wrote Losier, who noted that New 
Brunswick is now developing a provincial trail network of its own.

PROGRAM SEEKS TO KEEP GIRLS INVOLVED IN MATH, SCIENCE; EDUCATION: NEW JERSEY 
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ENROLLS FOURTH- AND FIFTH-GRADERS, HOPING THEY WILL 
RETAIN ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SUBJECTS AS THEY GROW OLDER. 
</P>

 Eleven-year-old Tyisha Wright enjoys science and math, and her mother wants to 
make sure that interest lasts. But she's concerned that teachers may not 
nurture her daughter's enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they encourage boys more to be good in science and math as the kids 
get older," said Kim Wright. "I'm happy she likes math and science. I want it 
to stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
 So Tyisha is enrolled in a new program at the New Jersey Institute of 
Technology designed to help fourth- and fifth-grade girls retain a love for the 
sciences as they enter their teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get them this young, many times it's too late," said Rosa Cano, a 
co-director of the program. "By the time many of them are teen-agers, they 
start forming opinions on what boys do and what girls do. They learn this 
notion that boys are naturally good in math and sciences and girls aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts, including the authors of a new book, say young girls are 
discouraged from studying math and science by their parents, teachers and 
peers. That leaves many young women with less of a chance to earn top wages, 
co-authors Myra and David Sadker argue in "Failing at Fairness: How America's 
Schools Cheat Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The program at NJIT, a state university, is aimed at countering those negative 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls have a very healthy esteem at this age," co-director Diane Muldrow 
said. "But they get discouraged as they get older. They're taught to be more 
interested in their looks and boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyisha is one of 50 girls chosen from 200 applicants for the free program. 
Participants have to be in the top 10% of their class and have an interest in 
math and science. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the classes are held in NJIT laboratories, where the girls are split 
into groups to compete against each other in math and science contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different," 9-year-old Melissa Go-Alcantara said after a chemistry 
workshop. "It makes me want to learn more. I want to study chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls will meet through June, take summer classes in July and attend a 
workshop in September. Cano and Muldrow are trying to raise money from 
corporations and other sources to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Fennema, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Center for 
Education who has been studying gender bias in mathematics for more than 25 
years, said she is surprised by renewed interest in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big topic about 15 years ago and then nobody spoke about it until 
five years ago," said Fennema. "But it's not just a feminist issue any more. 
Men now come when I speak. That rarely happened before." 
</P>
<P>
 Fennema credits a 1992 report sponsored by the American Assn. of University 
Women, "How Schools Shortchange Girls," with awakening people to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan McGee Bailey, who headed the team that wrote the report, said interest 
is growing as society becomes more technologically advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 "More jobs will require scientific and mathematical skills. It makes a 
difference in wages earned," said Bailey, director of the Wellesley College 
Center for Research on Women in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a lot of interest in trying to recruit more women into 
the sciences," said Stephanie Bird, who teaches courses in ethical issues 
concerning the sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Stowe, a high school physics teacher at Choate-Rosemary Hall, a private 
school in Wallingford, Conn., said changes in education must come in the lower 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "My introductory classes will be 50% female, but I lose most of the girls in 
the advanced classes," he said. "I think girls from younger ages need to 
perceive they can have science careers before the situation really changes."

DANA PARSONS: LEARNING TO TRUST THAT MOTHER KNOWS BEST FOR HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I spoke to my mother midweek and, after hanging up the phone, had one of those 
crystallizing moments. Something came into focus that I've been expecting but 
that was still oddly unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Mom had a date. 
</P>
<P>
 She was in Texas visiting her mother, who will be 98 in July. The Gulf Coast 
is my mother's old turf. She and a Yankee from Nebraska named Bud Parsons met 
on her college campus in Louisiana during World War II. He was there for Marine 
Corps officer candidate school and young Pearl Guidry from Abbeville was a 
dark-haired co-ed and, apparently, a sucker for a guy with a line. 
</P>
<P>
 They married in October of 1944 and were together for more than 48 years until 
Dad died in January of last year. Somehow, one of Mom's high school classmates 
from Louisiana heard the news and, after a respectful period of time, wrote her 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 They had had a couple conversations on the phone in recent months, but Mom 
never sounded overly enthusiastic. I told her the guy probably had a mild 
obsession going, given that he hadn't seen her since high school and knew 
nothing about her. But when he learned that she would be coming to Texas this 
month, he asked for a lunch date, and Mom accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 When she called last week, we talked about Grandma and the weather and the 
relatives and the price of tea in China before she got to the good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we won't have to worry about him anymore," she said, mentioning the 
man's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hear about it, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of ugly," she began. "And a sloppy dresser. I suppose I'll always 
compare everybody to Dad, because he was always so neat and well groomed." 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad, I said. Was he a nice guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, he had a beard, which I don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, she was having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, he had a big bulbous nose. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She was laughing too much for me to shut her up. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . and squinty little eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 All right, I get the picture, I said. What about the conversation? Was it 
awkward? 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was OK when he came to pick her up at Grandma's, because my uncle 
was there and the two men hit it off. But when Mom and he went to lunch, the 
spark just wasn't there. She said she "didn't want to tell him a lot of stuff 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
 When she came back from lunch, she told Grandma, "I don't think I'll pursue 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Grandma replied, "I didn't think you would, the minute he walked in 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
 There's something almost comforting about a 98-year-old mother still 
inspecting her 68-year-old daughter's dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom is now back home in Colorado. This little episode with the Louisiana 
Pretender is over. 
</P>
<P>
 But now more than ever, I'm preparing myself for this new phase of her life. 
My sister has given me orders not to discourage her from meeting other would-be 
suitors. I have vowed to faithfully obey. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, it's hard to picture Mom feeling comfortable or confidential with 
another man. After all, how could anyone hope to match my dad's special gift 
for both driving her nuts and making her laugh? 
</P>
<P>
 But is it Mom feeling comfortable and confidential I'm really worried about, 
or is it me? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, Mom is much cooler about the whole business than I. She says 
she's not looking to "meet anyone" and in fact already has told a couple of the 
guys at the golf course that she's not interested. She's learning how to fill 
up the days by herself but says it would be nice sometimes to have some good 
company. The silence in the house after 48 years can be overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I'm the wise old patriarch of the family, I tell her it probably will 
happen and that it was good she met her old classmate. And no sooner do the 
words come out of my mouth than I marvel at the fact I'm discussing the singles 
scene with my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, maybe this Mother's Day is a good time to start getting into the 
transitional mode. As I celebrate the longest and most unwavering relationship 
I've ever had -- that between me and my mother -- I wonder if I have the 
maturity to allow her to someday change the nature of that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Can I step aside, if need be, and let my selfish domination of her time and 
thoughts be usurped by another man? Can I remember to accept her judgment about 
some man she may meet down the road? Can I remind myself at that moment that 
it's her life and that if anyone deserves unbounded happiness, it's she? 
</P>
<P>
 I've trusted her on everything she's ever said or done. Can I trust her to 
make good decisions for herself? 
</P>
<P>
 I think I can. I hope I can. 
</P>
<P>
 That's my Mother's Day wish, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 My Mother's Day wish for me, not for her.

OLDER AND GRAYING, FORMER BLACK PANTHERS MELLOW BUT CLING TO IDEALS; CIVIL 
RIGHTS: BOBBY SEALE FORMS ORGANIZATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN PHILADELPHIA. ELAINE 
BROWN HOPES TO BUILD A SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES SCHOOL WHERE YOUTHS CAN LEARN 
TO BE 'ENTERPRISING HUMAN BEINGS.' 
</P>

<P>
 OAKLAND -- They are older, grayer. They no longer seek power in the barrel of 
a gun, and most left the organization long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing has not changed in the nearly 30 years since they arose from the 
mean streets of Oakland: The men and women who once led the Black Panthers 
still believe in bringing "All Power to All People." 
</P>
<P>
 And though many former Panther leaders aren't interested in reviving the 
militant party of the past -- the Panthers are now just a service organization 
in Oakland -- they lament that the social work they began remains unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frustrated many times and find it very depressing that there seems not to 
be any real voice for the underclass," said former Panthers Chief of Staff 
David Hilliard, 51. "The only thing people seem to get together around for 
today is a rock concert. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not 50-year-old revolutionaries and ex-Panthers who bring about change. 
It's youth who bring about change." 
</P>
<P>
 But the old Panthers try. Bobby Seale, who co-founded the group with Huey P. 
Newton in 1966, lectures 40 times a year and has established a nonprofit 
organization in Philadelphia to teach youth how to organize communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Brown hopes to build a school in South Central Los Angeles, to teach 
poor kids to be "enterprising human beings who will have something to do other 
than hope and wait for someone else to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a personal interest in them because I was them. I know what that feels 
like when the world doesn't care whether you live or die tomorrow," she said in 
a telephone interview from her home in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown grew up in Philadelphia, where her deepest desire was to be white. But 
then the Panthers came along, with their resounding call for social revolt. 
Malcolm X had been assassinated and the civil rights movement was losing steam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, Brown said, "gave me a sense of my value as a human being." She 
was with the Panthers for several years and served as the party's leader while 
Newton was in exile in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our organization is really no different from other civil rights 
organizations," said Seale, 57. "The only difference is we believed in the 
right to self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 28 party members and 14 police officers died in various Panther-police 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Seale says times have changed: "There's nothing wrong with being a cop. 
There's nothing wrong with being a white person. It's about where your heart 
is. . . . We've got to get everyone beyond the xenophobic isolationism." 
</P>
<P>
 But in those days, the Panthers were ready to fight. And, eventually, they 
fell to fighting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldridge Cleaver, author of "Soul On Ice" and Panther information minister, 
fought with Newton. He was banned while in exile and tried to form a rival 
party. After a shootout with police, he jumped bail in 1968 and fled to Cuba, 
Algeria, the Soviet Union, France and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver returned to the United States in 1975, renounced the Panthers and 
became a born-again Christian and a Republican. He continues to recover from a 
brain hemorrhage he suffered March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Seale resigned from the Panthers in 1974, as it dwindled from a high of 5,000 
members, two-thirds of whom were women, to a few hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huey had just degenerated into abusing drugs. . . . I know that half the 
reason of the party's demise was his fault," Seale said. He said the FBI's 
successful efforts to create internal strife could be blamed for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther co-founders, who had made a pact to always "back each other up," 
last spoke in 1985. "He apologized for everything he did wrong," Seale said. 
After that, "I had nothing to say to Huey any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Newton was shot to death Aug. 22, 1989, in West Oakland. Tyrone Robinson said 
he shot Newton in self-defense over a drug debt. Prosecutors argued that 
Robinson was trying to gain status in a prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected Newton to die any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only surprised that it took so long," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 She quit the Panthers in the late '70s. "I knew that I was making a choice 
between bad and worse. I wasn't sure which one was which. My survival instincts 
told me it was time to get out."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, she mourns the death of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if after the Black Panther Party, life went on hold in Oakland," said 
Brown, 50. "I had tried so hard to make that one city a kind of jewel of hope 
in America. It is in fact kind of despairing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard, who was banned from the party in 1973, expects a new movement to 
rise in its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it's going to take. I just know that oppression breeds 
resistance. . . . I know that these are bad times and it was these times that 
gave rise to the Black Panthers," said Hilliard, who now works for the Service 
Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard is organizing a museum tour, beginning late this year, of Black 
Panther memorabilia including prison letters and videotapes of Newton's 
speeches. Hilliard believes it will offer lessons to those who want change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who would try to repeat (our) process is doomed to failure. They 
should take a page out of the Panthers' history and learn from our mistakes," 
he said.

UCI SEEKS 200 MEN FOR PROSTATE RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UC Irvine Clinical Cancer Center is looking for 200 men to participate in 
a nationwide research program on prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those accepted for the program will be tested with the drug finasteride, which 
some researchers believe may prevent prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants should be between 55 and 70 years old and do not necessarily have 
to be suffering from prostate cancer. Participants will be part of a nationwide 
preventive study of 18,000 men sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men. There are about 
165,000 new cases and 35,000 deaths reported each year from prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information call (714) 456-8464.

LET THE PUBLIC JOIN EL TORO DISCUSSION; * CONCERNS COME TO LIGHT OVER DECISION 
TO CLOSE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tortuous process of closing the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and 
planning for its future is offering some lessons in process, in how to conduct 
vital public business. 
</P>
<P>
 First: One has to wonder whether the public will be served by the new Pentagon 
edict that reminds Navy and Marine Corps brass that they "must remain neutral 
at all times," a euphemism for "keeping their mouths shut" as one Navy official 
put it more bluntly, in the next round of military base closings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing for the commanders to refrain from active advocacy of one 
position or another. It is another for them to let the basic facts be known. 
Last year, Marine Maj. Gen. P. Drax Williams, commander of the base and other 
Marine air stations in the West, raised some very good questions about the 
cost-effectiveness of relocating the Marines to Miramar Naval Air Station in 
San Diego. If we fast-forward to 1994, we see that the Marines are under orders 
to begin their move without the money to pay for it and facing a shortage of 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Were Gen. Williams' public concerns a matter of making statements that "could 
be considered inconsistent with Defense Department policy" -- as a Navy memo 
sent down the chain of command put it -- or were they the legitimate expression 
of interest in the welfare of personnel under his command, not to mention the 
welfare of taxpayers' pocketbooks? The answer seems fairly clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Military commanders cannot defy the military hierarchy, of course. But this is 
not the same thing. The public will lose something if they are not at least 
made aware of the implications of a base-closing decision, and from there the 
chips can fall where they may. The decision already has been made on El Toro, 
with the base slated for closure. Orange County and the Marines both are now 
scrambling to cope with the consequences. However, it is worth asking whether a 
stronger case to keep the base open might have been mustered had the full 
implications of a local commander's concerns been considered earlier. No doubt, 
the free flow of information is often checked at the base gate where military 
decisions are concerned. However, the base commanders are the people positioned 
to give an accurate reading on the ramifications of any such planned change. 
</P>
<P>
 Second: Speaking of having a little faith, consider the petition drive, 
reported last week to be "about half way there," which would get a commercial 
airport for El Toro on the ballot in November. Apparently frustrated with how 
local officials have handled the issue to date, influential Lincoln Club 
members William Buck Johns and George L. Argyros want the public to decide. 
These movers and shakers are used to decisiveness and want swift action. Other 
members of their club are not so sure, and the executive board adopted a more 
judicious wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some irony here. Johns and Argyros have signaled their clear 
recognition of the importance of representative government through their 
substantial contributions to political campaigns in the past. They also are 
well aware of what many people being asked to sign petitions may not know: that 
there is a base reuse committee at work on the future of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that there will be an appropriate time for the public to render an 
advisory opinion on El Toro, but first, give the deliberative process a chance 
to play out. Planning for El Toro by holding a finger to the wind is a bad 
idea. Let the committee do its work; let the movers and shakers put their 
mouths where their money is, in support of representative government.

LAGUNA ISN'T JUST A MECCA FOR GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Festival of Pride" (May 1): I just want to let you know that 
Laguna Beach is not just a "mecca for gays." Maybe I don't fully understand the 
point of this article, but I am truly appalled by its content. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, Laguna Beach is a great place to live, even if you are not 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
 We have an excellent school district, police force, one of the lowest crime 
rates in Orange County, and many heterosexuals who raise families here because 
of the desirable positive aspects of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us in the community live side by side in harmony with our gay 
neighbors, and pretty much believe the phrase "live and let live," but we don't 
need you to be scaring away our heterosexual tourism trade with quotes like 
"promote this artists' enclave as a fashionable resort town for gays and 
lesbians."

COUNTY SENDS MESSAGE ON SENSITIVE AREAS; * ACTION TO STOP THE SECRET GRADING OF 
FRAGILE OPEN SPACE BY DEVELOPERS IS LAUDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many years, development in south Orange County seemed to operate at full 
speed, with government playing largely the role of facilitator. Now, however, 
some of the price of a lack of oversight has become apparent.In the past few 
years alone, developers have continued the secret grading of sensitive areas of 
open space in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 What is different now, and what is laudable to see, is the resolve of the 
Board of Supervisors to take a tougher stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have approved a schedule of fines and other civil-court 
penalties to serve with existing criminal misdemeanor punishments for 
violators. Under the new penalties, the county can collect up to $250 in fines 
for each day a property owner violates grading regulations or clears sensitive 
hillside property without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, perhaps more effective than the fines, which easily can be absorbed, 
is the ability of county officials to obtain restraining orders to halt grading 
that is not in compliance with county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors also can get warrants to gain access to sensitive lands under 
development. The action followed the county Environmental Management Agency's 
recent assignment of two inspectors to handle grading violations. 
</P>
<P>
 As Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez pointed out, the grading leaves land 
vulnerable. County officials note that clearings can alter hillside drainage 
routes seriously and precipitate landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 The new penalties signal a willingness to get tough and to send a message to 
those who have stalled the enforcement process by refusing access. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is to be commended for sending a proper signal of its willingness 
to crack down on careless and harmful land use practices. 
</P>
<P>
 With a firmer role as watchdog, the county either can deter wrongdoing or make 
compliance much more enforceable.

BEATING CRIME WITH COMMUNITY POLICING; * GARDEN GROVE PROGRAM HAS OFFICERS, 
RESIDENTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the high-tech world of some police work, the cops stay at the station until 
the call for help gets phoned in, then roll to the scene with tactical squads, 
or battering rams, or flash-bang devices, or something that will get the 
criminals to surrender -- after the crime is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing tries to prevent crime. It has been popular in communities 
across the country at various times, with several Orange County cities trying 
it in recent years. In Garden Grove, for instance, Officer Mark Elizondo walks 
a beat on Stuart Drive, trying to get a landlord to clean the brackish swimming 
pool in the apartment complex, organizing a job fair for residents and holding 
a neighborhood cleanup and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing involves one or two officers patrolling a small area, 
seeking help from residents, trying to calm their fears and cleaning things up. 
Police said broken street lights and graffiti send a message that a 
neighborhood is an easy mark. Clean it up and residents start to feel better. 
They are more likely to call police if they see something wrong, and support 
them when they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a good idea, but it is expensive because it is so labor-intensive. It is 
also a concept that waxes and wanes in popularity among police chiefs, and 
among the beat officers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Pat Ryan initiated a pilot program for community policing in Garden 
Grove, patrolling the Palm Vista neighborhood for five months last year. He 
said he was worried at the start that it would be a program that was "soft on 
crime." Police in other cities have sometimes complained that the program made 
them too much like social workers, too little like forces of law and order. But 
Ryan has changed his tune. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that showing residents there are more good folks than bad, and 
reminding them that they have responsibilities like cleaning up trash, built a 
sense of community and mutual respect among police and civilians. The 
experience rekindled his enthusiasm for police work, Ryan said, especially 
since he knew he had community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove is getting ready to add three new two-officer teams to the 
community police beat, helped by a $593,533 federal grant last December. The 
city was the only one in the county to get a grant, though several applied. One 
reason it qualified was its high crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing will not end crime. But it is better to prevent lawbreaking 
than to try to sweep up afterward. It is also valuable in reminding residents 
that they must be part of the solution.

MECHA SHOULD BE ALLOWED AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Community activists who have been urging the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District to reinstate a chapter of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan (MEChA) at Esperanza High School deserve our support as students 
("School to Continue Restrictions on Clubs," April 18). 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees has said that MEChA does not qualify because of the 
closed forum policy which prohibits all clubs except those that are directly 
related to the curriculum.But the policy also states that the district could 
have chosen to allow club status to all student organizations. Perhaps it is 
time for a change. When the students speak out and express their desires and 
need for a club which gives them a way of involvement in their school, not on 
the streets in gangs, then the district should listen. 
</P>
<P>
 The district officials state that they chose to allow only clubs related to 
the curriculum versus club status to all student organizations in an effort to 
head off neo-Nazi and other controversial groups forming on campuses. However, 
they are not taking into account what is happening to these Latino students who 
would like to identify with a positive group, and the help it might give in 
keeping kids out of gangs and trouble. This would also help to keep kids in 
school to finish their education and graduate, rather than giving up and 
staying home or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA has existed in the past with a positive outcome and should be allowed to 
re-establish in any school where there is an interest.

CLAS TEST LETS STUDENTS UTILIZE FACTS LEARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Conscientious parents are continuing their examination of the CLAS test, 
which is supposedly the improved replacement for the old, inadequate CAP test 
("Parents, Districts Can Exempt Students From State Testing," April 29). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them mistakenly believe that students taking the tests will be asked 
to answer questions which will cause a conflict with their personal or 
religious values. They are claiming that it is against the law to ask questions 
which ask for their "feelings" rather than quizzing them about facts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the test does in fact dare to ask students to express their 
"feelings" about a particular piece of literature. It does, in fact, ask 
students, in its "Open Mind" exercise, to describe what a person or character 
might be "feeling." It even goes so far as to ask students to share their ideas 
in group discussion (heaven forbid) and to express the results of their 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world where a lack of ability to communicate adequately with one another 
causes violent crimes and wars, I feel forced to ask the following question: 
What in the world is wrong with learning to communicate one's feelings and 
explore the feelings of others with regard to an issue or story which touches a 
common chord in any humane person? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a section of society arguing against group discussion and against any 
examination of the way an issue makes one feel. This is an argument for a sad 
regression to irrelevant rote education which has been so very popular with 
people who would measure education by the amount of facts stored in the head 
rather than what the person can do with those facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Facts by themselves are meaningless. What is important to an educated person 
is how to use the facts to support a point of view or to achieve a productive 
end. Education is about communication and the use of facts, not the mere 
accumulation of facts. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no doubt that the procedure used to evaluate this new test is 
riddled with horrendous problems, the test itself is a positive step in the 
direction of meaningful education. 
</P>
<P>
 There might be other and better ways to spend educational funds than to use it 
on this test, but people want tests and accountability. So we have the CLAS 
test. If we are to have it, we need to make it relevant, not just a 
multiple-choice test on the repetition of facts.

LOGICAL WAYS TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The editorial "Put the Bucks Along the Border" (April 27), remarkably states 
that The Times has "argued that it makes no sense to try to control illegal 
immigration" at a checkpoint 62 miles inside the country. It is a remarkable 
statement because the argument of The Times itself makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the editorial does The Times set forth how the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) is to cope with the thousands and thousands of 
aliens who are able to infiltrate the first line of defense at the border if 
there are no secondary barriers like the checkpoint if, as The Times urges, all 
Border Patrol officers should be sent to the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,500 miles along the southern border cannot be sealed even if the 
government does increase the Border Patrol significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thousands of aliens will still infiltrate illegally. The Border Patrol 
cannot be at all places at all times, even with augmented personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 A logical and necessary strategy is for INS to monitor and guard the few 
highways leading north from the border, and which necessarily must be used by 
the smugglers in transporting illegal immigrants into the hinterlands.  
</P>
<P>
 The Times refers to the checkpoint as "largely ineffective and even 
dangerous." The checkpoint is proximate to the border and a necessary adjunct 
to border immigration control. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional immigration officers at the border may slow down and make it more 
difficult to enter illegally, but will not materially impede entry along a 
2,500 mile stretch of border. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint must be looked upon as an integral part of the border defense 
against illegal entry. Once the alien is able to get beyond the checkpoint and 
into the big industrial cities, it is like looking for the proverbial needle in 
the haystack, as evidenced by the recent amnesty program that granted permanent 
residence to more than 2 million aliens who had eluded detection for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asserts that the checkpoint is "even dangerous." It is presumed that 
this assertion refers to accidents that have occurred when the smuggler with a 
load of illegal aliens seeks to crash through the checkpoint, or it may refer 
to the dangers the illegal immigrant may encounter if he/she seeks to walk 
around the checkpoint or through inhospitable terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a senseless disservice to U.S. law enforcement for The Times to argue 
that we should walk away from our enforcement responsibilities at a checkpoint 
because the smuggler or the illegal alien, in the act of violating our laws 
and, by his own action, might encounter danger. The argument of The Times is 
but another example of the softness toward law violators, resulting in 
increased law violations and lack of respect for our laws. 
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The editorial about the elimination of San Clemente checkpoint makes a lot 
of economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoints in the United States are bad for business. Every time I pass 
through one of them, it reminds me of a Nazi-type of government rather than a 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of organizations defending the undocumented workers should 
pressure Congress to eliminate the San Clemente checkpoint at once. 
</P>
<P>
 At the base of these efforts are the lessons learned from the Jewish people in 
Germany of the 1930s: If we permit one group of workers to be used as 
scapegoats for the economic failures of a government without defending their 
rights as workers, what is to prevent us from becoming the next scapegoats? If 
we do not stand together now, who will be there to stand beside us tomorrow?

TRUE ARROGANCE WILL TAKE PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was very interested to read "UCI Eager for Chancellor to End Silence" 
(April 24) on the new chancellor at UC Irvine, Laurel Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a bit surprised to read that she was keeping a low profile to avoid 
appearing "arrogant" and "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years on three University of California campuses, I can safely say 
that arrogance and stupidity are universal attributes of UC chancellors. 
</P>

 Please speak up, Chancellor Wilkening; true arrogance and stupidity take 
practice.

CHURCHES DO FAIR SHARE IN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "Pastors Sing Praises of Industrial Park Churches" (April 13), Millie 
Summerlin, Garden Grove's planning services manager, stated that having 
churches in industrial parks is bad for business and puts a drain on the 
services that the city can provide because of the churches' tax-free status. 
</P>
<P>
 Summerlin seemingly does not understand that churches are a community service, 
saying, "If large amounts of commercial space are converted to church use, it 
harms our ability to support community services." The fact is, churches provide 
not only the obvious spiritual benefits, but also such services as counseling, 
food and financial assistance to needy people, recreation for children and 
youth, family activities and social activities, including support groups for 
those with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches provide employment, a forum for discussion of the issues concerning 
society, an important element of education, and a place where people come to 
exercise their freedom of religion. They frequently offer day care or 
preschool, both of which provide local employment. Most of these benefits are 
provided to the local congregation, the very people Summerlin believes would 
suffer from the lack of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches require far less policing than retail outlets, bars, liquor stores, 
food stores or restaurants. They generate traffic only when other traffic is at 
a minimum. To attempt to keep these churches from locating wherever they want 
is probably a violation of their members' constitutional right to freedom of 
religion. I believe that the reason the drafters of the Constitution provided 
for separation of church and state was more to protect the church from the 
Garden Groves of this world than to prevent things like school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches may not pay as much in taxes as the businesses the Garden Grove 
politicians fear may not locate in the industrial parks because of the presence 
of churches, but they clearly provide a lot more in services than these same 
politicians could buy with the taxes from a liquor store or whatever other type 
business they seem to think a church would chase away.TED G. SHOWN

RECTIFYING GENDER INEQUALITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As we read the article by Morris Hirsch ("There Are Solutions for Women's 
Lack of Advancement at UC," May 1) on the University of California and its lack 
of hiring and/or advancing of females within the system, we were appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of California is an institution largely supported with our tax 
dollars, and they choose to spend these financial resources on lawsuits because 
female faculty find the only way for equal justice is through the judiciary 
system. This is a ridiculous waste of the university's money at any time, but 
with the increase in student fees, it is even more ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 How can the university justify, first, the poor hiring/promoting practices 
with regard to the female faculty and, secondly, the absolute squander of 
taxpayers' dollars to finance these misdirected lawsuits? The university must 
be held accountable to the people of California!

 * The "Commentary on Discrimination" was a real eye-opener. I would like to 
praise Prof. Hirsch's suggestion that the UCI chancellor appoint a blue ribbon 
committee of distinguished, impartial scholars whose purpose would be to 
investigate cases of alleged discrimination and make recommendations based 
solely upon qualifications, rather than gender as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 I would urge Chancellor Laurel Wilkening to act quickly as this is a problem 
that has existed far too long and cost the UC system, its students and the 
California taxpayers dearly.

<P>
 * Recent stories about the departures/resignations of top UC Irvine officials 
may be misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no connection between the resignations of Vice Chancellors Anne 
Spence and Kathy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, their decisions were determined by either professional or 
personal reasons -- not because UCI is unfair to women. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chancellor Laurel Wilkening states, it is unfortunate that both of these 
resignations have come at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to imply that their gender is in some way connected with these 
resignations is misleading and inaccurate. Rather, UCI has been proactive in 
appointing women to top academic positions, including the chancellor, the dean 
of biological sciences and the executive director of the UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of gender equality is an important one on our campus. Chancellor 
Wilkening has made it clear to the faculty that rectifying gender inequalities 
both at UCI and throughout the entire UC system is a high priority of hers, but 
that it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCI to successfully navigate these difficult times and fulfill its 
missions in education, research and community service/partnering, all of us 
(faculty, students, employees and community leaders) need to work together.

SUPERVISORS LET EGOS UPSTAGE NIXON FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was privileged to be in attendance at the funeral for Richard Nixon. It 
was a remarkable experience to personally witness a milestone of such national 
and world prominence, and I was grateful for the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, I read with both amusement and disdain the very petty 
squabbling among the Orange County supervisors ("Vasquez's Special Treatment at 
Nixon Funeral Frustrates Board," May 3) as to who was wearing what color pin 
and who was admitted to what and who was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps our illustrious officials would prefer to remain at play in their 
sandbox at the next event and let others who would be more appreciative attend 
in their places. 
</P>

 * Attending a funeral is an act of respect, not a right. Many of us stood in 
line to pay homage to a man and an office (President Nixon). We did this 
because we considered it a privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us in those five- and six-hour lines could have demanded some special 
perk but didn't. This was a funeral, not the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that our Board of Supervisors believe they can demand some special 
rights because they are representing the people is appalling. The people who 
were standing patiently in the long lines were paying their respects to 
President Nixon, not conniving their way through private doors. Our elected 
officials should re-evaluate their elitist attitudes. 
</P>

<P>
 * Orange County's Board of Supervisors have finally reached a new low, which I 
thought was impossible from that bunch. It appears that some of them are upset 
that following the funeral of the former President, they didn't get to go to 
the reception hosted by Nixon's family. Please. Cry me a river! 
</P>
<P>
 Someone should tell them that it was a funeral! Whatever your opinion of his 
presidency (and mine was not high), the man was loved and missed by his 
children, grandchildren and longtime friends. He had died fairly suddenly, in 
front of them, a few days before. I'm sure their hearts still ached with their 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Where were Supervisors (Harriett M.) Wieder and (William G.) Steiner? Our 
exalted representatives were sneaking past "a phalanx of security personnel to 
gain admission to the reception." Do the words boorish or unsophisticated come 
to mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine if any one of us attempted to sneak past security to gain 
admittance to their offices when they were busy meeting with rich developers 
with campaign contributions? The gnatcatcher would really hit the fan! 
</P>
<P>
 At least Supervisor (Thomas F.) Riley had the good manners to go home. And 
poor Supervisor (Roger R.) Stanton -- completely locked out and overlooked. He 
had to wait a whole half an hour for his ride. On the bright side, at least 
they car-pooled! 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad three out of five of our county supervisors don't have the 
manners or sense to know that a funeral, even a funeral for a former President, 
is just that. It is a time for family and friends to grieve and to say goodby 
to a loved one. Would that they worked as hard solving the graffiti, 
homelessness, unemployment and other issues they were elected to do. 
</P>

 * It is very difficult for me to comprehend that the Orange County supervisors 
could put their egos before sympathy for President Nixon's surviving daughters 
and their families. It's a shame.

HELPING DISNEY GROW HELPS COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the so-called "Disney parking structure" (Letters, April 24): 
Object if you will, but please get the facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure is to be a multiuse transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a center in Anaheim's Stadium/Convention Center/Disneyland area has been 
under consideration for some time, even before the Westcot project was 
announced, and will be built whether or not Disneyland expands. 
</P>
<P>
 If Disneyland expands, all Disneyland will get from the transportation center 
is parking spaces: The revenues will go to the Orange County Transportation 
Authority. Because of this, a transportation center will be an investment, not 
a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the structure were for the benefit of Disneyland, such a structure 
would be in the old American tradition of government help for business. 
</P>
<P>
 In this tradition, there are direct subsidies such as those to the highly 
lucrative tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tax breaks for capital investment. There are incentives to locate, 
to stay or to expand, such as the state of California is considering for Taco 
Bell's corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the way in which transportation money is spent which causes the 
freeways to be overcrowded; they are overcrowded because there are too many 
people and because there is a scarcity of land available for expanding 
freeways.

TRAVEL INSIDER; CONNECTING WITH A CONDO THAT'LL MAKE YOUR VACATION; LODGING: AS 
MORE TRAVELERS PICK CONDOMINIUMS OVER HOTELS, LOCATION SERVICES ARE 
MULTIPLYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When my wife and I invited my mother to join us on a summer getaway to Aspen, 
Colo., last year, we decided our best lodging choice was to rent a two-bedroom, 
two-bath condominium apartment. It proved a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The condo was no more expensive than two separate rooms in a comparable hotel, 
and we could share the extra space of a living room and a fully equipped 
kitchen. Each morning, we ate an unhurried breakfast together in our condo 
before setting out to explore the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel industry surveys indicate a growing interest among vacationers in condo 
rentals. But those so inclined face two hurdles: Who do you call to make a 
reservation? And how do you know the place isn't a dump? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, finding a satisfactory condo rental is getting easier, although 
it is nowhere near as simple a task as picking up the phone and booking a hotel 
room or making a reservation in such other vacation alternatives as bed and 
breakfast inns, country inns and guest ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hotels, condo rentals come in budget, mid-price and luxury categories, 
and you can rent in a building with as few as a dozen units or in a giant 
complex with hundreds of units. Many condo resorts provide a full sweep of 
recreational facilities, ranging from swimming pools to 18 holes of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, they differ greatly. At the Gant in Aspen, where we stayed, 
we checked in at a hotel-like front desk, but at some condos you have to 
arrange to pick up a key at a rental office at another site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many units are privately owned, and the owners furnish them to suit their 
tastes. At some condos, daily housekeeping service is offered; at others, you 
do it yourself. At many places, you may have to pay in advance for your entire 
stay. And some condos limit rentals to a seven-day minimum on a 
Saturday-to-Saturday basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite obviously, condos are not for everyone. On a skiing trip alone to Park 
City, Utah, a few years back, I made the mistake of booking a one-bedroom condo 
apartment near the slopes. It was a lovely unit, but all the apartments around 
mine were filled with families, and I felt completely out of place -- and a 
little lonely. I knew after the first day I would have been much happier 
staying in a busy inn or lodge where I would have been in the company of other 
solo skiers like myself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you rent a condo, you will want to know what to expect in order to 
avoid disappointment. Among the resources to guide you: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chambers of commerce or visitor information offices: At most resort 
destinations, the tourist information office can provide a list of real estate 
or rental agencies that handle condominium rentals. Typically, the agencies 
offer a wide choice of properties to meet your needs and your budget. Keep 
asking questions until you are satisfied you know what you are getting. Some 
agencies compile photo catalogues describing their properties. Request a copy 
before you make a deposit.  
</P>
<P>
 * Condo reservation services: Several vacation reservation services specialize 
in condominium rentals. If you are arranging a condo vacation through a travel 
agency, the agency probably will consult a reservation service. Or you can make 
the call on your own. One such service, Condolink of Omaha, Neb. (tel. 
800-733-4445), specializes in time-share rentals in major beach and ski resorts 
throughout the United States. Another, Creative Leisure International of 
Petaluma, Calif. (tel. 800- 426-6376), puts together complete condo vacation 
packages in Hawaii, Mexico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Condominium Travel Associates, founded in 1990, is an organization of about 
325 travel agents in the United States and Canada who regularly market condo 
vacations as a part of their travel services. When you call the organization 
(tel. 800- 492-6636), you will be given the name, phone number and address of 
the member agent nearest you. Dynasty Travel's Mac Parrish is a member. The 
agents can provide you with brochures and a property description sheet 
detailing the amenities of any condos that interest you. The agents also handle 
the booking. Condominium Travel is promising a discount of 10%-40% off what you 
would pay if you phoned the condominium directly, says president Rick Fisher. * 
Guidebooks: So far, there are only two guidebooks of which I am aware that make 
a serious effort to provide travelers with the details they need to know to 
rent a condo. "Condo & Villa Vacations Rated" by Clinton Burr and Ellen Burr 
comes in two volumes (Prentice Hall; $17 each). One lists 3,200 condo rentals 
in the United States and Canada, the other 2,000 condo rentals in Hawaii, 
Mexico and the Caribbean. The condo complexes are inspected and rated from one 
to 10. Most of the condos included in the guide are privately owned as opposed 
to being part of a time-share arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
 The other guidebook, "Condo Vacations" by Pamela Lanier (Lanier; $14.95), 
describes 3,000 vacation condominiums in the United States, the Caribbean and 
Mexico, but without evaluation. Descriptive material, the author says, is based 
on material submitted by the condo management or, in some cases, by someone who 
has stayed in a condo and offered a critique.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK; TENT TALES; THE DIGS WERE SPARTAN BUT 
THE SETTING SUBLIME FOR ONLY DOLLARS A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Haldane is a reporter for The Times' 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The epiphany came for me late one afternoon on the banks of the Merced River 
as I demonstrated abominably average rock-skipping skills to my 9-year-old 
daughter, Adina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, look at that," she exclaimed to her little brother, Drew. "Dad is good 
at everything!" 
</P>
<P>
 The comment took me back about 35 years to a similar demonstration by another 
dad -- mine. I remembered my own childish wonder at his skipping prowess, the 
comforting feeling that he knew everything, could do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments are fleeting, of course, soon to be replaced by the knowledge 
that our parents are certainly fallible and we are basically in the game alone. 
For a few shining moments, though, people with children get their turns in the 
sun. Several of my turns have come at Yosemite, a place I consider among the 
most beautiful on earth. It was to this wilderness paradise that I recently 
brought my children to engage in the ritual that my own father shared with me, 
the family semi-camp-out. 
</P>
<P>
 We had begun our trip not knowing exactly what to expect; common wisdom has it 
that you have to call months in advance for reservations. Yet we called a 
couple of weeks ahead and easily reserved space at Curry Village, a relatively 
inexpensive resort at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, for $37.50 a night, a family of three can rent one of 450 tent cabins, 
primitive accommodations consisting of permanent wood frames four steps off the 
ground with wooden floors and canvas walls. There's no heat, closet, carpeting, 
bathroom or kitchen. Just a couple of beds, a dresser and the nearby community 
shower; considerably more Spartan than a room at the Ahwahnee Hotel for $208, 
or one at Yosemite Lodge for $77. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was also more comfortable than an $8 campsite, affording the illusion 
of camping without all of its attendant hassles. And, we were told, generally 
available on short notice anytime except June, July or August. Perfect for what 
was to be our second trip to Yosemite together in the 2 1/2 years since my wife 
and I separated, dividing our households and our time with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Los Angeles on a Saturday morning during Adina and Drew's spring 
vacation in early April, we made it to Yosemite Valley in just over seven hours 
-- an enormous chunk of it spent trying to get out of the city itself. To 
facilitate the trip, we packed apples and cherry yogurt in an ice chest and 
rented something I highly recommend when traveling with youngsters: a series of 
children's books on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging finally from the Wawona Tunnel -- a long passage that burrows through 
a mountain to burst dramatically onto the first vista of Yosemite Valley -- I 
stopped the car long enough for the kids to gasp at the fairy-like specter of 
Bridalveil Falls cascading down the face of a distant cliff. Then it was on to 
Curry Village to check into our tent, unpack our bags and take an exploratory 
stroll.  
</P>
<P>
 Lots of other families with children were around, as well as a few young 
couples and what looked like some youth groups. They, and we, cheerfully 
wandered past the outdoor amphitheater where forest rangers lecture nightly, in 
and out of the gift shop, sport shop, ice cream parlor and burger joint, and 
through the village lounge with its comfortable couches and huge stone 
fireplace. We toured the rest of the campground, peering casually through the 
windows of the tidy heated cabins available at $49.50 per night without 
bathrooms or $63.75 with them. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner, the children decided on pizza at the Curry Village pizzeria. 
Almost immediately, they spotted a raccoon meandering among the tables on the 
patio. They dubbed it "Bandit" and watched for half an hour as I finished my 
Coke and chatted about earthquakes with an amiable couple from England. Then, 
after a rest in the lounge during which I read a book and the kids drew 
pictures, we retired to our tent where I -- wracked by cold and the loud snores 
of a next-tent neighbor -- spent the night tossing and turning while the little 
ones dreamed heavily of bears and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of our accommodations included sheets, pillows and as many wool 
blankets as we could muster, but the 42-degree nighttime temperature made me 
glad that we'd brought our sleeping bags as well. Snuggled deeply into them, 
rest came more easily on subsequent nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day was Sunday, a glorious blue cloudy day with the great Half Dome 
looming moodily over Curry Village and the little town of tents. Walking in 
sweaters to the village cafeteria, we found a long line of sleepy-looking 
guests snaking past an almost confounding array of aromatic foods. For about 
$18, we finally settled on a breakfast of bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns, 
pancakes and juice. Then we set off toward Mirror Lake on a 1.5-mile trail 
dotted with huge granite rock formations featuring cavernous "rooms" that 
provided the perfect grist for youthful imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yosemite is marvelous at this time of year, just awakening from its long 
winter sleep. With the waterfalls at their peak, the valley's wide wet meadows 
croak with frogs and bud with manzanita, oak, maple and dogwood. "Everything 
looks so fresh and green," Jeff Samco, a ranger naturalist, told us the next 
day during our stop at the visitor's center in Yosemite Village, about a mile 
and a half west of where we were staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around the valley floor is easy; you can leave your car parked at your 
quarters and take the shuttle or, as in our case, drive yourself from place to 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in spring, Samco said, the dogwood trees will bloom with big yellow 
blossoms. The Western azaleas will flower into sweet-smelling trumpet-shaped 
flowers. And gradually as spring wends into summer, the area's wild residents 
-- deer, coyote, bear and bobcat -- will become increasingly visible. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular day, however, caves were on my children's minds as they 
darted in and out of dark openings and displayed heroic poses on (low, 
reasonably safe) ledges. Later, after we'd skipped back down to the start of 
the trail, the kids declined a scrumptious brunch at the Ahwahnee Hotel that 
would have cost $16.35 for me and $13.50 per child, in favor of hamburgers at 
Yosemite Village. After lunch, we sauntered behind the visitor's center to the 
Ahwahnee village, an authentic re-creation of a Native American hamlet of the 
1870s, complete with bark tepees, a smokehouse and a prayer lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was here that Adina and Drew found one of their favorite spots 
in the valley, a tiny babbling brook at which they spent more than an hour 
building miniature bridges made of twigs.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, we drove down the road, stopping only for the long walk along the 
Merced River during which I delivered my lesson on rock skipping. Then it was 
back to the car for the ride to Bridalveil Falls where, hidden behind a boulder 
beneath the powerful flow, the kids floated bark boats down the treacherous, 
swirling waters while getting soaked in the shimmering mists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Adina said, barely audible above the roar. "I never want to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end we had to, of course. Gliding down the freeway back toward 
civilization, the kids seemed quieter than they had before. There were, of 
course, the usual fights over who got to sit in the front seat and where we'd 
stop for dinner. But, for a little while at least, there also seemed to be a 
kind of restfulness, the quiet reverence of an experience shared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy, this is so beautiful ," Adina had said as we pulled onto the highway 
after bidding our final farewells to a shaggy-looking coyote meandering by the 
side of the road. "Can we do this every year?" 
</P>

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER; MINDING MOTION SICKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It can ruin a car trip or an airplane flight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been known to spoil a Mad Tea Party ride at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 It can turn the most relaxing, romantic cruise into the voyage from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 But since most who suffer from motion sickness don't seek medical help, 
experts are hard-pressed to say exactly how many are afflicted. There's still 
debate, in fact, about its cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists do agree on a few points. Those who have had one bout of motion 
sickness are likely to get it again. And the best prevention techniques vary 
greatly from person to person. 
</P>
<P>
 A phenomenon called "sensory mismatch" is believed to be the culprit. "The 
brain gets different messages from three different sensory systems," said Dr. 
Fred Linthicum, a researcher at the House Ear Institute, Los Angeles. The eyes 
send one message, the ears another and the musculo-skeletal system yet another. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose a passenger is riding in the back seat of a car on winding roads. As 
he stares at the back of the seat, his eyes tell him he is not moving. "But his 
behind tells him he's bouncing and his inner ears (responsible for maintaining 
balance) tell him he is going around curves," Linthicum said. "The central 
nervous system can't accept all these conflicting messages." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, there has been another theory under investigation, he said. 
Overstimulation of the balance center in the brain may affect the nearby center 
that regulates vomiting. But that has yet to be proven, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its cause, motion sickness is often accompanied by queasiness, 
fatigue, lightheadedness and sleepiness. Travelers may also yawn, 
hyperventilate, have cold sweats and vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is surprising is that those who get car sick may not get air sick; 
nor will people prone to air sickness necessarily be prone to car sickness. And 
people who can't handle amusement park rides, may not necessarily have a 
problem with cars or boats, according to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland, for instance, park visitors occasionally show up at the 
first-aid station complaining of motion sickness, said park spokesman John 
McClintock. Most often, they've just disembarked from the spinning Mad Tea 
Party tea cups or Space Mountain ride, according to a first-aid station nurse. 
Visitors are encouraged to lie down until the queasiness passes and are 
informed that motion sickness remedies are sold in the park . . . just in case 
it occurs again. 
</P>
<P>
 Car sickness tends to be more common in children than adults, studies have 
found, and some experts say women are more prone than men to motion sickness. 
Others theorize that women are probably just more likely than men to report the 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Once travelers have been motion sick, they can be "on guard," said Robert 
Stern, a Pennsylvania State University researcher. Anxiety and fear can worsen 
the condition. Poor ventilation can also increase the changes of an attack 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention is easier than treatment, experts concur. To avoid or minimize 
motion sickness, they offer a plethora of suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Eat a small, nonfatty meal (before traveling)," Stern suggested, reasoning 
that getting sick is more likely if passengers are hungry. Crackers and 
carbonated soda are often advised. "Eat something every two hours," Stern 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Look out (the window) while traveling so all the senses get a sense of 
motion," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider over-the-counter remedies such as Dramamine (dimenhydrinate) or 
Bonine (meclizine). Follow package directions and take the pills before travel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acupressure could be helpful, said Fred Siciliano, a Ventura licensed 
acupuncturist. Locate the spot two finger widths above the wrist crease, palm 
side, he suggested. Apply moderate pressure with the thumb for three to five 
minutes before boarding and during flight or other motion. This can calm the 
stomach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Band-Aid-like patches impregnated with the drug scopolamine (Transderm-Scop) 
and usually placed behind the ear are available by prescription. Possible side 
effects include blurred vision and dry mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

TAKING THE KIDS; NATIONAL PARKS FOR JUNIOR RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "They're just a bunch of big, old trees," Reggie grumbled. "Can we leave now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Boring," Matt agreed. We were walking along a paved trail at Muir Woods 
National Monument just north of San Francisco looking at the giant redwoods. 
The towering trees, some more than 200 feet tall and more than 1,000 years old, 
were spectacular. But just seeing them wasn't enough to keep an active 
10-year-old and his 8-year-old sister, Reggie, interested. Even worse, the 
level path we were following was much too tame to offer a hiking challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 I really blew it. We could have had a terrific afternoon exploring had we 
known about the free discovery pack distributed at the visitor center. The 
kid-size backpack comes complete with binoculars, magnifying lens, ruler, paper 
and pencil, bug box, net and a list of activities that would have kept my 
children happily involved for hours, teaching them about the forest in the 
bargain.  
</P>
<P>
 There were far more challenging hiking routes we could have taken. But I 
didn't know about them or the free packs because I hadn't asked at the visitor 
center when we'd arrived. I was in too great a hurry to get going. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families who visit national parks have the same problem, rangers say. 
"People want to see the park in five minutes. It would be nice if they slowed 
down. They'd get much more out of the experience," said Allison Campbell, who 
oversees education programs at Muir Woods. Campbell said that the park gets 1.6 
million visitors a year, yet only 600 used the discovery packs last year. And 
many of those came with school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of exhausted kids and exasperated parents," agreed Candice 
Tinkler, education specialist for the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't have to be that way. National parks today are reaching out to 
children and families with an array of special programs and activities at large 
parks, as well as at smaller historic sites. The Parks as Classrooms program, a 
joint effort of the National Park Service and its philanthropic arm, the 
National Park Foundation, has reached more than 1.5 million school children 
since it started in 1992. And plans are underway to join the popular Junior 
Ranger programs at many national parks into one national program with unique 
regional characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts come at a time when aging baby boomers are searching for more 
active and meaningful (and, perhaps, budget) vacations to share with their 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessary to head to the biggest and most crowded parks. "Most of the 
367 national parks now offer Junior Ranger or other programs for children," 
said Corky Mayo, chief of interpretation for the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider spending a day at a national historic site near your home or a 
weekend at one of the smaller parks around the country. The rangers are eager 
to show off what makes their locales special. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask rangers how to make the most out of a visit to their park and they'll urge 
families to adopt a leisurely pace and enjoy the park, rather than racing 
through the day to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, let the kids do the planning. Talk about what everyone wants to 
do: Hike up to the top of a waterfall at Yosemite National Park in California, 
slide down a huge sand dune at White Sands National Monument in New Mexico, 
fish for trout at Glacier National Park in Montana. What animals do they want 
to see? The kids could even help plan which trails to hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears weekly.

GENOCIDE AND GENES; A 'NATURAL' ACTION MAY BE ATROCIOUSLY IMMORAL, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genocide, according to Jared Diamond, a research biologist at UCLA, is a 
behavior that Homo sapiens shares with the other primates, notably with the two 
extant species of chimpanzee. Attested in several other species, genocide is 
particularly well-documented among primates. Field research has shown clearly 
that bands of chimps exterminate rival bands down to the last member. As for 
the normality of genocide in humans, its empirical frequency -- Diamond counts 
17 attested occurrences between 1950 and 1990 alone -- is disturbing 
confirmation that, in this of all instances, the immoral is not unnatural. Do 
Humans Have a Collective Genetic Capacity for Genocide? 
</P>
<P>
 In morality, as in all human achievement,humankind often challenges nature. We 
are genetically programmed to like sweets, for example, but our original 
environment, in which they were rare, has been succeeded by one in which they 
are harmfully abundant. A correction is called for. Our collective capacity for 
genocide, fatally enhanced by technology, calls more urgently for a similarly 
collective correction. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as Diamond and such other observers as psychologist Robert Jay 
Lifton have noted, genocide induces a psychic numbing not just in its victims 
and perpetrators but also in those who merely witness or hear of it. The ape in 
us, so to speak, knows enough about ape destructive capability to run from the 
sight and sound of mass murder. But the ape's repugnance may indeed be like the 
craving for sweets: undeniably natural but, in the contemporary context, a 
harmful reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in 1992 in his brilliant "The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and 
Future of the Human Animal," Diamond carefully distinguishes several situations 
in which genocide is attested, including the ominously familiar "lengthy power 
struggle within a pluralistic society, leading to one group's seeking a final 
solution by killing the other. Cases involving two different ethnic groups are 
the killing of Tutsi in Rwanda by Hutu in 1962-63, of Hutu in Burundi by Tutsi 
in 1972-73, of Serbs by Croats in Yugoslavia during World War II, of Croats by 
Serbs at the end of that war. . . . " Can It Be Triggered Practically Anywhere 
and in Anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 One cannot say that if genocide is halted in Rwanda and Bosnia then by some 
simple causal sequence it will become less likely in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, genocide can no longer be thought of as something that only 
"they" do. Chimps and humans are, genetically, 98% identical; and historical 
experience confirms genetics: The suggestion is that genocide -- race murder -- 
arises from a tendency that, under given pressures, may be activated 
practically anywhere and triggered in practically anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures to neutralize the tendency are encouragingly widespread and 
effective, but they are not yet universal or infallible. So, no, sure, it can't 
happen here; and yet, in a world in which the escalation of civil strife is a 
more proximate danger than a superpower exchange, making sure that it can't 
happen there either may be a prudent hedging of the evolutionary bet.

JUDGE SEES HOW ROLE OF PLAINTIFF SUITS HIM; COURTS: VETERAN JURIST TAKES STAND 
IN HIS CASE AGAINST INSURANCE FIRM. HE WATCHES HIS DAUGHTER CRY, HEARS HIS WORD 
SCORNED AND COMES TO DOUBT THE CROSS-EXAMINATION PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past three weeks, veteran federal district Judge Laughlin E. Waters of 
Los Angeles has been looking at justice from the other side of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of presiding over a courtroom, Waters, 79, has been in the plaintiff's 
chair during an aggressively litigated trial that pits him and his wife against 
their insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a tall man with a full head of white hair, has given testimony about 
the fire at his Hancock Park home that touched off the legal dispute. He has 
also: briefly told a jury about his role in the Normandy invasion during World 
War II, undergone rigorous cross-examination on how an adjuster handled the 
insurance claim, watched one of his daughters cry on the witness stand, and 
listened to one of the state's top insurance defense lawyers tell a courtroom 
that his claim had absolutely no merit, even if he is a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although judges file suits from time to time, Waters is the only federal judge 
in recent memory to actually go to trial here. He has been a significant 
presence in the courtroom, but Waters is by no means running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on several occasions, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge G. Keith Wisot 
has told jurors to ignore testimony Waters gave because it was beyond the scope 
of a question posed to him or his remarks were deemed to be uncalled-for 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience has really been quite novel," Waters said in an interview. 
"I've been wondering to myself, how do I handle my relations with the jury, do 
I look at them, make a play to them, look at the attorney," while being 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge thought he did well on the witness stand, but won't know for sure 
until the jury returns its verdict. Deliberations begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said the trial has been a useful learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every trial judge, and maybe every appellate judge, should become a 
litigant and be subjected to the demands of the system," Waters said. "It might 
have some educational value to them when they resume their position on the 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since becoming an attorney nearly 50 years ago, Waters said 
he now has some doubts about whether cross-examination really brings out the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cross-examiner was particularly skilled at asking questions that called 
for a yes or no answer," Waters said of attorney Guy O. Kornblum of San 
Francisco. Waters said he felt that the strictures under which he was operating 
as a witness made it difficult to tell the full story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I perhaps will give more thought about whether I should exercise greater 
latitude in allowing someone to explain himself when I'm back on the bench," 
Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a Republican and longtime Establishment figure, earlier in his life 
was a state legislator, U.S. attorney and successful private lawyer. He hardly 
seems like the type to take on his insurance company, United Services 
Automobile Assn., in what has become a three-year pitched battle. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start, right after the fire, it seemed as if Waters' claim would be 
easily resolved. USAA adjuster Kevin Bushaw came to the large house, did an 
inspection and immediately wrote the couple a $50,000 check for anticipated 
expenses they would incur. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushaw also told the Waterses he was amenable to having the repairs done by 
TMLC, a construction company that employed the couple's son, Laughlin Waters 
Jr., known as "Loc Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 But a clash soon developed over how much it would cost to bring the large 
Mediterranean-style house back to the condition it was in before the blaze. 
USAA officials said the preliminary bids prepared by TMLC were too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company, used frequently by USAA, subsequently prepared a bid that was 
considerably lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sets of revised bids were proposed by both sides, but the haggling 
went on and on. After seven months, the judge said he and his wife, Voula, 
decided to sue because USAA, one of the nation's largest insurance carriers, 
had "low-balled" them in an attempt to get the couple to accept a bid lower 
than they believed necessary to cover the repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They forced us into this position by delaying and stringing it out, keeping 
us out of our home for 15 months, when we could have been back in our home in 
four months," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the couple sued, USAA agreed to accept the TMLC bid of $424,000 
to repair the house, and renovations by their son's company began. The 
insurance company also paid the couple $11,000 a month in relocation expenses 
for the 15 months they were out of the house. But the angry couple did not drop 
their suit. They insist they are motivated less by personal gain than by a 
desire to punish USAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if they would try to do this to people like us, they certainly 
could do it to others less able to weather this tribulation," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife allege USAA should pay damages for acting in bad faith and 
inflicting emotional distress on them, particularly Voula Waters, who was 
hospitalized during the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 However, defense lawyer Kornblum has told jurors that the Waterses' claim is 
groundless. He said USAA acted promptly and fairly. Kornblum described in 
detail the numerous meetings held over a period of months before the couple 
sued. The defense portrayed them as stubborn and unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides were apart by only $120,000 at the time the suit was filed. But 
the case, like much contemporary litigation, rapidly metastasized and the legal 
costs have run into the low millions. Though no dollar amount for damages has 
been specified, the judge and his wife are seeking compensation for "bad faith" 
and "infliction of emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
 Their chief lawyer is William Shernoff of Claremont, considered one of the 
state's top plaintiffs' insurance lawyers. He, his partner Frank Darras and a 
legal assistant were in court with their judge-client every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblum, USAA's lead lawyer, was joined by Century City attorney Paul R. Fine 
and a laptop computer at the counsel table and had at least one other lawyer in 
the courtroom for assistance, as well as a bevy of USAA officials and a jury 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been aggressively litigated from the start. Each side has filed 
sanctions motions against the other for alleged misconduct, but none have been 
awarded thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the federal courthouse, a few blocks from where the trial is being 
held, Waters is considered calm and congenial. But there were several moments 
on the witness stand when he got downright testy. 
</P>
<P>
 He clashed frequently with Kornblum. Near the end of cross-examination 
Thursday, Kornblum tried several times to get Waters to concede a point. Waters 
simply would not give an increasingly exasperated Kornblum the answer he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be evasive," Waters said. Then, as he offered another 
version of an answer, defense lawyer Fine rose from the table and started to 
whisper something in Kornblum's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, Mr. Fine. I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation," Waters 
declared tartly, drawing murmurs and some laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said he would sue again under the same circumstances. But he 
acknowledged that the process has been lengthy and that like other litigants he 
may soon face yet another delay: "If we win," he said, "there undoubtedly will 
be an appeal."

PROSTITUTES ARE PRIME VICTIMS IN LEADING RAPE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away by the railroad tracks near Sepulveda Boulevard is a bleak Van 
Nuys neighborhood where bravely tended bungalows are surrounded by aging 
apartments and industrial parks, check-cashing outlets, motels and other 
signposts of transiency and quick-hit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At night its dead-end streets come alive with sex -- perfunctory acts 
performed by prostitutes who walk Sepulveda and, to a lesser degree, Van Nuys 
Boulevard. Los Angeles police say that may be why Reporting District 936 had 
more reported rapes last year than any other area of the city -- because it 
rests between two corridors of drug-dealing and prostitution, and prostitutes 
are prime targets for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been raped twice in 12 years," Mary, 33, said between tricks on a recent 
night on Sepulveda. "We all try to take precautions," she said, adding that she 
carries a knife for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people out there that don't like women, period, and use 
prostitutes as a real up-front, easy-to-identify example of their hatred," said 
Detective Craig Rhudy of the Van Nuys Division, a veteran sex crimes 
investigator at the police station responsible for Reporting District 936. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime statistics for 1993 show that 14 rapes were reported in the district, 
which has an area of less than two square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The next-highest figure was 11 reported rapes in a nearby district in Panorama 
City, as well as parts of south and central Los Angeles. Police and prosecutors 
said the difference in rape reports between those reporting districts and 
Reporting District 936 is small enough to be arbitrary but is probably because 
of the high concentration of prostitutes and the dark industrial streets in the 
district and nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recently released crime analysis report prepared by the Van 
Nuys Division, 16% of the patrol area's reported rapes involved prostitutes who 
were working when attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhudy and other police officers said some rape reports filed by prostitutes 
turn out to be false claims against men who don't pay, including drug dealers 
who offer quick hits of heroin and crack cocaine in exchange for sex, then 
renege on their promises. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary and other prostitutes interviewed Friday night said they had never 
filed a false report despite frequent disputes over money. Mary said her most 
recent rape occurred after the john had paid her and then tried to take back 
his money while she was in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw it out of the car," she said when he grabbed for the money. She 
jumped out. He followed and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, who identified herself only as Vanessa, was a newcomer to 
Sepulveda Boulevard, having arrived from Sacramento two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been raped, but it's true prostitutes have been the ones raped out 
here," said Vanessa, 24. Despite her short time on the boulevard, she has been 
threatened at knifepoint by a man who refused to pay. He finally just let her 
leave the car unharmed -- and unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to do this all my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial number of the reports filed by prostitutes turn out to be true, 
and although most rapes involve victims who know their attackers, prostitutes 
have proved to be a particularly vulnerable group, according to prosecutors who 
specialize in crimes against women. 
</P>
<P>
 And experts widely believe that up to half the rapes of women are not 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience working Downtown is that prostitutes really get raped a lot," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lydia Bodin, who supervises her office's domestic 
violence unit. "I think the attitude about prostitutes is they are viewed as 
throw-away human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are readily accessible and not expected to wield much clout with 
police or a jury, streetwalkers are easy targets, said Detective Mike Buttitta, 
who is assigned to LAPD's special rape detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta cited a case coming up for trial May 19 in which two longshoremen 
from the Harbor-Long Beach area are accused of raping and otherwise brutalizing 
prostitutes so viciously that one of their alleged victims -- who was raped and 
beaten with a golf club -- nearly lost an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the woman was picked up last summer by the pair of friends 
posing as "johns," then driven to one of their homes, where she was attacked. 
Finally, she was thrown naked from their car -- the pair's alleged signature. 
They stand accused of doing the same thing to at least two other victims, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who are very aggressive. They're power rapists and they want 
to physically abuse these women," said Villa, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like they choose this particular type of woman because of what 
she is, because they think they can get away with more with them," Villa said, 
noting that serial rapists sometimes escalate in brutality until someone is 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all prosecutors agree. Van Nuys-based Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Rabichow 
said he believes the drug dealing along the Sepulveda corridor fosters other 
types of crimes, such as robbery, and in turn could lead to rapes of 
opportunity. Drug dealing also attracts people more likely to commit crimes of 
any kind, Rabichow said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I actually don't think that prostitution itself causes or increases rape," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, experts say, rape involves victims who know their attackers and 
takes place within the purported safety of the woman's home or neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence may be a universal problem, but what distinguishes Reporting 
District 936 from other neighborhoods is its high concentration of 
streetwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution has been such a continuing bane for neighbors that last winter 
some began marching up and down Sepulveda with signs saying, "Johns Go Home" 
and "Prostitutes: We Don't Want You Here." The effort seemed to have had some 
effect before it was sidetracked by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, said 
Officer Jean Green, who works with the area's residents for the department's 
community-policing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Police appeared to be targeting the area Friday night, with black-and-white 
patrol cars and unmarked cars outnumbering the prostitutes cruising Sepulveda. 
The handful of streetwalkers, including Mary and Vanessa, spoke quickly and 
nervously as they darted in and out of brightly lit gas stations and dark 
alleys, trying to attract clients but avoid police. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said the neighborhood's extensive industrial stretches -- which she 
described as a dimly lighted "ghost town" at night -- make "a good breeding 
ground for rape" regardless of whether the victims are prostitutes. Several 
bars feature nude dancing, Green said, suggesting that the nearby dark streets 
may prove too tempting for some drunk bar patrons leaving with an escort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drunk men do weird things," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 But any john is a potential danger, drunk or sober, the prostitutes say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't get your money first," Vanessa said, "they can do anything."

BILL BOYARSKY: POLICE TRY TOUGH TALK TO STEER YOUTHS AWAY FROM CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL BOYARSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone's looking for the ultimate cure for violent crime -- gun control, the 
Clinton crime bill, "three strikes and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes you can find a smaller remedy right in your own back yard. Or at 
least ours, the streets behind The Times that blend into a vast stretch of 
misery just east of us known as Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday night, I left The Times parking structure and drove 
through Skid Row, pulling in at an ugly brown fortress at 6th and Maple 
streets, the Central Area police station. There, in one of the most depressed 
and dangerous parts of Los Angeles, a small group of police officers is engaged 
in an unusual battle against violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen young men -- actual and potential gang members -- and their 
parents sat around a large U-shaped arrangement of tables in a conference room, 
taking part in a confrontational session with the police. The young men had 
been caught screwing up and the goal was to get them to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Frank DiPaola, wearing jeans, a sport shirt, a gun and badge, 
approached a Latino seated at the table. In a loud, hostile voice, he told him 
to take off his boots. Warily, the boy did as he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPaola picked up one of the boots and walked a few steps away. "How does that 
make you feel?" he said to the kid. "I just took your boot." 
</P>
<P>
 "You took something that was mine," the kid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did the man you robbed feel?" DiPaola asked. "I got the gun. I'm going to 
take your other boot before you go." 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three more cops took their turns giving others in the group the same 
sort of treatment, as did a psychologist. Parents, some of them unaware of the 
extent of their sons' activities, were confronted with what their boys had been 
up to. "Tell your father why you joined a gang," DiPaola said to a member of 
the Asian Boys, a Chinatown gang. This seemed to be big news to the father. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, these young men had come to the table by one of two routes. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPaola had plucked some out of jail after Juvenile Court agreed to turn them 
over to his program. 
</P>
<P>
 Other boys had their names taken down by police on field reporting cards 
during sweeps through gang hangouts, such as the Downtown video game arcades 
around 8th Street and Broadway. DiPaola visited the parents and offered to 
help. He persuaded them that their children were heading straight for trouble. 
He asked them to bring their sons down to the police station for the program, 
and invited them to participate in parenting classes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked one of the boys why he agreed to come down to the police station. "My 
mom was crying too many times," ex-18th Street gang member Abel Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police station meetings are just part of the program. It also includes 
something called "Scared Straight," where the young men are brought to the 
abandoned Lincoln Heights jail and put in cells. Ex-cons walk along the rows of 
cells, screaming and using threats of beatings and homosexual rape to give the 
boys an idea of life on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The third phase is community service, 100 or 200 hours of graffiti cleanup. 
None of this is pleasant. At each phase, the cops keep up the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Saturday a couple of weeks ago, I went to Central station to watch a 
graffiti cleanup crew at work. One kid was defiant, bragging about his skill on 
the streets. He was confronted by Rolling '30s gang alumnus Troy Garner, a 
program volunteer who sneered: "If you was as good at hustling as you say you 
are, you wouldn't be here. You'd be out hustling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program's real significance is that it suggests better ways of dealing 
with a problem that has stubbornly resisted solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 It recognizes that the LAPD officers can no longer limit themselves to their 
traditional role. Even if Mayor Richard Riordan builds the department up to 
10,000, we still won't have enough cops to put down all the city's violent 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central station program is a small, low-ticket item that reaches only a 
few. It's not going to stop the worst, most intractable thugs. But it offers an 
alternative to the road to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 As Central Area Capt. Dick Bonneau conceded: "It doesn't deal with a lot of 
people, and not everyone who goes in the program is a success." But he also 
said: "The fact is, it will change some of them, so it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 It also recognizes that gang membership, or hanging out with gang members, 
isn't always a certain ticket to prison or death on the streets. Everyone's 
different. People can change.

CELESTIAL COMMUTER SHOW; TUESDAY'S SOLAR ECLIPSE WILL BE LAST OF THE CENTURY 
HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the height of the morning rush hour Tuesday, the shadow of the moon will 
race across Los Angeles in the last solar eclipse visible here for the rest of 
the century.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in North America will have a chance to watch the moon 
partially eclipse the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But, weather permitting, those watching from within a narrow band 150 miles 
wide, running from Baja California through southern New Mexico to northern New 
England, will see an even rarer sky spectacle: an annular eclipse in which the 
moon will blot out all but the sun's fiery rim, creating a kind of golden solar 
wedding band. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a celestial portent in February, 1831, reportedly inspired Nat Turner, 
who led America's largest slave rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the partial eclipse in Los Angeles on Tuesday, almost 
four-fifths of the sun will be blotted out at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Morning sunshine will turn to twilight. As the source of light in the sky 
shrinks, shadows will sharpen. In the shade of leafy trees, the ground will be 
dappled with hundreds of bright, dancing crescents caused by the eclipse, as 
overlapping leaves form a profusion of natural pinhole projectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as astronomers in general are concerned, most eclipses are not of 
great scientific value, but they are of great aesthetic value and great 
emotional value," said Griffith Observatory Director Edwin C. Krupp.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, the eclipse here will last about 2 hours and 45 minutes, beginning at 
7:44 a.m. and ending at 10:29 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will have the thinnest crescent sun that we will see for the duration of 
the century," Krupp said. "One could even say it was just like the crescent 
moon if it were not so bright and so dangerous to view directly."  
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers warn that anyone looking directly at the eclipse risks serious eye 
damage unless they use proper safety filters, such as No. 14 welder's goggles 
or special solar Mylar filters. Parents should keep young children from looking 
at the sun. Even though most of the sun's light will be blocked, the remaining 
sunlight is still too intense even to be viewed briefly. The retina of the eye 
has no pain receptors, so the damage can happen without warning.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People can safely view the eclipse indirectly by projecting its image through 
a pinhole camera or by reflecting it with a pocket mirror onto a shaded wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the eclipse will take place during rush hour, Caltrans is not 
worried. Spokesman Vincent Moreno said that Caltrans data indicates that 
motorists -- who appear to be willing to slow down and gawk at almost anything 
-- actually are rather picky when it comes to rubbernecking and generally will 
slow only for phenomena in their immediate line of vision. The last eclipse did 
not cause a celestial gawkers block, he said, because commuters would have had 
to look up to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 A solar eclipse occurs somewhere around the world two to five times a year. It 
happens when the moon moving in its orbit around the Earth occasionally slips 
in between the planet and the central star that lights it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon, it also is almost 
400 times farther away from the Earth, so that the two appear about the same 
size when viewed from Earth. Most eclipses are partial ones because the moon 
and the sun are not always perfectly in phase. 
</P>
<P>
 When the moon is at the farthest reaches of its orbit, it can cause an annular 
eclipse when it passes in front of the sun because its disk is slightly smaller 
than that of the sun, as seen from Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 The last annular eclipse visible in the region occurred two years ago -- a 
rare late-afternoon eclipse that, for those lucky enough to experience clear 
skies, combined the ring of solar fire with the colors of sunset. Tuesday's 
event will be the last time people in the United States will see an annular 
eclipse for 18 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Not until May 20, 2012, will the moon again appear to pass within the sun, as 
viewed from the western United States, and it will be another seven years after 
that before the moon completely blocks the sun from view. Darkness in the 
Morning 
</P>
<P>
 Late rush-hour commuters will be treated to a partial, or annular, eclipse of 
the sun beginning at 7:44 a.m. Tuesday. In Los Angeles at the height of the 
eclipse, the sun will appear to be 72% covered. It will be the last eclipse 
visible in Southern California for the rest of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Views * The trademark solar halo will be visible in El Paso, which 
is almost directly centered on the path of annularity. Other cities along the 
path, such as St. Louis, will see an offset ring. The ring is visible only 
momentarily. * From Southern California, the sun will be about four-fifths 
covered, with coverage increasing toward the southernmost part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Annular vs. Total Eclipses 
</P>
<P>
 In an annular eclipse, the moon is silhouetted briefly in front of the sun but 
is too far from Earth to completely cover the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Total eclipses are spectacular, with a very dark sky and flaring solar corona. 
These occur when the moon is closer to Earth and can completely blot out the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Eclipse Schedule 5:56 a.m.: Sunrise 7:44 a.m.: Eclipse begins. The moon 
begins to move in front of the sun. 9 a.m.: Maximum eclipse. The moon covers 
72% of the sun's surface. 10:29 a.m.: Eclipse ends. Moon leaves the face of the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding Eye Injury 
</P>
<P>
 Any eclipse, even a total one, has the potential to cause eye injury because 
the visible sunlight is still far too intense even for brief glances. Here are 
some tips: * Create a pinhole camera by making a tiny hole in a sheet of heavy 
paper and using it to project the sun's image onto a second sheet of paper held 
below. The image is faint but discernible. * Use a pocket mirror to reflect the 
sun's image onto the shaded wall of a building. * Hang out with the experts. 
The Griffith Observatory will be open from 7 a.m. Specially fitted telescopes 
will be provided by the observatory, the Los Angeles Astronomical Society and 
local clubs. Sources: Griffith Observatory, Astronomy magazine Where the 
Eclipse Can Be Seen 
</P>
<P>
 * Weather permitting, the eclipse will be visible across North America in a 
path moving from southwest to northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 * The moon's shadow will take one hour and 40 minutes to cross the country. 
The portion of the sun obscured by the moon decreases with distance from the 
path of annularity.

BOBBITT ARRESTED AFTER FIANCEE ALLEGES ABUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt, the ex-Marine whose penis was severed by his wife in a 
case that touched off nationwide debate, was arrested Friday after his fiancee 
accused him of beating her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt, 26, was taken into custody on charges of battery and domestic 
violence after the woman summoned police to her apartment and alleged he had 
struck her, police spokeswoman Nicole Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being held in the city jail for a 12-hour "cooling off" period required 
under law in such cases. The extent of the woman's injuries was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to release her name or provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman was identified in broadcast news reports as Bobbitt's fiancee. 
He was said to have met her in Las Vegas while making one of his numerous 
nationwide paid appearances to tell his side of the story.

JAMES FLANIGAN: GLOBAL TRADERS REMIND U.S. WHERE THE BUCK STOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by the United States, a global phalanx of 16 nations from Japan to 
Portugal intervened in currency markets last week to uphold the value of the 
dollar against speculation by foreign exchange traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Right away you know there's a crisis when Portugal, 10 million people and an 
economy one-tenth the size of the U.S. gross domestic product, is brought in to 
defend the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 There was reason for concern. The dollar's value, which had been declining 
since January against the Japanese yen and German mark, threatened to 
accelerate downward; foreign investors were reducing their purchases of U.S. 
bonds and stocks; U.S. long-term interest rates had taken a worrisome turn 
upward again, imperiling housing and the economy's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 And those were only fever symptoms of the underlying illness, which was 
worldwide fear that the United States would withdraw from its economic 
responsibilities to other nations. Signs were there. The Clinton Administration 
has been talking down the dollar to benefit U.S. exports and hurt Japanese 
imports since the day it took office. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dollar has moved from being worth 124 yen to worth about 100, Japanese 
manufacturers of cars and copying machines have seen costs on products for the 
U.S. market go up by 19.3%. That means a Toyota Camry that could be sold 
profitably for $16,000 more than a year ago would now carry a $19,000 price tag 
-- which gives an advantage to the Ford Taurus, unless Ford also hikes prices 
to increase its profits, which it has been doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors also noted White House and congressional resistance to the 
Federal Reserve Board's raising of interest rates to stem incipient inflation. 
And they concluded that Clinton would tolerate inflation if it made for more 
employment and wage hikes in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, foreigners were alarmed by statements in Congress that the United 
States might not even live up to its commitment to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 So foreign investors put less money into Treasury bonds and other U.S. 
investments -- even though the strong economy argued for more investment. And 
as there was less demand for U.S. dollars, the value of the greenback declined 
against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the foreigners sent a message to Washington that if the United 
States tries to act alone in the world, it will pay a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment is needed to finance the U.S. current account deficit, 
which will run about $100 billion this year, says Washington economist John 
Mueller. That's the sum of the U.S. trade deficit in merchandise, its trade 
surplus in services, and investment flows into and out of U.S. and foreign 
pension and mutual funds. If foreign money doesn't come in, scarce U.S. savings 
must finance the economy's expansion, which in effect would mean slower growth 
or that some borrowers, mainly small business, would be starved for capital. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an interdependent world today, one in which $800 billion worth of 
currencies are traded daily on markets from New York to Tokyo to London. 
Governments are ruled by this trading, notes Robert Solomon of the Brookings 
Institution, who has a book coming out, "Transformation of the World Economy, 
1980-1993." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, international markets dumped the French franc and forced France's new 
president, Francois Mitterrand, to change his socialist policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those markets are sending messages to Clinton, and the issue is critical 
because of the dollar's central role in economic activities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 We benefit from the dollar's status. The United States can run trade and 
budget deficits and no International Monetary Fund interferes or lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 But markets always have something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system of floating exchange rates began in 1971 when the U.S. 
attempt to finance the Vietnam War and a consumer economy at home strained the 
fixed exchange rate system. President Richard Nixon abandoned fixed rates, and 
since then currency values have been guided by global trading. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't freed us from the concerns of foreigners. In 1978, President Jimmy 
Carter was forced to issue U.S. bonds denominated in yen because Japanese 
lenders feared U.S. inflation, notes Kenneth McCarthy, head of Economic 
Intelligence Co., a New York consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a dispute with Germany over the dollar and interest rates set off a 
global stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Will markets crash this time? Probably not, even though Friday's decline in 
U.S. stocks was scary. The U.S. economy is stronger than it has been in 
decades; fears of inflation are somewhat overblown. But some business people 
see signs. John Rutledge, an investment banker and director of several 
companies, reports that land and building values in Denver have risen 30% in 
the last year and that land prices are rising in the Southeast and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners see such signs too, and they worry when Clinton Administration 
officials call for easy money policies. "They fear losing money in U.S. bonds," 
says Albert M. Wojnilower, senior economist of CS First Boston. "It's their 
pension fund you're playing with too."  
</P>
<P>
 The result is a crisis, staved off temporarily by 16 countries madly swapping 
billions in dollars, marks and yen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more crises; the dollar will be weak through the summer," 
predicts Carl Weinberg, an economist at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds to you like a wasteful way to conduct the world's economic 
affairs, many experts agree. The latest debacle will increase calls for a more 
stable exchange system. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Judy Shelton, author of a new book, "Money Meltdown," suggests that 
the United States call a new international monetary conference, comparable to 
the Bretton Woods talks at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton suggests backing the dollar with gold; Rutledge and others suggest 
backing with U.S. real estate -- the $9.5-trillion net worth of all U.S. land, 
houses, buildings and factories. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important than technicalities is that "the U.S. must take the lead," 
says Shelton, of Stanford University's Hoover Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 She hits the nail on the head. Because the real message the currency markets 
sent to Washington last week was a cry for U.S. leadership. Surely if Portugal 
rushing to defend the dollar proves anything it's that the world is 
interdependent and sees the United States as its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must all hang together or assuredly we shall hang separately," Benjamin 
Franklin said in 1776. True then of his young nation, true today of the world.

 The Jonan Denki Co.'s chain of electronic appliance stores sells videocassette 
recorders at more than 25% off the standard price here. Branching out into 
cosmetics, the stores recently began selling imported Chanel No. 5 perfume at 
30% less than the prevailing price.

 And in March, during the nation's rice shortage, Jonan Denki's owner -- 
self-styled "Discount King" Toshio Miyaji -- created a sensation when he 
bypassed government licensing procedures to sell 12 tons of hard-to-get 
domestic rice at a deep discount. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Miyaji, who waged a long guerrilla war against government 
regulators and competitors to build his high-volume, low-profit-margin 
business, was viewed as dishonorable if not criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 But after three years of recession, Japan's consumers are tightening their 
belts, and 65-year-old Miyaji, showing a natural flair for tweaking this 
country's increasingly unpopular bureaucrats, is in the vanguard of a discount 
revolution that has made a success of a variety of low-priced specialty stores 
and even American-style discount malls. 
</P>
<P>
 A folk hero during the rice crisis, Miyaji has emerged as a favorite of talk 
shows, charming hosts and viewers alike with blistering attacks on bureaucrats 
and high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many analysts, Miyaji blames the high prices of imported and domestic 
goods on layers of middlemen and a maze of regulations with roots deep in 
Japanese history and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad laws ought to be broken," Miyaji declared boldly to the media as 2,500 
people lined up at one of his stores to buy the rice, which he bought directly 
from a farmer and sold without the required license from Japan's Food Control 
Agency. Luckily for Miyaji, the half-century-old law he violated is not clear 
about punishments. So far he has been left untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 He railed in a recent interview against "a wall of bureaucrats" who enforce 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Berlin Wall collapsed after 28 years," Miyaji said. "Why does Japan keep 
50-year-old laws? The American President is complaining about Japan's huge 
trade surplus. In spite of that, the government hasn't improved the situation. 
. . . I'm ready to go to jail. Unless someone sacrifices, Japanese law won't 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Regulatory changes and a leaner distribution system here could benefit the 
United States as well as Japanese consumers, because it would mean foreign 
imports wouldn't lose their price advantage by the time they hit the shelves. 
That might help ease the massive U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which hit $60 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the success of stores such as Jonan Denki, bigger Japanese firms 
are racing to build large, American-style discount stores. Such "Wal-Mart 
wanna-bes," in the words of Lehman Bros. analyst Dean Perry, have started to 
undermine prices here. 
</P>
<P>
 Isao Nakauchi, president of Daiei Inc., Japan's biggest supermarket chain, 
thinks his company can smash the cozy networks that keep prices high and 
foreign products out. Daiei's publicly proclaimed goal is "halving prices in 
Japan by the year 2010." 
</P>
<P>
 With businessmen such as Miyaji and Nakauchi on the prowl, old-style retailing 
just isn't safe anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Department stores have to meet the price competition," said Yoshihiro Tajima, 
a Gakushuin University economics professor. "Price wars have expanded from not 
only liquor or cosmetics or men's suits to other broad areas. Some supermarkets 
started to create discount stores. Now Daiei has several different types of 
discount stores, including a wholesale club." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are still far from collapsing, however. Japanese media excitedly 
recorded the spread last month of a beer "price war" from discount liquor 
stores to supermarkets to department stores, which in Japan have large food and 
beverage sections. Major department stores announced price cuts for beer, but 
only of 2%. Supermarkets and convenience stores knocked off a bit more. But 
beer is still expensive: a 12-ounce can now costs about $2.15 at department 
stores, $2 at supermarkets and $1.67 at discount liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure from discounters contributed to a 6% drop in department store sales 
last year, following a 4.7% drop the year before. Meanwhile, Aoyama Trading 
Co., one of the most successful "category killers" -- stores that specialize in 
narrow categories of goods and then "kill" their competitors by selling at 
roughly half the normal price -- sold 2.4 million men's suits in 1993, grabbing 
more than 20% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this trend is very good," said Fumihiko Taira, 36, who spoke while 
shopping with his wife at a suburban Tokyo discount mall. "The market should be 
free. It's the law of the jungle: 'Weak meat is food for the strong.' Free 
competition has some problems, I know, but it will bring cheaper prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's current retail system wasn't designed to encourage price competition 
but to protect jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, faced with the threat of widespread unemployment, Japan 
sought to protect huge numbers of small family-run retail outlets, which exist 
within easy walking distance of homes in every neighborhood. As Japan's economy 
developed, big department stores specialized in high-quality, high-priced goods 
and lavish service. Laws protected these economically inefficient but 
job-producing stores -- small and large -- from the threat of cutthroat 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Layers of middlemen, meanwhile, developed the art of frequent small deliveries 
of whatever goods the stores needed, eliminating the need for large retail 
inventories in shops with little storage space or investment capital. 
Traditions of loyalty to trusted business associates provided glue for the 
system. Consumers paid a price, of course, but as long as no one rocked the 
boat and the economy grew, the system seemed to work well for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 During Japan's high-growth era, only a handful of mavericks refused to play 
the game. When Miyaji first attacked the system 20 years ago, trouble came 
quickly. Unidentified hoodlums -- presumably acting on behalf of competitors 
whose prices were undercut -- beat up a store clerk, tore down advertising 
posters and cut the store's telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji persevered, gradually building a chain of six Tokyo stores. But it 
wasn't until a few years ago -- when Japan's late-1980s "bubble economy" 
collapsed into the country's worst post-World War II recession -- that 
discounting really began to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the retail distribution sector still employs 11 million people. But 
irreversible change is underway. A key break came in 1990, when, partly in 
response to U.S. pressure, Tokyo revised its Large-Scale Retail Store Law in a 
way that allowed the rapid growth of big discounters, despite the threat they 
pose to mom-and-pop retailers. By some estimates, total annual sales at all 
kinds of discount stores totaled about $50 billion last year, or roughly half 
the sales of traditional department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The power to force further change now lies with big firms such as Daiei, which 
is building an emerging chain of Hyper Mart discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices in Japan are high because the distribution system is grossly 
defective," Nakauchi, the Daiei president, declared in a recent interview with 
the Nikkei Weekly. "The amount of goods that a machine can produce in one 
minute is awe-inspiring. We have to be able to sell the goods at the same 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Daiei's strategy is to build direct links with domestic manufacturers and to 
take advantage of the strong yen, which makes foreign products cheaper, by 
selling more imported goods, Nakauchi said. Already a large firm, it took a 
major step toward greater economies of scale in March by merging with three 
affiliated general merchandising chains. It predicts that total sales this year 
will hit about $25 billion, making it by far the largest retailer in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakauchi said the merger puts his company, for the first time, in a position 
comparable in scale to that of major international retailers such as Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., Kmart Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. "We will now, at long last, be 
able to buy from Southeast Asia and the rest of the world in a big way, " he 
said. "In sporting terms, you could say that we have at last made it to the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Full-service department stores, the kind staffed with young women who chirp 
greetings and bow to welcome customers, thus face intense pressure from two 
sides: the expanding discount chains and the "category killers." Department 
stores are already seeing double-digit declines in men's clothing sales as 
aggressive specialty firms like Aoki International Co. and Aoyama Trading 
undercut prices by selling garments that are either imported or purchased 
directly from Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoyama, now a 520-unit chain, even opened a discount store in Tokyo's glitzy 
Ginza shopping district last year. Suits in Japan usually sell for about $750, 
but Aoyama offers them at about $300. Aoyama is now expanding its selection 
with J.C. Penney Co. casual clothing for men. It has projected sales of J.C. 
Penney products at about $75 million for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is also under attack from places like RISM Outlet Mall, an 
American-style landscaped shopping mall in the Tokyo suburb of Oimachi. About 
70% of goods sold at the mall's 36 discount shops are imports and the rest come 
straight from factories, according to Yoichiro Nagahashi, a planning official 
of R'ism Development Co. Prices at this mall are still higher than in the 
United States, but they run about 40% less than at ordinary Japanese shops and 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the outlet mall's unusual name, derived from English, reflects how things 
are changing in hard-working Japan. "RISM," Nagahashi explained, stands for 
"the ideology of the letter 'r' -- rhythmical life, relationship and 
relaxation." Despite the offbeat way they chose a name -- which they haven't 
bothered to explain to customers -- the people running the RISM mall are 
serious about business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still small," Nagahashi said. "But if outlet malls become more 
popular, it will influence the whole system. Customers for the first time will 
be able to pick and choose where to go to get products at a certain price. I 
hope RISM will lead a trend toward a revolution in values." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the free-spending "bubble economy" years of the late 1980s, 
consumer values are already changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Department stores will wrap things up very nicely, but people don't need that 
anymore. Maybe they still need it for gifts, but not for their own use," said 
Tsukasa Yamada, 35, who was shopping at the RISM mall with his wife and two 
children. "It's not so strange that this feeling is disappearing. What's 
strange is, why did it exist in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, growing numbers of shoppers simply want the lowest possible price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreign products are cheaper here," explained Mayuko Isobe as she browsed 
through Jonan Denki's cosmetics department. "I look in department stores, but I 
never buy there. I don't have enough money. I buy cosmetics only at discount 
stores."

 Discounting--one of the engines driving retail competition in the United 
States--is just beginning to make its impact felt on retailing in Britain and 
Japan. With a handful of exceptions, only home-grown staples cost less in those 
nations than in America. 04,32,08,10,10 U.S. British Japanese Product price

INVASION OF THE DISCOUNTERS; BRITAIN; AMERICAN-STYLE BARGAIN SHOPPING COMES TO 
THE UNITED KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulling off the highway into this suburb east of London, a visitor can quickly 
see why West Thurrock is probably the greatest bastion of American shopping 
culture in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 There are familiar names, now recognizable to most Brits, such as Burger King 
and Toys R Us. There's a giant American-style supermarket, this one a 
British-owned Tesco. 
</P>
<P>
 And farther along the service road is something more unusual for Britain: a 
Gargantuan, thoroughly American mall called Lakeside Shopping Centre, which 
offers a range of department stores, scores of smaller shops, parking for 
12,000 cars and the requisite "food court" with quick-service cuisine from many 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the latest American-bred addition to this shopping tract that has 
brought national attention to modest West Thurrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Costco, the Seattle-based discount chain that recently merged with 
California's Price Co., arrived here late last year, opening the first 
warehouse membership club in Britain amid an onslaught of media fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 While that might not seem like front-page news, it was in Britain, where 
discount shopping is virtually unknown and consumers pay some of the highest 
prices in the Western Hemisphere for goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite its single location and restrictive membership rules, Costco 
has become one of the most visible signs of a consumer upheaval in the United 
Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a shift in consumer attitudes," said Clive Grant, director of 
Corporate Intelligence Group, which compiles retail information. "People are 
prepared to go to a discount store and shop around more. It was not the 
attitude before, which I know must seem strange to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 As the British rethink their shopping habits, a steadily increasing number of 
U.S. retailers are showing them how it's done, American-style. With the U.S. 
market near saturation point, according to a Corporate Intelligence report, 
"there is a growing realization that the post-recession U.K. is ripe for an 
infusion of U.S. price-led, value-for-money, power retailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Big names such as Blockbuster Video, Gap and Toys R Us have already made 
significant inroads in Britain. Discount giants Wal-Mart and Kmart are 
considering transatlantic expansion. A surge of factory outlet shops is on the 
way, and QVC, the home shopping network, has hit the British TV airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not here by accident," Grant said. "They sense the time has come." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing spending habits of British consumers are largely attributed to an 
increase in foreign travel -- particularly to the United States -- and a 
five-year economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Brits traveling to Florida resorts and other U.S. 
destinations returned with tales of amazingly low prices on every kind of 
product imaginable. For many, it was the first realization that British prices 
were inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the recession forcing consumers to be more careful about their 
spending, more and more began thinking about such unusual -- for Britain -- 
notions as comparison shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was not odd that Costco's arrival was met with fascination. An endless 
stream of newspaper and television reports explained how the 
143,000-square-foot store operates, compared its prices (exceedingly favorably) 
to established British retailers and marveled at its size and "no-frills" look. 
</P>
<P>
 And shoppers responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saved 200 pounds on a television," boasted Val Morrish of nearby Corringham 
as she traversed a busy Costco aisle with a shopping cart filled with bulk 
packs of groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Meachin, a teacher in Kent, stood in front of a Crayola display, punching 
numbers into her calculator. "The prices are really good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meachin found she could purchase school supplies at Costco for less than they 
cost through the wholesale center run by the government purchasing office in 
her school district. After making an initial reconnaissance mission to Costco, 
"I went to the deputy head (of her school) and said, 'Look, we can save this 
much money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Costco Europe Managing Director Paul Moulton declined to give membership 
figures. "We're happy," he said. "We're more convinced than ever that this is a 
transplantable formula." 
</P>
<P>
 A second Costco is set to open in June in Watford, a suburb northwest of 
London, and the company is planning additional branches in Liverpool and 
Sheffield. Plans also are being made to enter Continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're studying hard the question of how much we're ready to take on," Moulton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it opened in West Thurrock, Costco faced a lawsuit filed by 
Britain's three top supermarket chains, which sought to halt plans for the 
warehouse club. 
</P>
<P>
 Costco had been granted a zoning permit as a wholesaler because more than half 
its sales comes from small businesses purchasing products for resale. But 
Tesco, Sainsbury and Safeway, which control about 60% of the British food 
retailing market, argued unsuccessfully that Costco should be deemed a 
retailer, which would put it under more stringent planning controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed legal bid served to cast Costco as the consumers' hero, struggling 
against the food giants to bring low prices to Britain. As soon as Costco 
opened, the neighboring Tesco introduced a special "bulk buying" section that 
aped Costco's grocery department. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the interest in discount shopping, U.S retailers coming to Britain 
must still contend with the long-established suspicion with which consumers 
regard low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been taught to equate low price with low quality," said Simon 
Hinde, senior editor at Which?, a magazine published by the Consumers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discounting became associated with cheapness," said Grant of Corporate 
Intelligence. "I do believe the British consumer has been brainwashed into 
accepting higher prices." 
</P>
<P>
 British shoppers have traditionally taken pride in how much they spend on an 
item, not how much they save, Grant said. Buying from a top-name store such as 
Selfridges or Harrods has been preferable to finding a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude was always 'I've just been to Harrods and bought this, and it 
cost me 5,000 pounds,' " he said. "Whereas the American would come along and 
say, 'Look, I bought this; just as good in quality as you bought at Harrods for 
half the price.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers and retailers have been only too happy to help British shoppers 
feel better about themselves. A survey by Britain's Business Age magazine says 
that residents pay an average of 48% more than Americans for the same products 
and that consumers are being treated like "mugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's computers, sports equipment, cars, clothes or movie tickets, 
British consumers pay prices that would make the average American cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a pair of Levi 501 jeans costs 200% more in Britain than in the 
United States, according to the Business Age survey. A Wilson tennis racquet 
costs 186.5% more, a Ford Escort 50% more, a Swatch watch 95.8% more. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why prices are so much higher has become the subject of recent debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers and retailers cite a range of reasons, including taxes, land 
costs, higher-quality goods and the relatively small size of the British 
market. But consumer advocates and government officials are becoming 
increasingly dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take refuge in technical arguments," Hinde said. "But when you look at 
each of these arguments, they don't hold water. The bottom line is they're 
overcharging because they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The director general of Britain's Office of Fair Trading has taken a 
high-profile stand against price gouging, recently launching investigations 
into the pricing of compact discs and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 New releases on CD generally cost at least $6 less in the United States, even 
though the products are identical. Business Age found it was substantially 
cheaper to buy a British-made CD at HMV, a British-owned record store in New 
York, than it was to buy it in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Said OFT director Sir Bryan Carsberg in a speech: "I find myself wondering 
whether the difference is caused by higher costs in the U.K. or by restrictive 
practices, such as price cartels, which are harder to track down and deal with 
under our competition law than the American." 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and manufacturers are armed with explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Business Age cited the Ford Escort as costing $15,000 in Britain 
and $10,000 in America. But John Gardiner, spokesman for Ford of Great Britain, 
said the comparison is unfair. "You're looking at two vehicles that are 
different but share the same name," he said, explaining that the cars contain 
different components. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Ford Probe -- which is the same in both countries, except for the 
position of the steering wheel -- lists for roughly $16,700 in the United 
States and $24,700 in Britain, according to Ford figures. Gardiner chalked up 
the difference to a number of issues, such as the comparative scale of each 
nation's economy, the costs of engineering right-hand-drive cars and the 
British insistence on buying vehicles loaded with optional equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 There does not seem to be a reasonable explanation, however, for the fact that 
British-made cars can be purchased in other European countries, and in the 
United States, for less than they cost in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Which? magazine said it has found instances of car dealers in Belgium 
operating under specific instructions from British manufacturers not to sell to 
British customers. And Business Age found that British car buyers could travel 
to the United States, buy a top-of-the-line British-made Range Rover or Jaguar, 
pay the shipping costs back to England and still save $7,500 "on a car that was 
made in this country, to much tougher American safety and emission standards, 
and then exported." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer electronics are yet another arena in which price differences seem 
inexplicable. Americans visiting Britain will notice that a stereo selling for 
$600 in the United States is likely to sell for about $900 in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixons, the largest consumer electronics retail chain in Britain, says the 
differential is not its fault. "It's a manufacturing issue," said Nicola 
Marsden, corporate affairs officer. "We, as the retailer, have very little 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sony, one of Dixons' major suppliers, corporate communications general 
manager Bill Vestey said there is a "raft of reasons" for the price disparity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily, the products are different," he said, also alluding to currency 
fluctuations, property prices and the size of the national markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safety standards are different," Vestey added. Asked if that meant Sony 
products are safer in Britain than the United States, he said, "I'm not an 
engineer."  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, consumer researchers and advocates believe, there is not a 
credible reason why things cost more in Britain.  
</P>
<P>
 "One doesn't say or like to use the word conspiracy ," Grant said. "But it 
does seem to me that 'an historic association,' if you will" -- he let out a 
slight laugh -- "which is designed to keep prices high, has become an accepted 
way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only when these accepted ways are challenged that people say, 'Hey, I 
don't want to pay all that.' Unfortunately, a lot of people still do. But 
increasingly, people are challenging it." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Costco, American Marilyn Land and her English husband, Harry, were 
browsing through the electronics department after stuffing their cart with 
large quantities of items such as wine, toothpaste, butter and toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 After six years in England, Marilyn Land was heartened when she learned Costco 
would be opening within striking distance of her home in Romford. And she 
puzzled at the attitude of her British neighbors, who had no interest in 
checking out the new store and predicted "there would be two cars in the Costco 
car park." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a big resistance to change here," the Boston native said with a 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she believes change is on the way. "Look," Land said, pointing to 
Costco's nearly full parking lot. "You can see it." Can We Shop? 
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: CHECKING ACCOUNT CAN BE A GOOD SPOT FOR 
CASH 
</P>

 Continuing volatility has millions of investors fleeing stocks and bonds for 
money market mutual funds, which are seen as safe parking spots for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three months, individuals have poured about $28 billion into money 
market mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute in 
Washington. It is the first sustained rise in this figure since 1989, ICI 
spokeswoman Malin Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, oddly enough, in today's environment of rising bank fees and high tax 
rates, a far more lucrative -- and equally safe -- option may be your checking 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of interest earnings and "waived" checking fees can net 
investors more than 8% on their money -- a generous return for cash that's 
readily available and fully insured by the federal government. Clearly, it is 
far more generous than the 2.5% to 3% investors are currently earning in money 
market mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what's offered at San Francisco-based Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will waive its $9 monthly fee for customers who maintain a $1,500 
daily balance in an interest-bearing checking account. Customers also earn 1% 
on the $1,500. The $15 in annual interest and the $108 saved on monthly fees 
nets $123 on the $1,500 deposit. In effect, that is an interest rate of 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, the bank's regular checking account works out to a better deal -- 
even though you don't earn interest on the balance -- because the balance 
required to waive the service fee is lower. If you keep $750 in a regular 
checking account, Bank of America will waive the $7.50 monthly fee. That works 
out, in effect, to a yield of 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 And BofA is not alone. Thousands of banks and thrifts in California and all 
over the country are offering similar deals, and they have been for some time. 
An American Bankers Assn. survey conducted in 1993 found that more than 70% of 
the nation's commercial banks would waive checking account fees averaging 
between $6 and $7 a month for customers who kept at least $1,000 in their 
accounts. That works out to a return of between 7.2% and 8.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, many investors didn't bother to maintain a minimum checking 
balance because they were earning double-digit returns in the stock and bond 
markets. That argued for investing all of one's available cash and simply 
paying the checking account fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the direction of the financial markets looks less certain, the picture 
has changed. Investors are looking for safe places to park their cash anyway, 
so keeping at least the minimum balance in a checking account begins to look 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some banks say they've already seen a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've noticed a big increase in our balances in the last three months, and we 
decided that this must be the reason," said Lisabeth Weiner at First National 
Bank of Chicago. "People who were just looking for parking places for their 
cash went into savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Is a fee waiver really the same as earning interest on your money? No. In some 
ways, it's better. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because a waived fee is not taxable income. Someone in the 30% tax 
bracket would have to earn $154 to pay Bank of America's $108 annual checking 
fees, simply because federal and state governments take a portion of all 
earnings -- interest or otherwise. So the person who invests elsewhere must 
earn a taxable yield of 10.2% to be even with the person who keeps $1,500 in a 
checking account to avoid $108 a year in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the catch? This is a bargain only if you ordinarily pay fairly stiff 
monthly fees on your checking account. Some senior citizens and people with 
limited check-writing needs pay significantly less for checking services than 
customers who need accounts with unlimited check-writing privileges.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, certain types of balance requirements are particularly unforgiving. 
Minimum daily balances, for example, are far more difficult to meet than 
"average balance" requirements. That's because, under the minimum balance rule, 
you'll end up paying the monthly fee if you dip below the balance requirement 
at any time during the month -- even for just one day. With the average-balance 
method, you can generally compensate for short lapses by having a larger 
balance on other days. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you keep more than the minimum amount required, your return drops 
substantially. That's because bank interest rates are still nothing to write 
home about. The main benefit of keeping the balance is having the bank fees 
waived. Check It Out 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of California banks and thrifts that will waive monthly 
checking fees if you maintain a minimum balance. 04,20,09,19,11 Monthly Balance

</P>
<P>
 ** Charge is reduced for customers who have their paychecks deposited directly 
into their accounts and for those who don't want their checks returned to them.

'I ALWAYS FELT HALF A PERSON'; BOOKS: THE DAUGHTER OF CLARK GABLE AND LORETTA 
YOUNG DETAILS THE PAIN SHE FELT GROWING UP, THINKING THAT YOUNG WAS HER 
ADOPTIVE MOTHER AND THAT HER FATHER WAS DEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Judy Lewis used to watch Clark Gable movies with her teen-age friends, 
she had no clue that Gable might be her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never would have dawned on me," she said. "Why would I ever think such a 
thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many in Hollywood were thinking just that. Even her best friends had heard 
the rumor from their parents, but no one dared tell her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Haley Jr., a pal from high school days, said: "Our whole group knew who 
her parents were -- and we knew she did not know. But we thought her mother 
would tell her." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother -- Loretta Young -- hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Young herself was the other half of the rumor -- that Judy, told all her life 
that she had been adopted by the actress, was really Young's child by Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 In her recently published autobiography, "Uncommon Knowledge," Lewis says 
Young and Gable met in 1935 on the set of "Call of the Wild" and had an affair 
during which she was conceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 81, declined to confirm or deny her daughter's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rumor is a product of (a) bygone time. As I have in the past, I have 
chosen not to give it any further credence," Young said in a statement from her 
Palm Springs home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any idea how sad it makes me that she still feels she must state 
that her daughter . . . is a rumor?" Lewis said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, every star's contract had a morals clause. Gable was married to 
someone else; Young was single and Catholic. Any suspicion of an affair, let 
alone a child born out of wedlock, would have meant canceled contracts and 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said her parents elected to deny that they had ever had a relationship 
or a child. Gable backed out of the situation, leaving Young to make the 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up thinking she was adopted "in the home of my real mother," Lewis 
said. Whenever the child asked why her biological mother had given her up, or 
who her she was, Young was evasive, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis writes that her nanny asked Young how to handle the girl's questions 
about her father. Young responded, according to the book: "You tell her that 
her father is dead. That's what he is . . . dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, now 58 with grandchildren of her own, said that even having her own 
family didn't erase the pain unwittingly inflicted by a mother so remote and 
relentless in her attempt to keep her child's heritage a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was literally fatherless. It was as if I never had a father," she said, 
expressing wonder even now that something so important could have been 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt half a person, never whole. That's one reason I had to write 
the book, to claim both my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said she interviewed former nannies, priests, doctors, relatives, family 
friends, childhood pals and anyone else who participated in a life so painful 
that she had blacked out huge chunks of it. Through intensive psychotherapy in 
the past few years, she said, she has been able to retrieve early memories and 
establish enough self-confidence to "claim my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said Young has not spoken to her since 1986, when the actress heard that 
her daughter might write a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' book asserts that Young gave birth to her on Nov. 6, 1935, in a 
darkened hide-out in Venice; left the baby with a nurse, and visited 
sporadically, only under cover of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 6 months, Lewis said, she was shipped to a Catholic orphanage in San 
Francisco, where she was cared for until she was almost 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no photos of my first two years," Lewis said, "because no one cared 
enough to take any." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon she surfaced as Young's adopted daughter -- the one with huge, standout 
ears like Gable's and an overbite like Young's. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ears were kept covered so diligently by hair brushing and bonnets that 
Lewis said she soon came to think of herself as deformed, rushing to cover her 
ears when her nanny forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 7, the ears had been fixed in a surgery that removed reminders of her 
lineage, but left memories of searing pain. The teeth were corrected soon 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls being cloistered in small rooms with a nursemaid in a huge 
Colonial house on Sunset Boulevard in Bel-Air. She rarely saw her busy mother, 
she said, which eventually made her wonder why the woman had bothered to adopt 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 And she remembers clearly the loss of her first nanny, "who was the only 
emotional anchor I'd ever had." She wondered: "Maybe if I had behaved better, 
tried harder, been a more pleasing child, my nanny wouldn't have left me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pattern of self-blame repeated constantly over the years. Lewis said 
she grew up trying to please her mother, to win the acceptance and love that 
seemed to flow so automatically in the homes of her school friends, whether 
they were adopted or not. 
</P>
<P>
 As the emotional distance between them continued to grow, Lewis tried even 
harder, although it often meant denying herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis writes that she did not attend USC as she wanted to because her mother 
preferred she go to finishing school in New York. She did not study acting 
there as she wanted to because her mother preferred her to learn secretarial 
skills. She did not marry the man of her choice, Russell Hughes, because her 
mother did not approve of him. 
</P>
<P>
 In her teens, Lewis said, a combination of her appearance, her mother's 
behavior and the rumors led her to begin to suspect that Young was her 
biological mother, but she had no proof. "Each time I asked, my mother would 
say, 'I couldn't love you any more if you were my own child.' It was always 
said with an air of finality, which discouraged me from further discussion," 
Lewis said. She had no inkling who her father was until the eve of her own 
wedding, at 23, when her fiance told her about the Gable rumors that had 
circulated for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was astounded, but said she was still so frightened of losing the 
tenuous bond with her mother that she couldn't confront her yet. She would try 
to establish a relationship with Gable, she decided, as soon as she could get 
her mother to confirm the relationship. That would take time -- a commodity in 
short supply. On Lewis' 25th birthday, Gable suffered a heart attack. Ten days 
later, on the first birthday of Lewis' own daughter, Gable died. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, Lewis still lacked confirmation from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis wrote that finally, at 31, she confronted her, and Young confirmed that 
Gable was her father.  
</P>
<P>
 The two talked for hours, the first and last such conversation they ever had, 
Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
 After her own divorce, Lewis enrolled at age 50 at Antioch University in 
Marina del Rey, working full time as a secretary to afford tuition. She is now 
a marriage and family counselor in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may wonder, what am I complaining about? I had all the physical things 
anyone could want. The glamorous homes, the clothes, the movie-star mother," 
Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But all that glamour was meaningless to a little girl who felt she didn't 
exist. I don't know how else to phrase it. I was alive, but I felt I didn't 
really exist. I was starved for attention, recognition, love."

D.C. KNOWS SCANDALS, AND WHITEWATER IS NO WATERGATE; HUMOR: COMICALLY SPEAKING, 
THE CLINTON DEVELOPMENT DEAL WILL NEVER EVER BE CONFUSED WITH THE NIXON 
POLITICAL BURGLARY THING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a town that likes a good political joke almost as much as a juicy 
political scandal, Whitewater has been a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Lenos and Lettermans have had a seemingly easy time extracting humor 
from it, few within the Beltway have found much in the complex tale to chortle 
over despite the capital's rich tradition of ridiculing political figures when 
they are down. 
</P>
<P>
 After a winter on the Whitewater defensive, however, the Clinton 
Administration is laughing back. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 6, Clinton adviser James Carville startled journalists at a Christian 
Science Monitor breakfast by passing out copies of a "media food chain" chart 
that put the Establishment press below the likes of Gennifer Flowers and Rush 
Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, the President himself traded Whitewater one-liners with humorist 
Garrison Keillor at a radio and television correspondents' gala, wondering how 
those assembled could possibly have time for their own taxes when they had 
spent so much time on his. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dinner, White House Staff Secretary John Podesta presented Rep. James 
Leach (R-Iowa), the perpetually pullover-clad Whitewater crusader, with a 
sleeveless sweater in case Congress holds hearings this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in an interview if the Administration now thinks of Whitewater as a 
laughing matter, Podesta said, "That would be going too far." But he conceded 
that there had been a change of mood in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blame it on the cherry blossoms," Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia, Haiti and renewed allegations of pre-presidential sexual misconduct 
have since wilted some of the White House's optimism. But on Whitewater at 
least, Democrats seem to think they have turned a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Washington birthday party April 9 for Mike Berman, a former aide to 1984 
Democratic presidential candidate (and now Ambassador to Japan) Walter F. 
Mondale, White House Communications Director Mark Gearan and his wife were 
dancing next to Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 When Altman accidentally stepped on Gearan's foot, Gearan cracked: "That's an 
inappropriate contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, as those steeped in Whitewater know, got himself into trouble -- and 
helped propel White House lawyer Bernard Nussbaum out of the Administration -- 
for briefing Nussbaum about the status of a supposedly independent government 
investigation into the failed Arkansas savings and loan that financed the 
Whitewater development. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton returned to the Whitewater scene at a dinner for White House 
correspondents on April 23, although the jokes had an edge that made the media 
wince. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: After a sarcastic crack about the "journalistic integrity" shown by 
Time magazine in using a misleading old photo of himself and adviser George 
Stephanopoulos, the President showed a slide of a cover he said Time had passed 
up -- a mock photo of the two men with Roseanne Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's resort to humor comes after a grim winter when even the 
Republicans on Capitol Hill found sparse comedic material in the arcane story 
of S&L shenanigans and back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the jokes now are about Hillary and the futures trading," said one 
Republican Senate aide. "Otherwise the thing is too complicated. I heard 
someone say Clinton got into Whitewater cause he thought Hillary said 
'McDonald's' " instead of McDougal (for James McDougal, owner of the failed 
Arkansas S&L). "Yeah, that's pretty pathetic," the aide agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, other Washington scandals have been comedic gold mines. 
</P>
<P>
 Example of one of the jokes: After Clarence Thomas got through his grueling 
confirmation hearings for the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
suggested that they go out together and pick up some dates. Thomas said, "OK, 
but this time, you do the talking and I'll drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Or this one circulating now about beleaguered Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.): He 
lost the congressional spelling bee because he thought harass was two words. 
</P>
<P>
 A scandal that only a policy wonk could love, Whitewater has also proved 
challenging to local professional punsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this huge big thing that everyone knows about but nobody knows what it 
is," said Mike Tilford of the Capitol Steps, a group of former congressional 
staffers that does musical parodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it about losing money, making money, Vince Foster's death? The part of it 
that's scandalous is boring, and the part of it that's not is probably not 
true," Tilford said. 
</P>
<P>
 His group's latest offering: A song called "Ol Whitewater," sung to the tune 
of "Black Water" by the Doobie Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilford as Clinton sings: 
</P>
<P>
 I lost sixty grand on some Arkansas land.  
</P>
<P>
 My wife lost money, the check's in her name.  
</P>
<P>
 So now I'm in trouble  
</P>
<P>
 Get help on the double  
</P>
<P>
 Let Nussbaum and Hubbell  
</P>
<P>
 An' Socks take the blame.  
</P>
<P>
 Gross National Product, another group appearing weekly in Georgetown, did a 
skit called the "Whitewater Brief," patterned after the movie "The Pelican 
Brief" for a few weeks in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the height of it and then it sort of died," said Bob Heck, who plays 
Clinton in GNP's show, "Clintoons." 
</P>
<P>
 In a more recent performance, Whitewater got short shrift except for an 
"Easter" skit in which Hillary Rodham Clinton was supposed to be Jesus; Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Pontius Pilate, and Clinton, Judas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ask you one more time," the Dole character says to Hillary 
Clinton. "Did you do anything illegal in the Whitewater affair?" 
</P>
<P>
 She replies: "Look, I've told you, Bill and I have never been involved in any 
S&M crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The skit ends with the press yelling, "Crucify her!" and Hillary telling Bill, 
"So that's what that little kiss on the cheek was about this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran political comic Mark Russell said he had no trouble finding something 
funny to say about Whitewater once "we heard the word shred ." 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitewater jokes take up only about 5% of his show in contrast to the 
great scandals of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't going to be a two-year run like Watergate," Russell said with 
evident nostalgia. "I was completely wiped out when (President Richard Nixon) 
resigned. I had to go back to writing my own material."

RADIO; LEADING L.A. TO THE LIGHT; AFTER TWO YEARS, TV NEWS REFUGEE WARREN OLNEY 
REFLECTS ON HIS REBORN CAREER AND THE UNEXPECTED CLOUT OF 'WHICH WAY, L.A.?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL, Sean Mitchell is an occasional contributor to Calendar. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Possibly stranger things have happened in broadcasting, but Warren Olney's 
trans-media journey from the anchor desks at Channels 2 and 13 to his seat at 
the controls of KCRW-FM's "Which Way, L.A.?" remains in defiance of the laws of 
electronic journalism. Highly paid TV news people do not, as a rule, migrate to 
the prestigious poverty of public radio. Few TV anchors would probably qualify 
even if they had the desire, and few have the desire because the money and 
celebrity are in television. Olney, at 56, has taken the road less traveled. 
And it has remade his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurled onto the air by local National Public Radio affiliate KCRW (89.9) in 
the wake of the April, 1992, riots, "Which Way, L.A.?" in two years has 
surpassed even its creators' best expectations, becoming a critical daily 
gathering place for the hearts and minds of this complex and troubled 
megalopolis, a small clearing where it often seems that the warring tribes are 
talking to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The head gatherer at this 1 p.m. Monday-Friday democratic inquiry (the program 
is rebroadcast at 7 p.m.) is Olney, who seems to be doing something no one has 
ever done before, at least in Los Angeles, by combining the skills of a 
political reporter with those of a diplomat and street referee, forging a new 
role as a kind of ombudsman of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 He sits alone in a small basement studio on the campus of Santa Monica College 
and reins in by telephone five or six carefully chosen guests -- activists, 
elected officials, ministers, reporters, professors, ordinary citizens -- 
sometimes taking additional callers, probing, mediating and making as clear as 
possible the conflicting points of self-interest surrounding a given issue. 
It's an hour of in-depth discussion with, of course, no commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has been essential listening in government offices and newsrooms but 
also in kitchens and cars and on portable radios tuned in by Angelenos trying 
to make sense of the law, the schools, the police, the environment, crime and 
health care, as well as the forces of race, class and culture that set the city 
on fire two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does pack some wallop in the political and governmental community," says 
Westside city councilman and former mayoral candidate Zev Yaroslavsky, who has 
been a guest on the show several times. "When I'm on, people tell me they've 
heard me. People definitely listen. If somebody says something newsworthy or 
interesting on 'Which Way, L.A.?' it will be all around town that day." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the show's clout came last year during a program on the mayoral 
campaign when, at one point, the leading candidates -- Michael Woo, Richard 
Katz, Richard Riordan and Joel Wachs -- were all on hold, waiting for Olney to 
question them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He manages to make domestic stuff compelling, with a very high level of 
debate," says Ian Masters, the host of the long-running Sunday morning foreign 
policy program "Background Briefing" on public station KPFK-FM (90.7). "Not 
only is it rare to have somebody talking about something important, but he's 
doing it when the trend in the media is to be more circus-like, with less and 
less reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the personalities who dominate commercial talk radio, Olney chooses not 
to flaunt his own opinions. He has not taken it as his mission to be amusing or 
provocative or as deliberately charming as the popular and genteel Michael 
Jackson of KABC-AM (790). Yet he has been a powerful presence on the air: a 
voice full of curiosity and intellect that is somehow soothing at the same 
time. In the continuing social disarray that is Los Angeles, it has sometimes 
seemed that if anyone is pulling the city together it's not Mayor Riordan, it's 
not Magic Johnson, it's, of all people, Warren Olney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's Ruth Seymour and it's Larry Stein and it's Sarah Spitz and a lot 
of people," Olney says when he hears this, acknowledging the KCRW team that 
assembles the show with him. "And it's the guests who really make it. But if 
that's true, if it does have that function to some extent, then that's the 
highest form of achievement as far as I'm concerned. You know there aren't a 
lot of things that do pull this place together." 
</P>
<P>
 The closest thing to Olney's show is the nightly half-hour "Life & Times" on 
KCET-TV Channel 28, which is a more conventional talk show, with three seated 
hosts and frequent in-studio guests. 
</P>
<P>
 While the audience for "Which Way, L.A.?" may be small (about 150,000 
listeners a week) by the standards of television ratings or Howard Stern radio 
numbers, it is considered an influential and diverse group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the yuppie Westside," Olney says. "I get a lot of response from 
government and a surprising amount of recognition from places I didn't expect 
it -- from the black community in particular. It's hard to account for that 
except to say that we are dealing with issues that other people aren't, giving 
people a voice that they don't have elsewhere. And taking them seriously, which 
is probably the most important thing. That's one of the lessons of the riots: 
People were pissed off from not being heard from, being ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olney walked away from KCOP-TV Channel 13 and a hefty six-figure salary in 
December, 1991, because, he says, "I just didn't want to do it anymore, really. 
I wanted to do something different and sort of get back to where I started, 
which was reporting. I was casting about. Ironically, I had thought about doing 
radio because I've always liked radio. I grew up with radio as a listener." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he had never worked in radio. He started his career in newspapers and 
jumped to TV early. He met Ruth Seymour (then Hirschman), KCRW's general 
manager, in the 1970s, when both were members of a local journalists' chapter 
of Amnesty International, the organization that monitors political imprisonment 
and torture around the world. After leaving television, he ran into her at a 
social gathering and told her that he listened to the station and that if she 
ever needed any help, he was available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought of Warren as a television anchor," Seymour says. "I always 
saw him in the context of that group, which shared certain concerns. I knew he 
was somebody interested in the world, human rights and the way the city 
operated." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, whose critics had accused KCRW of having a preoccupation with 
national and international affairs at the exclusion of local politics, took the 
riots as a further sign that the high-profile station had to change some of its 
focus. She called Olney and asked him to host a one-time round table on the 
riots presented in concert with a related show on PBS affiliate KCET. 
</P>
<P>
 Things went so well that she asked him to come back and do it for a week, then 
a second week, as Los Angeles continued to re-examine what had happened to 
itself on April 29, 1992. Believing that the show might have legs, Seymour came 
up with a running title, "Which Way, L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 "After two weeks there was still stuff to talk about," Olney recalls. "I had a 
sense that my former colleagues (in TV) would be going back to business as 
usual, which I think they subsequently did, so we thought maybe we can keep 
some of these things alive a little longer. So then it went on for the summer 
and then, Jesus, the rest of the year, and then we got a grant to do it for 
another year. So here we are still doing it. I had no intention of doing this. 
It came about completely by accident." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he may have been a new figure to KCRW listeners, Olney had been a 
familiar face on local television news since the '70s, having worked for 
Channels 2, 4, 7 and 13 as either a reporter or anchor. It became apparent from 
the first days of "Which Way, L.A.?" that he was not just another big, round 
voice bringing the sound of television news to public radio. But then, he had 
never exactly been a typical TV newsman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the guys who did his homework," says Los Angeles City 
Councilman Wachs, who remembers Olney as a TV reporter. "When he'd come to 
interview you, he was always well-prepared. He took the time to become 
knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
 He is, to be precise, Warren Olney IV, a fourth-generation Californian whose 
great-grandfather was the mayor of Oakland, a friend of conservationist John 
Muir and a founder of the Sierra Club. His father, Warren Olney III, was a Bay 
Area prosecutor and state attorney general who became head of the criminal 
division of the Justice Department under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren IV grew up in Berkeley, then moved with his family to Washington, D.C., 
for high school. He went to exclusive Amherst College in Massachusetts and 
while he was still an undergraduate married his high school sweetheart -- not 
an everyday occurrence at Amherst, which was then all-male. The marriage ended 
in divorce after five years and two children. (He has, in all, four children 
and four grandchildren from three wives.) 
</P>
<P>
 After doing graduate work in English at Berkeley and Cornell, Olney was 
drafted into the Army in 1963 and almost got sent to Vietnam as a radio 
operator. But his military job was changed to information specialist and he 
served out his time at Ft. Monroe, S.C., writing news releases and speeches for 
generals. He hastens to add that this was not what steered him into journalism: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to give credit to the Army for anything positive in my life, 
except learning how to beat the system, learning how to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 He took his first newspaper job in 1965 at the Newport News, Va., Daily Press. 
"I had always wanted to be a writer," he says. "And I had no idea how you could 
make a living at that except to be a reporter. Then I found out I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Olney was back in California, at the Sacramento Bee, then 
switched to television, becoming the Sacramento bureau chief for a San 
Francisco TV station. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he loved TV -- at first: "There was a different ethic at the time, 
more emphasis on reporting and what's the story. Reporters were asked what they 
had learned when they came back rather than why didn't it turn out the way the 
producer thought it was going to look before you left. You could actually tell 
a story. A story of four minutes was not unusual. So I had a wonderful time. 
It's fun to make these little movies, you know, it really is. It's a kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Olney went to Washington to work for local stations, then returned to 
California in 1970, ending up in Los Angeles at Channel 2 in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television anchoring was never my goal or particular interest. I just did it 
because they paid you. It's advancement, and when you're in the business you 
want to advance. And I'm enough of a performer, I suppose, that I enjoyed that 
aspect of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers not to discuss how much money he made in television, except to say 
that it was "three or four times" as much as he is making at KCRW, which in any 
case is paying him more than the station has ever paid anyone, says Seymour, 
the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a lot, but I certainly did not ascend to the stratospheric heights 
that are current today, which I find obscene -- appalling, absolutely 
appalling. Again, as a reporter, how much do you need? These guys are getting a 
million bucks -- (Paul) Moyer and (Jerry) Dunphy. And, you know, there are a 
lot better ways to spend that money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olney, who lives near the border of Venice and the Marina, gets to the station 
each day about 10:30 a.m. and takes a seat at a desk in a room with eight other 
desks, occupied by staff and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first came to KCRW, Seymour recalls, "I told him, 'I'll get you a 
desk,' and he said, 'I don't need a desk.' Where do you get a TV anchorman who 
says he doesn't need a desk? He fit in right away." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning he was dressed for work in loose khakis and a long-sleeve 
cotton blue shirt, unbuttoned at the neck and rolled up to his forearms. His 
face is tanned and serious, but one thing you can't hear on the radio is the 
look of refined amusement that crinkles his features from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 He goes over the day's program with producers Spitz, Stein and other aides. 
He's told what guests have been contacted, and he composes the day's news 
summary that he will read at the top of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney, Seymour, Spitz and Stein meet about twice a week to brainstorm topics. 
Coming up with four, five or six appropriate guests day after day can be a 
killing regimen. ("I don't know how he finds all these people," Yaroslavsky 
says.) "Incredible," says Olney, saluting his producers. "Their achievement in 
doing this is not to be dismissed. I'm not being modest when I say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the day's scheduled subject is pushed aside for more pressing 
events, as when the verdicts in the Reginald O. Denny beating case were 
returned or the day of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is done completely on the phone. There are never in-studio guests. 
"We discovered that people are more candid on the phone," says producer Stein. 
"Somehow they seem freer." Guests call in from office phones, car phones and 
airport lounges. At least one, American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Allan 
Parachini, called from an airliner somewhere over Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 While he sits alone in the studio with his headphones, Olney faces a small 
computer monitor that connects him with Spitz and Stein, seated in another room 
working the phones and typing messages that tell him who's on-line and who's 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His style has been likened to that of Ted Koppel of ABC's "Nightline," but 
Olney doesn't seem to be imitating anyone, especially Koppel, whose 
self-importance can loom larger than his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see myself as what I've always been, which is a reporter, essentially," 
Olney says. "So what I'm trying to do is get people to tell me what they think. 
I'll ask whatever question it takes to get them to do that. That's what's 
satisfying to me. And I want to hear from people whose ideas I don't find 
compatible." 
</P>
<P>
 He does not pre-interview the guests, preferring to take them as they come. 
"In so many ways, it's similar to what I've always done," he says. "When I did 
interviews for television, I don't know that they've been all that different 
from the kinds of interviews I've done on the air, but you just didn't see 
them. Because you just take a little piece out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 One difference on "Which Way, L.A.?" is that Olney must function not just as a 
reporter but as someone who, in Stein's words, "can really listen to people and 
facilitate interaction among them." 
</P>
<P>
 The interaction can be mild or it can get tense, as it did on a recent show 
about the shooting of a Latino youth in Lynwood by a Korean grocer who told 
police the boy had stolen a bag of cookies. Guests included a Latino member of 
the Lynwood City Council, Armando Rea, and a Korean American activist, Marsha 
Choo, who by the final 15 minutes of the show were shouting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney did not make peace between them, but with his own questions he succeeded 
in framing the dispute so that its different angles of interpretation were 
plain and palpable. There was a discussion of how the story had been played in 
The Times and on television. Angela Oh, a Korean attorney, came on to mention 
that the English-language press had failed to notice that, in the last year, 
more than 40 Korean store owners in Los Angeles had been shot, 19 fatally. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not, in other words, the usual news. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, which he likens to taking a daily exam, Olney winds down by 
calling as many of the guests as he can reach to thank them for appearing. He 
tends not to eat lunch, but snacks on a fruit bar packed from home while he 
busies himself with thoughts about upcoming shows and stays around for a couple 
more hours. 
</P>
<P>
 For relaxation he takes long walks on the beach. He recently learned how to 
play golf, but he's not sure he wants this known. "It's such an imperialistic 
game," he says as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends a lot of time with his wife, Marsha Temple, a lawyer and aspiring 
fiction writer, whom he remarried last year. The two met in 1972 when she was 
working for George S. McGovern's presidential campaign and Olney was covering 
it. They married in 1975 and divorced in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Which Way, L.A.?" has become "the 900-pound gorilla" at KCRW, in General 
Manager Seymour's words. A station once criticized for its lack of local news 
and public affairs is now harnessed to a show about Los Angeles that is its 
most expensive and ambitious undertaking ever -- made possible with grants from 
GTE, the California Community Foundation and other donors, along with the 
station's 40,000 paying members. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the riots, the show, like the city itself, has backed away 
from the heat of those first fearful months, when the future seemed cast in 
ethnic hatreds and doom. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's focus has broadened to include such topics as the war in Bosnia, 
the role of regents at the University of California, the assassination of 
Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, "the new nihilism," the 
press and the Whitewater affair and violence in motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney concedes that the focus has changed somewhat, but he says emphatically 
that he believes the relevance of the program's title is not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. seems to represent the world. I can't think of a subject except maybe 
arctic cold that wouldn't apply to L.A. It's the most exciting thing about it 
and the most daunting. There's no way we can stop being topical." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the political temperature of the city, he says: "I'm not sure much has 
changed. People just aren't as mad about it at the moment. But you wonder when 
they might get mad again." 
</P>
<P>
 He says that he is committed to the show for the foreseeable future and that 
he hopes to augment his salary with a number of video projects he plans to 
produce on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get paid a lot for doing this. On the other hand, you have to 
decide what you want to do with your life. There frankly are not a lot of jobs 
-- I can't think of any at the moment -- in local television that appeal to me. 
This appeals to me a lot. There's enormous freedom and independence. The value 
structure is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while somebody (in TV) says, 'Jesus, I wish I could do that' 
-- although not too often. I don't want to ask why."* 
</P>
<P>

MAKING THE MUNDANE STELLAR; BRITISH THEATER DIRECTOR STEPHEN DALDRY TOOK AN 
ENGLISH PERENNIAL, 'AN INSPECTOR CALLS,' AND PEELED BACK LAYERS THAT NOBODY 
ELSE SAW. THEN HE HIT BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the chance of a lifetime. Invited to direct at the prestigious Royal 
National Theatre, up-and-comer Stephen Daldry could suggest the play of his 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Daldry choose J.B. Priestley's "An Inspector Calls," a staple of 
English schools, radio shows and amateur companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just about the most performed play in England," concedes Daldry. "There 
are hundreds and hundreds of productions each year." 
</P>
<P>
 Not like this one. Daldry turned Priestley's drawing room mystery into a dark 
psychological thriller and played up its social commentary. His production, 
which opened at the National in September, 1992, was so popular it later toured 
Britain and moved to the West End's Aldwych Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Daldry's "An Inspector Calls" drew great reviews, solid houses and four 
Olivier awards. "One went in a state of duty," recalls Guardian theater critic 
Michael Billington, one of many English critics to rave about the show. "But he 
releases the hidden beauty of the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Many New York critics were equally complimentary when the show recently opened 
on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times critic David Richards, for instance, credited Daldry with 
turning the Priestley potboiler into "one of the more astonishing spectacles on 
Broadway right now." And Associated Press critic Michael Kuchwara concluded his 
review suggesting that Daldry join his cast onstage for curtain calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with such contemporaries as Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes and Deborah 
Warner, Daldry is among a handful of young British directors who have received 
increasing attention and accolades in the British press. With "Inspector" 
making such a splash on Broadway, 32-year-old Daldry now joins Hytner, director 
of both "Miss Saigon" and the current Broadway revival of "Carousel," as 
someone to watch on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at home, things also couldn't be much better for the one-time circus 
clown. Just a few weeks ago, his National Theatre production of Sophie 
Treadwell's play, "Machinal," won four Olivier awards, including Daldry's 
second in a row for best direction of a play. Currently artistic director of 
London's prominent Royal Court Theatre, Daldry has been mentioned as a possible 
successor to Richard Eyre as head of the National Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 It was largely Daldry's innovative productions of Spanish and German plays 
that landed him his first National Theatre assignment. But his most recent 
achievements at both the National and Royal Court have been successful revivals 
of English and American plays, including the lesser-known "Machinal" and Arnold 
Wesker's "The Kitchen" as well as "Inspector."  
</P>
<P>
 Daily Telegraph critic Charles Spencer wrote that Daldry reminded him of a 
"canny antiques dealer. . . . He picks up other people's disregarded tat for a 
song and then performs a brilliant restoration job that reveals the work to be 
far more valuable than anyone previously suspected." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the possibilities with "An Inspector Calls," for instance. An 
inspector comes by to notify the upper-class Birling family, home celebrating 
their daughter's engagement, that a young, lower-class woman has committed 
suicide. As the evening unfolds, that death is linked to every member of the 
family in one way or another.  
</P>
<P>
 "We reckon that 20% of the audience has been in the play," quips Daldry. "And 
when we played in Bradford, where Priestley comes from, we reckon 70% of the 
audience has played the Inspector." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal is "Inspector's" surface simplicity, suggests Kenneth 
Cranham, the actor who plays Inspector Goole in New York as he did in London. " 
'An Inspector Calls' has a simplicity like a medieval morality play, or a 
Western," says Cranham. "The guy comes to town and rides off." 
</P>
<P>
 Cranham is the only Broadway cast member who started with the show in England. 
Co-starring Philip Bosco and Rosemary Harris, the New York production also uses 
live music rather than recorded, and incorporates a more sophisticated rain 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Daldry's Expressionist staging of the play hasn't changed in crossing the 
Atlantic. On Broadway, the Royale Theatre's stage also rakes at an odd angle, 
says designer Ian MacNeil, to make everything seem out of kilter. And the 
Birling home is again a life-size doll's house balanced on stilts, allowing for 
some dazzling stage tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Daldry, who first tackled "Inspector" in the late '80s for York Theatre 
Royale, indicates he was attracted as much by the play's politics as by its 
staging potential. Priestley, who did weekly wartime broadcasts, wrote the play 
in 1944 in hopes of prodding his countrymen to a Labour Party victory after the 
war. Its first production was in Moscow (in August, 1945), not London. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Inspector Calls" is set in 1912 Yorkshire, but Daldry surrounds the 
Birling house with a 1940s landscape of war, despair and poverty. The play's 
terrain is a wasteland filled with poor, dazed children and adults who 
occasionally serve as witnesses, a chorus to what is happening onstage and, by 
inference, in contemporary England. 
</P>
<P>
 Daldry hammers home Priestley's points about the inter-dependence of society, 
a message the director also tries to make timeless. The Aldwych Theatre's 
program contrasted comments from Priestley and former Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, and actor Cranham notes that Inspector Goole's final speech on social 
responsibility was "particularly important" to director Daldry. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Inspector Calls' was written for the 1945 general election, so it is a call 
to arms," says Daldry. "What appealed to me was (Priestley's) wanting to say 
the past is not right and we need to reach forward into the unknown. Now it's a 
much more cynical time, where idealism tends to be derided as something that's 
spurious, not of value." 
</P>
<P>
 Priestley morality plays seem a long way from Daldry's early years studying 
clowning. After graduating from Sheffield University, where he first started 
directing, Daldry trained with Italy's Il Circo di Nando Orfei. Intrigued by 
the nature of clowning, he says, he signed on as an apprentice clown and toured 
Italy for nine months. He performed three times daily, riding unicycles, 
juggling, fire-eating, playing sousaphone and bagpipes.  
</P>
<P>
 He next went to Paris, spent some time there "chilling out, really," then 
headed back to England. He worked at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre, did 
free-lance directing in regional theater, then landed at the Gate Theatre in 
London's Notting Hill area as artistic director.  
</P>
<P>
 At that time a 60-seat theater (it seats about 120 now), the Gate specialized 
in English premieres of foreign work, both contemporary and classical. Daldry 
was known to fill its tiny stage with 25 actors and such spectacular effects as 
the actual building of a bridge onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, he says, was never to treat the Gate like a small theater by doing 
one-set or two-character plays. Instead, he says, he tried "to find a large 
theatrical language within this incredibly enclosed space (and) do epic plays 
so it really felt like they were bursting through walls. " 
</P>
<P>
 He was at the Gate from '89 to '92, during which time it won many awards, got 
a lot of press coverage and as Daldry put it, "managed to get quite a high 
profile quite fast." Before he had left the Gate, he says, he'd come up with 
both National assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 American playwright Sophie Treadwell's 1928 drama "Machinal," which closed 
earlier this year at the National, "was a play that I'd been wanting to do for 
a long time," says Daldry. "I couldn't find a way of doing it at the Gate, and 
the (National's) Lyttelton stage had everything that I needed for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Machinal" (French for "machine-like") tells the tale of a Young Woman who 
kills her husband, goes on trial and is sent to the gas chamber. Drawing on 
every bit of the huge Lyttelton stage to create a threatening, mechanistic 
world, Daldry and designer MacNeil used everything from steel curtains that 
open sideways to metal ceilings and grids.  
</P>
<P>
 In Daldry's "Machinal," machines overshadowed people, life was played out 
within terrible confines and the walls were closing in. The drama was as 
precisely choreographed as it was designed, and secretaries typed, tore paper 
and tapped pencils to a distinctive, monotonous beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a natural relationship to nightmare," says actress Fiona Shaw, who 
just won an Olivier for her performance as "Machinal's" Young Woman. "Both 'An 
Inspector Calls' and 'Machinal' seem to share (a nightmare's ) terrifying 
disassociation of images. There's a very safe play in 'Machinal,' and I knew 
Stephen would embrace the most dangerous aspect of it."  
</P>
<P>
 Daldry embraces stage dangers with the support of a creative team he has 
worked with since Notting Hill's Gate Theatre. He brought that team to Broadway 
as well, where they drew their share of favorable notices for "Inspector."  
</P>
<P>
 Set designer MacNeil, son of PBS journalist Robert MacNeil, and Daldry both 
live and work together. Composer Stephen Warbeck and lighting designer Rick 
Fisher have sometimes taken over such directing chores as giving notes to 
actors or leading rehearsals, Daldry says. Daldry and MacNeil not only use 
stage props and fixtures in a way reminiscent of Peter Sellars' staging, but 
they also suggest the dark, visual richness of such Coen brothers films as 
"Barton Fink." Equally cinematic, implies actress Shaw, is Daldry's way of 
shaping a play: "He did masses of choreography and pared it away," says Shaw. 
"He built a sort of enormous world and used the bits of it he liked." 
</P>
<P>
 His world these days is largely the Royal Court, the well-known Victorian 
theater across from Sloane Square. The place that launched John Osborne's "Look 
Back in Anger" and Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden," the Royal Court has 
been home to many of England's best writers and, for the past few years, Daldry 
as well.  
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Court is an unassuming place, and Daldry appears similarly 
unassuming. He rides a bike to work in London, as he also has in New York, and 
has a boyish, self-effacing charm that actors and interviewers alike always 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in 1991 to succeed Max Stafford-Clark, the Royal Court's longtime 
director, Daldry worked with Stafford-Clark for 18 months, then began running 
the place himself last fall. When he was in New York readying "Inspector" for 
its Broadway opening, he still went back to London each week from Sunday to 
Tuesday and talked every morning to his office there.  
</P>
<P>
 Daldry and the Royal Court are encouraging new writers, in part through a 
playwright exchange program with Los Angeles' Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre. 
The Court also has about 30 writers a year under commission, Daldry says. 
</P>
<P>
 New York critic Richards called Daldry " a showman with a conscience," and the 
director concedes he is drawn to what he calls "serious drama. . . . When one 
wants to change the world, there are many ways of doing it. God knows, it needs 
it. My particular way of doing it is through theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last few years, particularly in this country, have been a search to try 
and create a new language in theater. The stories are changing and the ways in 
which those stories are told are also changing. . . . Regular theatergoers are 
sort of going, and one has to find that new generation of theatergoers (that) 
tends to be younger and has different interests."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he's managing the afterlife of "Inspector." Productions are already 
set for Tokyo, Melbourne and Toronto, he says, and given the show's reception 
in New York, an American tour would appear likely. Daldry reports interest in a 
film remake -- a 1954 movie version starred Alastair Sim as Inspector Goole -- 
and says a few other potential film projects "are in the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 Daldry is clearly ambitious, but asked if "Inspector's" success gives him a 
sense of freedom, he says no. "Quite the reverse. Success is always a burden, 
really. People are right that success means your next failure is that much 
closer."*

THAT FACE, THOSE EYES . . .; DANA CARVEY'S GOT A NEW CAREER VISION THING. ( OK 
, OK . NO MORE GEORGE BUSHISMS .) SO WITH 'CLEAN SLATE,' CAN THE MAN OF A 
THOUSAND SENDUPS MOVE FROM 'SNL' TO BIG-SCREEN LEADING MAN?

<P>
 If you were Dana Carvey, you might be happy as hell that George Bush didn't 
get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing necessarily ideological, mind you, just fewer people on the street or 
on press junkets pestering you to do just a few seconds -- please? -- of the 
hemming-and-hawing lisp and ineffectual tomahawk chops that made the real Bush 
finally seem like a parody of Carvey's own appropriation on "Saturday Night 
Live." A term's worth of that, and a Bush breather ought to be welcome for a 
versatility-loving comic. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'd done enough of Bush," Carvey allows, feeling a little more for his 
spoofee's welfare than his own, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'd been beaten up quite enough, and it was fine to send him off 
into the night. I'm working on my (Jack) Kemp. Impressionists gotta get a jump, 
we gotta think 'Who's the front-runner?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But . . . it's kind of weird." An embarrassing admission is imminent. "I find 
myself going in a restaurant and thinking (he breaks into his best Bush), 
'Wellll, got a little biscuit . . . ' I mean, I find myself still doing him, to 
myself , so that is a sickness in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 But George Bush seems to be the one recurring "Saturday Night Live" character 
of the '90s that isn't in development as a feature film these days, though 
you'd think the ex-Prez would be at least as eligible a spinoff as Linda 
Richman or Pat. So, whither the film career of Carvey, who exited the show 
while still its most popular player nearly two years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 It's coming, it's coming. Enter "Clean Slate," Carvey's first real starring 
vehicle since leaving TV's preeminent late-night revue, if you don't count the 
"Wayne's World" movies, in which he enjoyed elevated sidekick status. 
("Opportunity Knocks," his sole prior stab at carrying a feature film, was 
released four years ago while Carvey was still in the midst of "Saturday Night" 
fever.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean Slate," which opened Friday, is the film a very weary Carvey has 
arrived at a Manhattan hotel to promote, on a one-day leave from a shoot in 
Canada, though he confesses only half-jokingly that he barely remembers making 
the movie in question. This forgetfulness isn't a riff on the script's amnesia 
theme but an allusion to the fact that the picture wrapped a year ago and he's 
been busy filming other movies ever since, one of the successors being the 
already rush-released "Wayne's World 2." 
</P>
<P>
 "A year? That's like a lifetime," he reiterates wearily. "I've done three 
films since this. So it's kinda like 'What was that again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The one with the dog, we remind him. (Barkley the terrier, who has much more 
time to burn than Carvey, is doing interviews of a sort on another floor.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, people love the dog. That's good. People were going, 'Were you afraid 
the dog was gonna steal the movie?' I said, 'Please, God, I hope he does.' If 
we can get some dog laughs, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 The human laughs in "Clean Slate," meanwhile, for once in Carvey's career, 
don't rely on his submerging his own persona in the service of exaggerated 
characterizations. He plays it about as close as he's going to get to straight 
in a thickly plotted comedy whose premise is sort of the inverse of "Groundhog 
Day": As a private detective newly beset by a rare form of amnesia that causes 
him to clear out his memory bank every time he dozes, he starts each morning 
mentally anew, while the rest of the world awakens to the usual continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 This role wasn't written with the comic or his famous mimicry in mind, and 
here at last, Dana Carvey stays visible as someone who looks and sounds much 
like Dana Carvey, a romantic leading man thing, without accents and wigs. A 
breakthrough he's been striving for? 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, not really. I like playing characters," he insists, "and I've 
really come to terms with that, and I realize that I don't really have a face. 
I think if there's anything true about me, it's that I just change a lot. I 
don't think I have a singular persona like Tom Cruise or Kevin Costner or 
something. I have such a bland, rubbery face that I can change it, so why not 
play to that?" 
</P>
<P>
 This picture, he indicates, is more an aberration than a model for his film 
career: "I basically would look for quirkier, weirder parts at this point, 
probably more extreme characters, edgier stuff. That's my thing, just play to 
my strengths from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ironically, my favorite kind of film is an Everyman in an amazing dilemma 
-- 'Three Days of the Condor'; pick any Hitchcock film. I love those kind of 
film noir mystery-detective what's-going-on movies. That's what appealed to me 
about 'Clean Slate': 'Hey, it'd be cool to be in something like that.' But for 
me, ultimately, honestly, probably my strengths are characters and comic 
rhythms, sort of transposing what I did on 'Saturday Night Live' into a filmic 
medium. . . . Listen to me, I sound so pseudo-intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
 He recovers, ever-present modesty intact: "My hero -- which I don't mean to 
make any comparison -- would be Peter Sellers. When I watch him work, I most 
identify with what he's doing. He knows how to bend the words, and that's what 
I like to do, bend words musically, get a laugh that way. I was just watching 
'The Party' the other day. He was hitting musical rhythms in his speech, and 
you could tell that he was having a good time with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Self-amusement, obviously, is no small factor for Carvey, who after all is a 
guy who goes out to eat and can't resist wondering in that inner lisp if 
buttering the biscuit would or wouldn't be prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Carvey's gift is that he works strictly within the topical realm of verbal 
comedy but as if he were a physical comedian, relying on vocal nuances and 
gestures so savvily that it often doesn't matter if content isn't up to form, 
as was too often the case with "SNL." Satire and scatology may have figured 
into Carvey's work regularly enough, but guile has always been secondary to the 
glee he takes in pure performance, which makes even his most devastating 
parodies seem sort of innocent. The world is full of angry comics, and Carvey 
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 All this talk about Carvey's acting aspirations is interrupted at one point by 
a startling declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says unexpectedly, fielding a query about his future in films, "I 
feel like I'm a comedian." He says it again for good measure. "I'm not an 
actor, I'm a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 So pardon us while we stop to collect our jaws off the carpet. But his 
declaration isn't a matter of humility. "People always go, 'Don't put yourself 
down,' and I say to them, 'Well, there's 10,000 actors and about 50 comedians 
-- I'm complimenting myself.' And I think a comedian has to exert control over 
what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the rub, and the real point, of his juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, certainly David Letterman exerts control on his show," Carvey 
continues, "and Roseanne Arnold exerts control, and Robin Williams exerted 
control on 'Mrs. Doubtfire.' You're still a collaborator in film, but you need 
to exert your influence, because you know best how to make you funny. That 
doesn't mean you know anything about film, or it doesn't mean you understand 
the history of cinema, but you do -- after being a stand-up for 10 years -- 
kind of know what your strengths are comedically and how to play to 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Aha, now emerges the ego, figures the cynic. But not really. Reports from 
impartial sorts who have toiled on film sets alongside Carvey give tale of a 
prototypical (and Hollywood atypical) nice guy who's anything but a power 
wielder. For all his talk of "control," Carvey's speaking mostly in the 
theoretical, as someone who hasn't much wielded it yet but is lately prone to 
pondering how to keep his hands near his own reins. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult is not the hallmark of his approach to Hollywood -- so far, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all kind of baby-boom, dysfunctional jargon, but I am a 
people-pleaser," he acknowledges. "I want everyone to like me, which really, 
really is just the way that I've learned to operate in the world. It works for 
me a lot of the time, and it works against me some of the time. I try to assert 
myself more, because I know that my tendency to please can get me in a lot of 
trouble, and not following my instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 And who wouldn't be trying to sharpen up the instincts a little, with the 
deadly "Saturday Night Live"-"SCTV" curse yet to be outlived? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Carvey can enjoy having retired from "SNL" at a personal 
peak: "I was really happy with the way it turned out, because I started out as 
the Church Lady, basically, and by the end they were mentioning different 
characters along with her. That was a triumph, because for a while there I 
thought I was just gonna be the guy in the dress." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the periphery of the path ahead, there's a cinematic salvage yard 
littered with the wreckage of high-concept, low-ball vehicles that lowered 
public estimation of the once-beloved likes of Chase, Aykroyd, Candy, Short, et 
al. Carvey doesn't want to whistle through that graveyard, but he'd still 
rather err on the side of too many movies than too few, lest he not learn along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trip from 'Saturday Night Live' into movies, it's fraught with danger," 
he understates. "If anything, I would beg for compassion for the people who 
make the trip. They're thrust into this arena they really don't understand, and 
yet they don't get to go make 10 B-movies and learn their craft, because of 
their success in television. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times editors overedit comedic scenes so that the rhythm is taken 
out of the hands of the comedian. We were shooting up in Toronto and they had 
this Marx Brothers filmfest up there, and I would come back and watch those 
movies, and I was just like 'Wow, they're playing it in a two-shot, and it's 
not cutting, and it's just Harpo and Chico doing their stuff, and here comes a 
straight guy, and they're (messing) with him, and they're staying on the shot, 
and they're staying on the shot, and they're staying on the shot.' You watch a 
lot of modern comedies, and they overshoot everything, and then they just . . . 
" He makes a wanton snipping motion. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out Carvey means "Wayne's World 2," which was hurriedly written and 
filmed and even more hurriedly edited for Christmas release, as an example. In 
the subplot wherein novice-to-love's-ways Garth falls under the spell of Kim 
Basinger, Carvey had control almost every step of the way -- writing those 
scenes, casting Basinger ("She was brilliant"), working closely with the 
director and cinematographer. But being shut out at the all-important last 
stop, the editing room, was a "frustrating" learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, he was disappointed that the setup he wrote, in which Garth imagines 
himself to have grown up, affording a new swagger in his walk and talk, was 
scissored from the final edit. "It's a little embarrassing when you see a 
performance and the premise of the performance was cut." 
</P>
<P>
 He still hasn't seen "Wayne's World 2" or "Clean Slate" from beginning to end. 
"I have a hard time watching myself on the screen. People say, 'Oh, what are 
you, a romantic lead now?' I see someone with no chin who looks very tired, who 
has his hair colored and looks uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Garth, I see a guy 38 . . . " This requires a little explanation. "In my 
mind, look, they never say our ages, and I say Garth is at least 30. I mean," 
Carvey offers with a whiff of apology, "I never for a second thought that I 
looked like a guy who just got pubes, unless he has some kind of disease. When 
that line came around, I did say to Mike Myers, 'What's with this pubes thing? 
We're trying to say I'm 14 or something? I don't know when yours came in, but . 
. . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lest it sound like this no-control issue has soured Carvey on the whole movie 
thing, that's not the case. His two most recent shoots have him buzzing, both 
having presented him with oddball parts of Peter Sellers-ish proportions in 
reputable ensemble satires. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently he completed work under director Alan Parker on "The Road to 
Wellville," based on T. Coraghessan Boyle's award-winning comic novel about 
rampant enemas and other strange doings at a turn-of-the-century Michigan 
health spa. Carvey plays central guru figure John Harvey Kellogg's 
disillusioned, rat-eating, dumpster-living son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty sick film," he says with a little pride. "I had a big scene 
with Bridget Fonda -- she's naked in a tub and I strip for her -- but mostly 
I'm getting to work with the world's greatest living actor. I do throw bottles 
of feces at Anthony Hopkins' face." 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Anthony's face, he means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, giant bottles of human excrement go flying at Sir Anthony's face, yes. 
So who could turn down a part like that? And I look just hideous in the film. 
I've got this makeup guy, Peter Frampton -- when he wakes up, he comes alive -- 
who cut out these pieces from a Coke can and put 'em behind my ears and made 
'em push out like that. And then he painted my teeth so they looked just 
decayed and rotten and chipped . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't sound more delighted if he was Chauncey Gardner with the clap. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completing "Wellville," Carvey caught the red-eye to Toronto to commence 
shooting "It Happened in Paradise," directed by George Gallo ("29th St.") and 
co-starring Jon Lovitz and Nicholas Cage. Here, as with "Wayne's World 2," 
Carvey is being allowed to create his own part -- as a none-too-bright Italian 
American good-fella -- and improvisation is being heartily welcomed as the 
cameras roll. Carvey's exhausted but intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've found is that the act of discovering it while you're filming is the 
key to comedy on film, rather than rehearsing it, getting it all perfect, 'now 
let's go in front of the cameras and try to repeat that,' " Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was doing 'Saturday Night Live,' I'd try to be bad at read-through, 
bad in rehearsals. Sometimes the writers would go, ' What are you doing?' 
Because I was so afraid to hit it on Thursday or Friday and then spend the rest 
of the weekend trying to repeat myself, and even trying at dress rehearsal not 
to do it too well, so that when you're on air you're discovering where its 
limits are, right as the camera's rolling. And on film that's really hard to 
do. But on this film, on 'It Happened in Paradise,' it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet how many opportunities will there be to play these kinds of weirdos in 
Hollywood pictures on a scale commensurate with the billing and budget he's 
used to? 
</P>
<P>
 For backup, Carvey has at least two of his own projects in development, both 
Sellers-type riffs on naive immigrants. At Columbia, he has "Tucson," about a 
paperback-fed Irishman who comes to the Old West with his own ideas about what 
a cowboy is; at MGM, he hopes to do "Beverly Hills Ninja," a Clouseau-esque 
comedy about a Japanese-born and -bred white guy who stumbles into America 
still laboring under the delusion that he's a great warrior. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's in television or film, I'm trying to protect whatever my strengths 
are and play to my instincts, don't sway from that. And it's hard to do. And 
they do bring truckloads of money," he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that money isn't a factor at all is crazy. . . . But usually you can 
make a lot of different choices. I had this brilliant acting coach who really 
helped me quite a bit. He died of AIDS. And he called me from the hospital, 
from his deathbed, basically, and he said, 'Don'tchase the Hollywood dream. 
It's a dead-end street' -- don't go for fame and money when everyone around you 
is going to 'go for the fame and the money.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I was offered a Church Lady commercial this year -- this year; I 
hadn't done the character in four years -- for seven figures, and didn't do it. 
And I'm not Johnny Integrity at all, but I honestly really like the character 
and I thought that would cheapen her. Isn't that weird?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carvey had paged through the New York Times over breakfast and happened upon 
an article on Dave Thomas, the veteran of the satirical series "SCTV" who never 
quite made it outside the show and is now toiling as a wacky sidekick on a hit 
network sitcom. There are generalizations in the piece about the 
disillusionment of Thomas' generation of comics that have Carvey pondering how 
much they might apply to him: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of traps in Hollywood -- selling your soul. . . . Sooner or 
later, as somebody from 'Saturday Night Live,' you're in a situation where 
you're doing something where they say you would have parodied that in your 
early days. Did you read that about Dave Thomas? I thought that was real 
interesting -- now he's doing what once he would have made fun of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a desirable situation," Carvey adds, thoughtfully, "but maybe it 
happens to all of us sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 This possibility seems to engender the slightest of Angst in the world's least 
angry dead-on savage parodist. But not much more than that. He takes his 
delight in the goofy subversion of the moment more than the expansive scheming 
and cunning of ideology. And if Carvey did break down, swallow the shame and 
imprudently go for the Church Lady commercial, chances are he'd wind up having 
a perfectly self-amusing good time giving the old bag a spin.*

DIVINING MADAME MAO; HENRY ONG'S 'MADAME MAO'S MEMORIES' HAS TRAVELED THE

QING, WIFE OF THE FAMED CHINESE LEADER AND AN INTRIGUING FIGURE IN HER OWN 
RIGHT

<P>
 If politics makes strange bedfellows, theater can make stranger ones still. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken writer Henry Ong sits amid the tan Southwestern decor of his 
Silver Lake home. He is as subtle as the color scheme in this hillside 
sanctuary, a man with much regard for fact but little for sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiang Qing, the woman whose life Ong portrays in his one-woman play "Madame 
Mao's Memories," is another matter entirely. Better known as Madame Mao 
Tse-tung, the ambitious ex-starlet was anything but subdued. She rose to power 
as one of the primary authors of China's violent Cultural Revolution, only to 
spend her waning years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the divergent sensibilities of this modest ex-journalist and the infamous 
member of the Gang of Four somehow complement each other. The proof opens at 
San Diego's Old Globe Theatre on Saturday, the third anniversary of the 
reported date of Jiang Qing's death. Kim Miyori performs the title role, 
directed by Seret Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Ong first wrote "Madame Mao's Memories" in 1984, yet he has continued to 
refine the text over the years, up to and including his work for this new 
staging. Chalk it up to a longstanding interest in biography and a fascination 
with the life of his inherently dramatic subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ong's perseverance also points to a notion of history that's at odds with 
the trendy revisionism of Oliver Stone and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to be faithful to what I see as the facts; I don't want to 
create a 'Madama Mao,' " he said, alluding to Puccini's "Madama Butterfly." 
"I'm not saying that this is the ultimate version, but there's an evolution in 
understanding someone. If you spend time, you see more layers to a person. I 
don't know if there will ever be a time when I say, 'This is Madame Mao.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ong first became interested in Madame Mao during one of his periods of 
journalistic unemployment. He was taking one of his characteristic strolls 
through the biography section of a library when Ong came upon a book about 
Madame Mao. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I opened this biography, the first line I saw was 'Let me dissect myself 
before you,' " he says. "This is what she said to the historian, Roxane Witke, 
who went to China to do research about women in China and found herself being 
summoned by Jiang Qing. I was struck by that one sentence. It doesn't seem like 
normal conversation. It was more like something she rehearsed in her mind." 
</P>
<P>
 So taken was Ong with the prospect of Madame Mao as a topic that he decided to 
buck his own insecurities and try his hand at a new type of writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had that self-doubt," he says. "I don't really have the background 
to write plays. I didn't go to school to study theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, having the courage to admit a secret desire to write seems audacious. I 
could just see the scorn on people's faces -- 'You want to be a playwright? 
Everybody wants to be a playwright.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Ong began to work on a play. At first he envisioned it, perhaps 
even as a film, with the proverbial cast of thousands. He also toyed with the 
notion of making it a musical, a la "Evita." Yet Ong ultimately settled on a 
one-person drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madame Mao's Memories" features an older Jiang Qing in her prison cell, 
flashing back on the many and varied scenes in her life, including the 1970s 
trial of the Gang of Four. 
</P>
<P>
 The many shifts in time mean that Miyori has her task cut out for her. "The 
central challenge is to make it all of a piece," the actress says. "The time 
jumps can be disconcerting. The clarity has to be there immediately in the 
first seconds of a scene, so that it's clear what time in her life it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jiang Qing was born into a peasant family in 1914 and went on to train at the 
Shandong Experimental Arts Academy and to pursue an acting career. She married 
Mao in 1939, 10 years before he became chairman, and is remembered most for 
leading the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a life with which someone like Ong would have an obvious connection 
-- he was born and raised in Singapore and graduated from the University of 
Singapore with a degree in biology. "My parents wanted me to be a doctor and I 
had to prove to them I could do it," he recalls. "I hated every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the biology degree helped Ong land a scholarship to study 
agricultural journalism at Iowa State University, where he supported himself by 
writing about 4-H projects, cattle raising and similar topics. 
</P>
<P>
 His master's thesis explored the relationship between journalism and 
biography, partly through a biography of his own grandfather, a colorful figure 
who practiced a number of religions before launching the first Bahai movement 
in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation in 1979, Ong went on to pursue both journalism and biography, 
although journalism came first, if only because there were bills to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Ong, who gives his age only as "early 40s," came to California in 1979 to look 
for a job. He worked for a small newspaper called the Cerritos Sun for two 
years before getting his green card and, after it folded, worked for Southern 
California Electronic News and then World Dredging in Long Beach. "I can't even 
remember some of these papers that I worked for," he says. "They either fold or 
they don't have enough money to pay you." 
</P>
<P>
 He also did a stint as editor of AsiAm magazine in L.A. "It's a constant 
struggle," he says. His last journalism gig was in 1989, as a writer and editor 
at the City Press, a Hollywood paper that went under after a year and half. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first began writing "Madame Mao's Memories" in between journalism 
jobs, Ong knew it was an ambitious project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finished it in a very secretive way, writing when I could," he says. "And 
when I finished the first draft, I was afraid to show it to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he did submit the work to 10 Los Angeles theaters. Nine months went 
by before "Madame Mao's Memories" received a reading at the Cast Theatre in 
1988. Yet the play, which has since been published by Three Continents Press, 
didn't premiere until October, 1989, when it was staged in Theatre/Theater's 
24-seat second stage, starring Miyori and directed by Robin McKee. 
</P>
<P>
 That critically successful production ran for six months (a long run by L.A. 
small-theater standards) before moving to San Francisco's Asian American 
Theater. The play was also later staged in 1990 at Chicago's Bailiwick Theater 
and at Singapore's Theatreworks, in 1991 at London's Latchmere Theatre and in 
1992 at the Edinburgh Festival. Last year, it was seen at the Telluride Theatre 
Festival in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Ong saw all of these productions and, although he was not able to participate 
in the rehearsal processes of any of them, found the experience invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a revelation to see how a script can be interpreted in different 
ways," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The London production was stark, very British in a way." Madame Mao was 
played by Tsai Chin ("The Joy Luck Club"), whose parents were killed during the 
Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Singapore, they had these red metal tubs that were half-filled with water 
surrounding the stage," Ong says. "Every now and then she would play with the 
water. I didn't understand the symbolism, but it was interesting. In Chicago, 
they had a white woman (Catherine Martineu, who died in 1991) play Madame Mao." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, "Madame Mao's Memories" returned to L.A. for a performance for 
at-risk students, funded by a City Cultural Affairs Department grant at 
Occidental College's Keck Theatre. The grant also supported Ong's retooling of 
the script in a workshop with Miyori and McKee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original production was really more of a sketch than anything else and 
there were layers to Madame Mao that I wanted to explore," Ong says. "Also, all 
of a sudden we were in a 400-seat theater, so we had to revamp the show. It 
became more abstract, and in a way I lost that intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes that will bow in the Old Globe production, however, will be more 
substantive than any earlier ones. "It's going to be very different from the 
original, closer to what I originally saw," Ong says. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes have been added, including one meant to show Madame Mao's feelings of 
betrayal as she languished in a Russian hospital, after being effectively 
discarded by Mao. "There's a lot more we could add," Ong says. "But you have to 
draw the line somewhere, or else it will be a history lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Another pivotal new scene brings into focus the main change between this and 
previous versions of "Madame Mao's Memories," most of which were staged on 
shoestring budgets. It is what Ong calls Madame Mao's "modus operandi," her use 
of sexuality as a means to power. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although known chiefly as one of the implementers of a bloody and excessive 
social upheaval that resulted in countless deaths and imprisonments, Madame Mao 
is also legendary for having had many lovers, some of whom were considerably 
younger than she was. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I read about Madame Mao and thought about it, the more I found out 
that her way of gaining power -- and power seems to be the main focus in her 
life -- was through sex," Ong says. "Basically, she used sex. She made no bones 
about it. As the script developed, this sexual aspect came into focus." 
</P>
<P>
 "When she wanted to gain membership into the Communist Party (in 1933), there 
were hints that she actually used sex to meet different people so that she 
could become a member," Ong says. "Of course with Mao, it was sexual. And when 
she came to power, sex became an expression of that power." 
</P>
<P>
 Mao eventually lost interest in Jiang Qing sexually. Yet she was able to wield 
power of her own, using the leader's weakened state in the wake of the failure 
of the Great Leap Forward against him. When Mao died in 1976, Madame Mao and 
three of her collaborators were put in prison. She died there in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is a complex legacy that provides an actor with much food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was perhaps more forgiving initially," Miyori says of how her attitude 
toward her character has changed since 1989. "It's still what I call a woman's 
play, about women's politics. But despite the politics and oppression that 
women experienced during that time in China, it's clear that she was an 
opportunist." 
</P>
<P>
 The more Miyori has worked on Madame Mao, the more morally ambiguous her 
subject has begun to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, I justified her motives more as being those of a woman who had 
been betrayed by Mao, but I think it's a much larger story," she says. "There's 
a big question as to how much she really believed in communism." 
</P>
<P>
 Another new aspect of the Globe production is an increased stylization. Not 
only are there now costume changes, but there is an added element of Chinese 
opera pageantry as well. Jamie H. J. Guan, a Peking Opera specialist who worked 
with Madame Mao's opera troupe during the Cultural Revolution, has 
choreographed movements for Miyori. 
</P>
<P>
 Guan also has proved to be a source of some unusual firsthand anecdotes about 
Madame Mao. He has, for instance, told Ong and others of Madame Mao's 
fascination with Hollywood movies, particularly those of Greta Garbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she wanted to reward her opera performers, she would have them into an 
auditorium to watch movies," says Ong, reporting Guan's stories. "One day, 
there was a hush-hush thing, and when they closed the door, what they saw was a 
porno movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they asked her why, she said: 'Don't ask questions, just open your 
lives. You must expose yourself to everything.' To me, that was very 
interesting that she would do something like that. Was it partly to shock 
people? I don't know. But it's very revealing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During Madame Mao's years in prison, the Chinese government did its best to 
keep her out of sight and mind. Yet Madame Mao, who once sought out a 
biographer to present her story to the West, was reportedly eager to be 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is therefore poignant that a Chinese American writer such as Ong would be 
the one to bring her story to the stage, and he has remained humbled by the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first wrote 'Madame Mao,' I was terrified because I don't speak 
Chinese," Ong recalls. "I'm not a scholar of Chinese history. I was terrified 
that someone would come and say, 'You got everything wrong, she's not like that 
at all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miyori, who has continued to research her character, shares Ong's passion for 
authenticity. But she's also concerned about making compelling theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be harnessed by making everything authentic," she says. "It 
could limit the imagination when you're trying to tell a story. But it's also a 
disservice not to be as accurate as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "There is properly no history, only 
biography," Ong is certainly doing history a service by telling Madame Mao's 
tale. And that's particularly true since the playwright won't bend the facts to 
accommodate the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ong seeks to strike a delicate balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play is lending a voice, whether or not it's a complete picture of Madame 
Mao," Ong says. "If someone can say it's all wrong, that would be helpful to 
me. I'm very concerned."*

HANGING OUT ON THE FRINGE; FOR MORE THAN A DECADE SONIC YOUTH'S KIM GORDON AND 
THURSTON MOORE HAVE BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO ALTERNATIVE-ROCKERS. WITH ITS NEW 
'JET SET' ALBUM, THE BAND STILL REVELS IN THE SPIRIT AND ENERGY OF THE INDIE 
SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the frequent irreverence of the music of Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore 
with Sonic Youth, the last thing you'd expect in the slot next to their buzzer 
in the lobby of a SoHo apartment building would be their own names. 
</P>
<P>
 If not left blank to throw off cult enthusiasts of these revered underground 
rockers, you'd imagine a wisecrack along the lines of buzz off , or maybe a 
play on the band's oddball album titles -- something like Evol Goo . 
</P>
<P>
 But it's just their names: K. Gordon/T. Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the couple is home this afternoon to answer the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another 20 minutes before Gordon and Moore arrive from separate 
directions, both loaded down with shopping bags and wearing heavy coats to 
protect themselves from the chill. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all apologies as they head up the stairs, explaining that they each 
thought the other would be back in time to answer the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside their spacious, fifth-floor loft, Gordon heads to the kitchen to make a 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Moore checks the answering machine for 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 All this -- from the real names on the board to the late arrival -- is typical 
of the surprisingly down-to-Earth approach of a married couple that for a 
decade has been viewed as the heart of the alternative/college rock scene. It's 
a scene that, thanks to the success of Nirvana and others, has emerged in the 
'90s as the new commercial mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have Sonic Youth's striking guitar explorations influenced a 
generation of musicians, but its strict adherence to high artistic standards 
rather than commercial compromises has also made the quartet a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 A chief reason Nirvana chose Geffen Records when it moved up to major-label 
status in 1990 was that Sonic Youth was already at Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Moore are in an upbeat mood. Sonic Youth's new album, "Experimental 
Jet Set, Trash and No Star," is due in the stores Tuesday, and they're pleased 
with its raw sound. (See review, Page 56.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the personal side, the couple are expecting their first child in June -- 
which leaves their fall touring plans up in the air. If they do hit the road, 
Gordon says, they'll bring the baby along. 
</P>
<P>
 The only topic, in fact, that draws a groan is whether the band, whose first 
two Geffen albums sold about 200,000 and 300,000 copies respectively, has felt 
any pressure to begin matching the multimillion sales of some of the bands that 
cite them as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 If R.E.M. stands as one of the key stories in post-'70s rock for the way it 
has maintained its quality and integrity in the face of explosive sales and MTV 
exposure in recent years, Sonic Youth is an equally noteworthy example of a 
band that has stood by its principles despite what some would call even greater 
pressure: the lack of that commercial breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the unfortunate things about the success of so-called alternative 
music is sales has suddenly become a big issue to people," says Gordon, sitting 
at a big wooden table with her sandwich. "The issue is no longer, 'Is the music 
interesting or good?' More and more you have people asking, 'Well, how many 
records have you sold?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to let it get to you and start measuring what you do by sales. But 
we've never been tempted by that. We are really into it for the history more 
than the money -- and that's something money can't buy. That might sound 
pretentious, but that's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much as the rock quartet X stood as the symbol of West Coast rock integrity in 
the '80s, Sonic Youth served as leaders of a corresponding wing of East Coast 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't a lot in common in the music the groups made -- X mixed poetic 
tales of urban tension with a sparking, highly accessible rockabilly inspired 
punk backdrop, where Sonic Youth relied on a dissonant guitar experimentation 
as much as lyrics to express its own aspirations and doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 What linked the bands, however, was a recognition of the bankruptcy of 
mainstream rock at the time. The bands stood at the forefront of the first 
generation of American groups whose goal was not to make the charts, but to 
simply make music that was honest and original. 
</P>
<P>
 It was revolutionary because most of the great American groups from the '60s 
and early '70s -- from the Beach Boys to Creedence Clearwater Revival -- had 
always believed that one of the measures of great music was sales. After all, 
everyone from Elvis to the Beatles and the Stones had hits . 
</P>
<P>
 But the pop machinery changed in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no longer underground radio on a mass scale, and mainstream radio 
was closed to daring sounds. The emphasis was on conformity, not change -- 
reassurance, not aggression. By the time the punk movement arrived in 1977, 
stations were championing Journey and Styx, not the Sex Pistols and the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Moore were part of a generation of rock fans who sought out the 
punk heroes and eventually created their own scene -- independent of both radio 
and the mainstream record Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the loft, however, singer-guitarist Moore smiles when asked to cite 
his earliest pop influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it was either the Beatles or the Monkees," he says, again exhibiting 
his own lack of pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how history places a judgment on records and acts -- the Beatles 
are a serious pop group, the Monkees are just like a fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not like that when you are a kid and you are just starting to listen 
to the radio. I remember way back sitting around with some friends trying to 
figure out which group was more important to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some sided with the Beatles because they had more hits or whatever, but some 
sided with the Monkees because they were a little fresher on the scene at the 
time. And I'm sure it must be the same today. Some kids probably look at 
Nirvana and, say, Stone Temple Pilots as being equal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who is in his mid-30s, has more in common with R.E.M.'s Peter Buck than 
the fact they are both lanky guitarists. They are also obsessive music fans, as 
quick to talk about other bands as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it's impossible to visit Buck's house without spending half an hour 
looking through his beloved record library, there are record shelves everywhere 
you turn in Gordon and Moore's loft -- in the office sanctuary next to the 
kitchen and behind the couches in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll spend 15 minutes just talking about his 8-track cartridge collection -- 
and how really obsessed some of his pals are about the old, disgraced album 
configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 This enthusiasm has led him to be active as a musician and producer in various 
side projects. The same goes for Gordon, who produced the first album by 
Courtney Love's band, Hole (Sonic Youth's lead guitarist Lee Ranaldo produced 
the latest album by Love's rival/counterpart Babes in Toyland.) 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Coral Gables, Fla., Moore moved with his family in the early '70s to 
Connecticut, where he got into music seriously while in high school. He even 
put out a record on New Alliance Records with a group called the Coachmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In his late teens, Moore became intrigued by the punk/art scene in New York 
and started going there to such clubs as CBGB as soon as he had a driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to read Rock Scene magazine and see all these pictures of people just 
hanging out at these clubs," he recalls. "It was really the most influential 
thing for me and a lot of people my age on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "That magazine really spread the word that the underground scene was much 
cooler than the big arena-rock scene, which looked kind of like a whole other 
world . . . one you could never get into and which looked kinda stupid anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many young musicians who fell under the spell of punk, Moore didn't 
want to start a hard-core group. He was drawn to the Sex Pistols' ideal of 
creating a new form of rock 'n' roll -- not the Pistols' hard-core sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember (the Sex Pistols') John Lydon saying, 'We want to see more bands 
like us' . . . and a lot of people took him at his word and started bands like 
the Sex Pistols," he says. "But later he said he never meant more bands that 
sounded like the Pistols. He wanted to see more bands with the Pistols' 
attitude . . . bands that would take the music in new directions." 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit, Moore was more influenced by Lydon's next band, Public Image 
Ltd., and by the experimental sounds of Glenn Branca, a visionary New York 
composer-guitarist who was big on the New York scene at the time, than by the 
music of the Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Gordon, who is now in her early 40s, was also looking for 
something original in music. She grew up in Los Angeles, where she graduated 
from University High School. As a teen she listened a lot to classic acts, such 
as Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, then began turning increasingly to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 But art was her main interest, and she moved to Toronto in the late '70s to 
attend art school. After a year, Gordon moved to New York, where she saw one of 
Branca's bands and began thinking about switching to music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music offered the kind of emotional outlet that I didn't find in art," says 
Gordon, who plays bass and sings in the group. "Art was difficult for me 
because I felt restrained . . . maybe because I had studied it so much and knew 
all these rules. Music was something I knew nothing about so it was easier for 
me to be intuitive and free about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Gordon met on the scene and started Sonic Youth in 1981 with 
guitarist Lee Ranaldo (the band now also includes drummer Steve Shelley). The 
group made a series of highly acclaimed independent-label albums, then moved up 
to Geffen Records' DGC label in 1990, where its work continued to be hailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gersh, who signed the band at DGC and is now president of Capitol 
Records, calls Sonic Youth one of the most important American rock bands of the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe history will look back on Sonic Youth as a band that was as 
important musically as the Rolling Stones were in their day and time," he says. 
"They are a natural extension of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands that came 
before it -- unpretentious, not easily categorized and constantly changing 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After spending two months in the studio polishing their last album, 1992's 
"Dirty," Sonic Youth wanted the new collection to be more spontaneous and 
natural. So they recorded it in just a couple of weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 The result is a fresh and striking collection that is receiving the fastest 
radio acceptance ever for a Sonic Youth album, according to Geffen Records. 
"Bull in the Heather," a track from the album, is already being played on KROQ 
and other key alternative-rock stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gordon and Moore don't want to get caught up in the numbers game after all 
these years. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they still don't feel the pressure to break through to Nirvana- or 
Pearl Jam-like sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel we have to live up to anything," Moore says, looking across the 
table at his wife. "In fact, sometimes I think it's almost like we have to live 
down to what's going on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a million bands out there totally off the edge, experimental . . . 
bands who are just putting out 7-inch singles in mom-and-pop retail stores. 
That's the scene where I turn for inspiration because there's all this frenzy. 
We still want to take chances . . . push ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the main reasons we did this festival tour of England last 
summer where we didn't play anything except for stuff we wrote a week before we 
went on the road. I'm sure a lot of bands look at that and think it's a crazy 
thing to do, but there are others who'll understand perfectly -- and they're 
the ones we feel close to."*

COVER STORY; SORCERER'S APPRENTICE NO MORE; DAVID COPPERFIELD, AT 37, COMES 
INTO HIS OWN AS A MASTER OF ILLUSION; HE HAS A 15-YEAR CBS RETROSPECTIVE 
THURSDAY AND A NEW JET-SET STATUS WITH HIS ENGAGEMENT TO MODEL CLAUDIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not far from the madding crowds pushing their luck on casino slot machines and 
keno here is a large industrial warehouse with an unbelievably clean floor. The 
outside of the pink building describes it as a bra and girdle establishment, 
but the interior is filled with various large implements of destruction that 
have nothing to do with underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the center stands a massive Death Saw, its silver blades bearing no 
evidence of the man it has severed in half numerous times. Close by is a bed of 
tall, uninviting spikes that once sat hungrily under the same man as he dangled 
precariously above from burning ropes. A glass case contains a 500-pound spike 
that could pierce a person in two. 
</P>
<P>
 All around the warehouse, as if warily watching all comers, are the brooding 
eyes of David Copperfield, their hypnotic gaze topped by impossibly dense 
eyebrows as they stare from large billboards and posters advertising "The Magic 
of David Copperfield." The facility is the disguised headquarters where the 
magic profession's most prominent practitioner keeps his more elaborate 
illusions and a secluded bachelor lair for the rare occasions when he isn't on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more eerie are the two rooms hidden in the bowels of the warehouse that 
are filled with the ghosts of wizards and conjurers past: Harry Houdini's 
Metamorphosis trunk, the first trunk ever used in the illusion of 
disappearances. The Chung Ling Soo rifle, believed to be the weapon used when 
the Chinese magician performed his famous bullet-catching trick one too many 
times. Dante's Spirit Cabinet. Maskelyne's Decapitated Princess Chair. Orson 
Welles' Buzzsaw Illusions. Hundreds of ancient volumes of witchcraft and magic. 
</P>
<P>
 In these rooms of mysteries and nightmares, David Copperfield finds solace and 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and come in here, and I feel 
all right," the master magician said quietly, sitting in a chair amid the 
priceless collection. "I don't feel like it's ghostly. In fact, it's a rather 
peaceful place. And it makes me feel peaceful knowing I've carried on the 
tradition of the people here, and that I've become a part of a very rich 
tapestry of artists who deserve a lot of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, several magicians honored in the rooms -- Channing Pollock, Jack 
Kodell, Norm Nielsen -- wandered with wide-eyed admiration through the 
collection, known as the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Copperfield calls it the world's largest repository of antiquarian books, 
magic, illusion and other works on magic. He bought much of it in 1991 from the 
Resolution Trust Corp., an agency appointed to clean up the nation's 
savings-and-loan debacle by selling some of the failed thrift companies' 
assets. The collection had been formed by Carl M. Rheuban, an amateur magician 
and former chairman of the now-defunct First Network Savings in Los Angeles. 
(The exhibits can be viewed only by guests of Copperfield and are not open to 
the public.) 
</P>
<P>
 While Pollock, Kodell and Nielsen, elder statesmen in the world of magic, 
marveled at the artifacts, it was clear from the chatty enthusiasm toward their 
host that they not only value Copperfield's respect for their craft but also 
are in awe that this 37-year-old multimillionaire with sculpted cheekbones, 
matinee-idol looks and a tan that would turn George Hamilton brown with envy 
has elevated magic to a mainstream popularity they never dreamed possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Copperfield is the king," said Pollock, who used to produce doves out of 
nowhere in his appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show." "He's reached a much 
wider audience than any of us combined. I've never seen a magician that is so 
universally loved." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, no other magician has hosted high-rated annual network specials for 15 
years, the latest of which is a retrospective, "David Copperfield -- 15 Years 
of Magic," airing Thursday at 8 p.m. on CBS. Or has made the Statue of Liberty, 
an airplane and a 70-ton train car from the Orient Express vanish in front of a 
live television audience. Or has escaped from an imploding building to appear 
moments later nearby in the middle of a solid sheet of steel. Or has appeared 
on the cover of Forbes as one of the world's richest entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while prominent magicians such as the self-proclaimed "bad boys of magic," 
Penn & Teller, and the Las Vegas magic kings Siegfried & Roy have their own set 
of impressive tricks up their sleeves, even they have never accomplished what 
many consider to be Copperfield's greatest feat, the trick that has gotten him 
a higher profile than any of his other spectacular illusions: getting engaged 
to German super-model Claudia Schiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupling propelled Copperfield instantly into jet-set status: He was a 
recent cover boy for Esquire (along with veteran cover girl Schiffer, of 
course), and they have been photographed at the Academy Awards and many other 
paparazzi -heavy happenings. He presented an award Wednesday to singer Gloria 
Estefan at the World Music Awards in Monaco after performing 12 sold-out shows 
at the Fox Theatre in Detroit. In Monaco, he stayed with Schiffer at her home 
there as he filmed promos for an extensive European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 His engagement also has made him the butt of jokes, as evidenced by a comic 
sonata a few weeks ago by the "Saturday Night Live" character Operaman: 
</P>
<P>
 "Copperfield, Coppa-feelo. Operaman no comprendo. Il Dorko has hot 
girlfriend-o." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you mean that joke on 'Saturday Night Dead'?" Copperfield retorted when 
asked about the barb. "I don't really mind. It's not like that show has a whole 
lot of viewers anyway. And when you're going out with the most beautiful girl 
in the world, there are some guys who are going to take shots at you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it's not the higher visibility but the magic that matters to 
Copperfield. He seems to be vying for the title of "the hardest-working 
magician in show business," playing more than 500 shows a year all over the 
world in addition to putting together his television specials. He wants not 
only to amaze the audience and overcome their preconceptions of what magic is 
but also to arouse them, make them fear for him, appreciate the art, even move 
them to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of magic and think of their uncle doing bad card tricks," 
Copperfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to see my work to respect it." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. "But you go to any Broadway show -- 'Phantom,' 'Les Miserables' -- 
and then come straight to my show, and, I'll be real cocky right now, my show 
will make you cry just like 'Les Miz.' My show will make you laugh more than 
'Les Miz,' " he said, adding the last comment with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to involve audiences, make them feel for me. I want to make my shows 
romantic and passionate. It's a theatrical experience. Magic can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few hours after escorting the magicians through the archives, 
Copperfield pops up before an enthusiastic sold-out Caesars Palace audience to 
perform his brand of very theatrical magic. The show, titled "Beyond 
Imagination," contains elements that might make many a more traditional 
magician want to pull a hat over him. Influenced by the showmanship of his 
idols -- Gene Kelly, Walt Disney, Fred Astaire, Steven Spielberg -- Copperfield 
fills the performance with large-scale effects like a major rock concert: 
chest-pounding music by Genesis and other artists, blinking lights, posing and 
dancing, elaborate special effects, slinky female assistants who eagerly wrap 
their taut bodies around Copperfield's lean physique and rub him suggestively. 
</P>
<P>
 During a variation on Houdini's Metamorphosis trick, even a subtle touch of 
S&M enters the mix, as one of the assistants binds Copperfield in a silky, 
cocoon-like enclosure, looking at him lovingly as she ties his wrists. The 
cocoon lifts off the platform and the woman quickly lifts a sheet in front of 
her. Then a shattering boom, the sheet comes down and Copperfield is standing 
where the woman had been. The cocoon is uncovered and the woman stands smiling, 
bound at the wrists. The audience, composed of both the MTV crowd and older 
out-of-towners, goes wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the viewers cheering the loudest are a couple sitting near the middle of 
the showroom who have seen Copperfield perform hundreds of times. They bounce 
to the ear-pounding music, laugh at his every joke and marvel at each trick as 
if they were seeing it for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Copperfield's parents, Hy and Rebecca Kotkin. Hy Kotkin runs his 
son's fan club, David Copperfield International, which publishes a quarterly 
newsletter, "Backstage With David." 
</P>
<P>
 "We never get tired of seeing him," said Rebecca Kotkin, shouting to be heard 
above the din. "We see it through other people's eyes. We like to see how 
everyone responds to him. But don't ask me how he does this stuff. I don't know 
and I don't want to know. I just want to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the show progressed, Copperfield paraded through his various personas -- a 
sensual sorcerer, a charming flirt who enjoys bantering with women in the 
audience, a storefront magician who still has his sleight-of-hand chops and can 
conjure a real red rose out of a paper rose with a snap of his fingers and a 
burst of flame, and the innocent, adolescent only child from Metuchen, N.J., 
named David Kotkin, who dreamed of escaping his loneliness and insecurities by 
flying like a bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of "Beyond Imagination," Copperfield lives his dream: He flies, 
apparently without the aid of strings or wires. He glides back and forth across 
the stage, turns a graceful roll in midair, flies in a large plastic case that 
has a lid on top. He even takes a female audience member up in the air with 
him, playing Superman to her unwitting Lois Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying also marks the big finale for this week's TV special, which co-stars 
Schiffer as a miniskirted reporter who stumbles across Copperfield in a 
fictional studio/warehouse. After showing clips from his previous specials, 
Copperfield escorts Schiffer to high atop the building, where he lifts her in 
his arms and they fly off. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls flying his most difficult illusion, explaining that it took seven 
years of training to perfect. Other tricks -- such as the Fires of Passion, in 
which he escapes from a straitjacket while dangling from burning ropes 100 feet 
above a bed of flaming spikes -- took a year of training. "I would go out after 
my shows and just work on getting it down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the big set pieces for which Copperfield is most famous: making the 
Statue of Liberty disappear, walking through the Great Wall of China, plunging 
over Niagara Falls, levitating across the Grand Canyon. His trademark is 
proving that all the tricks are done live in front of spectators at the scene 
and the television audience without camera cutaways or gimmicks. Many of those 
clips are repeated in the CBS special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing a lot of smaller-scale, emotional things on my specials, then I 
decided to do something a little different on my earlier specials and made a 
car and airplane disappear," Copperfield recalled. "All of a sudden I got all 
this added attention. Those big tricks became the illusions that I could hang 
my hat on. But I found that bigger isn't necessarily better. My whole show now 
is based around flying, which is a big emotional thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extravagant scale of his illusions -- "Beyond Imagination" costs 
millions, and Copperfield's elaborate sets and props require a separate jumbo 
jet to transport -- touching the audience emotionally remains a primary goal of 
Copperfield's magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for the audience to put themselves in my position," 
Copperfield said as he relaxed backstage following one of his Caesars Palace 
shows. "Every three years or so, I put myself in a dangerous spot. Through it, 
I -- and they -- can see that they can conquer fear, conquer panic. I want to 
take the audience with me. When I fly, hopefully they're flying with me. I try 
to be every man and woman so that the audience can live through me." 
</P>
<P>
 Copperfield still appears driven to the point where it seems his greatest 
trick is finding time to sleep. While on the road, he often performs as many as 
three shows a day. In one recent stretch, he spent Wednesday filming 
commercials all day at the warehouse for his upcoming TV special, performed 
"Beyond Imagination" at Caesars that night and then was driven to Los Angeles 
immediately afterward so that he could spend Thursday editing the TV program. 
He flew to Las Vegas that evening for "Beyond Imagination," then did a media 
interview after the show, which ended at 2 a.m. He did interviews with "CBS 
This Morning" and other reporters a few hours later Friday. Then there were two 
more shows that night, and two on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents said their son's frenzied pace is no surprise to them. The couple, 
who now reside in San Diego, recalled how the young David Kotkin used to 
entertain himself. "He was always very precocious, looking for things and small 
magic tricks to do with his hands," said Hy Kotkin. He was performing 
professionally at age 12. By 16, he was teaching magic at New York University. 
He took the name David Copperfield when he was cast in a Chicago musical, "The 
Magic Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the hectic work schedule and lifestyle, Copperfield said he keeps 
trying to top himself. "Many magicians work their whole lives trying to get 15 
minutes of material, but I have to come up with a new hour of material every 
year for my TV special," he said. "It's like my record album. It forces me to 
come up with new stuff. I don't really have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tortorici, president of CBS Entertainment, described Copperfield as "the 
ultimate showman. You can't be a master illusionist without having every 
possible detail taken care of. He has that undefinable something. You can't 
take your eyes off him." 
</P>
<P>
 Copperfield, however, is keenly aware that more eyes are on him these days 
because of his relationship with Schiffer. He says the added attention doesn't 
bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this is a problem -- although it is sometimes inconvenient," he said. 
"I mean, that's why they call it a private life -- because it is supposed to be 
private. I've always had a girlfriend over the years, but it was always kept 
quiet. I never went to premieres. I was always working. Maybe because I kept my 
lifestyle private for so many years, I didn't appear on as many magazines. But 
my ratings were never a problem, and my ticket sales were never a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, when the woman you become engaged to is on the cover of every 
magazine around and is the most beautiful woman in the world, people are 
naturally interested. So it's a new concept for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not dismayed that discussion of his magic disappears in the media 
spotlight: "If you go to the magazine stands and see all the articles about 
actors and actresses, about 10% of the story is about the art of acting, and 
about 90% is about who they're married to, who they're dating, who they're 
breaking up with. It's rarely about the work, and mostly about the lifestyle. I 
just have to keep it all in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Copperfield met Schiffer last year during a tour of Germany that was 
front-page news in newspapers around the country before he played a single 
performance. He picked her out of the audience at a gala performance for a 
trick in which he "predicts" what kind of graffiti audience members will write 
on a wall. When the pair started dating, the German media reacted with a 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has wealth, fame, security and "the most beautiful girl in the 
world," Copperfield stressed that his life will not change all that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will slow down a little, but I love doing what I do and will not change all 
that drastically," he said. "Also, my fiancee loves what she is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 How about having a family? "I hope so," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When off stage, Copperfield can seem distant and, some say, aloof. Performing 
seems to be the aspect of his life in which he finds most comfort. "It's really 
my sanctuary," he said in explaining why he keeps up such a relentless touring 
schedule. "I love interacting with the audience. It's different each night." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a television retrospective at age 37 is a bit unnerving: "It was the 
furthest thing from my mind. I'm always looking forward, so it's strange to 
look back -- especially at some of the haircuts I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more spectacular magic is in store, he said. "I want to straighten the 
Tower of Pisa. I want to make the moon disappear. I want to put a woman's face 
on Mount Rushmore." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as he stands up, ending the backstage interview, Copperfield knows he has 
many more performances of "Beyond Imagination" to do before undertaking his 
next spectacular trick. No more time for talking. Time to fly.*

IT'S ALL ABOUT QUALITY CONTROL; ROBERT ALTMAN AND STEVEN SODERBERGH WON'T MAKE 
A MOVIE THESE DAYS WITHOUT PETER GALLAGHER, BUT THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE FOR 
THIS ACTOR

 It's probably Mozart, some acoustical footnote to the name -- Cafe Mozart -- 
but just the overture for Peter Gallagher. He's run in, a little breathless, to 
grab a sandwich at this neighborhood cafe on the Upper West Side, but the 
canned piano stops him dead. Even before he reaches his favorite corner table, 
he turns, cocks his head and segues into unprompted melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soon the talking stopped and we listened. And wept. And realized what was the 
point of going on with the interview because we'd be dead anyway, in the next 
30 or 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher drops his backpack to the table with a thud and sinks into a chair, 
smiling rather blissfully for an actor who up until recently had a hard time 
getting anyone to take him seriously, musical accompaniments notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a stage-trained performer, an accomplished song-and-dance man, who had 
done all those Broadway shows, big musicals like "Hair" and "Grease," even 
plays with major-league directors -- "A Doll's Life," with Hal Prince; "The 
Real Thing," for Mike Nichols and "Long's Day Journey Into Night," directed by 
Britain's Jonathan Miller. He had earned good notices, a few awards, even a 
Tony nomination, but none of it seemed to matter in Hollywood, where 
Gallagher's name was tainted by his far less impressive foray into film more 
than a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Taylor Hackford's 1980 drama "The Idolmaker," Gallagher played a 
Fabian-like rock star, replete with chest-hair waxings and an overdose of 
publicity for the then-25-year-old newcomer with the Elvis Presley pout. 
"Caesare is coming" screamed the posters plastered with Gallagher's smoldering, 
dark-browed features. Coming and going was more like it; the film disappeared 
with embarrassing speed, nearly capsizing the actor's fledgling film career. 
Two years later, when he played an equally depilated member of a menage-a-trois 
in Randal Kleiser's short-lived "Summer Lovers," Gallagher thought he would 
never work again. 
</P>
<P>
 It was "that classic pretty boy thing," as director Robert Altman recalls, 
that can kill a serious actor's career. "I'd get amazing reviews in Broadway 
shows and then I wouldn't have an audition for a year," says Gallagher. "So 
you'd start to think, 'Yeah, I guess there is no market for people with big 
lips and fat eyebrows.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That the 38-year-old actor with the strikingly Byronic features has struggled 
back from that inauspicious beginning to remain one of Broadway's more viable 
members while landing some of Hollywood's plummiest character roles says as 
much about the peculiar nature of success as it does about Gallagher's own 
talents and persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he still does not head many producers' A-lists, Gallagher has shed 
that earlier stigma to become one of the more respected and busier characters 
working, in demand for a variety of film, television and theater projects. 
Recent high-profile appearances include "Mother's Boys," an erotic thriller 
co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis, and Joel and Ethan Coen's "The Hudsucker Proxy," 
as well as an HBO movie, "White Mile," which airs later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also remains the actor of choice for a handful of acclaimed auteurs , most 
notably Altman, who has worked with the actor on "The Player" and "Short Cuts," 
and Steven Soderbergh, whose 1989 drama, "sex, lies, and videotape," marked 
Gallagher's first unqualified hit and whose next film, "The Underneath," was 
written for the actor.  
</P>
<P>
 "After 'sex, lies, and videotape,' I certainly saw more (scripts)," says 
Gallagher. But it's all about the long haul, when I started out, John Travolta 
was big and I got work because I had vaguely Italianate looks. Then that 
changed. I fully expect to have several careers, or chapters of careers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all end up in categories," adds Altman, who has said that he looks for a 
role for Gallagher in each of his films. "But Peter is a terrific actor, and 
very courageous because he plays a character regardless of their weakness or 
badness. He doesn't posture himself as a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is perhaps still best known to audiences for playing those 
protagonists whom Altman describes as "handsome, vain and sleazy" -- John 
Milaney, the cheating husband in "sex, lies, and videotape," Larry Levy, the 
back-stabbing studio executive in "The Player" and Stormy Weathers, the 
volatile helicopter pilot in "Short Cuts" -- Gallagher has amassed a fairly 
catholic range of roles on his resume. In addition to those earlier theater 
productions, Gallagher originated the role of Sky Masterson in the recent 
Broadway revival of "Guys and Dolls" -- and turned down starring roles in the 
Los Angeles production of "Sunset Boulevard" and the Stephen Sondheim musical 
"Passione." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mother's Boys," he plays the devoted father of three young sons, his first 
sympathetic leading man role to date. In Alan Rudolph's "Mrs. Parker," which is 
being shown at Cannes this month, he portrays Alan Campbell, the beleaguered 
alcoholic husband of writer Dorothy Parker, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. In 
"White Mile," he plays a naive advertising executive under the spell of a 
Machiavellian boss played by Alan Alda. And in "The Underneath," which will be 
released early next year, he portrays an older version of his "sex, lies, and 
videotape" persona, "a guy who's always gotten by on his looks and charm," as 
Soderbergh says, "but who now has to come to terms with that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm in every movie that's coming next year," Gallagher deadpans. "If you 
look carefully in crowd scenes, I'm there. It's like, 'Where's Waldo? Where's 
Gallagher?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And in "White Mile," Gallagher can be spotted clinging to a rubber raft 
careening down some of New Zealand's most challenging white-water rapids in a 
film, directed by Robert Butler from a script by Michael Butler, that Gallagher 
calls, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, "an allegory for the '80s." He plays a young 
advertising executive, the protege of particularly competitive CEO (Alda) who, 
in a story line strikingly similar to the annual raft trip hosted by Disney's 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, invites colleagues along on a treacherous white-water 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes this whole (expletive) contest that's all about ruthless ambition 
and the lack of responsibility," says Gallagher, adding wryly, "Of course my 
character is in conflict about his boss' motives." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Gallagher is weighing offers from several producers to star in a 
variety of comedies, which only recently he has begun to explore. "Peter is one 
of the smartest and funniest actors," says Soderbergh. "He's not a jokester, 
but makes characters funny in a dark way and by his (intended) lack of irony." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And sitting in this cafe just around the corner from the co-op he shares with 
his wife, Paula Harwood, an independent producer, and their two young children, 
Gallagher seems far more engaging and ingenuous -- not to mention being a 
devoted family man -- than his film roles might suggest. His darkly handsome 
looks, while striking testimony to his Irish-Catholic background, seem also to 
be mellowing, "deepening" as Soderbergh says. Mostly, his appearance serves as 
an ironic counterpoint to his unassuming breezy affability, a sanguinity born 
out of his experiences on Broadway and in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gallagher can be scathing about certain events. He doesn't hesitate 
to disparage several Broadway producers, including those of "Sunset Boulevard," 
who wanted him to star with Glenn Close during the production's Los Angeles 
run: "I couldn't afford to do it because they were offering $1,000 a month 
living expenses, and to hear Andrew Lloyd Webber cry poverty. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 He is also startlingly candid about the film industry, the paucity of 
well-written character parts, agents who make actors "feel like it's your fault 
that you haven't an audition for a year," and what he sees as the industry's 
prejudice against actors who, as he quips, "don't operate under the burden of 
wanting to be liked." Hollywood, he says simply, "rewards people who have the 
savvy or good fortune to have significant roles in successful movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Even "Mother's Boys," a film he concedes offered him the opportunity to play a 
more realistic role than most thrillers, was not his first choice when Harvey 
Weinstein, president of Miramax Films, the producers of "sex, lies, and 
videotape," first approached him about the work.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of problems with the script," Gallagher says, "but they made some 
changes and because they'd gotten into a little bit of a scheduling jam, I did 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he also shows a touching lack of ego. Despite his impressive Broadway 
credits, he insists he doesn't have "the musical chops" some actors do, and he 
jokes about being replaced in the workshop version of Sondheim's new musical, 
"Hey, lets get Mandy (Patinkin) because he sings higher." He refers to himself 
as "a late bloomer" and characterizes his career with a blithe "I don't think 
anything is going to help at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 And no amount of success, he adds, snapping open his wallet with its requisite 
photograph of his two children, a 3-year-old son and an infant daughter, "would 
make it worth (compromising) the life we're trying to build with our family. 
Yeah, I'd love to have bigger parts that give you more room to express 
yourself, but I really believe there is no formula and the truth is, I'm 
happiest when I'm just working well." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything characterizes Gallagher's approach to his craft it is his love of 
collaboration, fostered by his years in theater but less called upon in his 
film experiences. "Film can't really be successful unless it is the product of 
a single vision," he says, "but that vision can be expansive enough to include 
others at their fullest."  
</P>
<P>
 Soderbergh and Altman clearly agree. "I cast Peter in 'sex, lies, and 
videotape' because I needed an actor who was smart enough to flesh out the 
least well-written of the four characters," says Soderbergh. "I needed him to 
come up with good stuff and Peter had great ideas about how to make the husband 
more real, funnier and also darker." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Altman, with whom he first worked with on the 1988 TV movie "The Caine 
Mutiny Court-Martial," Gallagher describes the director "as almost painterly in 
his approach. He creates the environment where something might occur and gives 
you the freedom to go with it. It's why we all sing Bob's praises, because he 
loves actors -- his taste isn't market-based, it's very personal -- and he 
allows us to do our work." 
</P>
<P>
 As Soderbergh puts it, "Like most good actors, Peter is not afraid that the 
character reflects on him. He's not afraid to make them real jerks." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after Gallagher resuscitated his career from the pretty-boy label, he 
found himself pigeonholed again after "sex, lies, and videotape" was the 
surprise winner at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival -- a prejudice not helped by 
the producer's use of promotional material that included admiring quotes from 
reviewers for every performance but his. "Because I played the least 
sympathetic characters, I knew that people who weren't familiar with my work 
would say, 'Boy, he's an (expletive)! Next!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as Gallagher is quick to point out, there are bad guys and there are bad 
guys. "In most movies if you're not playing the lead, you're supposed to make 
sure audiences know who you are with just a few moments of screen time, and if 
you're the bad guy, you're supposed to spell it out in real obvious ways. But 
people aren't like that in real life. The most interesting bad guys are the 
ones you'd least expect." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest son of an outdoor advertising businessman -- "you know, 
billboards!" he laughs -- and a bacteriologist, Gallagher was raised in Armonk, 
N.Y., in a conservative Irish American family beset by many of the insecurities 
common to second-generation Americans. "We knew nothing of the world of show 
business," he recalls. "We didn't go to many movies and I think I was actually 
in a play before I saw one. I never really considered a career in show 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an interest in musical theater developed in high school and a summer 
studying voice at the New England Conservatory, Gallagher attended Tufts 
University in Boston where, at his father's urging, he obtained a degree in 
economics. He even spent a semester studying Marxist theory at UC-Berkeley. But 
theater eventually wooed him back. After spending three seasons working with 
the Boston Shakespeare Company, Gallagher moved back to New York and 
immediately began to work on Broadway, playing the starring role of Danny Zuko 
in "Grease" in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two decades later, Gallagher still finds that link to New York's 
theater community remains pivotal. It's the main reason why he refuses to 
settle in Los Angeles, where he sees actors "treated like poker chips," of 
differing value, and "where the only thing you can count on is that your value 
won't stay the same from week to week." 
</P>
<P>
 "New York is where I'm from and it helps remind me who I am when I'm here," he 
adds, looking around the cafe as if he were about to burst into song. "I just 
believe there is no way to anticipate the success of something. You only have 
control over what you do and choosing people to work with that have sympathetic 
points of view. If you do that, you can be enriched by the experience."*

 Chrissie Hynde is arguably the greatest female rock singer of the last 
decade-plus, but if you wanted to hear her in the last four years, you'd have 
to turn to such items as her performances on the Jimi Hendrix tribute album and 
at the Bob Dylan 30th-anniversary concert, and her one-time collaborations with 
such bands as INXS and Urge Overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been no new music from her group the Pretenders since the "packed!" 
album in 1990, and that collection was a pale shadow of the bright, aggressive 
sound that established the London-based band as one of rock's leading forces 
and made the feisty singer-guitarist a role model for female rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 That changes with the release Tuesday of "Last of the Independents" (see 
review, Page 60), an album that reunites Hynde, 42, with original Pretenders 
drummer Martin Chambers for the first time since the "Get Close" album in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independents" also introduces what Hynde says is a "real band," ending the 
revolving-door membership that's marked the Pretenders since the drug-related 
deaths of guitarist James Honeyman-Scott in 1982 and bassist Pete Farndon in 
1983. The new Pretenders are guitarist Adam Seymour (from the Katydids) and 
bassist Andy Hobson (ex-Primitives). 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohio-born Hynde, who has lived in London since the late '70s, has devoted 
her time between albums to those assorted collaborations and side projects, and 
to raising her two daughters -- an 11-year-old whose father is the Kinks' Ray 
Davies, and a 9-year-old by Hynde's ex-husband, rock singer Jim Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 With her enthusiasm renewed, she's looking forward to the upcoming Pretenders 
tour -- especially the shows in small clubs such as L.A.'s House of Blues, 
where the band will play on June 12. In an interview on the eve of the album's 
release, Hynde touched on such topics as women's place in rock and her 
ambivalence about stardom.

<P>
 Question: How do you feel about being held up as an inspiration for women in 
rock -- someone who blazed a trail? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think that's just gibberish really. That doesn't mean anything. 
Because I didn't blaze any trails. Women could do it, and they still can if 
they want. When I was a teen-ager we didn't have the term role model , but if I 
had any they were all men anyway. It was a musical endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think women face more obstacles in rock if they don't fulfill a 
traditional role or image? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know about other women, but myself personally I never had any 
problems. I think it was an advantage. I get to play with guys because I can 
sort of guest with them -- I mean think of all the duets I can do with guys 
where they need a woman. There aren't that many women rock singers. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't offer any competition to guys, so it's kind of good to have me around, 
I guess. I can play all right, but everyone's better than me -- there's no 
problem there. And I have a vision and I can make everyone sound great. So I'm 
an asset. But I've never felt there were any obstacles or that I've had to work 
harder. I mean, to tell you the truth, I think I've had to work a lot less than 
guys. Competition is stiff for them.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it difficult to have a fulfilling private life -- specifically raising 
children -- and meet the demands of a career? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, it's always difficult having a fulfilling private life. I don't 
really think of it as demands in my career. I mean, first of all I don't really 
think of it as a career. I'm not really trying to get to the top. I'm not 
trying to be a legend or be seen as an important musical voice in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think what I do is nearly as hard, to be honest, as most women who 
work and have kids. Friends of mine at the record company, they have to be at 
the office early in the morning and have to work late. I know people who don't 
get to see their kids that much even though they're living in the same house. 
</P>
<P>
 I think what happens to a lot of women who haven't had children is that they 
end up excelling and getting to the top of the tree, and then when they do 
decide to have children it becomes very awkward. Because really a woman's 
nature isn't to work that hard and be competitive and get to the top. She's 
much more into her life, not on a domestic level but an emotional level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How competitive are you in your career? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never had a commitment to this career. I just wanted to get in a band and 
do the business. Get onstage, play, make some records. So I got that. And ever 
since then that's worked out just fine, you know. I can just kind of tool along 
and do what I want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When those first albums became successful, didn't you think that this 
pinnacle was in your reach? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I didn't think like that. The pinnacle that was in my reach was when I 
finally got the band together, and everything after that was just the ride. I 
just wanted to be Chrissie Hynde in this bad-ass band. I never thought about 
Chrissie Hynde singer-songwriter -- and still don't. After two albums I didn't 
feel there was anything more or less to achieve. Just trying to stick to some 
kind of guns, you know, stay true to the vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you describe that vision? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well it's just my personal code of what a rock band should sound like. . . 
. There's like an intro to the song, there's a song, there's more often than 
not an ending. . . . A lot of people don't attend to those things. There's 
certain things I adhere to. Certain guitar sounds. When I say vision, it's just 
the way I like to hear things. It's very traditional. It's not that original or 
anything. My thing is just keeping things crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What music influenced that way of hearing things? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm from Akron, Ohio, you know. I grew up with AM radio. I could get 
stations from all over the place -- Nashville, Detroit, Chicago -- and they 
were all different kinds of music. It's not like it is now, where it's uniform. 
. . . B. B. King, James Brown, the Rolling Stones, all that English music. The 
Beatles, of course. Then there was all the West Coast stuff. Then as soon as 
everything started going underground, I could start getting stuff like "Sister 
Ray" by the Velvet Underground. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in the middle of nowhere. There was no real scene where I was, and 
that's always a really good place to be if you're a rock fan. Because you're 
not really ensconced in your own scene. You can just kind of dig everything 
that's going on everywhere. You don't really have a personal favorite because 
you're biased. . . . I was from nowhere. I liked it all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was your family life like growing up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Happy. Typical, Midwestern, Lutheran, you know -- mom, dad, two kids. Me 
and a brother. Like the cover of any Life magazine you'd care to point out from 
the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of mother are you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You could say I'm pretty strict. I don't think you'd think that the kids 
were being raised by a rock star. Manners -- that's what's important to me. . . 
. An understanding of life on Earth and appreciation for it. I appreciate that 
they can enjoy their childhood, so I've allowed that to flourish. I haven't 
pushed them into anything. Let them discover their own little things. There's 
nothing foisted on them that they should be musical or they should be this or 
that, but if they are, that's great. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said the Pretenders' first tours burned you out. Have you learned 
how to tour and survive? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you can't get too excessive with alcohol and drugs. I think 
moderation is a good thing. It's not something that I've really mastered yet, 
but I'm working on it. I'm getting there. It's hard for people in this 
business, because most of us are pretty extreme. But going from being a total 
alcoholic junkie raging maniac to being a total fitness fanatic, that's not 
really my approach to life. I'd rather try to roll with the punches. But I 
don't mind getting a few punches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've had two tragedies in the Pretenders, with the deaths of James 
Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon. What was your reaction to Kurt Cobain's 
suicide? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Devastated. Very sad. It's just heartbreaking. I didn't know him, but I was 
a fan, and I liked him. . . . We're used to this kind of thing in this 
business. People don't usually (kill) themselves. They usually do it, at least 
it appears, accidentally, even though they've been on some self-destruction or 
death-wish sort of trip. It never seems as blatantly intentional, I guess. . . 
. I can't speak for anyone else, but one does understand somewhat how he must 
have felt a lot of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you deal with those two deaths in your band? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you know, you just live from day to day, don't you? You just go 
through it.

FIRST BLACKS TAKE OATHS AS S. AFRICAN LEGISLATORS; GOVERNMENT: NEW LAWMAKERS 
ALSO ELECT PROVINCIAL PREMIERS. MANDELA ATTENDS SERVICES OF VARIOUS FAITHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid pomp and pageantry, hundreds of blacks were sworn in at new provincial 
legislatures around the country Saturday, taking elected office to govern 
alongside whites for the first time in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight regional assemblies convened a day after last week's liberation 
elections were certified as free and fair, and members of all races took the 
formal Oath of Solemn Affirmation in any of the nation's 11 new official 
languages. As their first act, they then elected provincial premiers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We stand on the threshold of time, as makers of history, to realize the 
dreams and aspirations of all South Africans," said Tokyo Sexwale, the new 
black leader of the region that includes the nation's commercial, financial and 
mining centers, and its biggest municipalities, Johannesburg and Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the landslide win by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, 
seven of the new premiers, including Sexwale, are ANC members. Mandela will be 
formally elected as the country's first black president by the National 
Assembly in Cape Town on Monday and then be inaugurated outside the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party won the Western Cape 
province, and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party 
won in KwaZulu-Natal. The new legislature there postponed its first meeting 
until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislatures' second official act will be to choose capitals of the nine 
provinces, as well as new provincial names in some cases. Most likely to be 
renamed are towns, airports, roads and public buildings named after the 
architects of apartheid's now-dead racist policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts said the election results augur well for the new democracy and 
the prospects of social peace.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven parties, ranging from the black radical Pan-Africanist Congress on the 
far left to the white separatist Freedom Front on the far right, won seats in 
the National Assembly. That means a variety of voices will be heard as the 
country reinvents itself under Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the white-led National Party and black-led Inkatha, the two 
major opposition parties, each captured a major province in the regional races. 
That gives each a strong power and patronage base from which to prepare for the 
next elections in 1999 and the post-Mandela era. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ANC was denied a two-thirds majority, the threshold necessary to 
rewrite the interim constitution without considering other parties. That check 
on unbridled ANC power reassured their political rivals as well as the business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the surprise win by Inkatha in KwaZulu-Natal may help defuse the raw 
political tensions and clan hatreds that have turned large parts of the 
impoverished, Zulu-dominated province into war zones that have claimed more 
than 10,000 lives in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials in the province continued to bitterly complain that the election 
was stolen through blatant vote-rigging. But reports suggest that national ANC 
leaders made a tactical decision to let the poll results there go unchallenged 
in hopes of appeasing Buthelezi and buying peace in the new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Buthelezi's decision to join the race a week before the polling 
began now appears shrewd rather than reckless: He made his point, swallowed his 
wounded pride and won anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he faces another choice: whether to join Mandela's coalition Cabinet or 
take his more accustomed role, outside the government, as a political gadfly 
and opposition leader in Parliament. Either way, Buthelezi, a man who warned 
last month of a "final struggle to the finish" with the ANC, is now in the 
ANC-led government, with a stake in its future.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, perhaps the most important decision during the torturous 
multi-party constitutional talks last year was the agreement to use 
proportional representation, rather than a winner-take-all approach, to create 
a government based on a principle of power sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant that every established political party that joined the race had a 
claim in the final outcome. Only 50,000 votes, out of an electorate of 20 
million, were needed to win a seat in the National Assembly and a role in the 
nation's future. That created a centripetal force, bringing more and more 
recalcitrant parties and players into the democratic process.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite what seemed a biblical series of misfortunes and insurmountable 
hurdles in the last two months -- homeland uprisings, rural massacres, urban 
firefights, boycotts and strikes, a major police scandal, a state of emergency, 
a wave of terrorist bombings -- the political center not only held but steadily 
grew. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers haven't disappeared -- the fear and distrust is too deeply 
embedded for that. The real challenge will come in trying to narrow the 
economic and social chasm between the races. But those problems remain hidden 
in the post-election euphoria that still pervades the land.  
</P>
<P>
 One obvious reason is Mandela himself. When De Klerk carped Friday about 
several of his more dubious choices for a Cabinet, Mandela generously agreed to 
reconsider. Reconciliation was more important than power, he said. This 
singular man then began a remarkable pilgrimage to bind the nation together.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he was guest of honor at the Owal Mosque in Cape Town. He was 
welcomed with a garland of flowers and a tribute by the country's Muslim 
leaders while crowds of supporters chanted outside. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he donned a white yarmulke and attended Orthodox Sabbath services 
at the Green and Sea Point Hebrew Congregation in Cape Town, where he was 
welcomed by Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, he will attend an interdenominational Christian rally and 
Thanksgiving service with De Klerk at a soccer stadium in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
 What might seem crass in another politician is spiritual history with Mandela. 
He attended a Methodist school as a child but later branched out. He worshiped 
at Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Christian services during his 27 years in prison. 
Overall, he only missed one Sunday service in all those years, he has said, and 
that was from illness.

OLD GUARD VIES WITH SALSA STAR IN PANAMA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Panama's first presidential election since a U.S. military invasion changed 
the country's history has boiled down to a contest between the onetime 
political party of ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and salsa star Ruben 
Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely options in today's vote speak to ways Panama has changed in the 
five years since the invasion, and ways it has not. The elections also 
highlight both the success and failure of a U.S. policy designed to build 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative coalition government of outgoing President Guillermo Endara, 
installed by U.S. troops once Noriega was toppled, is highly unpopular, and 
public anger is turning voters away from the ruling parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this election is expected to be the fairest and most free in Panamanian 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will control the country's preparations for taking over the vital 
Panama Canal and thousands of acres of prime real estate that become available 
to Panama as U.S. troops stationed here withdraw gradually by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time in 25 years that Panamanians will vote for president 
removed from the shadows of military dictatorship, and it is the first time in 
decades that the results are likely to be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 So it may seem ironic to many Americans that the party that the U.S. 
government battled to oust -- at the cost of 23 American and hundreds of 
Panamanian lives -- stands a good chance of returning to power. 
</P>
<P>
 And it may seem unusual that the next most probable victor is a musician and 
Hollywood actor who has not lived in Panama for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares, the charismatic candidate for the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, or PRD, which backed Noriega throughout the 1980s, is 
leading the polls with a 3- to 10-point margin. Blades, whose campaign seemed 
dead in the water a few weeks ago, places a strong second. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares had been the seemingly uncatchable leader for most of the 
year, but opponents have exploited his past ties to Noriega to erode his 
support. And the mercurial Blades, who for a long time seemed ambivalent about 
the campaign and fell dramatically in the polls, has suddenly taken to the 
streets in the last month, shaking hands and offering free salsa concerts to 
capture the imagination of a generally disenchanted public.  
</P>
<P>
 Panamanians who believed that democracy and a better way of life would be the 
automatic results of the 1989 invasion that ousted Noriega have been bitterly 
disappointed. There have been gains in political and personal freedoms and an 
impressive economic recovery, but few of the benefits have trickled down to the 
poor. A reduction of the state bureaucracy has cost many jobs, crime and drug 
abuse are growing, and many Panamanians see the Endara government as elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the real opportunity for change," Blades told a jubilant crowd of 
mostly young Panamanians last week in his final campaign rally outside a soccer 
stadium in one of the city's working-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a fluorescent orange baseball cap backward, Blades did more singing 
than speaking, running through renditions of the salsa hits that made him an 
international superstar, including "Decisiones," which, with its risque 
subject, was banned in Panama during most of the Noriega dictatorship.  
</P>
<P>
 Blades launched his maverick candidacy last year, moving from his home in 
Santa Monica back to Panama after a self-imposed exile of 18 years. He casts 
himself as the ultimate outsider, a unique chance to break from the past, and 
that seems to be a big plus in the minds of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the polls, Blades, 45, is the only candidate who has a chance -- 
though a slight one -- at preventing the return of the PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on widespread anti-government sentiment while offering old-style 
populism, Perez Balladares has campaigned tirelessly to distance himself and 
his party from Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he revived the image and memory of party founder Gen. Omar Torrijos, 
the military strongman who overthrew an elected government in 1968 and ruled 
until his death in a plane crash in 1981. Despite his iron fist, Torrijos 
exploited Panama's class and racial differences to appeal to the poor masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares, an economist and millionaire businessman, maintains that 
with Noriega serving a 40-year drug-trafficking sentence in Florida, the party 
has been purged of its most corrupt thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PRD of 1994 has absolutely nothing to do with the PRD of 1989," he said 
in an interview in one of several campaign headquarters. "Although (today's 
party) may have many of the same people who participated in '89, their 
philosophy, their behavior, their orientation is totally opposed to what it was 
in '89. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a problem that I have to admit. People still believe the PRD is 
Noriega's party. . . . As long as the American public doesn't get to recognize 
that this is a different situation, it will be very hard for them to understand 
why we won." 
</P>
<P>
 But his opponents say Perez Balladares' memory is selective and revisionist. 
His campaign ads, for example, offer a detailed biographical sketch from his 
birth until his participation in the negotiations for the 1977 Panama Canal 
Treaties. Suddenly, there is an abrupt jump to today, when the candidate is 
described as a "renowned businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares lost his party's presidential nomination in 1984 to a Noriega 
selection. But he ran the PRD's 1989 campaign for Carlos Duque, Noriega's 
handpicked candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 That election ended in rampant fraud when Noriega annulled results that 
favored Endara. Perez Balladares has denied participating in the fraud but 
defends his work for Duque as what he calls a moral obligation to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 When thousands of U.S. troops landed Dec. 20, 1989, to capture Noriega and 
destroy his army, Perez Balladares was arrested by the Americans and held for a 
few hours until associates applied pressure for his release. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed "the Bull" because of his enormous neck and bulky build, Perez 
Balladares has further worried opponents today by naming as his running mate 
Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque, publisher of Panama's oldest newspaper, which 
frequently served as a mouthpiece for the Noriega regime.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite Perez Balladares' claim that the party has cleaned up its act, other 
well-known Noriega cronies are running for office on its slate. These include 
former Noriega spokesman and close friend Mario Rognoni, who is a candidate for 
the legislature. And the party's president, Gerardo Gonzalez, is seen as a 
hard-liner whose son is the prime suspect in the killing of a U.S. soldier on 
the eve of former President George Bush's disastrous 1992 trip to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, how changed is the party, and it's an unknown," said a 
source familiar with U.S. policy. "The question is, how effectively will (Perez 
Balladares) be able to marginalize the radicals and whether that's his 
intention." 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Roberto Brenes, who is directing the campaign of another 
candidate, said: "The problem is not the Bull but the tail. Can he manage all 
of the people who come with him? If the ticket is any indication, you can 
expect about one-third of his people to be corrupt and one-third to be 
opportunists." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also fear that those military officers who once swore allegiance to 
Noriega are waiting in the wings to resume prominent roles in government. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares has pledged not to rebuild the military, which the Americans 
disbanded after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one explanation for the revival of the PRD can be found in El 
Chorrillo, a slum neighborhood that was bombed by the invading Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last week, five women were seated on the stoop of a tenement house. It 
was near noon, but there was nowhere else they had to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life was very much better" under Noriega, Suzanne Lovet said as her neighbors 
chimed in and echoed her. "You used to have work. Now you have nothing. (The 
Americans) give the money, but we didn't get it. . . . For the last four years, 
we don't get anything. No jobs, no money and no house. The rich people getting 
richer, the poor people getting poorer. Just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "With the dictatorship there were more jobs for the poor people than with the 
democracy," said Mare Angulo, 33, an unemployed mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Blades seems to recognize the phenomenon of the PRD popularity and has styled 
his own campaign -- with less success -- to channel the anti-government 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the PRD) are back strong because of the spectacular failure of the 
parties, the other traditional parties, in not just solving problems but 
showing compassion for people in Panama," he said last week. "The PRD brings 
memories to many people of a time, whether paternalistic or not, (when) there 
was an effort made to take into consideration the needs of the poor and the 
disadvantaged and the disenfranchised." 
</P>
<P>
 Endara's coalition, a mishmash of conservative parties that banded together as 
the so-called Civilista Movement to oppose Noriega, won the 1989 elections but 
was prevented by Noriega's henchmen from taking office. Only after the invasion 
was Endara sworn in, during a ceremony at a U.S. military base.

 But under Endara, many of the supposed sins of Noriega -- corruption, nepotism 
and the money-laundering of drug dollars -- continued apace.  
</P>
<P>
 Endara is barred constitutionally from seeking reelection. His coalition 
proceeded to commit political suicide by failing to agree on a single candidate 
and splitting apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the governing parties are running separate and not particularly 
charismatic candidates: Ruben Dario Carles, a gruff-voiced and cantankerous 
73-year-old former controller, and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, whose principal 
qualification seems to be that she is the remarried widow of Arnulfo Arias, a 
legendary politician who was thrice elected president in the 1940s and 1960s -- 
and thrice overthrown by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts see the demise of the ruling coalition and the resurrection of 
Noriega's old party as an indictment of U.S. policy, a policy doomed to fail 
because it focused on the military problem of Noriega without focusing on the 
political aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the U.S. government) handed power over to people who didn't represent 
anyone, who had won elections but under a set of completely different rules, 
where everyone was supporting them because they didn't want the military," said 
analyst Marco Gandasegui, who heads Panama's Latin American Studies Center. 
"People saw that Endara didn't solve any problem, so a lot of people now are 
saying give us back (the PRD). . . . It tells you the degree of frustration 
that exists."

U.S. JETS MAY SEAL OFF HAITI; EMBARGO: CLINTON CONSIDERS DISPATCHING MILITARY 
AIRCRAFT TO ENFORCE TOUGHER U.N. SANCTIONS. HE APPROVES OFFSHORE ASYLUM 
HEARINGS FOR SOME REFUGEES.

<P>
 President Clinton is considering the use of U.S. military aircraft to enforce 
a U.N. embargo on flights in and out of Haiti, including forcing down planes 
suspected of carrying supporters of the island nation's military regime, 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is one of several that Clinton is contemplating to make the U.N. 
embargo effective and concentrate its impact on the Haitian regime, which the 
United States wants to push from power, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, responding to protests from supporters of exiled Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Clinton has decided to provide offshore 
hearings to Haitian refugees who ask for political asylum in the United States, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President does not intend to change the basic policy of intercepting 
Haitian refugees at sea and returning them home without allowing them to land 
in the United States, the officials said. But he has decided that "adjudication 
in third countries or on ships will be provided within a few weeks," a White 
House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met for more than two hours Saturday with his top foreign policy 
advisers, including Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss his options in 
Haiti, where the brutal regime has ignored U.S. pleas to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made several decisions" and may announce them as early as today, an aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has tried several approaches to force the military from power and 
restore Aristide, Haiti's first popularly elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a year, the United Nations has imposed an oil embargo on the 
impoverished nation, but it failed to keep oil out -- or to impress the 
military. For several months, the Administration tried to broker a compromise 
between Aristide and the military, but that approach failed too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Administration has won U.N. approval for tougher sanctions, including 
a near-total embargo on trade and transportation. And, in an apparent attempt 
to pressure the Haitian military further, Clinton has warned that he will 
consider U.S. military options if the sanctions fail. 
</P>
<P>
 But that suggestion has deeply divided the Administration. Perry has publicly 
dismissed the idea of a U.S. invasion of Haiti as half-baked, asking: "After 
we've done that, what is Act II?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, however, the President is concentrating on ways to make the 
new sanctions work in a way the old ones never did -- even though many experts 
doubt that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing is that we are convinced that we have the makings of an 
intensified, broadened sanctions regime that can achieve the objective we have 
set out," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council on Friday include an 
immediate ban on private flights in and out of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said members of the military and their wealthy supporters had used 
such flights to ferry supplies to the island. U.S. officials also charge that 
private planes have been used in illicit drug trade that is enriching the 
military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they have been looking at ways that U.S. 
military aircraft could enforce that ban, in part because they consider it a 
way to strike directly at the military and its backers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The broader trade sanctions are scheduled to take effect May 21 if the 
military regime does not step down before then. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides discussed ways to help enforce the embargo, including 
increased aid to the Dominican Republic, which shares a land border with Haiti 
on the island of Hispaniola -- and whose frontier is a major smuggling route. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has also decided to soften his controversial policy of returning 
refugees directly to Haiti -- but without taking the politically unpopular step 
of allowing them to land in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and liberal Democrats in Congress have denounced the policy as 
racist, and activist Randall Robinson has been on a hunger strike in Washington 
for 26 days to protest it. Robinson said Saturday that he would end his fast if 
the United States provided the refugees a shelter somewhere and allowed them to 
make a case for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President did decide this morning on an adjustment," a senior official 
said Saturday. "We are going to pursue two options: to provide hearings in a 
third country or countries, or aboard ships." 
</P>
<P>
 He said no other countries have been approached to provide the hearing 
facilities. In the past, officials have proposed other Caribbean islands or 
Honduras as possible sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton decided to make the change because officials estimated that about 5% 
of the refugees have a legitimate claim to refugee status, "and they are put at 
risk by being returned," the official said. "We're concerned that with 
increasing harassment and violence, that could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not mean that people who go to sea will have a better chance of 
getting into the United States than those who apply in Haiti," he added. "The 
great, great majority will still be returned to Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The human rights group Amnesty International said last week that 139 of the 
Haitians returned by the United States have been arrested, but the State 
Department said most were held for less than 48 hours, and all have been 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide said he was skeptical about Clinton's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already 30 months (that) I've been hearing beautiful statements," he 
said, referring to the time since the military overthrew him in 1991.

PUC PUSHING FREE-MARKET REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In less than a decade, the impeccably conservative Republicans of the 
California Public Utilities Commission have unleashed the most far-reaching 
deregulation of telecommunications, natural gas -- and now electric utilities 
-- undertaken by any state or nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they achieve their intended result -- lower consumer prices and a 
competitive climate for California industry -- or stir up the business and 
consumer woes that have plagued deregulated trucking and airlines will take 
years to assess. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than continue micromanaging utility companies' business decisions 
-- and risk dictating bad policy -- the five members of the PUC prefer to let 
the marketplace have its way with the state's power and telecommunications 
industries.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1970s, different commissioners with more confidence in government 
planning bet on the conventional wisdom that soaring oil prices would never 
return to earth. The consequence: State programs that promoted new energy 
sources but also locked in higher energy costs than might otherwise have 
lingered after oil prices collapsed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "And over the past 20 years, those higher costs have pushed more 
energy-intensive manufacturing to other states," said Lynn Reaser, chief 
economist of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That fateful look in the crystal ball weighs heavily on the current 
commissioners and their brilliant, if occasionally imperious, president, UC 
Davis law professor Daniel W. Fessler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simplified regulation -- less green eyeshade regulation -- if we can bring it 
off, will reduce the regulatory burden on California's economy," Fessler said, 
"especially now as we're opening this world of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its 83-year history, the PUC's decisions have cast long shadows on 
a state whose sprawling growth has been linked inextricably to energy and 
measured by the march of telephone and power poles into distant suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been always one of the first states to be on the cutting edge of 
technology," said Fessler, citing California's high per capita access to 
telephones, electricity and other basic services compared to the rest of the 
country. "And we have -- I think anybody would concede -- one of the most 
reliable infrastructures for the delivery of energy on the face of the earth," 
he added in the resonant boom that has helped make his contracts law classes 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 With much of its free-market revolution yet to take hold, the future of the 
PUC was threatened last year. Statehouse planners weighed a transfer of some of 
the agency's authority to the state Energy Commission. Fessler, considered the 
commissioner with the closest ties to Gov. Pete Wilson, led a stalwart defense, 
and in the end Wilson called for eliminating the Energy Commission instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Having hung on to their power, what the commissioners want to do is substitute 
market forces wherever possible for traditional command and control regulation, 
including the conventional rate-setting authority that has kept tabs on the 
state's investor-owned utilities -- including Southern California Edison Co., 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Gas Co., Pacific Bell and 
GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid changes in technology and federal law have brought competition to 
industries that for most of this century trudged along as "natural monopolies." 
Electricity, gas, water and phone service, it was assumed, would always be 
public services that could be delivered most dependably and cheaply by 
companies given exclusive franchises in their markets -- and then watched 
hawk-like by the PUC to assure that consumers' interests were protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, technology -- particularly in telecommunications and in generating 
electricity -- has changed that. New devices have made it possible for new 
companies to compete with utilities. And the technology is so complex and 
evolving so quickly that withdrawing from micromanagement is the commissioners' 
most fervent hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition "puts the customer in the decision-making responsibility, not the 
commission," Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon said. "Regulation is just a 
surrogate for competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Deregulation of long-distance telephone calls, with the 1984 breakup of AT & 
T, started the PUC down the free market path. In the decade since, 
long-distance rates have dropped 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the commissioners are expected to release their plan for bringing 
competition to regional toll calls -- such as those between Los Angeles and 
Riverside or Irvine and Santa Monica. Already, more than 120 companies are 
waiting to get into that business, said Commissioner Norman D. Shumway, a 
former Republican congressman from Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next is deregulation of the dial tone" -- local calls -- with a goal of 
consumer choice by 1997, Shumway said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission considers the deregulation of natural gas -- which also began 
after a federal lead in 1984 -- a stirring success, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Patricia M. Eckert recently had the cost-benefit picture 
researched for the deregulation of wholesale natural gas. In the mid-1980s, 
high-priced, long-term production contracts were renegotiated in light of 
falling gas rates. For the $10 billion invested nationally by gas buyers in the 
one-time restructuring of contracts, $80 billion in payments was saved over a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission next wants to open up natural gas pipelines within the state to 
competition. Conlon and other commissioners want to expand on an experimental 
program that gives some residential customers a choice of natural gas 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 California's high electric rates -- which run about 50% above the U.S. average 
-- have proved a tougher nut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started scratching our heads in 1980," said Edmund J. Texeira, a 37-year 
commission veteran and director of its Division of Ratepayer Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the PUC made its first attempt at stabilizing energy prices, 
implementing a state policy to promote renewable and domestic fuels, thereby 
lowering California's dependence on foreign oil. That reliance had left the 
state more vulnerable than any other to the oil shocks of the 1970s, resulting 
in gas lines and mile-high prices for natural gas and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring, 1985, the PUC ordered an auction that led to the state's electric 
utilities signing contracts to buy power from independent power producers -- 
many of which made their electricity from solar, wind, geothermal and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California has more diverse sources of energy than any place in the 
world. Some technologies -- notably wind power -- are becoming competitive. 
Although rates are high, Californians' monthly power bills are much lower than 
the national average because energy conservation programs have been so 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that many of these 1985 contracts were pegged to high oil 
prices. Until cost adjustment clauses take effect starting in 1997, the pacts 
are pushing up utilities' energy costs. Big industries that cannot cut their 
energy consumption are hard hit -- or hitting the road to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hangs like the proverbial sword over the economy of California," said 
John E. Bryson, chief executive and chairman of SCEcorp., parent of Southern 
California Edison. Bryson, who served as PUC president from 1979 to 1982, 
estimates that in 1996, the independents' contracts will cost Edison $1 billion 
more than it would otherwise pay for electricity for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the commission adopts its proposal to deregulate the electric industry 
-- a plan that calls for all customers to have a choice of power providers by 
2002 -- a new auction of power contracts at more competitive rates is being 
held up. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay has brought the strongest criticism so far of the electric 
deregulation plan. The state's independent power producers are furious, saying 
that 5,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in investments are being jeopardized. 
Environmentalists remain deeply suspicious that deregulation will sacrifice 
renewable energy on the altar of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a debate about whether to have competition. The environmental 
community has promoted competition for years," said Ralph Cavanagh, energy 
policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's over how 
competition should proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they take on such far-reaching issues, commissioners have sought to 
rule apart from the political fray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1912, reform-minded Republican Gov. Hiram W. Johnson tried to insulate the 
commission's predecessor agency from political influence by enshrining its 
autonomy in the state Constitution and transplanting its headquarters from 
Sacramento to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But in carving out such independence -- at the time, from the railroads and 
their political allies -- Johnson also embedded a legacy that rankles critics 
to this day. Commission decisions can be overturned only by the state Supreme 
Court -- something Fessler acknowledges happens about three times a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups say that gives them no practical recourse if they feel 
ill-served by the blizzard of regulatory decisions that occupy the commission's 
time between big policy moves. They also object that, unlike judges, the 
commissioners are free to have private conversations with parties to their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts residential and small business consumer groups at a big disadvantage 
versus the utilities, said Robert Gnaizda, senior partner and co-founder of San 
Francisco-based Public Advocates Inc., which campaigns at the PUC for consumer 
protection and minority opportunities. "When some well-paid lobbyist wines and 
dines a commissioner and gives him a 100-page document with a seven-page 
summary, you can't know what he said, so you can't refute it," Gnaizda said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the commission was forced to withdraw its initial proposal for 
deregulating regional toll calls when it was learned that phone company 
executives had been at PUC headquarters the night before the commission vote. 
After years of public hearings and discussion, changes were made that night 
that uniformly favored the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The big utilities pay $100 million to $150 million a year to attorneys who 
represent them before the PUC, Gnaizda estimates. In contrast, he said, 
consumer group attorneys -- who are awarded fees by the PUC when they win a 
case -- have averaged $500,000 in lawyers and experts fees and court costs 
annually in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the effective consumer groups won't appear before the PUC," Gnaizda 
said. "It has a bias, sometimes unintentional, for the powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Fessler, although seen by many as the commission's strongest consumer advocate 
-- would rather see less, not more, courtroom procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old trial model of confrontation -- of everybody starting with the most 
extreme position and then assuming that the judicial process will move them in 
the direction of a more reasonable outcome -- is crazy if you've got 15 people 
staking out extreme positions," Fessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also campaigned for an end to state laws that ban commissioners from 
meeting behind closed doors for procedural discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, bills pending in the Legislature would toughen the open meeting 
rule or allow judicial review at the appellate court level. Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Utilities and 
Commerce, supports the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Fessler is a very bright and insightful individual . . . and (he) 
provides a leadership that probably has not been present in recent times," 
Moore said. "But the PUC has the power to impose billions of dollars in rates 
on ordinary ratepayers. . . . We have to make the system as fair and open as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what rules they follow, the commissioners have launched policies 
that could lead to a smaller, less-powerful agency. After the bugs are out of 
deregulation early in the next century, many commissioners see renewed emphasis 
on the interests of yesteryear, such as safety and consumer fraud, and 
attention to new concerns such as data security in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Northridge quake hit, "it wasn't an accident that the (utilities') 
spare parts were there," Fessler said. "It wasn't an accident that the 
contingency plans were there. . . . And that will be on the agenda when I'm 
long gone."

ENDING ROLE OF OCCUPIER BRINGS JOY TO TEL AVIV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Standing amid his piles of ripe tomatoes and leafy stalks of celery, Goell 
George was weighing and bagging vegetables speedily for weekend shoppers -- and 
talking politics even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finally getting out of Gaza and bringing our boys back home," George 
said. "I thought this day would never come. But, praise God, we are through 
with Gaza, and soon, I hope, we'll be off the West Bank too." 
</P>
<P>
 George, 60, who came from Afghanistan as a boy, is not one of the Israeli 
liberals who have been campaigning for years for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank and recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a vegetable seller in Tel Aviv's bustling Carmel Market, where political 
opinions are conservative, generally shouted and often punctuated with a bang 
of the fist on the table. Here, the right-wing Likud Party can usually count on 
100% support from both the vendors and the shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wanted to stay in Gaza? Nobody I know," George said. "As for security, I 
think holding Gaza cost us more lives than it saved. Same way with the West 
Bank. I say, let the Palestinians decide themselves what to do. For us, it's 
enough. We're going." 
</P>
<P>
 A deep satisfaction spread this weekend across Tel Aviv, the country's coastal 
metropolis, as the meaning of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West 
Bank town of Jericho sunk in and people savored the prospects of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said David Yaakov, 42, who sells clothing in the market at 
a stall where his father, an immigrant from Iraq, had sold goods before him. 
"When people voted for (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin and the Labor Party two 
years ago, this is what they wanted. You can criticize the deal Rabin did this 
way or that way, but the important thing is, we'll be out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, in two years my son goes into the army. I hope he won't have to fight 
as I did. At least I know he won't be in Gaza and probably not on the West 
Bank. Who wants to raise a boy for 20 years, to be your pride and joy, and then 
see him die in Gaza?" 
</P>
<P>
 There were others criticizing the agreement on Palestinian self-government 
reached last week with the Palestine Liberation Organization, but in Tel Aviv 
they seemed a dissonant minority despite the full-scale Likud assaults on the 
Rabin government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving back Gaza is one thing -- the only people who want it are the 
Palestinians," Menahem Scherf, 33, said between sales of trays of eggs, "but 
the West Bank is another matter. First, there are 110,000 or 120,000 Israeli 
settlers there, and then there is a security question because it is actually 
very close to Tel Aviv. . . . I'd say, keep most of the West Bank." 
</P>
<P>
 A fishmonger paused as he cleaned a couple of trout to comment: "Trust the 
Arabs? Never. An Arab will work for you 10, 15 years and then one day stab you 
in the back. Even if Palestinian autonomy begins well, that's the way it will 
turn out -- a knife in our back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shlomo Haim, 60, a retired steelworker who came to Israel as a teen-ager, 
acknowledged that Israelis are divided over the agreement but dismissed such 
comments as "mad shouting." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an army to defend us," Haim said. "How can people forget that? We are 
strong militarily. The Palestinians cannot threaten us, and we won't let them 
terrorize us. If those settlers are worried about their safety, they should 
return home to Israel. This peace is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cafe Nordau, a trendy bistro on Ben Yehuda Street, owner Benny Schlesinger 
observed that the agreement between Israel and the PLO had "released a lot of 
the tension among people -- there was a relief, a relaxation, a sense of doing 
something very right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk with hundreds of people every day," said Schlesinger, 44, "and I know 
the mood of Tel Aviv. Ninety-nine percent of the people here are happy with 
this agreement, most of them very happy, and those who are angry are a bitter 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have had it up to here with war," he said, using his hand to draw a 
line well over his head. "And this occupation is war in another form. . . . We 
will have to work at making peace work, we will have to be patient with the 
PLO, we will maintain our security so people feel easy, but all this we can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Others go further and see the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and later from the 
West Bank as a liberation for Israel as well as the place they are starting to 
call, with a bit of a catch in the throat, Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best thing to happen to Israel since the state was founded in 
1948," said Havatselet Arnon, 31, a sound technician at the Cameri Theater 
here. "In 1967, we fought a war we had to fight to defend Israel, but we got 
into a very dangerous situation psychologically and morally when we kept the 
West Bank and Gaza and started to rule over another people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are supposed to be the only true democracy in the Middle East, but 
occupying another country contradicts all notions of democracy. Our soldiers 
felt they could do anything to Arabs in the (occupied) territories. That 
feeling spread to Israel, so we all looked on Arabs as less than human. And we 
forced young men, just out high school, to be part of this -- or go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalia Binder, 38, a real estate agent, made the point even more graphically. 
"We take an 18-year-old who barely knows himself, give him a gun and tell him 
to decide whether to kill another boy who has a stone in his hand," she said. 
"This changes someone for life, and after almost 27 years, two generations of 
Israelis have been shaped in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gidi Orsher, 44, a film critic, the lengthy Israeli occupation had changed 
the country into "a place where we don't care much, at least as much as we used 
to, about one another." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young and we heard a soldier had died, it was a national tragedy, 
something everyone felt," he said. "Now, who cares? We lost our innocence with 
the occupation, and over the years it hardened us. Those years seemed to take 
everything bad and distill it into government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole debate about whether to stay or go shows how cynical we have 
become. We think only of ourselves -- is this good for Israel or bad? We look 
to only our own needs without thinking that what would be good for the other 
could also be good for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arnon, Binder, Orsher and many other Israeli liberals, the agreement on 
Palestinian autonomy thus becomes a redeeming act for Israel itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking the freedom of another nation is a terrible thing," Arnon said, "but 
giving it back is wonderful, for us and for them." 
</P>

 Baruch Ben-Anat, 68, a retired businessman, and his wife, Zevaha, also 68, 
consider themselves "people of the moderate center," and for them the retreat 
from Gaza and the West Bank will be a return to the Zionism they have supported 
from their youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a state that is Jewish and democratic," Ben-Anat said, "and not a 
state that will have a minority of nearly 50% Arabs or that deprives those 
people of their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it has taken us time to understand the implications of remaining in Gaza 
and the West Bank. We were happy after the 1967 war because we thought it 
completed the (1948) War of Independence and brought us the whole Land of 
Israel. But, really, we had to make a choice -- Israel as a Jewish state with 
less land but at peace, or Greater Israel with so many Arabs and no peace."

PRISON BARS CAN'T KEEP OUT MOTHER'S LOVE; REUNIONS: WOMEN TREK TO SAN QUENTIN 
TO ASSURE THEIR SONS: I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The lucky ones got two hugs and two kisses for each day of their visit here. 
The lucky ones got to hold hands with their sons, share lunch from a vending 
machine, have a guard snap a Polaroid picture to take home -- woman and child 
in Death Row visiting room, Mother's Day weekend, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the lucky ones got to telegraph again the message they can so 
rarely say in person: I love you anyway. You were convicted of raping and 
setting a woman on fire, but I love you anyway. You beat four gay men to death 
with a pipe, but I love you anyway. You shot and killed a liquor store owner 
after robbing him of $80,000, but still I am here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought him into this world; I will always be there for him," says Catalina 
Weaver of her son LaTwon, who is on Death Row for the murder of a jewelry store 
owner in a 1992 robbery. "I will always find a way to visit him. I could never 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen Southern California women with hearts as full as their wallets are 
empty traveled Friday from Los Angeles to San Quentin to see the men whose 
absence shapes their lives, these sons and husbands, nephews and boyfriends 
spending anywhere from a couple of months to the rest of their days in the 
oldest state prison in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Mother's Day is not about perfect families; it is, however, about 
close-to-perfect love, the kind that makes Irene Mepsham of Los Angeles spend a 
silent weekend on the road simply to see her son Leo's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Mepsham cannot hear and no interpreter accompanied her. Instead, she carried a 
black ballpoint pen and a small white pad for her very cursory communication at 
places such as Carl's Jr.: "Charbroiled chicken sandwich and a 7Up." 
</P>
<P>
 For company, a new Reader's Digest. For support, an aluminum cane. 
Inspiration? A black and white high school picture circa 1961: Leo in coat and 
tie -- young, handsome, innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people on this bus haven't seen their sons or husbands for 
some years," says Samuel Theus, president of the HELP Public Service 
Foundation, which along with the Los Angeles Police Department, arranged the 
unusual -- and free -- Mother's Day bus trip. "A lot of these mothers don't let 
go of their children regardless of what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the sort of pilgrimage that Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia probably 
envisioned in 1907, when she started the holiday by asking her church to hold a 
service in memory of all mothers on the anniversary of her own mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mother's Day journey to a far-off prison is not the sort of gift that 
Theodore M. Kaufman thinks of first, he of the Father's Day/Mother's Day 
Council Inc., when he says: "The median mother gets 2.5 gifts. Some get five 
and 10, some only one." 
</P>
<P>
 And some spend eight hours in a vibrating bus under rain and hail, past vast, 
empty fields, through the belly of California to see the men they love -- the 
lucky ones granted physical contact, the others just speaking through windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Odell Farris, regal in bright-colored African garb, is HELP foundation leader 
and unofficial hostess. As the bus splashes rapidly north, Farris says: "Would 
anyone like some chips? We still have some M & M's left. Something to read?" 
</P>
<P>
 First stop Buttonwillow. Next stop Los Banos. Final destination, a dreary 
motel whose chief comfort is its cleanliness. It is 9 p.m. Friday. They grab 
their bags in the soft steady rain and head for rooms they will share with 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone need an iron?" Chris Escobedo asks of no one in particular. "I 
brought an iron and starch and a curling iron." 
</P>
<P>
 The closet-sized lobby is scented with curry. For a quarter, the beds have 
magic fingers. U.S. 101 runs right by the pillows of these 18 women, two men 
and a child; at least it sounds that way at midnight, with sleep far in the 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 a.m. it is even closer, as an out of control car slams into the motel, 
skids along a side street and comes to rest underneath a Ford. A fight breaks 
out. Three police cars, a fire engine, a tow truck and paramedics extricate the 
driver and his wayward compact. The motel balcony is ringed with spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just getting into a good sleep, when 'Pow!' I thought it was an 
earthquake," says one sleepy-eyed mother as she waits in the rain for the bus 
to San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 7:30 a.m. She has not seen her son for a year. Their reunion is still an 
hour away. She does not give her name, this persevering parent. No pictures, 
either, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 If she did, well then, the talk would start again, the memories would roll, 
and where would she be? Back on that dreadful night 11 years ago. Hearing 
another woman say she will not rest until a young man dies and evens the score. 
A son for a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think about her child that died," says the woman who visits the child 
that lived. "I think about it all the time. We still grieve. We still hurt. 
It's like I'm doing time. . . . I feel bad for their family. My son did it. 
We're suffering. I didn't raise my son to do this. It was the drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 What if she just stayed home, this woman who can ill-afford to visit Death 
Row. Her eyes narrow, and each word is spoken just so: "You don't stop loving 
people because something goes wrong. That makes you less than human." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker of the LAPD is a firm believer in the power of 
"influential eyeball-to-eyeball visits" by mothers and sisters, children and 
wives. These men will be back on the streets some day, quite possibly even 
those who are condemned. Connect them to the real world, Kroeker says, and 
maybe they will stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing better than the family," says Kroeker, who linked Theus up 
with Tom Nix, president of a check-cashing business, the man who is bankrolling 
the $6,000 trip, which ends with more visits today. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit next month is planned for Pelican Bay, but funding is still in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who might argue with Kroeker, but Geneva McClintock is not one 
of them. Her son, she says, has a heart of gold, this man who is in prison for 
aiding and abetting a drive-by murder 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been so long, so long to see him," says the mother. "He's been going to 
school. He's been working. Every year the parole board says one more year. It's 
just dreadful." 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock passes the time on the tedious trip to San Quentin composing a 
speech in a spiral binder. She thanks just about anyone she can think of for 
bringing her north to see her boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentleman," McClintock begins, in script that wavers from the 
bus's motion. "Our loved ones need to know we love them. We want them to know 
they are very special, and when they do come home we want them to know they are 
coming to a world of love." 
</P>
<P>
 She never gets to read these words; instead she starts her Saturday sort of 
speechless. At 9:05 she is inside the San Quentin gates, the arms of her son, 
Thomas Bailey, around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey can find the words as he wipes the tears from his mother's eyes. "I'm 
so elated. Some days are bad in here. Some are better. But this day, this day 
is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 She touches his face: "My special love." 
</P>

TELEMARKETER'S FUNDS DID NOT REACH CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Burbank-based telemarketing firm that took in $500,000 in charitable 
contributions last year has cashed checks made out either to charities that do 
not exist or real charities that never received the money, a Times 
investigation has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers, a business whose telephone solicitors call households 
across the Los Angeles area, also sought and received donations for charities 
it does not legally represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Local and state laws prohibit commercial fund-raisers from misrepresenting 
what will be done with the donor's money or soliciting for an organization 
without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Galambos, president of Valley Fundraisers, which is among the top third 
of all commercial fund-raisers in California, acknowledged in an interview 
recently that "mistakes" have been made, blaming overzealous employees who had 
acted without his knowledge perhaps "twice in a thousand times." When 
confronted with evidence of at least 90 such checks, Galambos said the company 
had administrative problems that have now been remedied. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the state attorney general's Registry of Charitable Trusts 
said the agency has investigated Valley Fundraisers, but declined to divulge 
any details because no action was taken against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analyzed records of thousands of checks received by Valley 
Fundraisers over nine months in 1992 and 1993 and interviewed dozens of donors. 
Among the practices found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some donors told The Times they wrote the checks on the understanding that 
their money would be used to grant wishes to dying children, operate a veterans 
shelter, provide Thanksgiving baskets to homeless veterans and support veterans 
wheelchair competitions. In fact, officials of the three charities the firm is 
authorized to represent said they do not provide such programs for veterans or 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Couriers for Valley Fundraisers -- checks are collected immediately by 
runners, not mailed -- picked up checks for well-known national charities 
including Easter Seals, March of Dimes and the American Kidney Fund without 
authorization. Officials of those organizations said they had never heard of 
Valley Fundraisers and received no money from it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley Fundraisers continued to accept thousands of dollars in checks 
payable to two organizations -- Missing Children's Report and American 
Wheelchair Veterans' Assn. -- that had canceled their contracts with the firm. 
Officials of both organizations said they received no payments from Valley 
Fundraisers after the contracts ended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donors said they were instructed to make out checks to an alphabet soup of 
children's, medical and veterans causes, sometimes under initials such as AACP, 
CES and CHC and at other times to non-specific names such as Crippled Children, 
Vets Shelter and Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 One name appearing frequently on checks deposited by Valley Fundraisers is the 
Children's Hospice Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS has no registration for Children's Hospice Center, according to Daniel 
Langan, spokesman for the National Charities Information Bureau in New York, a 
philanthropic watchdog organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos acknowledged that his firm does not represent any children's hospice. 
He said that deposit of any check in that name was a mistake and that if he 
knew about it he would refund it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers occupies a little-known niche of the philanthropic world in 
which telephone solicitors act as independent contractors taking a commission 
of up to one-third on each donation. The couriers also receive a share and 
Galambos earns a profit, leaving a small percentage for the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities consider fraud to be a widespread problem in California's 
$88-million commercial fund-raising industry, but find it hard to prosecute 
because of the difficulty of linking individual donors to improper 
solicitations, especially because the donors often do not realize they have 
been cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Once filed, cases are complicated and costly to put together, said state 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Chet Horn. Horn said he could not recall any criminal cases 
filed against charitable fund-raising firms by his office. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the largest charity fraud cases in California, and one of only a 
handful brought against a telemarketing firm, Orange County Charitable Services 
was accused in a 1992 civil complaint of raising money for shell charities that 
were run by its own principals. Trial is scheduled for August. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers has reported receiving more than $2.6 million in the past 
four years, according to records on file with the Registry of Charitable 
Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has contracts to solicit donations for three charitable 
organizations. According to its own reports filed with state authorities, it 
keeps more than 87% of the money it raises to cover its expenses and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Supreme Court rulings protecting commercial fund raising as an exercise 
of free speech rights, no laws may require that Valley Fundraisers pass on a 
specific percentage of its take to the charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos defends his enterprise as a source of employment for dozens of 
down-and-out people and a source of funds for charities having a hard time 
getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of commission-based solicitation is considered unethical by the 
two leading professional societies of fund-raisers, the National Society of 
Fund-Raising Executives and the American Assn. of Fund-Raising Counsel, even 
when it is conducted legally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with Valley Fundraisers' donors showed that they often responded to 
repeated appeals, writing checks to numerous names and causes without realizing 
that all were being collected by the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the donors interviewed by The Times remembered being told they were 
being solicited by Valley Fundraisers. State law requires commercial 
fund-raising firms to identify themselves as such at the beginning of the 
solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The donors were often well-educated and well-off. Among them were a television 
producer, a retired aerospace manager and a journalism professor. Most asked 
that their names not be used. The majority gave from one to four times before 
deciding to say no. 
</P>
<P>
 Some particularly soft-touch donors -- known in telemarketing jargon as "taps" 
-- have made thousands of dollars in donations, paying from $25 to more than 
$250 at a time to various charities, including those that Valley Fundraisers is 
authorized to represent. Many still give regularly.  
</P>
<P>
 Many "taps" say they were treated rudely and continued to receive calls from 
Valley Fundraisers or other commercial solicitors even after asking to be left 
alone.  
</P>
<P>
 "They really play on your softness," said one. "They really know how to get 
things out of you. Some of them are so rude when I finally say no." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd jump off the roof to get them to stop calling," said Arne Rubenstein, a 
Westside school principal who said she receives so many calls from charity 
solicitors that she cannot differentiate one appeal from another. 
</P>
<P>
 Several frequent donors said they have become suspicious of the calls after 
recognizing the same voice pitching different groups or because the solicitors 
refused to give them an address to which checks could be mailed, insisting that 
a courier pick up the donation, a practice of several charitable solicitation 
agencies. However, the donors said they continued to turn over money because 
the causes sounded so worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several donors whose checks were deposited by Valley Fundraisers recalled that 
solicitors described in elaborate detail how their money would be spent, even 
though the explanations bore no connection to the activities of Valley 
Fundraisers' three client charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd say they were AIDS, homeless vets, whatever was essential at the time, 
post-earthquake, post-fire," said Gail Gordon. "I give to the AIDS foundation. 
. . . It was for a hospice center they were going to build by the VA." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gilliland, a writer for the "Roseanne" television show, said he wrote a 
check to Veterans Olympics after being told, "We're sending our guys to the big 
games somewhere in Spain. The guys did really well thanks to your donation in 
the past games. Now they're going to the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I specifically asked them if they're 501c3," Gilliland said, using the IRS 
code for a charity with tax-exempt donation status. "They said, 'Yes.' Every 
dollar goes to this? It's all volunteer, correct? They say, 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One appeal was for "a man who hadn't seen his daughter for a few years and he 
was close to the line," donor Ruth Tolbert recalled of the telephone call that 
induced her to write a $100 check to the Children's Wish Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let me know afterward that he did go meet his daughter. They met and 
spent a couple days together. Just to let me know that my money had gone toward 
a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 According to financial reports Valley Fundraisers filed with the California 
attorney general as required by the state's commercial solicitation law, the 
firm did not have a contract to raise funds for the Children's Wish Foundation. 
The solicitation firm did not report receiving any donations for that group. 
</P>
<P>
 An organization with a nearly identical name, Children's Wish Fund of Carson, 
was dissolved by a 1992 Sacramento Superior Court order and its officers 
enjoined from soliciting funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Stein, president of Children's Wish Foundation International of 
Atlanta, Ga., said Valley Fundraisers was not authorized to collect funds on 
its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if he could obtain canceled checks made out to his organization, 
he would "prosecute these people to the fullest extent of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state Business and Professions Code imposes a fine of $2,500 per violation 
for making "any statement . . . which is untrue or misleading" in a charitable 
solicitation. That code also imposes a fiduciary duty on solicitors to ensure 
that the funds they collect are used for the stated purposes. The Los Angeles 
Municipal Code prohibits charitable solicitations without the "written 
authorization" of the intended beneficiary and makes any violations punishable 
by a maximum of six months in jail or a $1,000 fine.  
</P>
<P>
 Galambos said his solicitors are authorized only to ask for donations under 
the names of the three IRS-registered charity organizations with which he has 
contracts. He suggested that checks made out to initials that do not match 
those could reflect writing errors by the donor, who may have been told to 
write ACRF for AIDS and Cancer Research Foundation, one of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the writer doesn't abbreviate properly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he sees such a check, Galambos said, he will ask the sales agent which of 
the three agencies it was intended for and credit the funds to that account. 
The other two are Helping Hands for the Blind of Chatsworth and the Brotherhood 
Rally of All Veterans Organizations (BRAVO) of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the checks made out to Children's Hospice Center or Veteran's 
Shelter, he said, the solicitor must have been at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't pitch that in the first place," Galambos said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Valley Fundraisers has deposited checks made payable to at least 30 
names. Among them are the initials AACE, AACP, AAFF, ACF, CCC, CE, CLC, HRF, 
RAV, OC and VO. Full names appearing on checks include Crippled Children, 
Abused Children's Assn., Abused Child Report, Disabled Children, Save A Child, 
Children's Cancer Fund, Operation Teddy Bear, American War Veterans, Disabled 
American Veterans, Paralyzed War Veterans, The Veterans, California Veterans 
Special Projects, Cal Vets, Veterans Toys for Tots, Vet Shelter and Marine 
Corps Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos offered no explanation for those checks except to say they could not 
have been received and deposited in his presence. He said that he cannot always 
be present to supervise the solicitors working in his Burbank phone room and 
that others work out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no control," the 57-year-old Hungarian native said. "If the solicitor 
doesn't tell the truth, I don't know how much I am responsible for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos said his procedures have improved markedly since he closed his Santa 
Monica phone room about eight months ago. Some solicitors there were crack 
cocaine addicts who would not adhere to his rules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that over the years he has refunded hundreds of checks when he learned 
of errors. One donor said he received several hundred dollars back after 
threatening legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are learning from our mistakes," Galambos said. "Every mistake that we 
make is costing us money, so therefore we have to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not deny that his firm had deposited the checks made out to unconnected 
or apparently nonexistent charities, but disclaimed personal responsibility. He 
can only personally deposit about half the checks and relies on others who have 
proven less conscientious than himself to handle the rest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos said he cannot account today for the distribution of any funds his 
firm received and deposited made out to organizations with which it has no 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he cannot afford to pay an accountant to keep records of individual 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Government Code requires commercial fund-raising firms to make "a 
detailed, itemized accounting of funds solicited for charitable purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Horn said the proliferation of charity names is common in 
fraudulent fund raising because solicitors move from one organization to 
another, taking their familiar pitches with them, and because donors are more 
likely to keep giving if the causes change. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of California's 121 licensed commercial fund-raising companies, Valley 
Fundraisers can legitimately solicit funds for tax-exempt organizations 
registered with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 In its financial statement for 1993, Valley Fundraisers reported to the 
California attorney general that it raised $511,911 and, after deducting its 
expenses and profit, distributed $63,294 to the three organizations, or about 
12.4% of the total donations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Simi Valley Police Department conducted a search of Valley 
Fundraisers' Burbank office after receiving complaints that the firm was asking 
for donations to the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. No charges were filed 
because the search yielded no evidence connecting a specific person to any of 
the solicitations, Detective Steve Delamater said. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary obstacle to prosecuting fraudulent charitable solicitation is the 
difficulty of tying a victim's check to a misrepresentation made over the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many victims interviewed by The Times said the dozens of calls they 
received seemed to blend together in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was housing," one donor said, trying to recall her check 
to Children's Hospice Center. "They might have told me it was Special 
Olympics."

UNLIKELY PATH LED TO WILSON FOE'S FAR-RIGHT CHALLENGE; POLITICS: A COMPUTER 
'GENIUS' WITH A PASSION FOR GREEK PHILOSOPHY, RON UNZ HAS SET OUT TO JOLT THE 
GOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 32-year-old theoretical physicist Ron Unz decided to run for governor, 
even some friends tried to talk him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is not the kind of thing you expect geniuses to go into," said Eric 
Reyburn, who attended Harvard University with Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivko Knox, Unz's aunt, worried that the race would be brutal. "I said: 'Can 
you take criticism? What if you speak and people laugh at you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 David Horowitz, the conservative activist, was more blunt. Instead of a 
politician, Unz "looks like a person who reads science fiction novels at night 
and spends all the rest of his time on a computer talking to other people about 
science fiction," said Horowitz, who has spent hours discussing politics with 
Unz. "I told him: 'You're an intellectual. . . . Your passion is ideas. You'll 
be murdered.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Unz, the soft-spoken owner of a small computer software company in Silicon 
Valley, calculated the odds and made up his mind. A month ago he formally 
challenged Gov. Pete Wilson for the Republican nomination, launching a 
statewide media blitz financed with more than $1 million of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, Unz has blistered Wilson, calling him a hypocrite, an opportunist 
-- even a closet Democrat. The ultraconservative long shot has attacked the 
more moderate incumbent for raising taxes, bashing immigrants and supporting 
"the pathology of the social welfare state." Although he has been short on 
specific solutions, Unz's relentless debating style and his willingness to 
spend freely have won over some skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid he would embarrass himself. But he hasn't. I'm glad he's out 
there pushing," said Horowitz, who has dubbed Unz's campaign "The Revenge of 
the Nerds." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Steinberg, a Republican strategist, said his reservations have been 
replaced by enthusiasm. He tried to talk Unz out of running, he said -- but 
ended up signing on as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few people believe Unz can beat Wilson -- Unz admits that his campaign is an 
"uphill battle." Still, some Republicans worry that the young challenger will 
wound Wilson, making it easier for a Democrat to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign, which at first attempted to ignore Unz, recently began 
responding to him, labeling one TV ad in which he accused Wilson of letting Los 
Angeles burn during the 1992 riots "a new low" in the campaign. Though their 
recent tracking polls show only about 8% of Republicans would vote for Unz, 
Wilson's camp has begun to take him more seriously, poking into his background 
-- and informing reporters of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's spokesman, said one call to First Boston Bank, one of 
Unz's former employers, yielded this tidbit: Unz is remembered as the only job 
applicant ever to list his IQ on his resume.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Unz may have one of the few IQs worth noting on a resume. It has been 
estimated at 214, a statistic that one intelligence expert describes as "one in 
a million." Educated at Harvard, Cambridge and Stanford universities, he has 
mastered not only theoretical physics and computer programming, but also 
ancient Greek history. The author of several scholarly papers on the Spartan 
naval empire, he is probably the only gubernatorial candidate who warms to the 
subject of Plutarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of the Greek city states really gives you a sense of how nations 
or states can decline," said Unz, who claims that his many areas of expertise 
have each helped prepare him for executive office. "People told me that 
politics can be frustrating. But when you have sat month after month working on 
the same computer program, you get used to . . . incremental change." 
</P>
<P>
 Braininess does not necessarily yield political savvy. Unz used the 
mathematical concept of "expected return" to assess whether he should enter the 
race. Multiplying the probability by the possible payoff, he concluded that if 
he had at least a one-in-five chance, running would be worth it. But most 
political experts say he drastically misjudged the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 If Unz's intellect is unique among political candidates, Unz says that is not 
the reason to vote for him. Instead, he wants people to respond to his ideas -- 
among them, smaller government, fewer regulations and traditional values. He 
claims he, not Wilson, is in the Republican mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 He rails against bilingual education and affirmative action (policies that he 
says amount to "ethnic separatism") and bad-mouths welfare programs that he 
says foster "irresponsibility, illegitimacy and a total sense of disconnection 
from the work ethic in American society." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Unz's current ideology, one might never guess at his background.  
</P>
<P>
 Unz's ads describe him as "the Republican for governor," but he grew up a 
Democrat. He was born in the San Fernando Valley in 1961 and had his first 
involvement with politics at age 11 when he donned a McGovern T-shirt and 
accompanied his mother door to door, stumping for the Democratic presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate who vows to "roll back" public assistance programs once relied 
on those programs for survival -- when growing up in North Hollywood, he and 
his mother were on welfare. Unz, who today describes the culture of 
illegitimacy as a root cause of crime, was born out of wedlock -- a fact that 
made the young Unz feel "very ashamed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians might use such personal details to bolster their arguments. 
Unz, by contrast, prefers to keep them at a distance, discussing his childhood 
only at a reporter's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think my personal background has had much of an impact on my 
views," Unz said recently, moments after comparing his mother, Esther -- a 
former high school teacher who he says "made some stupid mistakes" -- to TV's 
"Murphy Brown." "The 'Murphy Brown' case works great on TV, but it's not clear 
to me that it works in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, Unz says, "the system worked." Enrolled in public schools, he 
proved a top student -- a math and debating whiz who as a senior in high school 
became the third Californian ever to win first place in the national 
Westinghouse talent search competition. Despite his own success story, he 
firmly believes that welfare does more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that the cost of living in America, if you're talking about 
living relatively simply, is pretty low. The marginal cost of eating simple 
foods and not starving is minimal. And there . . . would be more charitable 
organizations in society if these (welfare) programs didn't exist," he said, 
adding that he does not believe that the assistance he and his mother received 
"was that much of a help." 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Unz recalls things differently. To cut costs, she said, she and her 
young son lived with her parents. But when she fell ill and was unable to work, 
she applied for aid. The money she received from the government was essential, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron's father was out of the picture very soon. . . . But my parents' home was 
paid for. What saved us financially completely was there were no rent 
payments," she said, adding that her son's conservative views are something of 
a mystery to her. "For some reason he turned to the other side. I never tried 
to structure him as far as (political) party. He just kind of came out this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, she is immensely proud of her son and believes his 
sincerity and industriousness would make him an effective governor. She has 
long worried, however, that his penchant for hard work has left him without a 
fully rounded life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now all I can hope for is he will have time for some extracurricular life," 
she said. "And get a girl. Because he has had very few in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz says he wants to marry and have children, eventually. But when he puts his 
mind to something, he says, he focuses completely. For several years his 
financial software company, which devises specialized "code" to help Wall 
Street firms manage their investments efficiently, has been his primary 
fascination. So far he has not given his personal life the same kind of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to Unz's large Spanish-style home in Palo Alto reveals a life 
completely built around work. Three of the five bedrooms -- which house his 
company, Wall Street Analytics Inc. -- are filled with files and computer 
equipment. The rest of the house appears largely unoccupied. He sleeps on a 
mattress and box spring set on the floor. His spacious living room not only 
lacks furniture -- it is utterly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only lived here a year," he says, nodding toward a well-appointed 
kitchen he has never used. "Monomaniacal" is the word one friend says Unz uses 
to describe himself. Asked what he does for fun, he answers: "I've been very 
busy." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked the same question, Unz's best friends from Harvard do not hesitate. 
For fun, they said, Unz has always loved to talk politics. "Ron's idea of a 
good time at a party is to have five or six people stand around and talk about 
the issues of the day," said Reyburn, who fondly remembers a nightly college 
ritual: dinner, spiced with spirited political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an intellectual, not a party animal," recalled Robert Dujarric, another 
friend who remembers those dinners warmly. "He likes to talk to people. Even 
though he's very much at home in the realm of computer software and numbers, he 
likes to socialize." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz graduated in 1983 with a double major in theoretical physics and ancient 
history and headed to England. There on a Churchill Science Fellowship, he 
studied quantum gravitation under Stephen Hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While continuing his studies at Stanford in 1986, Unz and two of his former 
junior high school teachers developed a plan to create a public academy for Los 
Angeles County's high-ability students. Despite winning the support of some 
educators, the proposal was rejected by officials who worried that if an elite 
school drained off the best students, ordinary schools would become less 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz describes this incident, his first deep involvement on a public policy 
issue, as an eye-opener. He came to believe that if he wanted to improve 
society, he would have to get rich enough to champion the causes important to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a summer job on Wall Street in 1987, working in mortgage finance at 
First Boston Bank. He taught himself computer programming and soon wrote "The 
Solver," a program that used the computer to carve up mortgage loans into 
securities -- a series of calculations that until then had been done by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz's work was outstanding, his colleagues recall, and he accepted a full-time 
job. But some who worked with him said he could be inflexible when he believed 
he was right. It was that single-mindedness that ultimately led to his 
departure, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Warren, a managing director at First Boston who was hired the same day 
as Unz, recalled: "He came from an academic background where if your professor 
told you to do x, and you did y because it was better than x, and then you 
explained your reasoning -- your professor shook hands with you and said: 
'Congratulations, you were right.' He felt that was the way he was going to 
behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz's bosses did not share this approach. A few months after taking the job, 
Unz left to start his own company. For the next six years, Unz worked seven 
days a week, up to 20 hours a day, writing computer code in his modest 
apartment in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City appalled him. The crime and the poverty proved to Unz that 
welfare programs not only were not working but were the cause of society's 
decline. He began reading Commentary magazine, and was so impressed that he 
ordered 15 years of back issues. When his long hours started to pay off (his 
first sale, to a Wall Street investment firm, netted nearly $200,000), he used 
the money to fund conservative projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unz will not say what he is worth, but says he gave hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to think tanks such as the Manhattan Institute in New York City and to 
Linda Chavez's Center for the New American Community in Washington, D.C. Even 
before moving back to California two years ago, Unz sought out the Los 
Angeles-based Horowitz to see if he needed funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do this book 'Surviving the PC University,' " recalled Horowitz, 
co-founder of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. "He said: 'How much 
will it cost?' I said $10,000, and he pulled out his checkbook and wrote me a 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care much about money," said Unz, who drives a compact car and has 
spent more on clothing while preparing to become a candidate than he had during 
the previous several years. "The whole reason I wanted to make money was to be 
able to influence policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, when Unz realized that no other Republican was likely to 
challenge Wilson, that attitude made it easy for him to volunteer. To others, 
spending a hard-earned personal fortune to run what in all likelihood will be a 
losing race might seem crazy. To Unz, it was civic duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are, you lose. But if you don't try it, you're sure to lose," he 
said, adding that he plans to spend a lot more of his money before the June 7 
primary. "A lot of this is patriotism. . . . At some stage, individuals have to 
decide whether they're going to make an effort." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Unz's rhetoric has been dominated by criticism of Wilson. His lack of 
specific alternatives has hurt him even among some Republicans who dislike 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not for me," Dieter Holberg, a retired engineer, said after hearing Unz 
speak at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. "You can say, 'Cut 
things.'. . . But it would have been long done if it was easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But at times he strikes a chord. The California Republican Assembly, a 
conservative grass-roots organization, has endorsed him. And recently, after 
hearing Unz blast programs such as prenatal care, drug rehabilitation and "New 
Age self-esteem counseling," a few members of UC Berkeley's College Republicans 
came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a strong sense that here is a fundamentally competent person who is 
intelligent enough to grasp everything -- though that is not the same thing as 
being able to command or lead. But I don't particularly think that Wilson 
leads," said Gregory Sikorski, 27, a history major. "I will support him now and 
support the Republican (nominee) later."

<P>
 The scenario is called "nuclear dominoes," and it is every defense planner's 
nightmare -- because the first dominoes have already begun to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins this way: North Korea succeeds in putting a nuclear warhead atop a 
medium-range missile -- and then offers to sell similar weapons to other 
"outlaw states." Or Iran buys a nuclear bomb from the arsenal of the former 
Soviet Union. Or Ukraine declares itself a nuclear power and keeps some of the 
nuclear weapons already on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Those events are not fiction; all are under way already. 
</P>
<P>
 The "domino effect" is what happens next. If North Korea goes nuclear, South 
Korea and Japan seek atomic deterrents of their own. In response to Iran's 
coup, Saudi Arabia asks the United States to deploy nuclear weapons on its 
soil, and Israel targets Tehran with its own atomic warheads. If Ukraine stays 
nuclear, Russia begins rebuilding its armed forces, Germany and Poland think 
about atomic weapons, and Central Europe becomes a potential battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the end of the Cold War, the familiar terror of the old 
U.S.-Soviet nuclear stalemate has abruptly been replaced by new, more 
unpredictable dangers: The Bomb, with its power to level cities and destroy 
civilizations, is passing into many more hands. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton calls it "the biggest threat we will face." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend a lot of time on this issue," he said last year. "We have got to stop 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toughest issue there is," said Samuel W. Lewis, who recently retired 
as the State Department's chief of policy planning. "It keeps people awake at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern has been growing for more than a decade as the irresistible spread of 
technology made it possible for countries such as Israel, India and Pakistan to 
build atomic weapons on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But since 1990, three unexpected events have made the problem more pressing -- 
and more dangerous: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Persian Gulf War revealed that Iraq was much closer to developing 
nuclear weapons than the United States had realized -- and showed that the 
United Nations' safeguards against proliferation did not work. Before the war, 
U.S. intelligence knew of only two Iraqi nuclear-weapon development sites; 
after the war, they learned that there had been at least 20. "If that war had 
come a year or two later, we might have been looking at a nuclear Iraq," one 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collapse of the Soviet Union left more than 30,000 nuclear warheads 
under the uncertain control of an impoverished and disintegrating military 
Establishment. At some point, officials fear, some of those weapons will be 
sold on the black market to Iran, Libya or some other eager buyer. "That's the 
most frightening thing," said David Kay, the United Nations' former chief 
nuclear inspector. "I think it's inevitable . . . that at some point we will 
face either the use or the threat of use of former Soviet nuclear material." 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea's drive to develop its own nuclear weapons already has produced 
enough plutonium for two warheads and could soon produce enough for five more. 
What worries U.S. officials most is the prospect that the Pyongyang regime 
might sell nuclear warheads abroad, just as it has already sold medium-range 
missiles to Syria, Iran and possibly Libya. "North Korea is the destabilizing 
factor," a senior U.S. official said. "We are at a turning point with that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential sale of nuclear weapons from North Korea or the former Soviet 
Union raises an entirely new threat, what one official calls a "blowout" in the 
non-proliferation system. In the past, a country that wanted nuclear weapons 
had to spend years assembling nuclear material and warhead technology. Now, 
with enough money and the right connections, any country -- perhaps even a 
terrorist group -- could simply buy a nuclear arsenal "off the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, many more countries will want nuclear weapons -- if only to 
protect themselves against "outlaw nations" such as North Korea and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in time, they will get them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Countries who want the technology bad enough will eventually get it," Lt. 
Gen. James Clapper, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told a recent 
congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a future in which every major power has nuclear weapons," 
agreed Michael Vlahos, a strategist at the Center for Naval Analyses. "The only 
question is whether they use them or not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts believe that they already know the answer to that question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere, some time -- but in this decade -- somebody . . . is going to set 
off a nuclear weapon in deadly earnest," said Rear Adm. Edward D. Shaefer Jr., 
director of naval intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees with Shaefer's prediction. A few political scientists, 
such as UC Berkeley's Kenneth Waltz, even argue that proliferation can make the 
world more stable in the long run by making war so dangerous that it is 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly everyone agrees that as more countries acquire nuclear weapons, 
chances of something going wrong -- a misguided war, a miscalculation in crisis 
or a simple accident -- will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 That new reality has prompted a basic change in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the United States concentrated on preventing countries from gaining 
nuclear technology. Now, U.S. policy acknowledges that more countries may 
acquire atomic weapons and has added two additional goals: making proliferation 
safer and building "counter-proliferation" weapons in case a U.S. President 
decides to destroy a budding arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, for example, the United States cut off military sales 
to Pakistan to discourage it from pursuing nuclear weapons. But now that 
Pakistan's bomb is virtually acknowledged, the Clinton Administration is 
proposing to relax the sanctions and to begin talks on how to prevent 
accidental nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Frankel, editor of the journal Security Studies, calls this the "New 
York City public school solution": Like teen-agers and sex, nations that want 
nuclear weapons are going to do it anyway, and the best we can do is to help 
them do it safely. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Pentagon has launched a new counter-proliferation 
program to develop forces capable of destroying nuclear weapons and facilities 
abroad -- to prevent their shipment to another country or their use in a local 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 But proliferation does not only increase the probability of nuclear wars. It 
also changes the balance of world power and diminishes the superpower status of 
the United States. In the Gulf War, U.S. strategists worried that Iraq might 
use chemical weapons against U.S. troops or Israeli civilians -- but they never 
had to worry about nuclear weapons. If the United States ever considers another 
war with Iran, Iraq or North Korea, the story could be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to put us in a world much like that of the 1930s: a world of 
several equally sophisticated military powers, with no one clearly on top," 
Vlahos warned. "The conventional wisdom in defense planning is that we dominate 
the 'battle space' and we always will. But it isn't necessarily so. Nuclear 
weapons are a great equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that has a political as well as military impact. If a potential adversary 
has nuclear weapons, "the cost of intervention for the United States is much 
higher," a senior U.S. official said. This means that the other country has 
less reason to fear the United States -- and a freer hand to intimidate its own 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation outlook, region by region: 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea: CIA chief R. James Woolsey says the Communist regime of Kim Il 
Sung probably already has made at least one nuclear weapon using plutonium from 
its own atomic power plants. If North Korea goes ahead with plans to remove the 
fuel from its 25-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, it could extract enough 
plutonium to build several more. Coupled with a determined program to develop 
ballistic missiles -- and a penchant for selling weaponry to such customers as 
Iran and Syria -- the North Korean nuclear project is the world's most 
dangerous military enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 If North Korea goes nuclear, the effect on the rest of Asia will be immediate. 
South Korea, which abandoned nuclear weapons research under U.S. pressure in 
the 1970s, would clamor for atomic weapons. Japan, which officially has 
renounced nuclear weapons, would reconsider that stand -- and U.S. experts 
believe that Tokyo could build a bomb within months. Last year, Japan briefly 
balked at endorsing an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty -- apparently because some officials were not sure they could promise to 
stay non-nuclear forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, China is already modernizing its nuclear force, testing more 
accurate warheads and better missiles for medium-range targets such as Taiwan 
or Japan and for long-range targets such as the United States and European 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 A North Korean nuclear threat could prompt China to add more weapons to its 
arsenal of at least 450 warheads. China's nuclear strength, in turn, worries 
two neighbors: India, which already has nuclear warheads on medium-range 
ballistic missiles, and Taiwan, which has twice been stopped by the United 
States from launching a nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Iran and Iraq: The CIA says that Saddam Hussein's Iraq was only a year or 
two from testing a nuclear weapon when the Gulf War interrupted his program. 
U.S. officials say they believe that Iraq's weapon development program is 
moribund but almost certainly will be revived if U.N. inspections ease up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Iran is working hard to acquire nuclear weapons. The CIA has said 
Tehran's dogged domestic research program is making only slow progress and 
still appears at least eight years from producing a weapon. As a result, Iran 
has stepped up its efforts to buy warheads or nuclear material from the former 
Soviet Union. Iranian agents reportedly have been sighted in Russia and 
Kazakhstan in search of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of an Iranian bomb would be immense -- in both the Middle East and 
farther afield. Nuclear weapons would make Iran the most powerful country on 
the gulf, able to intimidate its neighbors without fear of military reaction 
from the United States or Iraq. A nuclear Iran could seize territory or demand 
cuts in others' oil production. Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Israel would all view an 
Iranian bomb as a direct threat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis would probably react by seeking more protection from the United 
States. Israeli leaders might well be tempted to launch a preemptive strike 
against the Iranian nuclear force, just as they bombed Iraq's Osirak reactor in 
1981. Even Turkey, Kazakhstan and Russia would feel nervous about an Iranian 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 * Libya: Col. Moammar Kadafi reportedly has been negotiating to buy ballistic 
missiles from North Korea and may also be in the market for nuclear weapons. 
U.S. analysts do not believe that Libya has significant nuclear research 
ability of its own. If Libya acquired nuclear weapons, its potential targets 
would include Israel, Egypt and U.S. forces in Europe. And Libya's long history 
of support for terrorist groups, from Palestinian guerrillas to the Irish 
Republican Army, would raise the specter of an atomic weapon falling into their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ukraine: In January, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed agreements 
with the United States and Russia to remove and dismantle the estimated 1,656 
nuclear warheads in Ukraine within seven years. But U.S. officials still worry 
privately that Ukraine, fearful of neighboring Russia, will be tempted to hang 
on to a deterrent force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're holding our breath and crossing our fingers," one official admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ukrainian nuclear force would heighten tension in Eastern Europe -- and 
probably prompt neighboring Germany, Poland, Hungary and Belarus to reconsider 
their non-nuclear status. And in the event of a civil war in Ukraine, the 
presence of nuclear weapons could provoke Russian intervention rather than 
deter it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability of smaller countries to acquire nuclear weapons does not mean that 
they will actually do so, officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the last decade offers three examples of countries that abandoned 
nuclear weapons projects. South Africa built a nuclear force of six bombs, 
apparently for possible use against its black citizens, but destroyed them in 
1993. Brazil and Argentina were on the way to building nuclear arsenals for use 
against each other but managed to turn back in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the lesson of half a century of nuclear weaponry is that the drive to 
acquire atomic hardware is rarely predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Josef Stalin shocked the United States when he detonated the first Soviet atom 
bomb in 1949; China surprised the West in 1964; Iraq stunned the United Nations 
when its nuclear enterprise was discovered in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that we've seen so many sudden and surprising developments 
that we have to anticipate more of them," said Leonard S. Spector, a 
non-proliferation specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, the nuclear allergy in Ukraine and Japan . . . may not last 
forever," he said. "As soon as the security environment becomes more dangerous, 
people begin to rethink things.

 "The danger is to think that there is only going to be incremental change. 
That isn't going to happen. There are probably going to be some big shocks." 
Nuclear Weapons: A Growth Industry 
</P>
<P>
 Countries ranging from Israel to Pakistan have developed atomic weapons, 
thanks to the spread of technology around the globe. Many more are on the verge 
of having weapons, either through their own development programs or by buying 
necessary components. 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTRIES WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS: 
</P>
<P>
 United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, Israel, India, Pakistan, 
Ukraine*, Belarus*, Kazakhstan* 
</P>
<P>
 * Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan inherited part of the nuclear forces of the 
former Soviet Union; all three have pledged to remove or dismantle nuclear 
warheads on their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD: 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTRIES WITH ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS: 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, Iran 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTRIES WITH POTENTIAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS: 
</P>
<P>
 Algeria, Libya, Egypt, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Poland, Germany WHAT TO 
WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 1. North Korea's nuclear project is the world's most dangerous military 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Iraq was only a year or two from testing a nuclear weapon when the Persian 
Gulf interrupted, the CIA says. 
</P>
<P>
 3. If Libya acquires nuclear weapons, potential targets would include Israel 
and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 4. A Ukrainian nuclear force would heighten tension in East Europe -- and 
probably prompt neighboring Germany, Hungary and Poland to speed up development 
of nuclear weapons.

CIVIL WAR RAGES AMONG HOLOCAUST REVISIONISTS; COURTS: AT STAKE ARE CONTROL OF 
THE COSTA MESA INSTITUTE FOR HISTORICAL REVIEW AND A $10-MILLION BEQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the morning of the coup d'etat, Willis Carto could be found clinging to the 
glass doors of his cherished institute like a tough sea barnacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiftly, the mutineers moved to oust Carto, a stubborn and wiry man of 67 
years who had founded and shaped the obscure Institute for Historical Review 
into a right-wing think tank that critics call the "spine of the international 
Holocaust denial movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurrection finished with a slam of a door and Carto in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did not put a close to the civil war that rages within a small circle 
of Holocaust "historical revisionists," who are more accustomed to fighting 
facts like the gas ovens of Auschwitz or the World War II extermination of 6 
million Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that sunny autumn day Oct. 15 -- when the founder and the institute's 
insurgent staff unclenched their fists and laid down a club, a cement-filled 
can, wire-clippers, a sawed-off garden handle and a handgun -- the rival 
factions have continued battling for control of the institute with lawsuits and 
poisonous prose. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter power struggle is outlined in voluminous court documents in three 
lawsuits filed in Orange County Superior Court. Carto has declined to discuss 
the matter except through his court declarations and letters to supporters.  
</P>
<P>
 At stake is not only the 16-year-old Costa Mesa-based institute and its 
shadowy web of political connections, but a generous bequest of more than $10 
million in stock share certificates from the late granddaughter of inventor 
Thomas Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 And much like their lingering squabble over history, everyone involved has a 
sinister theory about the spark that burned the bonds of the founder and staff 
of six longtime editorial employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Subterranean forces. Greed. Money. Racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Inadequate health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure this is personally difficult for Carto," said Kenneth S. Stern, the 
author of "Holocaust Denial" and the American Jewish Committee's specialist on 
hate groups. "This is the man behind the curtain who has been pulling the 
strings for years. Carto was the guiding force behind the institute, the one 
who pulled together the white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Is it going to fall 
apart? These people are all committed to the same goals. They're fighting over 
money, tactics and personality, but their common agenda is one of promoting 
Nazism and xenophobia." 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream Jewish organizations, alarmed by the spread of Holocaust denial 
theories, said the split is a boon because it divided key figures who promote 
the movement as a serious enterprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever enemies are fighting with each other that is a positive sign," said 
Aaron Breitbart, a senior researcher for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. "Let them shoot each other. You don't hear a lot of human rights 
groups talking about this because they feel they should fight it out. Maybe 
they'll manage to wreck each other's camp." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From an unassuming suburban headquarters in Orange County, the institute has 
emerged over the last decade as an international forum for right-wing 
ideologues from Europe and the United States who have used the pages of the 
institute's glossy Journal of Historical Review to debate arcane themes such as 
whether the diary of Anne Frank was a fraud or the concentration camp gas 
chambers possessed the actual capacity to execute 6 million Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the institute reaped international publicity and Movie of the Week 
immortality after it paid $90,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by an Auschwitz 
concentration camp survivor, Mel Mermelstein. Mermelstein sued after 
unsuccessfully demanding the institute's $50,000 reward offer for proof that 
the Nazis operated execution gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Carto's unceremonious ouster, his wife and another ally have filed a 
lawsuit and an appeal in Orange County Superior Court seeking unsuccessfully to 
regain control of the institute. He has also circulated angry letters, linking 
the rebel staff to his familiar enemies like Mermelstein, the Anti- Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith and a catch-all category of "political Zionists." In 
court documents, he hints that the Church of Scientology is a backstage force; 
two of the rebel staff members are Scientologists who deny religion played a 
role in the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certain there are many more motives at work," Carto wrote in a letter 
shared with his supporters, "not the least of which -- in addition to Zionist 
forces -- are pure greed and also the involvement of a bizarre, mind-bending, 
Jim Jones-like cult, which has a long history of infiltrating and ruining 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Carto was a man who selected his enemies with care. Over 16 years, he 
handpicked or approved every one of the rebel staff members who shared his 
theories that the Holocaust killings had been greatly exaggerated for WWII 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most enduring figures of the postwar right, Carto had been active 
in conservative politics since the 1950s when he organized the Liberty Lobby, a 
Washington-based group which publishes a weekly tabloid called The Spotlight 
that was supportive of former Klansman David Duke's political aspirations. The 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith scorns the lobby as "the most active 
anti-Semitic organization in the country . . . a multimillion operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin Suall, director of fact finding for the ADL in New York, said his 
organization has been monitoring Carto's activities for decades. "We regard him 
as probably the leading anti-Semite in the country because of his funds, 
resources and publications at his command," he said. Yet, even with that 
well-known reputation, the staff eventually came to view their founder as an 
edgy, cantankerous Captain Queeg who was steering the institute too far 
starboard. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, they complained that he treated them like children and skimped 
on their pay. He was so intent on saving money, they said, that he lowered the 
air conditioning during peak summer days. He exhorted them to conserve paper 
clips. Longstanding employees said they lacked health benefits, a sore issue 
that a lower-ranking staff member huffed about even in the midst of the October 
coup d'etat. 
</P>
<P>
 They blamed Carto, too, for economizing on the institute's fire insurance 
coverage, which became a compelling issue after the group's former quarters in 
Torrance were destroyed in a July, 1984, firebombing that caused $300,000 in 
damages. The group was insured for only $50,000. One employee bitterly observed 
in a court declaration that only Carto's locked personal office -- which 
contained four heavy bronze busts of Hitler -- was unscathed by fire.  
</P>
<P>
 And in interviews and court documents, they criticized Carto for botching the 
handling of the celebrated Mermelstein case, which later was made into a Movie 
of the Week with Leonard Nimoy and Dabney Coleman in starring roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carto's launching and subsequent mishandling of the reward offer wound up 
costing a $90,000 settlement with Mermelstein and another $30,000 in attorney's 
fees and $20,000 in lost productivity, not to mention embarrassment and 
widespread alienation of supporters," wrote director Thomas J. Marcellus in a 
court declaration in connection with the lawsuit debating control of the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the growing resentment finally exploded on the issue of race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main problem was editorial direction," Mark Weber, editor of the Journal 
for Historic Review, said in an interview. "He wanted to make substantive 
changes in the direction of the review. He wanted to become more 'racialist,' 
to make it more clearly white racist." 
</P>
<P>
 Carto's intent became clear last April, according Marcellus, who remembered a 
table-pounding session of outbursts "a la Nikita Khrushchev." 
</P>
<P>
 While the senior staff editors listened in dismay, they said, Carto declared 
his intention to slash journal stories devoted to the Holocaust by 80%. 
Eventually, they were told, the topic would vanish entirely along with the name 
of the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus of the new journal would be race and multiculturalism," recalled 
Weber in a letter to subscribers. "In one written memo, Carto called for an 
article to appear 'proving' the partial African ancestry of President (Dwight) 
Eisenhower. . . . The staff told Carto that to transform our journal into such 
a periodical would be suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, they had tried to win a measure of credibility for their movement 
with a journal that strived for a sober tone although mainstream historians 
still scoffed at the results. Suddenly, it appeared to the staff members that 
their glossy, scholarly-looking journal -- with a paid circulation of 6,000 -- 
was in danger of transforming into little more than a crude racist rag. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his own correspondence to old allies in the Holocaust denial movement, 
Carto would later argue that he simply was trying to expand the focus of the 
journal to include articles on ancient history, culture, art, religion, 
philosophy, social and racial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff didn't buy the Renaissance argument; they threatened mass 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having suffered Carto's machinations, hair-brained (sic) schemes, 
mismanagement, insults and irrationality long enough, the senior staff met to 
determine the course of action to stop Carto from taking harmful actions," said 
Marcellus in his court declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly devised a strategy, turning for advice to the same Santa Ana 
attorney who had defended the institute in the Mermelstein lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the employees started researching Carto's ties to the institute's 
parent corporation, the Legion for the Survival of Freedom Inc. He discovered, 
according to the staff's court declarations, that the Texas-based nonprofit 
corporation had listed a corporate director who had been dead for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then as the summer progressed, Marcellus discovered a $100,000 bank order for 
Carto's Liberty Lobby. It was drawn on a Swiss bank account holding funds for 
the Legion from the Jean Farrel Edison bequest, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, the granddaughter of Thomas Edison, was a heiress to the Edison 
fortune who died in 1985, leaving conflicting instructions about the dispersal 
of her estate. A handwritten will bequeathed the money -- then estimated at $40 
million -- to a South African-born woman who was Edison's neighbor in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legion also had a claim to the money because Edison left further 
instructions that only a Legion representative could open the four safe-deposit 
boxes in Europe, Asia and the United States, which contained cash certificates 
for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the boxes and $20 million in certificates were found, according to 
Suall of the ADL, who said the fourth box in Singapore was never located. The 
Legion and the neighbor fought over the money in Swiss courts, eventually 
splitting the estate in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 During settlement conferences related to the Mermelstein case, the institute's 
attorney, William S. Hulsey, remembered how Carto acknowledged the existence of 
the legacy, describing it as "considerably smaller because it had been 
contested by various Jewish groups." 
</P>
<P>
 "Carto told me that he had been distributing the Farrel Edison bequest 'to 
good causes' but did not say to whom," Marcellus said in court documents. He 
added that Carto's wife, Elisabeth, told him that Carto had set up a separate 
corporation called Vebit Inc. to control the money and loan it back to the 
Legion. The loans and debts would then make the Legion an unappealing target 
for lawsuits, according to Marcellus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, said Marcellus, the institute, which has a mailing list of 30,000, 
had shifted its assets between various corporations to avoid losing property in 
an unfavorable lawsuit. But never had they considered that they would unleash 
the lawyers on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In his court declaration, Carto lashed out at the accusations of "lying, 
cheating, falsifying, committing fraud etc. These brazen smears prove that (the 
staff) is trying to obfuscate the one significant fact: that I founded and 
built the IHR using what help I could get and usually paying for it with the 
dollars of sincere and concerned Americans. And I did this in the teeth of the 
opposition of extremely powerful and entrenched forces, which had no wish to 
have me succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the senior staff members and their attorney would persuade two 
elderly directors of the board for the Legion to resign because of the 
allegations about Carto. Then the remaining third board member was enlisted to 
appoint a slate of new directors in the rebel camp. 
</P>
<P>
 That director, Thomas Kerr, eventually came to regret his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was misled as to the facts," said Kerr, a retiree and part-time translator 
who added in an interview that he appointed new board members because he 
thought he had no other choice. "I think it's all about money. They believe 
Willis Carto has a tremendous amount of money that was left to the Legion in 
the will. They think he has it and they mean to get ahold of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the new board voted to terminate all association with Carto. At 
present, the fractured relationship of Carto and his historians are being 
sorted out in Orange County Superior Court where the three lawsuits stemming 
from the takeover are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Judge Robert J. Polis already has ruled that the new board has 
authority to run the institute, concluding that "Willis Carto was exercising 
substantial control over the Legion without any apparent legal authority." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still awaiting judgment is the staff's civil damage claim for the fateful fall 
day when Carto returned to the headquarters after the senior editors engineered 
his termination. 
</P>
<P>
 While the editors were away, Carto notified their attorney that he was seizing 
control. Meanwhile, according to remaining staff members, Carto and his wife 
and three men set about disconnecting the office telephones, disabling the 
computers and changing the locks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to keep from laughing," recalled Hulsey, the staff attorney who 
raced to the office after receiving the faxed declaration of war. "It was like 
something out of Woody Allen's Banana Republic. Who would control the 
headquarters? The staff arrives, forces the door and then fistfights start 
breaking out all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually police arrived and Carto was arrested along with some of the other 
staff members. Charges were never filed against any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulsey's last memory of the melee is an indelible image of Willis Carto with 
one foot wedged in the door. Nearby a staff editor brandished a gun to break up 
a wrestling match on the floor. Meanwhile, other institute historians were 
struggling mightily to shove Carto out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder's screams filled the room: "You're killing me!"

PALIMONY TRIAL IS A DAYTIME HIT; COURTS: BROADCAST OF SPLIT OF CLAIRE AND TONY 
MAGLICA, A HIGH SOCIETY ORANGE COUNTY COUPLE, DRAWS VIEWERS NATIONWIDE. 
LOYALTIES ARE ABOUT EVENLY DIVIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Move over, Luke and Laura. These days, daytime television watchers are glued 
to the real-life drama of Claire and Tony, the high society Orange County 
couple whose bitter palimony battle is being broadcast live from Santa Ana on 
Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the cable network that broadcasts trials from all over the country, and 
this week network officials say they have been swamped with hundreds of calls 
from viewers hooked on Maglica vs. Maglica: women who are rooting for Claire to 
triumph over her lover, whom they have decided is greedy; men who grouse that 
the network's female commentators are unfairly biased in favor of Claire and 
insist that she is the greedy one. 
</P>
<P>
 For those just tuning in, Claire Maglica is suing Anthony Maglica for half of 
Mag Instrument Inc., a flashlight empire she estimates is worth $400 million. 
He is the company's president. She is the executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls and letters to Court TV have not been overwhelmingly in favor of 
either Claire or Anthony Maglica and are not necessarily split along gender 
lines, said Debby Fry Wilson, vice president of public and governmental affairs 
at the network.  
</P>
<P>
 But emotions are running high. Just listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Maglica case, I resent the fact that your analysts all favor the 
plaintiff. In this case, it is very clear that Claire is an embezzling liar and 
Mr. Maglica is an honorable man," said one middle-aged man from the 
southeastern United States who called the network last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound harsh? Consider this counterpunch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Maglica is making a career out of being a poor, old, misunderstood, 
befoggled, poor-English-speaking, heart-of-gold foreigner struggling to make 
good in America," one man said April 18. "Everyone is dancing to his tune, and 
he should get an Academy Award." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hills couple have rubbed shoulders with U.S. presidents, sent 
generous contributions to the Republican Party and made headlines last year 
when they airlifted a blinded Bosnian boy to California for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Maglicas lived together for more than 22 years and were known to 
many as husband and wife, they never married. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury began deliberating Wednesday in their 
palimony trial, which has been broadcast live for the past six weeks on Court 
TV, the three-year-old, New York-based cable network which is available to more 
than 14 million households nationwide. It is carried by some Los Angeles County 
cable companies, but is not available in Orange County unless you have a 
satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
 If Claire Maglica prevails, legal experts say, the case could lead to the 
biggest palimony settlement ever.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, 60, and Anthony, a 64-year-old Croatian immigrant, worked side 
by side for more than two decades, turning a small machine shop into the 
Ontario-based Mag Instrument Inc., maker of the popular Mag-Lite flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 She says Anthony vowed to her repeatedly that they would always share 
everything. He says he made it perfectly clear the houses and business belonged 
only to him. 
</P>
<P>
 So who do viewers believe? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bless her if Claire can get even $5 from this fellow who she lived with for 
20 years," said one woman over 55 years old who declined to say where she was 
calling from. One young woman called in asking for Claire Maglica's address "so 
I can write her words of support." 
</P>
<P>
 But some sneered, complaining about gender bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guest commentators in the Maglica case are women and are favoring Claire 
Maglica. This is one-sided," one young man from the Northwest said. "The women 
need to be more fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry Wilson said that Court TV, also known as the Courtroom Television Network, 
keeps track of its daily calls from viewers. transcribing the comments and 
recording each caller's age range and where they are calling from. Calls peaked 
at about 1,000 a week during the murder trial of Lyle and Eric Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that all of the network's commentators are attorneys, and that if 
they issue opinions, they do so based on their professional expertise, not 
their emotions.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Maglica case, the issues "really hit home," Fry Wilson said. "It's a 
trial that anyone can identify with, being that it's a domestic dispute, and 
unfortunately half our population will go through these kinds of issues -- 
splitting the family assets, or separating business assets."

PERILOUS STATE OF AFFAIRS; MEXICO: AS BAJA CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR, ERNESTO RUFFO 
APPEL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MANY REFORMS. BUT THE RECENT BOUT OF SLAYINGS AND 
SCANDALS THREATENS TO ENGULF HIS OPPOSITION PARTY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid assassinations, drug violence and political combat, Ernesto Ruffo Appel 
still projects the image of the down-to-earth businessman who five years ago 
became Mexico's first opposition governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of changing times are unmistakable, however. The man who once 
shunned ostentatious entourages, mixing easily with dockworkers and Japanese 
investors alike, now travels around Baja California with a phalanx of wary 
bodyguards. Although Ruffo's manner is still cheerful and plain-spoken, he 
looks tired of late. 
</P>
<P>
 And the governor's words convey the gravity of recent events that seemed 
unthinkable when, as Ensenada mayor and a reform-minded political newcomer, he 
launched his historic bid for the Baja governorship. In two grim months, he has 
endured a scandal caused by a drug-related shootout between federal and state 
police, the assassinations in Tijuana of a presidential candidate and the 
city's police chief, and the arrest by federal authorities of his deputy 
attorney general on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dangerous game," Ruffo said during an interview Thursday at his 
official residence in this desert city that serves as Baja's capital. "And I 
don't even want to call it a game, because I never wanted to be a player in 
such things. But well, these are things that fall into my area, and what can I 
do? I hope that after this I can live a peaceful life." 
</P>
<P>
 This unconventional leader of a prosperous border state has brought about 
landmark electoral and human rights reforms, infrastructure improvements, 
international investment. He has led a campaign for democratization and urged 
greater power for states in the rigidly centralized Mexican system. 
</P>
<P>
 But that has been overshadowed by the violence that threatens to engulf his 
government, which is controlled by the National Action Party (PAN). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Ruffo approaches the end of his six-year term, critics say his greatest 
weakness has been the persistence of law enforcement corruption. They fault the 
governor for remaining loyal to Juan Francisco Franco Rios, who stepped down as 
attorney general last month as the result of accusations of links to drug 
mafias. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug traffickers have continued functioning with great impunity and 
tolerance on the part of the government," said Victor Clark Alfaro, a noted 
Tijuana human rights activist who has conducted an independent probe of police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo's state has become another battleground in Mexico's crisis, a northern 
counterpart to the conflict in the southern border state of Chiapas. The line 
between border drug wars and high-stakes political intrigue in Baja is blurring 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very vulnerable to having his image and his legacy seriously damaged by 
all of this," said Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center of U.S.-Mexico 
Studies at UC San Diego. "He's done a lot of very important and constructive 
things in his state." 
</P>
<P>
 As turmoil deepens in a presidential election year, hostility between the 
state government under the PAN and the federal government of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has escalated. Ruffo says he has been 
the target of unprecedented political attacks. He describes tense verbal 
exchanges with top Mexican officials, who he says have urged him to remain 
silent about the unsolved slaying of candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Ruffo, the 
most prominent opposition figure involved in the investigation, has been more 
willing than federal authorities to discuss the unanswered questions in the 
assassination probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo said he simply wants the Colosio case "cleared up. I want the truth to 
be known. . . . If not, this story will remain associated with us. And Tijuana 
will never get rid of that image." 
</P>
<P>
 The assassinations of Colosio and of Federico Benitez Lopez, Tijuana's police 
chief and a close ally of the governor, have also left Ruffo concerned about 
his safety. He and Tijuana Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime have beefed up what were 
previously unobtrusive security details. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is enormous risk," Ruffo said. "A chief of police dies, an honest, 
dedicated man, who in my judgment was free of any corruption. It seems that the 
bad guys are defeating the good guys." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks preceding his death in a highway ambush, the chief was worried 
because he had rejected a $100,000 bribe from drug gangsters who wanted him to 
curb anti-narcotics operations, Ruffo said. But Ruffo did not discard a 
possible connection to the Colosio case; some observers say the chief was 
killed because he was looking into the assassination on behalf of Ruffo and had 
raised doubts about the official version. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Benitez's murder, tensions between Ruffo and Mexican Atty. 
Gen. Diego Valades broke into the open. Federal agents dispatched by Valades on 
Tuesday arrested another Ruffo ally, Deputy State Atty. Gen. Sergio Ortiz Lara, 
at his office on charges of drug corruption. The accompanying deployment of 100 
heavily armed federal agents, who briefly confronted state judicial police 
after Ortiz was hustled away at gunpoint, prompted fears of renewed combat 
between state and federal officers in downtown Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general charges Ortiz with aiding the escape of gunmen of the 
Arellano drug cartel during the March 3 shootout between state and federal 
forces that killed a federal commander and four others, including a state 
police officer who was allegedly guarding a drug lord. Investigators are also 
looking into the deputy attorney general's possible involvement in the police 
chief's murder, Valades said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been implications that Benitez's death is linked to his supposed 
investigation of corrupt state officials -- something Ruffo angrily disputes. 
In fact, he and his backers suggest that Ortiz's arrest has more to do with 
politics than crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The political hostilities grow partly from a stark reality in Baja: a justice 
system besieged by Mexico's drug mafias. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellano cartel is warring for control of one of the world's most 
lucrative smuggling corridors. Two years of machine gun murders and brazen gun 
battles in the border region and elsewhere culminated in the slaying last year 
of the cardinal of Guadalajara by Arellano gunmen, who police say were trying 
to kill an enemy kingpin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo has failed to eradicate corruption in state law enforcement, critics 
say. They say the governor protected the recently replaced former attorney 
general, Franco, despite serious questions about Franco's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo admits that federal authorities are investigating Franco, who is 
reportedly the ultimate target of the probe accelerated by the dramatic arrest 
of the deputy attorney general last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor maintains that he has not seen proof that Franco broke the 
law. Ruffo described a federal investigative dossier on Franco as a "political 
document." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo said the state and federal forces have problems with corruption. The 
truth behind the chaotic gunfight pitting state against federal police on March 
3, Ruffo said, appears to be more complicated than the federal government's 
description: that state officers in league with cartel gunmen ambushed an elite 
federal unit trying to arrest a top lieutenant of the Arellanos. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo believes that some of the federal officers were also working for 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by Baja's independent human rights ombudsman provides some backing 
for that view. The April 11 report is damaging to the state police and 
implicates many state officers, including a former station commander and a 
former chief bodyguard for the fired attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the report concludes that federal officers may also 
have been involved in criminal activity, an allegation made by veteran federal 
officers and Mexican newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state-federal friction is ironic when compared to the harmony that 
prevailed when Ruffo won the Baja elections in 1989. President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari was widely credited with stepping in and "allowing" the PAN its 
first victory ever, despite the objections of the local PRI, whose 
administration had been racked by scandal and incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo says he has a good relationship with Salinas. Top Mexican officials have 
been attentive to the governor, according to Cornelius of UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a true test of a modernizing, supposedly democratizing, central 
government to work with an opposition government in an important state and 
forge a constructive working partnership," Cornelius said.  
</P>
<P>
 The PAN has subsequently won two other states and Ruffo has been the topic of 
speculation as a future presidential candidate. Looking back, Ruffo seems 
bemused at the speed with which he left behind neophyte local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never studied for this or thought it was going to be my career or 
anything," he said, with the direct manner that distinguishes him from the 
stiff, florid style of stereotypical Mexican politicos.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo, a 41-year-old father of three, is the son of a self-made merchant from 
La Paz. His father arrived in Ensenada with little money or education and 
established a seafood packaging firm. Ruffo grew up working in the port of 
Ensenada, an experience that he says cultivated his rapport with working-class 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young executive, he drifted into opposition politics, he said, after 
publicly denouncing the government corruption he encountered while working for 
a seafood concern owned by U.S. and Mexican partners. He ended up running for 
mayor of Ensenada in 1986, with decidedly modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I know I'm going to give them a real fight here in Ensenada, but I 
know that since I'm on my own, they're not going to let me win.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who wins the three-way race for president, Ruffo said, the next 
federal administration will include cabinet-level representatives of opposition 
parties for the first time. That is just one of the democratic advances that he 
says are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many established interests and old ways of doing politics, there 
are old ways of doing business, that are accustomed to their advantages and 
don't want to give them up," he said. "But there are many Mexicans who want to 
share the benefits. And I think it is only natural that the sharing of wealth 
and political power will resolve the problems."

WAVE OF BEACHINGS BAFFLES EXPERTS; MARINE LIFE: SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO 
DISCOVER WHY AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF WHALES AND DOLPHINS HAVE BECOME 
STRANDED ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual episode that is baffling scientists and upsetting beach-goers, 
two dozen dolphins and sperm whales have washed ashore along a 110-mile stretch 
of California's Central Coast, sparking an intensive hunt for a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious strandings, which began April 3, have been clustered in San 
Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, between San Simeon and Refugio State 
Beach. All but three of the marine mammals have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have no idea what's going on," said James Lecky, chief of 
the protected species division at the National Marine Fisheries Service. "There 
are no common symptoms, no obvious causes of death. What we do know is that 
these strandings are occurring at a much higher frequency than we expect to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, marine scientists recorded fewer than 30 strandings of common 
dolphins and sperm whales along the entire California shoreline. In the five 
weeks since this spring's wave of beachings began, 21 dolphins and three whales 
have washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, volunteers in a statewide marine mammal stranding network have 
rushed to the Central Coast, rescuing the victims and collecting the dead for 
laboratory studies that may reveal clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the species' population levels are strong, scientists worry that the 
deaths could be an indicator of disease or the presence of toxic substances, 
either naturally occurring or people-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to go into a panic mode yet, but we're certainly concerned and 
we need to figure this out," said John Heyning, curator of marine mammals at 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Heyning will perform necropsies on several carcasses, hunting for 
diseased organs or other obvious explanations of mortality. Scientists 
elsewhere are conducting lab work, including toxicology tests to look for the 
presence of heavy metals or other contaminants. Unraveling the mystery could 
take months or years, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Theories about the beachings abound. One possibility is that shifts in ocean 
currents have redistributed the species' food source, forcing them closer to 
shore to feed. If that is the case, the strandings could simply be evidence of 
natural deaths that would usually occur at sea, Lecky said. 
</P>
<P>
 A "red tide" of toxins, caused by algae blooms, is another suspect, and a 
disease epidemic could also be to blame. In the late 1980s, 2,500 Atlantic 
bottlenosed dolphins died of a virus that was not identified until years later. 
So far, that culprit -- the morbillivirus -- has not been detected on the West 
Coast, and tests for it on one of the surviving dolphins were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Central Coast, some residents see a connection with a massive spill 
of petroleum thinner at an oil field owned by Unocal Corp. The site of the 
8.5-million-gallon spill -- which occurred over a period of 40 years and was 
only acknowledged by Unocal in March -- is three miles south of Pismo Dunes, 
where seven mammals washed up. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Fish and Game plans to conduct tests to uncover a 
possible relationship with the spill, but scientists do not believe that one 
exists. The petroleum, they say, would probably have evaporated or become 
diluted before reaching the dolphins and sperm whales feeding offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ruling it out, but I would think we'd have seen die-offs of birds and 
other more susceptible animals" if the oil were to blame, Heyning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sperm whale -- memorialized in fiction by the mighty Moby Dick -- is the 
largest of the toothed whales, with males reaching up to 60 feet in length. 
Sperm whales are also among the deepest- and longest-diving mammals in the sea, 
able to plunge 6,000 feet and remain submerged for up to 90 minutes. None of 
the beached whales survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolphins that have washed ashore include two species -- the long-beaked 
and short-beaked common dolphin. Known to form exceptionally large schools, 
they are the most common cetaceans found off California. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the sperm whale nor the common dolphin is endangered. There are an 
estimated 750 sperm whales in the state's waters, Heyning said, and about 
240,000 common dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those numbers, a beached mammal -- especially one flopping futilely on 
the sand -- is a distressing sight. At Pismo Dunes, beach-goers encountering 
the seafaring victims have been pretty upset, said Don Patton, superintendent 
of the state recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see quite an emotional response because you don't find these animals lying 
around in our artificial world very often," Patton said. "These things have 
washed up in popular areas of the beach, and with the live ones, we've had 
large numbers of people in the water, trying to coax them back out to sea." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging a distressed mammal to return to the ocean is not necessarily 
advised. Although beachings remain one of nature's mysteries, experts say 
creatures that wash ashore are typically too weak, diseased or disoriented to 
swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, they just hit the shore and are too sick and confused to do 
anything about it," said Heyning, who has studied hundreds of strandings. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, most mammals that wash ashore die before volunteers from 
California's marine mammal stranding network can race to their aid, said Joe 
Cordaro, a federal wildlife biologist and coordinator of the network. Even if 
rescuers arrive in time, he said, the journey to a rehabilitation site is 
stressful, and often fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, three dolphins remain alive. Two were driven to San Diego's 
Sea World -- traveling on foam pads in the back of a truck, where attendants 
kept them covered with wet towels and made sure their blowholes were clear. Sea 
World's curator of mammals said the dolphins are in stable but poor condition, 
with one requiring assistance to eat and another receiving antibiotics for an 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The third survivor -- named "Catalina Bob" by his rescuers and "C53," for 
Cetacean 53, by scientists -- is doing better, recuperating at Marine 
World/Africa USA in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Hanni, science director for the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, 
which deploys volunteer rescuers, pronounced Bob "in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 "Diagnostic tests turned up nothing conclusive," she said. "If all goes well, 
we hope to release Bob in Monterey Bay on Monday."

ON CALIFORNIA: WHEE! THE PEOPLE

 " I am not a gifted public speaker. In fact, I am not even an average speaker. 
" -- Wolf Dalichau, announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate 
</P>
<P>
 Modern politics requires modern methods, and so Wolf Dalichau has been 
brushing up on sound bites. He sits in his campaign office here, a couple doors 
down from his Rollin' Pin Bake Shop on Glendale Boulevard, and recites the 
one-liners that seem to play well on those rare occasions he is actually 
invited to speak somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a joke about my German accent," the baker says. "I say, 'Nobody 
complained about Lawrence Welk's accent.' They get a kick out of that. Or I 
tell them, 'I have worked with more dough than all the senators put together.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles at his own jokes, and then pauses, straining to remember some more. 
He can't. "I am drawing a blank," he says with a shrug. "Usually it's just 
something about dough." 
</P>
<P>
 Okay, so maybe Wolf Dalichau is not ready for Leno. He has more on his mind 
than comedy. A political neophyte, he announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate 
in January -- eager, to quote a campaign flyer, "to give a voice to 
Californians who cry out for change." Ready, as another press release put it, 
to do battle on behalf of "we, the people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since entering the Republican primary, Dalichau has waged a relentless and, 
until now, largely unsuccessful campaign to see his name published in a 
newspaper. He figures he has sent at least 20 letters to this newspaper alone. 
To his dismay, almost all the media attention in the GOP primary race has 
focused so far on Michael Huffington, the mega-millionaire from Texas who also 
wants to displace Sen. Dianne Feinstein next November. Dalichau sometimes will 
make the obligatory listing of also-ran no-names, but that's been about it. 
This is a shame, because in a political world so frequently devoid of color, 
Dalichau is a walking rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for instance, is a candidate who concedes that his initial motivation in 
seeking office is to settle scores with city inspectors who shut down his 
doughnut-making machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a candidate for U.S. Senate whose official biography lingers proudly 
on his father's tour of duty in World War II, as a soldier in the German army. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a candidate who admits in an interview that, although his campaign is 
short on cash, financial help is expected to arrive any day now from his 
fiancee's mother in Palm Springs. "She said," he adds in all earnestness, "that 
the check is in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a candidate seemingly unafraid of impossible odds, and also puns. As 
yet another of his many missives to editors declares: "Big shots demand, 'How 
DARE a 'baker' run for U.S. Senate?' Well, Benjamin Franklin was a printer. 
Thomas Jefferson was a farmer. And Harry Truman sold hats in Missouri. Maybe 
California kneads a 'baker' in the U.S. Senate to save dough!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of politics, Dalichau says, "the whole thing is corrupt." Clearly, he has read 
a little LaRouche, and has listened to a little Limbaugh. His major campaign 
issues are immigration, crime and bureaucrats -- in particular, bureaucrats who 
police doughnut machines. He doesn't claim to have many answers, but he's 
convinced that these are the questions. The solutions he can work on once he 
arrives in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymity aside, it's obvious that Dalichau is enjoying his campaign. "The 
time of my life," he calls it. Regulars who come to his bakery for coffee 
address him as "Sen. Wolf." Merchants on the block have put his campaign poster 
in their windows. "Wolf's the one," the posters declare. That a fellow named 
Nixon employed a similar slogan is news to Dalichau. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks most fondly of those few times he has addressed small gatherings of 
voters. "It is unbelievable," he says. "I didn't realize. There are tons and 
tons of people out there who think just like me." No doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to ignore Dalichau's candidacy, to dismiss him as just one more 
cashew in the California nuthouse. Except that, in a crazy way, he's right. 
There are plenty of people "out there" who believe the business of politics has 
failed, who advocate a retaking of government by citizen-politicians. It is 
this sentiment that produced flawed messengers such as Ross Perot and crude 
methods such as term limits and the rhetoric mouthed so easily by Dalichau and 
a legion of candidates like him. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in this context, Dalichau and Huffington pretty much are running the 
same campaign. Sadly for Wolf, however, there's one thing he has absolutely 
wrong. Populism, schmopulism. In politics today, dough still counts for 
everything. And he's covered with the wrong kind.

NORWEGIAN POLICE RECOVER STOLEN MUNCH MASTERPIECE 'THE SCREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Norway's most famous painting, "The Scream" by Edvard Munch, was recovered 
Saturday, almost three months after it was stolen from an Oslo museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the painting, which is on fragile paper, was recovered undamaged 
Saturday morning at a hotel in Asgardstrand, about 40 miles south of Oslo.Three 
Norwegians were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery and arrests apparently were made in connection with an attempt to 
sell or ransom the painting, the Norwegian news agency NTB said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munch's 1893 painting was stolen from the National Gallery in a break-in on 
Feb. 12, the opening day of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. The work 
depicts a waif-like figure, wide-mouthed in terror beneath a blood-red sky with 
two shadowy figures in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 50-second break-in, which was recorded by a security camera, two 
thieves used a ladder to climb up to a museum window, broke in and emerged with 
the painting. They left behind a postcard that said: "Thanks for the poor 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Scream" has been used as the anguished symbol of a century scarred by two 
world wars, the Holocaust, the atom bomb and modern horrors such as the 
conflict in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The police refused to give details about their investigation or release the 
suspects' names, in keeping with Norwegian practice.  
</P>
<P>
 A police spokeswoman said she could not exclude the possibility of more 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Lief Lier, who led the investigation, said Norwegian police had asked the 
special art and antiquities unit of Scotland Yard in London for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist lived from 1863 to 1944.

 The Bosnian government warned of a possible new Serb offensive as U.N. 
peacekeepers scrambled to find Bosnian Serb tanks believed to be inside the 
protected zone around Sarajevo. U.N. officials conceded that as many as four 
tanks may be in the hills around Sarajevo in violation of a NATO ultimatum in 
February banning heavy weapons from within 12.4 miles of the city. One of the 
tanks disappeared while being escorted by U.N. peacekeepers. Up to three others 
were believed to have remained within the exclusion zone.

U.S. ENVOYS CHIDED FOR 'FALSE REPORTS' ON CANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singapore's government said early today that it had reprimanded two U.S. 
diplomats because of what it termed "false reports" about how much American 
teen-ager Michael P. Fay suffered during a flogging for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-month controversy about the Fay case, which has strained relations 
between the United States and one of its longtime allies, blossomed into a 
full-fledged war of words over news reports that the youth had been "bloodied" 
by the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, was lashed four times with a rattan cane on Thursday 
afternoon as part of his sentence for spray-painting cars. On Friday, Fay was 
visited in prison by U.S. consular official John Coe, who then described Fay's 
condition to Fay's mother in Singapore, his father in Michigan and his father's 
lawyer in Philadephia in a conference telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's father, George Fay, quoted Coe as saying, "Mike has been bloodied," and 
then describing horizontal wounds on his buttocks where it appeared the skin 
was missing. In one place there was a two-inch gash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's lawyer, Theodore Simon, was quoted by Reuters news service as saying: 
"During the caning, blood ran down Mike's legs, and Mike's methods of dealing 
with the pain was to focus on the love of his parents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement published today, Kishore Mahbubani, permanent secretary of the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, was quoted as saying that the reports "astonished" 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that when we allowed the U.S. consul to visit Michael Fay, a true 
picture would come out. We were shocked by the tremendous amount of 
falsification," Mahbubani was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 A Foreign Affairs spokesman was quoted as saying that Coe and U.S. charge 
d'affairs Ralph Boyce had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry Saturday to 
receive a "firm message" about the press reports. Mahbubani said they had a 
"moral obligation" to state that Coe had been misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce confirmed today that he and Coe had been called to the ministry but said 
he could not comment on a U.S. consular visit under State Department 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was also today quoted as saying the government 
now considers the matter closed. "We will leave it to the U.S. to decide what 
they wish to do. I think our relations are robust enough to withstand whatever 
actions they might take against us."  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the description given by Fay's father and his lawyer, a 
statement from the prisons department described the caning in upbeat terms, 
saying the teen-ager shook hands with the prison official who caned him, smiled 
and walked back to his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 It also quoted the teen-ager as telling Coe that he wanted his father to "shut 
up" and that there had been only a few drops of blood shed during the 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coe never related that to us," the elder Fay said in a telephone interview. 
"It's new, and bewildering. I'm at a loss to understand that if it took place." 
Fay acknowledged, however, that the remarks attributed to lawyer Simon that 
blood ran down his son's legs were "sensational," and that Coe had never made 
such a comment.

JAPANESE MINISTER RESIGNS AFTER FUROR OVER REMARKS; CABINET: SHIGETO NAGANO HAD 
APOLOGIZED FOR DENYING RAPE OF NANKING, GUILT OF WORLD WAR II AGGRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata accepted the resignation of Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano on Saturday, three days after Nagano called the 1937 Rape of 
Nanking a fabrication and denied that Japan was guilty of aggression in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time since 1986 that a Japanese Cabinet minister has resigned 
or was fired for making revisionist statements about World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came a day after Nagano apologized and withdrew his statements 
published Wednesday. Hata, winding up a European trip in Brussels, rebuked 
Nagano on Friday but said he would like to retain him. Hata said then that the 
Japanese government was informing China and South Korea, both of which 
protested officially, of Nagano's "true intentions" and hoped they would 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, Hata said Japan could not afford to allow repercussions 
in neighboring countries to spread. Demands for Nagano's ouster had also 
increased at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano, 71, a former chief of staff of Japan's postwar army and a member of 
Hata's Renewal Party, took the initiative in offering his resignation. Hata 
accepted it Saturday night after returning to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize from the bottom of my heart for the shock and rage my 
inappropriate remarks gave to our neighboring countries, and the disturbance 
and anxiety they caused to our own people," Nagano said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano's initial claim that Japanese troops did not kill tens of thousands of 
Chinese soldiers and civilians and indiscriminately rape women after seizing 
Nanking (now known as Nanjing) in 1937 and his insistence that Japan intended 
to "liberate colonies" in its 1931-1945 Pacific war inflicted a serious wound 
on a new foreign policy Japan adopted last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, now the head of a shaky minority coalition government installed only 
nine days ago, named Hiroshi Nakai, 51, deputy secretary general of the 
middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party, to replace Nagano.

PANEL CHIEF SEES TREATY TO BAN NUCLEAR TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A treaty banning all nuclear weapons tests could be reached this year or the 
beginning of next year, the chairman of the committee negotiating the ban said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is much sooner than the 12 to 18 months that Miguel Marin-Bosch gave 
after the conclusion of the first round of talks on a comprehensive test ban 
treaty in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin-Bosch, of Mexico, is chairman of the nuclear test ban committee of the 
38-nation Conference of Disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of Cold War stalemate, the United States and Russia decided last 
year to actively support a comprehensive test ban, a decision widely supported 
by countries without nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, the Soviet Union and Britain agreed on a partial test ban 
in 1963 covering tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater. A 
comprehensive test ban treaty -- aimed primarily at underground tests -- would 
outlaw all nuclear explosions.

'WE SHOULD NOT POSSESS THESE WEAPONS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who just stepped down as Japan's defense minister acknowledges that 
his nation has the ability to produce nuclear weapons, but he says that for 
political and diplomatic reasons it will never acquire them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand, looking at Japan from the outside, when you look at its 
economic, technical and manufacturing capabilities, that it's certainly 
possible for Japan to possess these weapons very quickly," said Kazuo Aichi, 
who served until last month as defense minister in the government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "So I can understand why, from the outside, 
people would think Japan may do this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have the capabilities, and it's not helpful for us to deny those 
capabilities. We certainly do," Aichi said in an interview during a visit to 
Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that the role of Japanese politicians is to impress upon the 
Japanese people, including younger Japanese, and the rest of the world the fact 
that "we should not possess these weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of any situation in which Japan would possess its own nuclear 
weapons," said Aichi, who was replaced as defense minister last month in a 
Cabinet reshuffle but is still a member of Japan's House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize the domestic political situation would make it very 
difficult, if not impossible, (for Japan) to possess these weapons. But 
probably more importantly, just looking at basic national self-interest, it 
would not pay for Japan to possess these weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if we went ahead and possessed these weapons; it would act as a wedge 
separating us from most other Asian nations. . . . Also, throughout the world, 
everybody would begin to wonder what Japan is up to, would see it as a threat, 
and that would just add to this whole trend of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons."

LEGISLATORS' 37% RAISE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer advocates Ralph Nader and Harvey Rosenfield reacted angrily Saturday 
to news that state legislators will receive a 37% raise, calling for the 
abolition of a citizens' commission that granted the salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously reckless and outrageous," said Nader, who maintained that the 
wages of most Californians have remained stagnant over the last 20 years 
compared to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's governing by double standard and governing by hypocrisy, which is not 
good for democracy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield, best known for his advocacy of insurance reform, pointed out in a 
statement that legislators also received a 30% raise in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "While working men and women in California struggle to pay the bills," he 
said, "a pay raise (to legislators) is not merely inappropriate, it is an 
obscenity and an affront to the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Citizens Compensation Commission, which granted the raise, was 
established in 1990 in an unsuccessful attempt at political reform by state 
voters, Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, all they got was an elitist 'citizens commission,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader and Rosenfield urged the Legislature to draw up a ballot initiative to 
give voters an opportunity to abolish the commission at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission announced Friday that in order to attract qualified candidates 
to the Legislature, legislators' salaries are to be raised from $52,500 to 
$72,000 per year, effective in December.

JOYOUS HAWAIIANS RECLAIM BATTERED KAHOOLAWE ISLAND FROM MILITARY; CONSERVATION: 
ONCE A TARGET FOR SHELLING, THE 45-SQUARE-MILE SYMBOL OF NATIVE CULTURE IS 
HANDED TO THE STATE IN A CEREMONY ENDING A LONG STRUGGLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Barefoot men in loincloths blew conch shells 100 times here Saturday as 
Hawaiians celebrated the end of a long struggle to reclaim the island of 
Kahoolawe from the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a historic event," said Leslie Kuloloio of the Protect Kahoolawe 
Ohana (Family), who joined several hundred people for ceremonies at a sandy 
cove on the southwest coast of Maui, the closest point to the deserted island. 
"We used no violence, no guns, just the law and our total belief in the truth 
of what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Commandeered by the Navy for target practice during World War II, Kahoolawe 
had been bombed and strafed for more than a generation when nine protesters 
occupied it in 1976 in an attempt to stop the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrests for trespassing kicked off a David-versus-Goliath battle that 
culminated in Saturday's formal transfer of the 45-square-mile island to the 
state of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be held in trust for a sovereign Hawaiian nation, should one someday 
be recognized by state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for Kahoolawe (pronounced Kah-HO-oh-lah-vey) has come a long way. 
Once dismissed as ragtag radicals, the Protect Kahoolawe Ohana championed a 
cause that eventually became the heartbeat of a movement by native Hawaiians 
seeking self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Noa Emmett Aluli, one of the original protesters, is now chairman of the 
Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission, created last year to oversee the island's 
rebirth as a cultural sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the physician joined Gov. John Waihee and Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy William J. Cassidy Jr., to sign documents detailing the 
island's return and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor himself is no stranger to the cause. As a young lawyer, he helped 
defend some of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lei-bedecked crowd, clad in shorts and tropical prints, burst into 
applause as the men held the papers aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the return of Kahoolawe, it feels like Hawaii is whole again," the 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two storytellers traced the history of Kahoolawe and welcomed it back to the 
family of Hawaiian Islands, the low tones of their chants rolling with the 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers had hoped to hold Saturday's ceremony on Kahoolawe, but the 
logistics proved impossible. Instead, Ohana members, Navy officials and 
spectators gathered here in sight of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kahoolawe is now a cause celebre embraced by the highest levels of 
government, that was far from the case when the Ohana members banded together 
to proclaim it a Hawaiian treasure in the mid-1970s. They were considered 
troublemakers, and their efforts to challenge the U.S. government were 
denounced as foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest and driest of the eight main Hawaiian Islands, Kahoolawe seems an 
unlikely prize. The dusty, arid island was leased to ranchers early in the 
century. Goats stripped its greenery, and erosion slashed deep gullies in its 
sides. Since 1941, nearly every type of conventional ordnance in the U.S. 
military's inventory has pounded its red dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the uninhabited, unassuming island became a powerful symbol for the 
Hawaiian people. To many, it represented the most stark desecration of the 
native tradition of "aloha aina," or love for the land. And the struggle to 
save it fired a cultural and spiritual renaissance among native Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kahoolawe made people really feel good about being Hawaiian again," Aluli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Frenchy DeSoto, a Hawaiian elder and Ohana member, said that before the 
Kahoolawe protest, "we were becoming not Hawaiians but brown Westerners who 
were like flotsam on the ocean, with no real sense of cultural identity or 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 More trespassers followed the first boatload, eluding Navy searches. Two young 
men, including one of the Ohana's most charismatic leaders, were lost at sea on 
a rescue mission for other protesters, becoming martyrs for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the Ohana sued the Navy, seeking enforcement of laws governing 
protection of the island's environment, preservation of historic sites and 
freedom to practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
 A consent decree signed in 1980 restricted the bombing and gave the group 
regular access to the island for religious, cultural and educational 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Ohana's efforts, the entire island was placed on the 
National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Despite the shelling, it remains 
rich in archeological sites and offers a rare glimpse of ancient Hawaii. 
Petroglyphs are etched on its flanks, and fishing shrines dot its coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohana members have rededicated old shrines and replanted native vegetation. 
During monthly visits to the island, they live in the old way, diving for fish 
and prying limpets off lava rocks. To reach the undeveloped island, they must 
drop anchor offshore, form a human chain and pass their belongings through the 
surf to the beach, where they camp. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 people have visited the island under the Ohana's auspices. 
Through the 1980s, support for reclaiming Kahoolawe spread across the state and 
even abroad. One foreign nation after another dropped out of joint military 
exercises on Kahoolawe. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, President George Bush ordered the bombing stopped temporarily. Last 
year, Congress voted to permanently halt all military exercises and return 
title to Hawaii, authorizing $400 million for cleanup and restoration of the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 Access will remain limited while the Navy removes ordnance from the island 
during the next 10 years. Unexploded shells and bombs stud its landscape and 
near-shore waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiians envision Kahoolawe as a retreat that could become the centerpiece of 
native culture. In setting it aside as a cultural reserve, the state has 
prohibited commercial activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kahoolawe will be a place for all of us to find a peaceful corridor -- no 
noise, no lights . . . and making contact with the Creator and our ancestors," 
Kuloloio said. "That's what's been lost here in Hawaii and throughout the 
world."

WHITE SUPREMACISTS MARCH PEACEFULLY

<P>
 Seventeen white supremacists staged a peaceful march under the close scrutiny 
of police in riot gear Saturday, as more than 200 counterdemonstrators marched 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out better then we could have ever planned," Police Supt.James 
Clayborn said. No one was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mississippi-based Nationalist Movement had negotiated with city 
authorities for permits to march through the streets in South Boston. Group 
members said they wanted to make up for the city's canceled St. Patrick's Day 
parade, which was scrubbed when sponsors refused to consider participation by a 
gay group. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Robert O'Toole, a police spokesman, said the National Movement members, 
headed by group leader Richard Barrett, marched on the sidewalks without a 
permit, which is allowed. Permits would have been needed if they had marched in 
the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 counterdemonstrators also marched on the sidewalks under guard by 
the helmeted police, authorities said.

BIOLOGICAL PARENTS GET CUSTODY OF SWITCHED-AT-BIRTH GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The biological parents of switched-at-birth teen-ager Kimberly Mays have been 
given custody of her by the man who raised her, a lawyer said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of negotiations, Ernest and Regina Twigg reached an agreement 
Friday with Robert Mays, who raised the 15-year-old from birth, said John 
Blakely, a lawyer for the Twiggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice Mother's Day present for Mrs. Twigg, isn't it?" Blakely said. "I 
know the final agreement is acceptable to everyone, including Kimberly." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone numbers for Mays and the Twiggs are unlisted. A telephone message 
left Saturday at the office of Mays' lawyer, Arthur Ginsburg, was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl received a judge's permission last August to legally stay away from 
the Twiggs. But in March she suddenly bolted from Mays and went to stay with 
the Twiggs in Sebring, 85 miles southeast of Tampa. Another lawyer in the case 
described the reason as typical adolescent conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new agreement, the judge's order from August was thrown out. 
Instead, the Twiggs and Mays are recognized as Kimberly's legal guardians. The 
teen-ager will live with the Twiggs until she becomes an adult -- or asks to 
leave -- and Mays will be allowed to visit, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby the Twiggs took home in 1978 was named Arlena. She died of a heart 
defect in 1988 and medical tests during her illness determined she was not 
related to the Twiggs. Genetic testing later showed Kimberly was the Twiggs' 
biological daughter and the legal tug-of-war began.

CLINTON, GOP INVOKE MOTHERHOOD IN HEALTH EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All that was missing Saturday was apple pie, as both President Clinton and his 
Republican opposition invoked motherhood to argue their cases for and against 
the Administration's health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton marked the Mother's Day weekend by making an appeal for his proposal, 
which he said would give mothers "another gift that will improve and prolong 
their lives -- the gift of good health care." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are the people most likely to guard their family's health care and to 
make sure we're all healthier, and yet too often our health care system leaves 
women behind," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when treatments are available, women don't get the necessary health care 
they need because they have inadequate insurance, or none at all," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to guaranteeing health care coverage to every American, Clinton 
said, the Administration proposal would emphasize preventive care, such as 
mammograms and Pap smears, and make research into women's health problems a 
higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I ask every mother's child to send another card this Mother's Day," 
Clinton said. "Address it to your senator or representative in Congress. Tell 
them this health care reform plan is important because it may help the most 
important person in your life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican response to Clinton's address also picked up on the Mother's 
Day theme, as Rep. Porter J. Goss of Florida agreed that the health care system 
should provide affordable, high-quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said Clinton's proposal was merely "a move toward bigger, more 
intrusive government" that would deny "a mother's right to choose a doctor or 
decide which treatment to pursue for herself or her family."

ANAHEIM VOLUNTEERS DO HOME WORK; AID: WITH DONATED MATERIALS AND 1,000 HELPERS, 
PAINT YOUR HEART OUT ANAHEIM SPRUCES UP 47 HOMES OWNED BY THE ELDERLY AND 
NEEDY.

 Edward Wulfestieg peeked out his front door Saturday at the platoon of workers 
applying a fresh coat of tan paint to his 68-year-old stucco bungalow and 
smiled at the buzz of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really swarming all over the place, in and out and around," said 
Wulfestieg, 89. "They're doing a beautiful job, aren't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Across town from Wulfestieg's Ellsworth Avenue home, a similar flurry of labor 
was bringing new life to two homes on North Riviera Street. Paintbrush in hand, 
Dottie Smith took a short break and watched as about a dozen workers changed 
the color of her house from orange to gray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to get out and help," Smith said. "This is really great." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim, a citywide volunteer effort 
run by Anaheim's Community Development Department that Saturday put 1,000 
temporary painters to work on 47 homes owned by the elderly and the needy. A 
week earlier the volunteers had trimmed the shrubbery and sanded peeling paint 
to ready the homes for Saturday's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its fourth year in Anaheim, Paint Your Heart Out has put in more than 
$500,000 in neighborhood improvements to 156 local homes, said Carolyn Griebe 
of Garden Grove, a public relations consultant who is the group's only paid 
employee.  
</P>
<P>
 As needed, windows are glazed, smoke detectors checked, fences are mended and 
driveways repaved in addition to the painting -- all donated by local 
businesses, Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, a resident must be elderly, low income or disabled and a 
homeowner, Griebe said. She estimated the group receives between 
$50,000-$60,000 in donated material and labor, with $25,000 in cash from 
federal grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to bring that down to $15,000 next year and by 1996 be completely 
off government money," said Griebe, whose involvement in a local anti-graffiti 
campaign led to the house-painting effort. The contributors to Saturday's 
effort included Dutch Boy Paints, which donated 1,568 gallons of paint; Home 
Depot, which donated $5,000 in tools and supplies, and Ganahl Lumber, which 
chipped in $1,500 in materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Olesen of Anaheim, who is the event's co-chairman with Griebe, said it 
was the purchase of a downtown Anaheim home built in 1903 that got him 
interested. He fixed up his own home and found out how it affects the entire 
neighborhood, Olesen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we'll go in and fix up the worst house on the block, which can turn 
it into one of the nicest," Olesen said. "That can cause the neighbors to fix 
up their houses." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 8 a.m. Saturday that about 20 workers from State Farm Insurance 
descended on Daisy Jones' home on Riviera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real lifesaver for me," said Jones, 60, who lives in the home with 
her two adopted daughters, Christina, 11, and Elizabeth, 13. She has to support 
the three of them working part time with the disabled, 23 hours a week at $4.25 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much, but it is some money coming in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although George Giroux is 69 and disabled, he pitched in with the workers from 
Lifefleet Ambulance service at his home on Malboro Avenue. Standing in his 
driveway with paint splattered over his shoes and shirt, Giroux said his 
daughters "would kill me if they knew I was out here working. But everyone else 
was working so hard I thought I would help."

OFFICER KILLS MOTORIST AFTER FREEWAY CHASE; HOMICIDE: MAN ALLEGEDLY HIT A 
POLICEMAN WITH HIS CAR AT AN ANAHEIM MOBILE HOME PARK EARLY SATURDAY. SHOOTING 
REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A police officer shot and killed a 25-year-old man early Saturday morning 
after the suspect allegedly hit him with his car in a mobile home park after a 
high-speed freeway chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Boomer of Anaheim was pronounced dead by paramedics shortly after the 
1:15 a.m. shooting near his home in the Friendly Village mobile home park, 
according to a written statement from the Anaheim Police Department's homicide 
detail. Police said the shooting was under investigation and refused to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the 15-minute chase began about 1 a.m. According to Linda Boomer, 
the dead man's mother, Boomer's girlfriend apparently telephoned the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and Anaheim police, saying Boomer was harassing her 
and had driven away. Gary Boomer, who was wanted by police on a felony assault 
warrant, led officers on a wild chase through the city of Anaheim and onto the 
eastbound Riverside Freeway, reaching speeds in excess of 90 miles per hour 
before he exited at Imperial Highway, according to the statement, issued by 
Sgt. Steve Rodig of the department's robbery-homicide detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who had been alerted by Gary Boomer's girlfriend that he would 
probably be headed to the mobile home park, were waiting for him when he 
arrived at Friendly Village, said Linda Boomer, who also lives at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Boomer drove into the park but failed to stop before jumping a curb near 
the park entrance several blocks from his home and hitting a uniformed officer 
with the car, according to the statement. The unidentified officer, who was not 
seriously hurt, was treated and released at a local hospital, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they heard police yell "Stop or I'll shoot!" and then the sound 
of two gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard somebody yelling and then I heard the shooting," said a woman who 
declined to identify herself but said she an Ohio resident visiting a relative 
in the park. "I had just put my head down to go to sleep when I heard the 
yelling and the 'boom, boom! ' I went outside and there were policemen all over 
creation, still holding their guns. Everything happened very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The police statement said that the officer "discharged his duty weapon during 
the assault, and struck suspect Boomer." But after the shooting, witnesses said 
they saw Boomer's body lying on the ground outside his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office will investigate the death, a 
routine procedure in all officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 A tearful Linda Boomer said her son had been unemployed for some time and had 
troubles with his girlfriend, but she questioned the reason for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe this has even happened," said Boomer, 49, a factory 
worker, as she sat at her dining room table and was comforted by her daughter 
and friends. "I guess he hit an officer. Maybe that gives them the right to 
shoot somebody, but I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer said her son had been in trouble with police for evading an officer 
after an automobile accident. She said he had recently failed to report to his 
probation officer and could only guess that is why a warrant had been issued 
for his arrest. It was not clear Saturday why Gary Boomer was on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Boomer had attended Anaheim's Savanna High School briefly but had dropped 
out before graduating, his mother said. He was living with her and his 26th 
birthday would have been May 24, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Boomer was driving his mother's car during the chase and had called her 
earlier in the evening to tell her he would return it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called and said, 'Don't worry, Mom, there's nothing wrong with your car, 
you'll get it back,' " said Linda Boomer, a divorced mother of three children. 
Her son's girlfriend also called twice to say he was there with her car, Linda 
Boomer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer said she heard police helicopters hovering over the park but didn't 
know her son had been killed until police arrived at the mobile home she also 
shares with her daughter, Kim Lombard, about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombard also questioned the reason for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. Maybe if you have a warrant, that gives them the right to shoot 
you," Lombard said. "It doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents of the 349 large mobile homes in the sprawling park at 5815 
E. La Palma Ave. heard the early morning commotion. Brandi Curtis, 16, said she 
had just gotten home and received a phone call from a friend that someone in 
her neighborhood had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked over and saw the car and a man lying on the ground in handcuffs," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Nicoll, 58, who has lived at the park for 20 years, said that when he 
left home to take his morning walk about 8 a.m., police were still at the 
scene, which was cordoned off. Gary Boomer was still lying on the ground and 
his mother's car was still astride the curb with its front wheels on the grass, 
Nicoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe he was still there," said Nicoll, who had seen a 
television newscast of the shooting. "It didn't seem right that they would let 
somebody lie there like that so long."

DOG REMOVED FROM HOME OF CRUELTY SUSPECT 
</P>

 Responding to a flood of calls from angry dog lovers, police took a collie 
into protective custody on Saturday -- one day after the dog's owner was jailed 
on charges that he stoned and beat the dog while a neighbor captured the attack 
on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog, named Jazzy, was taken to the County Animal Control shelter in 
Orange, which also fielded hundreds of calls from people asking who was looking 
after the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone kept ringing and ringing," said Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Keith 
Levin. "They were disgusted and dismayed." The collie's owner, Richard Eugene 
Griffith, Jr., 36, was released from Huntington Beach City Jail Friday after 
posting $5,000 bail. On Thursday, he was charged with two felony counts of 
cruelty to an animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a neighbor videotaped Griffith as he sealed Jazzy's mouth with 
tape and then beat her with a wooden-handled garden tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Mark N. Phillips, 
declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said Griffith cooperated with officers who came to pick up Jazzy shortly 
after noon Saturday from the family's Fountain Valley home, and noted that the 
owner offered officers a leash for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The length of the collie's stay at the shelter will depend on the outcome of 
the criminal case, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department decided to remove the dog from Griffith's home because 
of the barrage of calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Those calls came from people such as Myrna Jorgenson, the owner of a German 
shepherd and a Lhasa apso, who spent Saturday morning phoning the police, 
animal control and the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern was that it didn't seem that there were any rights for the 
collie," said Jorgenson, who lives in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorgenson said the news of the beating charges appalled her and made her worry 
about Jazzy's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe this man could come back to the home and maybe inflict more 
pain on the dog," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had filed the charges against Griffith in West Orange County 
Municipal Court on Thursday, alleging that he beat the collie "continually."  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors reported that the dog was left in the yard without shelter around 
the clock, regardless of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks ago, an anonymous letter had appeared in the neighborhood, 
asking people disturbed by the dog's daytime barking to complain about the 
noise to the Griffiths, a neighbor said.

SCOTT HARRIS: THIS FANTASYLAND WOULD BE LETTER-PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. Michael Eisner  
</P>
<P>
 Chairman of the Board  
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co.  
</P>
<P>
 500 S. Buena Vista St.  
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, CA 90521  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Eisner, 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Scott Harris. You may recognize the 
name. Many people do. But let me assure you I am not that Scott Harris. I am 
not the Scott Harris who parachuted into your friend Michael Jackson's ranch a 
few years back and quite literally crashed Elizabeth Taylor's latest wedding. I 
am not a convicted trespasser. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I am the Scott Harris who grew up just a few miles from Disneyland and now 
writes a column for the Los Angeles Times, which brings me to the first point 
of this letter. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something I've been meaning to clear up. Last December, I wrote a 
column that questioned the values reflected in the California tax code and 
contained a passing reference to your $203.1-million compensation for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Reader response gives me the awkward feeling that the mere mention of your 
salary and stock options was intended as criticism. It was not. The purpose of 
my column was to explain that although Californians are charged up to an 8.5% 
sales tax on such items as diapers and textbooks, there is absolutely zero tax 
on tickets for amusement parks, movies and the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, it seems, look at your compensation and think that would put a 
lot of cops on the streets and rebuild a few freeways. They think, gee, if we 
could just get our hands on Eisner's loot -- if, say, we charged the sales tax 
on the frills and thrills that Disney provides, just as we tax Pampers and 
textbooks -- then maybe Eisner and his like wouldn't be such profiteers and our 
own taxes wouldn't be quite so high. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, this is an unsophisticated, simplistic view of capitalism and 
the American way. Sometimes I think these people don't understand that 
communism is dead. They just don't appreciate how our collective economic 
survival -- indeed, their own jobs -- depend on the ability of visionaries such 
as yourself to earn a just wage. And really, every time I ride Pirates of the 
Caribbean and watch those buccaneers loot and pillage, I can't help but think 
that, at $203.1 million, the entire world is getting a bargain in Mr. Michael 
Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings me to the second point of this letter. It seems to me that people 
don't appreciate your contributions the way they should. They envy you, but 
they don't love you the way they loved Walt Disney. They seem to think of you 
as just a lucky fellow who got plucked from Paramount to run an undervalued 
company and couldn't help but succeed. And they read about the red ink at Euro 
Disney and scoff. 
</P>
<P>
 This is unfair. And that is one reason I would like to call your attention to 
a modest investment opportunity that promises a big payoff in money and public 
image. I can sum this golden opportunity up in just one word. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right: Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you're familiar with the rustic little truck stop 60 miles up 
Interstate 5. It's got a sheriff's substation, a post office, a motel, a diner, 
a Carl's Jr. and three gas stations. But the place is so darn pretty that the 
artist Christo chose this site to erect a forest of yellow umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Gorman -- including about 3,000 acres of peach orchards and grazing 
land -- is for sale. The Ralphs family -- the ones who founded the grocery 
chain -- is asking a mere $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think of what we could do here. What I propose is the creation of a new 
company to purchase and develop this land. Eisner-Harris Imagineering could 
work wonders. Eisnerland will show the world what you can do without the help 
of Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 My thoughts are still a bit sketchy, but Eisnerland will give adults the kind 
of vicarious thrills that Disneyland gives to children. Instead of "rocket 
ships" and roller coasters, Fatcat City would have rides simulating limousines 
and Lear jets. There would be faux gold mines and oil gushers. Instead of 
Goofy, Pluto and the Three Little Pigs, we'd have look-alikes of everyone from 
the Trumps, the Clintons and the Windsors to Rush Limbaugh, Teddy Kennedy and 
Elvis. Jack Nicholson would be a court jester with a 5 iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Main Street, we will offer Rodeo Drive. Instead of the Matterhorn, 
Aspen. Instead of Toon Town, Schmoozeville. And best of all, instead of 
Sleeping Beauty's Castle, we'll have the Corridors of Power, where patrons 
would be able to make "campaign contributions" in exchange for political 
favors. And by the end of the day, customers might ride "Oh Yes, You Can Too 
Take It With You," in which they lie in gilded coffins and are covered with the 
park's official currency, known as Eisnerbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, we need to talk. The initial financing should be easy to work out. 
The way I figure it, if I invest the entire Harris family fortune, and you 
invest a mere 6.75% of your 1993 income, we can get Eisnerland rolling. (Since 
I am taking the greater risk, it would seem fair that I control 51% of the 
company.) 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I read somewhere that you saved $17 million for yourself by 
exercising your stock options before the Clinton tax plan took effect. Once 
more, I salute you! 
</P>
<P>
 And I look forward to us working together. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely,  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harris 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. To help us get a fast start, perhaps you could mention to your friends in 
Sacramento the great public need for new off-ramps in Gorman to bring in the 
heavy equipment. Of course, the taxpayers will cover this, just as they are 
covering the $50 million for new off-ramps to serve the Disneyland expansion, 
plus another $47 million toward new parking structures. This is only right. 
After all, we'll be creating thousands of minimum-wage jobs.

POLITICS '94; A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
UMBERG'S STAFF WANTS POLANCO AND HIS MONEY OUT OF 69TH DISTRICT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turf war: Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and his staff are growing 
irritated with Assemblyman Richard Polanco, leader of the Legislature's Latino 
Caucus, over what they consider to be meddling in the 69th Assembly District 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco (D-Los Angeles) has given his support -- and a promise of big campaign 
bucks -- to Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno, one of four Democrats trying to 
succeed Umberg, who is running for attorney general. But the Umberg camp is 
backing Mike Metzler, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce president and another 
Democratic contender. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is that Polanco might funnel upward of $150,000 to Moreno's campaign, 
although George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager, says the figure he's heard is 
$80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco "better have a couple million dollars for the general election, 
because he won't elect Ted Moreno without it," Urch says, noting that Latinos 
who might favor Moreno have made up only about 20% of the district's likely 
voters in past elections. 
</P>
<P>
 More galling, Urch says, is that Polanco is backing a candidate against 
Umberg's chosen successor. "What's Polanco doing in our district?" he grumbled. 
"If Tom was in East L.A., pumping an Anglo candidate, Polanco would be jumping 
down our throat." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Party dues: For the first time in years, the Republican Party took advantage 
of a law that lets a political party use the sample ballot to seek donations 
from registered party members. 
</P>
<P>
 The privilege to print the two-page letter cost the GOP more than $17,000, 
County Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal was signed by county GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and John M.W. 
Moorlach, the party's assistant treasurer and challenger to longtime county 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorlach's campaign isn't mentioned because the law forbids using the 
letter for individual endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Howard Adler says local 
Democrats once used the strategy but found the costs far outweighed any 
returns. "If we had all the cash in the world like the Republicans, then maybe 
we would do it more often," Adler says. 
</P>

<P>
 Pin the tale on Clinton: Frustrated by what he says are President Clinton's 
unkept campaign promises, Newport Beach architect Christopher R. Colvin has 
developed a new game called "Tax Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to the "Pin the Tail on the Donkey" game, players are given a "No 
Taxes" blindfold, spun around numerous times (depending on their tax bracket), 
and then sent toward the target with a tax tale/tail in hand. The target is a 
large poster depicting a tail-less donkey with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The "tales" are reminders of some of the President's anti-tax pledges such as: 
"I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs." The 
three tails closest to the donkey's behind are checked off on a survey sheet 
that can be sent to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Colvin says it's nothing personal against Clinton. "It began as more of a 
frustration about the political system rather than the candidate in 
particular," Colvin says. 
</P>

<P>
 Tricky Dick?: Richard Nixon's death prompted County Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley to recall his own private moment with the former 
President.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his appointment to the board two decades ago, Riley and his 
wife, Emma Jane, were invited to a Nixon dinner party in San Clemente. 
Watergate was in full bloom and Riley expected a more reclusive host. 
</P>
<P>
 He got nothing of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley says Nixon made him an unusual offer: "He told me that Mayor (Richard) 
Daley in Chicago (a Democrat) owed him a chit and could help with a future 
reelection campaign," the supervisor recalls. "When I told him that I didn't 
think so, he says, 'Well, then, I'll just vote for you twice.' " 
</P>

 Young rebels: Members of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom lined up 
last week at UC Irvine to take shots at Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom 
Hayden. But they apparantly forgot they were dealing with one of the masters of 
the 1960s student radical movement and Chicago Seven defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal shots bounced off Hayden like rubber bullets. "You guys are 
breaking my ribs. I can barely sustain myself," he told his hecklers as he 
mockingly grabbed his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, whose generation warned during the '60s not to trust anyone over 30, 
gave the Republicans some advice: "Never try to argue with someone who's over 
30 and was there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quote of the week: "I don't know if we'll come together, but if he's right, 
he's right." -- Orange County Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) on his odd 
meeting of minds with liberal state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). Both 
oppose the way administrators at California's public universities are enriching 
themselves with perks and high salaries while students are being socked with

THEY FIGURE IT'S FUN; STUDENTS COMBINE WIT AND TEAMWORK AT MATHEMATICS 
COMPETITION 
</P>

 They came facing long odds -- not to mention evens, integers, pluses and 
minuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the 400 Orange County fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders who attended 
the 3rd Annual Mathematics Field Day at Los Amigos High School Saturday, 
matching wits made for good fun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the construction derby, teams of students put their heads together to 
design paper airplanes that would fly farther and longer than the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call us the boys of destiny," said David Zickman, 10, of Riverdale Elementary 
School in Orange, displaying some preflight confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call him the boy of destiny, call us smart," replied teammate Chris Nelson, 
also 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Zickman and company, equipped with eight pieces of paper, four drinking 
straws, one paper clip, scissors and tape, drafted, tested and retested their 
entry before toeing the line and releasing their "Masterglider." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditionally styled paper airplane with a straw taped along its mid-fold, 
sailed down a hallway for 2 1/2 seconds before it hit a desk and took a 
nosedive. But the flight was long enough for the crew to claim victory over two 
other fifth-grade teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with countywide teaching methods, the events stressed working 
together to develop a common solution, said coordinator Marelle Dorsey. About 
54 elementary schools were represented at the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, a former teacher and member of the Orange County Mathematics Council, 
which sponsored the event, said the participants were not necessarily the best 
math students at their schools, but students who worked well in groups. 
Teachers selected the students who attended, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really great to see these kids work together as one," she said. "Usually 
the students who can share ideas and come to a consensus do the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The top six finishers in each grade group earned medals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a session on logic later in the morning, students were given a half-hour to 
solve 10 imposing word problems. For Lindsay Yourman of Lincoln Elementary, the 
phase was fun but "complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Fore saw the whole outing as a way to bone up on his already-chosen 
profession as an airplane engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad designs airplanes and someday I want to," the 10-year-old said. "He 
uses math a lot in his work, so I have to be good at it if I want to do the 
same thing."

SEAT-BELT POLICE BUCKLE DOWN TO BUCKLE UP TOTS; CHILD SAFETY: SOME PARENTS 
CAUGHT IN ORANGE DRAGNET TOOK THE VIDEO PEP TALK. OTHERS, IN A HURRY, DRIVE OFF 
WITH $271 TICKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The seat-belt police prowled the busy streets of this community Saturday, 
looking for parents who deserved a gentle scolding, a video pep talk and -- in 
some cases -- a hefty $271 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you allow your 2-year-old child to walk along the roof ledge of a 
three-story building?" was the sermon distributed in flyers by five officers, 
two reserves, eight Police Explorers, and two volunteers who established a seat 
belt checkpoint long a stretch of Katella Avenue between 10 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department inspection, timed with Mother's Day weekend, was 
designed to ascertain that children in cars were protected by either seat belts 
or car seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor officer Brent Taylor said the "Buckle Up for Love" checkpoint resulted 
in 24 citations, the sale of six car-seats, one arrest for drunken driving and 
the instant deputization of dozens of junior seat belt police advised to 
monitor their buckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have written more tickets," said Taylor, who helped invent the idea 
for the checkpoint. "It was such an endless supply of people who didn't have 
belts on their kids. But we can't stay out there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, according to Taylor, was to educate parents about the hazards of 
riding unfettered. The force of a car crash or jolting stop at 30 miles per 
hour has the same impact on a child as tumbling from a three-story building, 
police noted in flyers passed out to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 During yesterday's inspection, families who lacked child car seats were given 
the chance to buy one on the spot for $35 from the Orange Police Department, 
which will also continue to sell them at its headquarters. Police officers also 
gave quick lessons on installing the car seats properly. 
</P>
<P>
 California law requires that every child under the age of 4 or below 40 pounds 
must be restrained in a car seat meeting federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who didn't have a car seat got a ticket, " Taylor said. "We offered 
them the opportunity to watch a video in a trailer set up nearby. If they sat 
through the program, they got a certificate to take to court so they wouldn't 
have to pay the fine." 
</P>
<P>
 But several parents declined the invitation to view "Don't Risk Your Child's 
Life," and drove off with the ticket. What many may not have realized -- since 
the fine was not spelled out on the citation -- is that the price of seat belt 
freedom is extremely high. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine, said Taylor, is $271.

EXPERTS GIVE RESEEDING PROGRAM A SECOND LOOK; ECOLOGY: SOME SPECIALISTS SAY 
SEEDING MAY INTERFERE WITH REGENERATION OF NATIVE PLANTS AND RE-ESTABLISHMENT 
OF ECOSYSTEMS AS AREAS RECOVER FROM WILDFIRES. 
</P>

<P>
 To seed or not to seed. That was the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecologists, biologists and public policy-makers gathered Saturday for the 
Southern California Academy of Sciences annual meeting at UC Irvine to discuss 
October's wildfires and whether vegetation should be replanted in burn areas to 
hold off mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the researchers who discussed the fire's impact on the local 
environment cautioned that their studies are still in progress, some said their 
findings show that reseeding may interfere with regeneration of native plants 
and re-establishment of ecosystems as an area recovers.  
</P>
<P>
 Jon E. Keeley, biology professor at Occidental College, said he has compared 
areas seeded with native grasses and unseeded areas burned in the Laguna Beach 
fire. Neither has bounced back strongly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we didn't see that seeding was particularly effective at all," 
Keeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if it was because of the intensity (of the fire) or (lack of) 
rainfall." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeley also compared the growth of plants in seeded and unseeded areas of the 
Santa Monica Mountains, which were burned in the Malibu wildfire. The density 
of regrowth differed little, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While reseeding may not have environmentally damaging effects, it may not be 
cost-effective," Keeley said. "Should you spend half a million in reseeding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Keeler-Wolf, vegetation ecologist with the state Department of Fish and 
Game, said introducing non-native plants to an area may make it possible that 
"in one generation you can completely swamp out native species." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeler-Wolf said that grasses used in reseeding, which are chosen because they 
grow quickly and control erosion, might compete with native seedlings trying to 
grow back after fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Division of Forestry officials said they believe reseeding can work 
in areas of major damage. After future fires, "we're going to have 
interdisciplinary teams look at each burn site and evaluate what it needs," 
said Douglas Wickizer, staff chief for forest management with the forestry 
division. "And that may very easily include seeding." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day conference held Friday and Saturday attracted hundreds of people 
for sessions on topics ranging from earthquakes to local fish populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many researchers called for further study of reseeding, but seven 
sixth-graders from Thurston Middle School in Laguna Beach have concluded that 
reseeding works if it's properly done, but plants also grow back well by 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see when it's sprayed too thick, the sun can't get through it," said 
Chelsea Weenig, 12, who displayed a picture of a large chunk of mulch and seeds 
that had been spread on a hill. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilkerson, a Thurston science teacher and director of the school project, 
said his students are recognizing that many varieties of plants are growing 
back well in ash. 
</P>
<P>
 "They compare how plants are growing back without reseeding and you can see 
the money spent wouldn't have been necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One researcher who studied methods of stopping erosion said that hay bales 
blocking some Laguna Beach canyons may halt rocks and sand from reaching houses 
during small storms, but are "ticking time bombs" where accumulated debris can 
be unleashed in major rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist, Tom Spittler, of the state Division of Mines and Geology, 
showed a slide of a massive boulder that had tumbled onto a La 
Canada-Flintridge road in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 "I submit that a straw bale dam would have a hard time containing that," he 
said.

3 MEN SERIOUSLY INJURED WHEN CAR SLAMS INTO TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were seriously injured early Saturday when their car veered across 
Brookhurst Street and struck a tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Adrian Charles Muldrew, 36, of Fountain Valley, faces charges of 
suspicion of possession of amphetamines and driving under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs after the 2:45 a.m. accident, said Fountain Valley police Sgt. 
Keith Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was listed in critical but stable condition at Western Medical Center 
in Santa Ana with hip and skull injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew's passengers -- Jeffrey P. Tucker, 37, of Fountain Valley, and Steven 
J. McCleave, 35 of Balboa -- were also badly hurt. Tucker, who was riding in 
the front passenger seat, was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he 
was listed in critical condition with head trauma, internal injuries and a 
pelvic fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleave, who was in the back seat, was taken to Western Medical Center in 
Santa Ana with a broken leg. He was listed in stable condition Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was driving his Nissan 240 SX southbound on Brookhurst at 
approximately 80 m.p.h. when the car veered across the center line just past 
Talbert Avenue and struck a large pine tree, a Fountain Valley Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters 25 minutes to pull Muldrew from the mangled car, he said.

SEX WITH PATIENT MEANS JAIL FOR COUNSELOR; CRIME: MUNICIPAL JURY CONVICTS BUENA 
PARK PRACTITIONER. STATE OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING LICENSE REVOCATION. HIS VICTIM 
SAYS SHE'S 'SLOWLY RECOVERING' FROM 1992 CRIME.

<P>
 A Buena Park family counselor found guilty of having sex with a patient will 
begin serving a one-year jail term next month. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lisle, 67, had pleaded not guilty to nine misdemeanor charges involving 
the same woman. But a jury in North Orange County Municipal Court found him 
guilty after two hours of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle was sentenced on April 18 to a year in Orange County Jail, a $500 fine 
and five years' probation, according to Deputy Dist. Atty James Laird. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, now 28, said Friday that "to be validated by a jury of my peers 
showed me that there is hope for my recovery . . . and that this is something 
that needs to be made known to others for what it is: a crime against 
vulnerable people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle and his attorney could not be reached on Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who lives in the Long Beach area, was 27 when she sought counseling 
for depression at a Fred Gross Christian Therapy Program in Buena Park in June, 
1992, by calling a toll-free help line. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the criminal case, the state Board of Behavioral Science 
Examiners filed a civil lawsuit against Lisle, seeking to revoke his license as 
a marriage, child and family counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Lisle diagnosed the woman with "severe (lifetime) 
depression" and she began seeing him regularly. He had sex with her, according 
to the suit, after telling her that "God had chosen for her to be healed 
through intimacy with (him)."  
</P>
<P>
 "I am recovering slowly," the woman said Friday. "An average day is very 
difficult." She said she found last year that she was pregnant with Lisle's 
child. She said that some of her friends have been unable to show support to 
her because it is too difficult for them to relate to her experience, which she 
described as "devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisle's license has been temporarily suspended, and a hearing on a permanent 
revocation is pending, according to Dr. Kathleen Callanan, executive officer of 
the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners.

D.A. URGED TO OVERHAUL CHILD-SUPPORT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private consultant has recommended a partial reorganization of the Orange 
County district attorney's child support collection division to keep pace with 
a caseload that has increased by more than 100% in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-month study prepared by the audit firm of Price Waterhouse found 
that the collection rate, which was about $47 million last year, was on pace 
with that at most other urban counties.But the firm recommended that the 
division's 290 employees be reorganized into more efficient teams to handle the 
increased number of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the child support division handled slightly more than 100,000 
cases, up from about 40,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said that the audit was in part 
commissioned to prepare for the county's conversion of its child support filing 
system to a California computer network, the Statewide Automated Child Support 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade said the network would provide county officials with greater ability to 
locate delinquent parents and begin faster collection proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Price Waterhouse study cost the county about $80,000.

SANTA CLARITA SHOULD TAP OTHER SOURCES; STATE FUNDS MIGHT BE BEST SOLUTION IN 
FEUD WITH WATER DISTRICT OVER QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Santa Clarita has received much in the way of aid for damage from 
the Northridge earthquake. So far, for example, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency has approved nearly half of the city's requests for the $12 
million in disaster assistance needed to repair public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The only request FEMA has denied Santa Clarita thus far was the $22,500 it 
asked for to pay for the relocation of its Cowboy Poetry, Music & Film 
Festival. At the risk of being challenged to a draw at high noon, we must say 
that the festival request was simply ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal generosity to date demands less frivolity in aid requests, 
especially since the monies already on the way include another $4.6-million 
grant from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But part of our interest here concerns the growing feud between Santa Clarita 
(and its own $1.1-billion quake-related redevelopment plan) and the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency, and the legal action the agency has filed against that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in February, the Santa Clarita City Council decided to spend that amount 
over the next 45 years on quake recovery, improved infrastructure, affordable 
housing and the redevelopment of blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Santa Clarita plan was nothing but a development plan "masquerading 
as a disaster project," said water agency officials. They added that it would 
jeopardize the agency's ability to repay bonds for its new water treatment 
plant. Santa Clarita officials have countered by saying that the agency's 
financial difficulties were the result of its own mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 The real victims of the legal action between these two relative behemoths, 
however, will be the taxpayers who will foot an increasingly large bill if its 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps both sides should join the local clamor for millions of dollars in 
previously approved but unspent state funds that could help pay for earthquake 
repairs. As of March, for example, $196 million of a $300-million bond approved 
by voters in 1990 had not been used. The State Allocation Board also had $74 
million that could possibly be used for repairs to elementary and secondary 
school repairs. Similarly, the College of the Canyons, which lost half of its 
classroom space in the quake, should be lobbying for some of the $75 million in 
unspent higher-education bond monies approved as far back as 1988. Obtaining 
such money might reduce Santa Clarita's quake relief needs . . . and perhaps 
its legal bills.

THIN BLUE LINE BEING STRETCHED EVER THINNER; RIORDAN POLICE BUILDUP PLAN WILL 
HELP, BUT NOT MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you sitting down? If you aren't, have a seat . . . please. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Police Foundation, a nationally recognized nonprofit group 
dedicated to improving law enforcement, had disturbing news for the city of Los 
Angeles. In a report entitled "The Big Six: Policing America's Largest Cities," 
there were statistics on the number of sworn personnel per square mile of each 
municipality. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit had 37.2 officers per square mile. Philadelphia, with Willie L. 
Williams as chief at the time, had more than 50 officers per square mile. 
Chicago had nearly 55 officers. New York City was in a league of its own, with 
nearly 90 officers per square mile. Washington, D.C., wasn't included in the 
report, but the nation's capital had 70 local officers per square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, all 465.9 square miles of it, had just 14.9 sworn officers per 
square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how would Mayor Richard Riordan's first-year proposed budget buildup 
affect that horribly skewed bar graph? If the City Council approves it? Not by 
much. It would bring the number up to 16.6 sworn officers per square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "sworn" can be quite misleading. It says nothing, in fact, about the 
number of uniformed and traffic officers who are actually out in cars or on 
motorcycles, patrolling our streets. They are far fewer in number. For the San 
Fernando Valley's 2,812 street miles, for example, there are 1,047 uniformed 
and traffic officers. Factor in illnesses, injuries, vacations and the fact 
that folks work in shifts, not like 24-hour RoboCops, and that figure is 
reduced accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it finally mean? In the Foothill Division, for example, with its 
60.8 square miles and 538 street miles, there might be four or five cars 
patrolling on the morning shift, which runs from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., according 
to Cmdr. John Moran, the assistant commanding officer for operations in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, a few of those wheezing, six-figure-mileage patrol cars might 
just stall at some inopportune moment. "If you have one car covering a couple 
of reporting districts, it doesn't take long for one car to be out of service. 
Another car has to back up the other," Moran says. "Pretty soon there is no 
integrity for staying on one's beat." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the thin blue line. It's the thin blue thread, and it is being 
pulled to the breaking point by new, labor-intensive demands. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those demands include gang bans in certain parts of town. These require 
police officers to maintain long lists of gang members who are to be arrested 
if found in certain parts of Panorama City, for example, even if they are only 
carrying a flashlight, screwdriver or a gang-emblem belt buckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Los Angeles city attorney has added that officers must arrest certain 
convicted prostitutes for probation violations if they are simply caught 
attracting traffic in certain locations at certain hours. Solicitation need not 
be proved. Both are incredibly labor-intensive in terms of the number of police 
needed to clear such areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Other crimes, for which Los Angeles is notorious, have not slackened either. 
There are more hit-and-run accidents here than any other part of the state, and 
California leads the nation in such accidents. They are difficult to solve, 
time-consuming and are handled, of course, by traffic officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The meaning of all this ought to be quite clear to Valley residents. Riordan's 
proposed police buildup is but a first step (and a vital one) on a tall 
staircase toward the kind of police force that can implement a preventive, 
community-oriented policing program. It will take considerable time and expense 
to build the LAPD to a force befitting the city's size and population.

TIME FOR A LITTLE BRUSH-FIRE PREVENTION; RESIDENTS IN HIGH-RISK VALLEY AREAS 
SHOULD FOLLOW A FEW SIMPLE RULES WHEN PLANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for a public service editorial. The audience we seek includes 
residents in the mountain fire district and fire buffer zones of Woodland 
Hills, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Encino, Tarzana, Studio City, Sherman Oaks 
and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 We hate to say it, but it's time to swap some earthquake recovery stories for 
the kind of effort that might help prevent a repeat of last year's devastating 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week, a few dozen members of the Los Angeles Fire Department's Brush 
Task Force began their annual, two-monthlong inspections for the kinds of 
vegetation that can fuel conflagrations of the type that occurred last year. 
Those inspections will continue through the end of the year as local fire 
departments take over responsibility for this work. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks who live in those areas will be required to remove all hazardous native 
brush, weeds, grass and vegetation . . . even dead trees. The need for this is 
obvious when one considers the fact that fire brands or flying embers can 
easily travel up to half a mile from an actual flame front. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, why not start now? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few rules of thumb involving plants. So-called "pyrophytes" are 
definitely out. Junipers, conifers such as pines and cedars, eucalyptus, 
peppers, bamboo, pampas grass and palms can all be explosive fire fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire departments also prefer that no trees or tall shrubs be within 30 feet of 
a house in fire-prone areas. Ten feet is the minimum. And soon, it will be time 
to cut back those weedy annual grasses, and time to prune and clear out dead 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 For landscaping purposes, the most fire-resistant (and low water usage) 
options include native coast live oak, mahogany and western redbud trees. Also 
preferable are rosea or white trailing ice plant, cape weed, snow in summer, 
ivy, geraniums, yarow, dwarf rosemary, and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow these rules of thumb and you're going to see a lot of relieved and 
pleased fire inspectors in the coming months. You might even save a few of 
those hard-earned tax dollars you've shelled out for extinguishing brush fires.

REACTION TO APPEARANCE OF A REVILED SYMBOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the effort to promote understanding of the Buddhist use of the swastika 
("Buddhist's Use of Swastikas Focus of Cultural Conflict," April 27), it is 
important for Americans to realize that the swastika is one of the oldest, most 
universal religious symbols used extensively by the early Christian church, 
especially in the forms of the crux dissimulata (disguised cross) and the croix 
gammee or croix cramponnee (hook cross) known in German as Hakenkreuz . 
</P>
<P>
 In old Danish churches, the swastika was used as a decoration on baptismal 
fonts, and it was often used decoratively on the feet of church windows 
throughout Europe. The swastika was also much used in medieval heraldry, 
although knights couldn't be sure whether it stood for the cross of the 
crucifixion or the cross of Thor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's use of the swastika was based on the mistaken notion that the 
swastika was used by the Vehmic (German "punishment") Courts, civil tribunals 
whose activities were kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
 They were convened to pursue heretics and eventually became connected with the 
Inquisition. This secret society operated underground much like the Black Hand 
in Sicily, and from this organization came specifically anti-Semitic societies 
in Austria and Germany in the early 20th Century that were the forerunners of 
Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes that understanding the true nature of the swastika, like the truth 
about the pentagram, will take the onus off and restore a beautiful and 
meaningful symbol to its rightful place in human spiritual understanding. 
</P>

<P>
 * I don't care how many centuries before World War II the swastika stood for 
peace. The Nazis changed the meaning forever in my mind, and to me it will 
always stand for torture, death and atrocities to innocent humans. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the owners of the Buddhist building will be sensitive enough to remove 
the swastikas from their fence.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL MATERIALS, EVERYONE IS IN DIRE NEED; 
A SCHOOL COUNCIL MEETS TO AWARD MONEY TO TEACHERS. NOT ALL OF THE REQUESTS ARE 
MET. IT BRINGS HOME THE LOW PRIORITY OUR STATE AND CITY PLACE ON EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

public schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The School Leadership Council adjourned at 5:25 p.m. Most of the teachers left 
first. Parents clustered a moment longer before departing. An assistant 
principal assured the custodian he would lock up. I moved slowly toward the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting had gone well. We had reached consensus on the primary issue at 
hand. Nevertheless, I felt disheartened. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, schools receive an allocation for instructional materials. The 
amount is based on enrollment and comes to about $28 per student. About a 
quarter of the fund goes to running administrative, attendance and counseling 
offices. The balance is supposed to cover things like ingredients for science 
experiments, construction paper, pens and markers, chalk, erasers and a host of 
other non-textbook items. On the average each teacher receives about $250 a 
year. For my student load it amounts to about $1 per student per semester. It's 
easy to see why teachers supplement the meager allocation from their own 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, our school decided to create a "superfund" equal to 10% of our 
account -- $7,783. We made the fund available to any department or program with 
a special need, things that cost more than $250 and which they couldn't 
purchase from their materials account. We encouraged everyone to ask for items 
which could help a lot of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Making superfund awards was the primary reason the School Leadership Council 
met, and we all looked forward to being part of the process, to moving our 
school forward after so many budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the 
condition of public education in Los Angeles in general and of our school in 
particular. However, since there is little contact among departments, I hadn't 
fully understood the abysmal conditions that other teachers were working under. 
Making the awards brought home the low priority our state and city place on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Later I called friends at Chatsworth, Monroe, Verdugo and Sylmar high schools. 
The story is the same all over: Everyone hopes to get a grant, but it's like 
trying to win the Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 To a big business, our requests would seem pitifully small. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemistry teacher asked for new heating stations to replace old, 
non-functioning Bunsen burners. She's been trying to comply with state 
guidelines that call for two hands-on experiments a week. Since she has only 
six working heating elements, the class is divided into groups of six or seven. 
That means that while two students have a hands-on experience, the other four 
or five are hands-off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The music teacher asked for some additional band instruments. Fifty students 
share 20 instruments in each class. While they wait their turns, they read or 
listen to music or play cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The photography teacher asked for a photo drying unit, cost $1,283. Currently, 
he dries hundreds of student photos, which won't all fit in the old unit, on 
clotheslines strung around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The graphic arts teacher had already scrounged video monitors and computer 
parts from businesses' discards but needed three hard drives for $762. 
</P>
<P>
 The school secretary asked for a computer station, because they are still 
using typewriters in the office. Imagine running a business with 3,000 
employees using a typewriter and a hand-held calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 My department, language arts, wanted a computer capable of handling a desktop 
publishing program that my son had donated. We've been planning to publish a 
student art and literary magazine in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The requests went on and on. I wished we could have granted all of them. But 
all we had was the $7,783 we had scraped together. 
</P>
<P>
 We did the best we could. The band will have a few more trumpets and tubas. 
Graphic arts will have hard drives to run its software. Science won't have all 
the heating sources it needs, but six new ones will help. And our main office 
will have one computer station which the dozen or so clerks will share. 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be a new dryer for photography or CD-ROM for social studies. 
Business students will continue to clunk away on their typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative writing? Well, we didn't get our computer. Nevertheless, my students 
will continue writing their poems and stories, and I will continue bringing 
them home to type. We will manage to publish our magazine. Unfortunately, it 
won't be the kids who learn to do desktop publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 About my colleagues and their students? Wanted: a city of angels.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; LONGING FOR THE BULLOCK'S BUILDING; I NEVER ANALYZED EXACTLY 
HOW ALL THOSE FLAT PLANES CAME TOGETHER; I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A SYMMETRY TO 
IT. THAT'S WHY IT ALWAYS WAS A SURPRISE TO LOOK AT IT. AND YET IT HELD ITS 
PLACE FIRMLY, LIKE A BULLOCK, OVERLOOKING THE STORES.

<P>
 I miss Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't exactly miss Bullock's. I miss the Bullock's building. Oh, I 
bought a few things at the Northridge store over the years, as did my wife; I 
think I'll always remember the light green leisure suit I bought there in the 
'70s, which I loved (did I really wear that to teach classes at CSUN?). 
</P>
<P>
 What I really miss though, is the structure, the architecture, which was taken 
away from us so rudely by the earthquake. There was something about that 
building that caught my eye every time I drove by on Tampa Avenue, whether or 
not I had any business at the Fashion Center. Many, many times I looked at it 
in its off-kilter stalwartness, squatting amiably to anchor one end of the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 What possessed a department store designer to come up with such a profile? My 
fancy always said it was the name of the store that inspired the design. 
Bullock's. The sound of it, the animal imagery of it. Heavy, low, sturdy, 
strong. Rounded in its squareness with all those facets meeting one another at 
odd, unpredictable angles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I never analyzed exactly how all those flat planes came together; I don't 
think there was a symmetry to it. That's why it always was a surprise to look 
at it. And yet it held its place firmly, like a bullock, overlooking the 
remainder of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask myself why I miss it more than a building I actually used more 
frequently and that has been totally gone now for weeks: the Kaiser Permanente 
pharmacy and clinic at Balboa and Devonshire. My wife and I always had our 
prescriptions filled there, utilized the services of optometry there fairly 
often. It was astonishing to see what the quake did to that building. The sides 
of it completely slid off from the central structure, leaving it looking as 
though bombs had hit it. 
</P>
<P>
 To find it a few weeks after the quake gone , entirely demolished with nothing 
left, not even debris -- just a vacant lot -- was also breathtaking, a building 
that had been there so many years, seen so many uses. 
</P>
<P>
 But miss it? Not at all. Yes, we'd have to travel to Panorama City or Woodland 
Hills now for prescriptions -- we'd miss the convenience. But the building? It 
had nothing to distinguish it. 
</P>
<P>
 It would certainly be another matter too if the Oviatt Library on our Cal 
State Northridge campus should, God forbid, turn out to need total replacement. 
It was the architectural centerpiece of the university, warm, lofty, ambitious 
. It would be more than missed, it would be as though a dagger had been sent to 
the heart of the institution. No one will feel the campus is fully itself until 
the Oviatt is ready to open its doors again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reports now say Bullock's will take the longest of the Northridge Fashion 
Center stores to reopen, and it must be completely rebuilt. Its completion is 
not expected until the summer of 1995. That doesn't sound unreasonable 
considering the devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if those geometrically shaped facets coming together at odd angles 
weren't especially vulnerable to the thrusts and shifts of the earth's 
movements, each surge putting the junctures into unbearable stress upon one 
another. Wouldn't it be the way -- the building's especial satisfactions for 
the eye also proving to be its weakest links in resisting an earthly onslaught? 
What will the newly designed store look like? I don't know. I could hope for 
the old look in some ingeniously reinforced manner. But I suppose not. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, among the unsung losses from the Northridge quake exist such 
nonquantifiable and nonfleshly, yet human, matters as a lost building upon a 
landscape. Commercial ventures go on within it to serve a public's needs. But 
services to the heart and spirit, no less needed, were etched upon its face.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; 'MANAGED CARE' TAKES DECISIONS OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S HANDS;

By MELVIN H. KIRSCHNER, Melvin H. Kirschner, a physician practicing in Van

committee on biomedical ethics, but the views expressed here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 80-year-old woman, many years my patient, came to my office the other day 
in respiratory distress. It was quickly evident to me that she was in heart 
failure. I told her that she would need an X-ray and medication. 
</P>
<P>
 She told me she had signed up with a health maintenance organization since her 
last visit. My secretary called the HMO. As I suspected, we were not on this 
particular part of the plan. I asked my patient why she had signed up if she 
intended to continue to come to me. 
</P>
<P>
 She told me that representatives from two plans had been coming to her house 
for weeks, "hounding" her to sign. She told them that she wanted to keep her 
regular doctor. She finally agreed to sign when the salesperson told her that 
my name was in their book. 
</P>
<P>
 Intentional or not, that was misleading information. Yes, my name is in their 
book, but not for the plan to which they assigned her. By coming to see me, she 
was "out of network." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get medical services outside a network like the one she had joined, 
the insurance company pays nothing. This is true even if the doctor whom you 
chose is signed up with the same insurance company but is affiliated with a 
different network of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is very confusing to patients and is seldom adequately explained by the 
insurance companies' sales forces. The moment my patient signed, I was no 
longer her primary physician. She had been assigned to a total stranger -- a 
doctor who knows nothing about her and has yet to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did she join this insurance group? Although she stated that they hounded 
her into it, the reason most Medicare patients join managed-care plans is the 
promise of free medicines and no annual deductibles. Their only obligation is a 
small co-payment, usually $10 or less, for each visit and prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 She can continue to be my patient, but it will cost her. When she signed with 
the HMO, she gave up her Medicare card, and the HMO will not pay for outside 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I treated her heart failure, and I'm pleased to report that she responded 
well. We avoided a paramedic run to the emergency room in the middle of the 
night and most likely prevented hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the HMO care about all of this? Probably not. After all, none of this 
costs them a cent, and the hundreds of dollars given to them monthly by the 
government is theirs to keep after small monthly fixed per-patient fees to 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies have taken medical decision-making away from patients and 
their doctors. They have accomplished this by using the concept of "managed 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care is supposed to save money by controlling the wasteful use of 
unnecessary medical services. The concept is a good one, but it sometimes 
backfires by giving insurance companies the option of refusing to authorize 
services on the basis of cost effectiveness rather than medical necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 It also delays the timely approval of needed services. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my patients, who has years of experience in the insurance industry, 
gave me a rather distasteful explanation of why insurers can dominate the 
medical decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it's a result of the "golden rule." They who have the gold make the 
rules -- in this case, the insurance industry. It not only makes the rules but 
also controls where the patients go. Its actions grow bolder as its power 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago the Prudential insurance company took 175 of my patients 
-- without notice to the patients, and only a few days notice to me -- and 
reassigned them to another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 I called to ask why. Was I doing something wrong? No, was the reply, in fact a 
poll had shown that most of my patients were very happy with me (many later 
changed insurance to return to me). I was told only that it was "a business 
decision." Did another doctor offer to work for less? Was the company 
simplifying its paperwork? I couldn't find out. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been opposed to buying and selling patients. Patients should be 
allowed to go to whomever they wish. But that's not the way managed care works. 
You pay your premium, (or your employer does) for the privilege of having 
managed care control your medical destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies treat patients like chattel. They are interested only in 
how many they can service at the lowest possible cost and highest possible 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has stated that between 25% and 40% of the health care 
dollar goes to administrative costs before one cent is spent on patient care. 
In a recent article promoting his single-payer national health plan, Rep. Jim 
McDermott (D-Wash.) said Medicare has an administrative overhead of only 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, the government decided to try to save money by encouraging 
patients to join HMOs and other managed care systems. A study showed that 
Medicare lost money by doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come to get rid of the insurance companies, their enormous 
executive salaries, obscene profits, constant interference with the 
patient/doctor relationship, huge marketing budgets and "fine print" 
manipulation of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The billions of premium dollars saved would be better spent on patient care 
and universal medical coverage.

FIRST PERSON: FIRST-TIME MOM RECEIVES GIFTS IN GIVING LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Allison Johnson, 39, was a budget 
analyst for Mazda Motor of America and Universal Studios. She is staying at 
home to raise her daughter; this is her first published article. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When my daughter, Juliana, was born nearly a year ago, I thought I was 
prepared for the many emotions I would encounter. During my pregnancy, I read 
books and talked to mothers about their experiences. I expected to feel happy, 
sad, tired, anxious and, mostly, overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 What I was surprised to discover is the deep feeling of peace motherhood has 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
 It centers and calms me as nothing has before. I am magnetized by, and riveted 
to, my daughter. I have that blissful feeling of new love, and everything seems 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 My lifestyle has slowed. I worked for many years as a professional in the 
corporate world, where the meeting is holy and lunch is the focal point of the 
day. I hurried from task to task, trying to get the maximum done in the minimum 
amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched the clock like a hawk, revolving my day around it. I enjoyed working 
and put 15 years into my career as a budget analyst. I was always looking ahead 
to the next project. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Juliana came. She slowed me down and encouraged me to live in the 
present. It is impossible to look into her face and have my mind racing ahead 
to the next thing. I absolutely lose myself in her sweet smile. 
</P>
<P>
 I have become much less self-consumed. I am not as caught up in the latest 
fashion and making sure my hair and makeup are perfect each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when I shop, I first look in the children's department for something 
for Juliana. I wonder how a certain dress would look on my daughter instead of 
gazing at an outfit for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, motherhood threw me into a state of panic. I was afraid to come home 
from the hospital, baby in tow. I felt unsure, shaky and emotional. I wanted 
the nurse to come home with me. I cried a lot. How was I going to take care of 
this tiny little person? To know that her entire development was being 
entrusted to me was scary. 
</P>
<P>
 I grow in confidence with each passing week as my mom skills expand. I chose 
to stay home and raise our daughter because I want to, and through hard work 
and planning, we will squeak through on one income. So I said goodby to the 
corporate world and hello to the land of lullabies and dirty diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 I always looked at mothers of large families and wondered how they did it. How 
could a person take care of all those people and still be sane? If I had 
started younger (I am 39), I might have wanted a large family. As the family 
grows, the amount of joy can only multiply. 
</P>
<P>
 I have become softer -- on people and myself. Some months ago, during my 
pre-mom days, I noticed a family digging through the Dumpster outside my condo. 
I hurried out to shoo them away and remind them they were on private property. 
I felt self-righteous as they nervously slunk away with their bags of aluminum 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, I observed a family digging through that same Dumpster, perhaps 
the same family. This time I felt a sense of compassion, maybe because they had 
a little girl, too. I felt camaraderie with that man, as he was doing the best 
he could do to care for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled. My change in attitude surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought I would be as fascinated by a baby as I am. Maybe it's because 
she's my own child. I find her endlessly magnetic, hanging on her every sound 
like some love-struck teen-ager gazing at his beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 What I have learned as a new mother is that I am capable of an unlimited 
amount of tolerance, patience and love -- much more than I ever dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a sense of fulfillment and peace that I've never had. I have learned 
that babies are continually interesting beings, changing and evolving with each 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliana matures and grows right before my eyes. Once, after weeks of watching 
her lie on her back, she rolled over. Just like that. No trumpets, no fanfare. 
She just did it. And I didn't have to show her a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 She sees everything with a freshness that renews me. No matter how many times 
I repeat our special words, or smile at her, she always delights in it, 
giggling in glee. 
</P>
<P>
 As I gain confidence as a mom, I find that my baby is endearingly loyal and 
loving and, mostly, predictably unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know exactly when she's going to cry, or what new thing she will do 
tomorrow, but I know that she will, and that I'll be there to share it with 
her.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; HEALING WITH THE MIND'S EYE; AFTER 33 YEARS AT UCLA, 
MARIELLE FULLER BRINGS HER EXPERTISE IN IMAGE THERAPY TO LAGUNA BEACH, GUIDING 
AIDS PATIENTS IN DREAMLIKE STATES THROUGH MENTAL LANDSCAPES TO TAP THE BODY'S 
RESOURCES FOR WELLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting beside a patient during a dream session, Marielle Fuller sometimes 
folds her torso forward abruptly, her head nearly touching her knees, and then 
snaps back upright. It is a quirk not of old age -- Fuller is 85 -- but of 
fervor for her work and, one gathers, of empathy for her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The movements punctuate Fuller's comments but do not distract her patients, 
whoseeyes are always closed and whose thoughts lie far afield. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's patient, 36-year-old Susan Tibbetts of Laguna Beach, pulls off a pair 
of Western boots and settles back on the couch. In the next 15 minutes, Fuller 
will use guided image therapy to take Tibbetts into a soothing mental landscape 
of potentially healing images. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unconscious is seen by the conscious in terms of images," Fuller 
explains, "and through accessing the unconscious we reach the higher self. The 
self is the best healer." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her age, it has been just nine months since Fuller retired from UCLA's 
Neuropsychiatric Institute as a lecturer in psychiatry. During her 33-year 
career, she trained more than 400 psychiatry residents in guided imagery 
techniques and lectured assembled therapists in London, Paris, Florence and 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its name has a New Age ring, guided imagery has roots in ancient 
healing disciplines. A cousin of hypnotherapy, it is based on the principle 
that bodily responses are linked to the patient's unconscious interpretation of 
mental stimuli. 
</P>
<P>
 In dreamlike therapy sessions, the stimuli take the form of images, archetypes 
and symbols that are spontaneously offered by the patient's unconscious. These 
images, Fuller says, serve both as metaphors that help the patient understand 
the disease process and as emotional triggers to the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because tests have proved imaging's ability to affect blood pressure, 
heart rate and other body responses, the technique has gained increased 
credibility among medical doctors for pain management. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who for years saw at least 20 private patients a week, has quit the 
lecture circuit but has no plans to retire from therapy. Since February she has 
shared her expertise as the oldest of the 150 volunteers at Laguna Shanti, an 
AIDS service group in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller had planned to retire in Laguna ever since she and her husband 
vacationed there in the '50s and '60s. She relishes the slower pace outside Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked six days a week until I was 84 1/2, and now I need time for my own 
inner life," she said. "I just love the beauty here, and it's to be my final 
home. I am a very private person, and I don't need many people." 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrived in Laguna, she realized that her skills could still prove 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there would be a lot of HIV-positive people here, and I'd heard about 
Shanti and asked if I could do workshops. I had worked with people with 
Parkinson's disease, colitis and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in competition with doctors; I'm only an adjunct to taking care of a 
patient. Imagery can prepare them to die in a very different place because it 
helps them discover their own spirituality. They have strength and power to 
control the pain and live a richer life than if they weren't doing imagery." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, says Sarah Kasman of Shanti, the workshops have been well received. 
</P>
<P>
 "With AIDS, alternative therapies are very significant, and the people have 
really loved it," Kasman said. "Many people with life-threatening illnesses 
lose their sense of self and feel powerless. Imagery can bring some of that 
power back to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because it is a rainy day, Tibbetts is the only person who has shown 
up at Fuller's weekly session at Shanti. Or maybe, Fuller says, the low turnout 
is to be expected after last week's session, an emotional freight train for the 
half-dozen AIDS patients and mourning partners of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A common mistake among imagery therapists, according to Fuller, is directing 
patients to pleasant scenes rather than letting the unconscious confront and 
overcome obstacles naturally, which Fuller says leads to longer-term healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People cry and get very sad, but that's where they are," she says. "Sometimes 
the archetypal figure in the dream will say, 'Your tears are OK. Let's water 
the ground with them, and maybe something will grow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbetts, who is HIV-positive, has requested an image session before she moves 
out of state. Fuller leans forward earnestly and begins to lay the dream's 
groundwork. Her voice has a practiced cadence and a low register that 
nonetheless manages to maintain its freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are walking on a path in a forest. A lovely wide path, very smooth, very 
comfortable." Fuller, rocking forward, waits for the peaceful scene to be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will come to a stream, and the stream has formed a pool. You will get in 
it, because it's a healing pool. Feel it; look up at the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes in the pool, Tibbetts says that some animals, including a 
fawn, have come to drink from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deer in imagery is a very spiritual animal, and he may want to show you 
something," Fuller says. "You will follow the deer and see what he wants to 
show you. We'll come back to the pool after." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the fawn takes Tibbetts is a barbed-wire fence, in which another deer is 
entangled. Tibbetts frees the animal. A few minutes later, after the therapy 
has ended, she agrees that the sequence's obvious symbolism -- spiritual 
development running into obstacles -- rings true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm spiritual, but (having HIV,) it's been a struggle," Tibbetts said. "I 
think, 'Why me? Am I not good enough?' But what the dream told me is that I can 
overcome that. The session was very centering, very empowering. Other leaders 
describe the entire scene, but she allowed me to use more imagination myself. I 
could feel her energy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fuller, born in Montreal in 1909, recalls her mother as being domineering yet 
fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was queen of the house. My father was a wonderful man, but my sister and 
I didn't get very close to him -- my mother wouldn't allow it," Fuller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing the Montreal schools to be mediocre, her mother taught Fuller until 
she was 10, and Fuller earned her high school diploma through tutors. "I don't 
think keeping me out of school was a good idea, because I was very lonely," 
Fuller says. "But I learned to be alone then, and it helps now because I've 
been alone now for 27 years, since my husband died." 
</P>
<P>
 She married Victor Fuller, an Englishman, in 1934 and moved to Toronto five 
years later. She took night journalism classes at the University of Toronto and 
wrote occasional book reviews for the Toronto Globe and Mail. Because of her 
trouble with arthritis, the couple moved to the warmer climes of California in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller became a West Coast pioneer in imaging techniques in part because of 
her ability to read the original French texts of Robert Desoille, a mechanical 
engineer who was an imagery theorist in Paris in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time it wasn't really done here, but she had the creativity to be 
able to integrate (European) ideas and come up with her own way of using guided 
imagery," said David S. Gordon, a colleague of Fuller's at UCLA for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During her years at UCLA, Fuller helped conduct drug experiments, worked with 
suicidal patients and treated hundreds of clients suffering from anxiety, 
depression or low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual aspect of her university life was that, although she worked daily 
among colleagues who have multiple academic degrees, she lacks any sort of 
college credential. For this reason, she said, administrators would 
occasionally ask her to lie low while visiting VIPs made the rounds. "I said, 
'No, I won't,' " she recalls. "They didn't know how to explain me, but they 
always trusted me." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, colleagues say it was just this spunk, as well as her innate skills as 
a therapist, that kept her afloat in the sea of pedigreed psychiatrists, 
clinicians and psychoanalysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a great ability to use psychiatrists, who were clinically trained, as 
a sounding board, to fill in gaps in her own education," said Gordon, who has 
taken over Fuller's weekly seminars at UCLA. "It's unusual for (a worker 
without a degree) to have the status and respect that she had throughout the 
institute, not just among the residents but among faculty and staff. She 
developed a large and fond following." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who trained under Fuller is Dr. Bernard Towers, a Beverly Hills 
physician who uses imagery to help patients with cancer and heart disease 
understand the body's healing processes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marielle has an absolutely remarkable clinical sense. She empathizes with 
every person she works with and can get inside their skin and see their 
situation. This is the hallmark of all good therapists," said Towers, a 
professor emeritus of anatomy and psychiatry at UCLA and the former director of 
medicine at Cambridge University in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does not have the Ph.Ds and MDs and all those tickets of admission to 
academia, but the fact is that, like many pioneers in the world's history, she 
is a pioneer because she has insight and is so skilled," Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fawzy I. Fawzy, deputy director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute, praised 
Fuller's work and said that other adjunct lecturers at the institute have 
lacked psychology degrees, including Norman Cousins, the late journalist who 
wrote on the role of mental attitude in healing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller's skills were especially put to the test on the occasions she addressed 
convention halls packed with skeptical members of psychiatric associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one lecture in Los Angeles I got up to the podium and said, 'Standing here 
I'm reminded of Daniel going into the lion's den, but I don't really see anyone 
here who's going to eat me,' " she said. "That broke the ice . . . and some of 
them later referred patients to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room of her rented home in northern Laguna, Fuller sits close to 
a picture window, where she nods now and again at the zinnias she has planted 
in her front yard. Flowers color her back patio too, planted, perhaps, to spite 
the brush fires that threatened her home in October. In her study, which 
doubles as a treatment room for Shanti patients, three bookcases contain dozens 
of the arcane psychology titles one would expect to find in the office of a 
renowned therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because my education has been very much my own doing, reading is very, very 
important to me," Fuller says. "But even that is getting harder now, with age." 
</P>
<P>
 The maladies of the elderly, which have begun to slow Fuller, led to her 
retirement from UCLA. Because of cataracts, she must use a magnifier to read, 
and she says large-type books are a blessing. To get around town she depends on 
her 52-year-old daughter, Monica ("my seeing-eye daughter"), and on friends who 
drive from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, a mother of two, has lately been indulging her fondness for gardening, 
music and reading as she has adjusted to a far more anonymous life than she had 
in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning it was frustrating not being as well known in Laguna as I 
was in Los Angeles," she said. "I even had a dream about it. I dreamed that my 
purse and my wallet (were) stolen, and all my identification cards were in the 
wallet. No one could know who I was, meaning my identity was nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Another frustration to Fuller is that, in part because no license is needed to 
do image therapy, many practitioners have only a marginal understanding of 
symbols and their importance in interpreting the unconscious mind. She is 
collaborating with Toby Klasser-Rothman, an Encino psychotherapist, on a book 
that details the role of symbols in imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to any approach to imagery, however, is the principle that the body 
has built-in mechanisms for healing. To Fuller it is an axiom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't get in touch with is psychic energy," she says. "There's so 
much of it in the universe that we never call on. It's not magical but just 
getting in touch with your own power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient," she says, "is the best doctor."

THE LAW IS ROOT OF IMMIGRATION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the debate over children born to immigrants, as a former Russian 
lawyer, I suggest a curious comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 If a child is born to Russian parents in America, he is a citizen of the 
United States. This is American law. 
</P>
<P>
 If a child is born to American parents in Russia, he is not a citizen of 
Russia. Why? Because according to American law, he is still a citizen of the 
United States. This is Russian law. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it a reason why a lot of Russians live in the United States, and no 
Americans in Russia?

CONSERVANCY SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE BLUEPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Calabasas Needs to Follow the Blueprint" (April 17) mentions 
the support of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for the 250-unit Micor 
project, upzoned by the City of Calabasas from 81 units. If we look behind all 
the major upzonings in the delicate Malibu Creek Watershed in the last few 
years, we will see the implied or direct stamp of approval of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy supported the new massive City on Ahmanson. Ventura's 
blueprint designated this magnificent 5,400-acre ranch as an open space 
greenbelt. This convoluted deal will create a new city next to the San Fernando 
Valley, and the public, not Ahmanson, will pay a total of $29 million for 
restrictively zoned hard-to-develop mountain properties. Public financing of 
developer windfalls can hardly qualify as a mitigation for the loss of precious 
native grasslands, oak woodlands, and pristine wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 General plans are written to insure orderly development and preservation of 
important resources for all people. They are formulated by consensus and are 
therefore not to be discarded lightly. Save Open Space will continue to insist 
that all jurisdictions and agencies follow the blueprint, including the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 MARY E. WIESBROCK Agoura Hills Wiesbrock is the director of Save Open Space. * 
</P>
<P>
 Your April 17 editorial, "Calabasas Needs to Follow the Blueprint" correctly 
chided the Calabasas City Council for wasting public money in court battles to 
proceed with approval of a development that was inconsistent with the 
established county plan. I disagree however, with your comment that the value 
of the project is not the issue. It is precisely the issue!  
</P>
<P>
 As you noted, the City of Calabasas was created and the council members 
largely centered their campaigns on the issues of protection of the natural 
beauty and the quality of life in Calabasas. Massive grading, dramatic upzoning 
and the destruction of a pristine wildlife habitat area, which includes a 
limited private open space dedication of undevelopable portions of the project 
site, can hardly be called an overriding benefit to the public or to the 
natural resources of Malibu Canyon.

WHY CAN'T THE SCHOOLS DELIVER IS THE QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Bernson-Parmenter raises some interesting questions in her Valley 
Commentary article "Are We Too Poor to Deny Kids a Richer Education?" (April 
24). However, she asks the wrong questions and appears to miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, these courses and activities were once available to the children. We did 
benefit from the various classes that we were able to attend. Our parents did 
pay taxes for these things. 
</P>
<P>
 We, the taxpaying adults of this era, also pay for these things, and we pay 
significantly more than our parents did.  
</P>
<P>
 The question is not why don't we pay for these things. The question is what 
happens to the taxes we do pay? Somewhere along the line our money is 
disappearing down some deep, dark pit, and our kids are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The question should be, why can't the school districts deliver the goods for 
which we, like our parents before us, pay? Where is all this money going? It 
is, very obviously, not getting to the school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty ones are not the taxpayers or the on-site school staffs. The guilty 
spendthrifts are somewhere in the vast gray area between the two points. 
</P>
<P>
 KAREN E. NOVIKOFF Granada Hills My daughter is a special-education teacher in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. I agree with Janet Bernson-Parmenter 
(Valley Commentary, April 24) that the schools need art, music, field trips, 
driver's education, cooking and shop again. No doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also right about there not being enough money for these and other 
programs. But that is where her logic and good sense stop. 
</P>
<P>
 In this state we spend approximately $30,000 to $35,000 per year per person to 
house people in prison. They get TVs and gyms to exercise in, three square 
meals a day, medical care, conjugal visits and all the rest -- everything but 
hard work. I mean hard, hard work. Making little rocks out of big ones, road 
repair, picking up trash, cleaning graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending $30,000 to $35,000 on them, we should spend only half that 
amount and give the rest back to the schools where it was taken from in the 
first place by our glorious elected officials. Add that to the paltry $3,500 
per year per student spent to educate our children and see what changes take 
place in a very short period of time.

SEATTLE IS BEHIND EIGHT-BALL; NBA PLAYOFFS: MUTOMBO HAS EIGHT BLOCKS, PACK 
SCORES 23 AS NUGGETS OUST TOP-SEEDED SUPERSONICS, 98-94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Denver center Dikembe Mutombo was overcome with emotion after the Nuggets 
ousted the Seattle SuperSonics from the NBA playoffs with a stunning 98-94 
overtime victory Saturday in the decisive fifth game of their first-round 
Western Conference playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo, who had eight points, 15 rebounds and a playoff-record eight blocked 
shots, fell to the court and hugged the ball like a father cradling a newborn 
baby as the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was emotion coming from my heart," Mutombo said. "I just couldn't believe 
that we won this series. We've been called underdogs all series long, 
especially after the way we got whipped (a 24-point loss) in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are part of history right now. I dreamed that this game went into 
overtime. I wasn't sure that it was the same dream as the game showed, but when 
we went to overtime I knew that this dream was correct and we were going to win 
this ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Before a stunned sellout crowd of 14,813 at the Seattle Center Coliseum, the 
Nuggets pulled off one of the biggest upsets in NBA playoff history as they 
became the first eighth-seeded team to eliminate a top-seeded team. After 
losing the first two games of the series, the Nuggets won three in row, the 
last two in overtime, against the SuperSonics, who compiled the NBA's best 
regular-season record (63-19). 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone had penciled them into the finals," said Nugget backup guard Robert 
Pack, who scored a career-high 23 points. "Watching TV all week, 
(sportscasters) were saying we didn't have a chance. We wanted to come out and 
prove a lot of people wrong, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stunned the SuperSonics, who were booed off the court after losing 
for the first time in 15 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is embarrassing," said Seattle guard Kendall Gill, who had a team-high 
22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Sam Perkins agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this team really did have a chance to win the championship," 
Perkins said. "We're doing a lot of soul-searching right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver will face the Utah Jazz, which advanced by beating the San Antonio 
Spurs in four games, in a Western Conference semifinal series that opens 
Tuesday night at Salt Lake City. The Nuggets were 1-4 against the Jazz during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack, formerly of USC, outplayed Seattle All-Star point guard Gary Payton, who 
had 14 points and eight assists, scoring 22 second-half points. Denver, which 
trailed 44-41 at halftime, outscored the SuperSonics, 57-50, in the second half 
and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to come out and play hard and show the nation that I belong in 
this league," said Pack, who made three of five three-point shots in the second 
half as Denver overcame an 11-point third-quarter deficit. "No one gave me a 
shot to be in the league, but I didn't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver reserve forward Brian Williams had career highs of 17 points and 19 
rebounds as Denver's reserves outscored Seattle's reserves, 42-19. With Mutombo 
on the bench for the last eight minutes of the first half because of foul 
trouble, Williams had seven points and seven rebounds in the second quarter to 
help keep the Nuggets close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets did a superb job on the boards, outrebounding the SuperSonics, 
58-36. They also did a good job of defending All-Star forward Shawn Kemp, who 
had 19 points and 12 rebounds but shot only 37.1% in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 78-70, the SuperSonics outscored the Nuggets, 18-10, in the final 
5:57 of regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 88-88 on Gill's 
putback with 0.5 seconds remaining in regulation. Mutombo, who had an NBA 
record 31 blocks in the five-game series, forced Payton to shoot an airball, 
but the Nuggets failed to box out Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets, however, didn't fold in overtime despite four 24-second 
violations. Trailing, 92-90, Denver outscored Seattle, 8-2, in the final 3:06 
of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it's over," Seattle guard Nate McMillan said. "I'm going to 
get up tomorrow and have nothing to do and it's May."

ON LEITER SIDE OF NEWS, A'S ROLL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels don't want to see it happen. They hate even contemplating the idea, 
wanting to provide Mark Leiter every possible chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this is a business, and after the Angels' 7-4 defeat Saturday night to 
the Oakland Athletics, they are staring at the cruel realization that they soon 
might have to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they continue to keep Leiter in the starting rotation, or do they send him 
to the bullpen? 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter (2-3), who has shown his heart and courage this season, lost for the 
third consecutive game. He was lit up for a season-high 10 hits and seven 
earned runs in his seven-inning stint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Athletics had five runs and eight hits off Leiter by the fourth inning, 
and by the sixth, third baseman Scott Brosius had four runs batted in. Oakland 
had a 7-0 lead by the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels scored three runs in the ninth to make things interesting for the 
25,474 at Anaheim Stadium, but Dennis Eckersley struck out Tim Salmon for the 
final out, getting his first save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's reverting back to being a two-pitch pitcher," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
said of Leiter. "He's been throwing that fastball-slider for so long, he has to 
start changing that a little bit and throw his split-finger more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to come up with something to change his thinking. I haven't 
decided what that will be yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leiter, who might be spared a bullpen demotion for the time being by 
starter Brian Anderson's broken thumb: "He's the manager, so I'm not going to 
question him, but I just didn't make good pitches. I got hurt on my fastball as 
much as anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Athletics, at 9-21 off to the worst start in their 27 years in 
Oakland, it was only their second victory in 17 games. In fact, if not for 
starting pitcher Bobby Witt, they would be winless since April 17. He pitched 
six shutout innings Saturday and has been the only starter who has won a game 
for the Athletics the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Angels were in good spirits. They watched Mark Langston, the ace of 
their staff, put on a dazzling performance in a simulated four-inning game 
Saturday afternoon. Langston will be examined today by Dr. Lewis Yocum, and if 
Yocum provides clearance, Langston will return to the starting rotation this 
week on their trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "It's amazing that his arm can get cut on, and in four weeks be 
back in full tilt. Ten years ago, it would probably be a career-ending 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The most unfortunate aspect of Langston's return to the rotation is that he 
won't be joining Anderson. It was Anderson who replaced him April 10, with the 
Angels winning five of his six starts, and now Langston must replace Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the disappointing part," Langston said. "He pitched so well for us, 
and I would have liked for him to stay in there. I wish both of us could have 
stayed in the rotation, because that would have made us a lot better team." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson broke his left thumb while trying to field a grounder Friday night. 
It is expected to sideline him at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that stinks about it," Anderson said, "was that was the best I've 
thrown all year. But the bright spot is that Mark's coming back, and he won't 
hurt the rotation any. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, come on, we're adding Mark Langston." 
</P>
<P>
 The folks most disappointed in the latest turn of events are those in 
Anderson's hometown of Geneva, Ohio. They had planned a Brian Anderson Day on 
May 31 when the Angels are in Cleveland, with three buses already reserved to 
take folks to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to make that trip," Anderson said, "even if I have to fly 
out myself. There's no way I can miss that one now."

DODGERS TURN UP THE JUICE; BASEBALL: BUTLER AND OFFERMAN HIT BACK-TO-BACK 
HOMERS, AND OFFERMAN'S CHECK-SWING SINGLE BEATS GIANTS IN 10TH, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a most unexpected way, Kevin Gross, that Giant killer, backed by Brett 
Butler and Jose Offerman, those powerhouses, led the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory 
in 10 innings Saturday at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to get a win, it might as well be funky," Gross said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gross now is 10-8 against San Francisco, so his success was no shock, but what 
happened in the sixth inning was completely out of character. Butler led off 
the inning with a home run -- his second in three games -- and Offerman 
followed with another -- his first of the season -- both against a stunned Mark 
Portugal, who hadn't given up a hit since Butler's leadoff single in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you enjoyed it, because I don't think you will see them anymore," 
Offerman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The home runs surprised everyone except Manager Tom Lasorda, who claims he 
called the homers before the inning started. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Butler was walking up to the plate, I said, "back-to-back-to-back homers," 
Lasorda said, including Mike Piazza, who grounded out, in that prediction. "So 
after Offy hits his, Orel Hershiser turns to me and says, 'If Piazza hits this 
out, I'm taking you to Vegas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, who held the Dodgers to four hits in eight innings, said the homers 
didn't surprise him, either. "When you get behind in the count, they can turn 
on on a ball, and when both balls were hit I knew they had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The home runs, which made the score 2-2, were the only runs the Dodgers scored 
until the 10th, when Offerman's check-swing single against reliever Mike 
Jackson (2-1) scored Delino DeShields from second base for the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was hit soft and died before Barry (Bonds) got to it, but it would 
have been a close play at the plate with DeShields' speed," Jackson said. "It 
was tough to lose on a hit like that, but that's baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, who hadn't played since Wednesday because of a bruised elbow, entered 
the game in the ninth and led off the 10th inning against left-hander Al Osuna, 
who arrived Thursday from Albuquerque. Osuna struck out Bonds, then turned the 
game over to Darren Dreifort, who retired the next two on ground balls to earn 
his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Barry coming out and trying to do it when maybe he should have waited 
another day, it just shows you the rivalry between these two teams, and it will 
last the whole year," said Butler, who is batting .404 with 18 runs scored in 
his last 16 games. Against the Giants, he has a .310 career average. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said his home run was about as well as he can hit a ball. "It was a 
mistake, I'm supposed to hit line drives and hit the ball on the ground," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Offerman has hit only two homers in his two full seasons in the majors and 
Butler has 45 in 13 seasons, before this series. But it is Butler's recent 
power surge that has raised questions about the so-called juiced ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After Butler homered Saturday, Giant Manager Dusty Baker merely shrugged. 
"When Butler and Offy hit back-to-back homers, it makes you wonder," he said. 
"Both of them were no-doubters. I just hope they start juicing them our way." 
</P>
<P>
 When Gross last faced the Giants, on the final day of last season, they had 
the best offense in the league, but Gross held them to six hits in a 12-1 rout. 
The Giants' offense this season is the worst in the league, but the result for 
Gross was the same.  
</P>
<P>
 When he started getting his fastball up, he adjusted by mixing up his pitches, 
changing speeds and throwing slow curveballs. It kept the Giants off balance, 
and helped Gross hold them after giving up runs in the first two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a Met killer, now I'm a Giant winner," said Gross, who had a 
no-hitter against San Francisco in 1992. "I've had good success against them."

VOLLEYBALL / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; EAST FINALLY BEATS WEST WITH UCLA LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HORNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This isn't the type of history UCLA likes to make. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Bruins became the first school to lose an NCAA men's volleyball 
championship match to an Eastern school Saturday night, falling to 
second-seeded Penn State, 9-15, 15-13, 4-15, 15-12, 15-12, at Allen County War 
Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a boon for East Coast volleyball," said UCLA Coach Al Scates, 
who was seeking his 15th national crown. "We're looking forward to playing them 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion Bruins had not played Penn State this season, which 
Scates said evened things up considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the only good team that we didn't play this year, and we didn't see 
them until last night," Scates said. "They're a difficult team to score on 
because they run a very quick attack, and when they're allowed to move the ball 
around quite a bit, they can be very deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had the Nittany Lions confused early in Game 4 with a 6-0 lead and a 
two-games-to-one advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when tournament most valuable player Ramon Hernandez rallied Penn 
State, notching 17 kills with no errors in the game, including three straight 
kills to give the Nittany Lions a 13-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Jeff Nygaard followed by misfiring on two straight kill attempts to 
complete a seven-point run and extend the match to a decisive fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State, buoyed by a crowd of 7,908, rode a wave of emotion to a 12-8 lead 
in Game 5. The Bruins rallied to a 12-12 tie before Paul Nihipali and Erik 
Sullivan committed errors and Penn State's Byron Schneider converted a kill to 
complete one of the biggest upsets in collegiate volleyball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Penn State had been in this position before. Penn State was not 
nervous," said Penn State's Ed Josefoski, noting UCLA's 17 three-game wins this 
season. "UCLA had not been in that position before. They were going to crack." 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast schools won the first 24 volleyball crowns, and schools outside 
California appeared in championship matches only two times before Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should put a lot of people on notice," said Penn State Coach Tom 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nygaard tied a school match record with 37 kills, but he also committed 18 
errors to finish with a .229 kill percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins started strong, taking a 6-0 lead in the first game before Penn 
State rallied briefly to make it 11-9. UCLA, however, scored three straight 
points on Nihipali's serve to effectively put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State trailed, 7-3, in Game 2 but rallied to tie the match. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA dominated Game 3, posting a .552 kill percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's rally forced the Bruins to lose their composure, reaching a peak 
in Game 5, when Kevin Wong ripped off his jersey after an official's call went 
against UCLA. He received a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State converted at a .462 clip in the final game to UCLA's .182. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss breaks UCLA's 27-match overall, 14-match NCAA tournament and 
seven-match NCAA championship match winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, Schneider, Josefoski, Nygaard, Nihipali and Sullivan earned 
all-tournament honors.

GOLF ROUNDUP; DALY RETAINS TWO-SHOT LEAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly overcame an early bogey-double bogey stretch to shoot a 
three-under-par 69 and retain a two-shot lead over Brian Henninger in the third 
round of the BellSouth Classic Saturday at Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly had a 54-hole total of 202, 14 shots under par on the hilly, 7,018-yard 
Atlanta Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Four others, including Tom Kite and defending champion Nolan Henke, were four 
shots off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite eagled the final hole for a 68, Henke shot 69, David Peoples 68 and 
Blaine McCallister 69, leaving them all tied at 206. Kite's eagle came after he 
hit his three-iron eight feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly stretched his lead to three shots when he birdied the second hole but 
then got into trouble. He bogeyed the par-three third and took six shots on the 
par-four fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly got one shot back when he birdied the sixth and then started the back 
side with consecutive birdie putts of 20 feet on 10 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "The front nine was a little shaky," Daly said, noting the birdie on the sixth 
hole saved him. "It was solid after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger, 30, the Hogan Tour player of the year two years ago, had birdies on 
Nos. 6, 12 and 14, his last a 10-footer that moved him into a share of the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a two-shot swing on the par-three 16th when Daly rolled in a 
30-footer for birdie and Henninger blasted out of a trap eight feet short and 
missed his par putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Daly and Henninger, who also shot 69, birdied the par-five final hole 
with two putts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Douglass and Charles Coody, who teamed to win the 1990 Legends of Golf 
tournament, shot an 11-under-par 61 to grab a two-shot lead in the team-format 
tournament at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 124 put them two strokes ahead of the teams of Bob Murphy and Jim 
Colbert and Chi Chi Rodriguez and Jim Dent in the $1.1-million two-man, 
better-ball event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino and Mike Hill, the winning team in 1991 and 1992, were three shots 
off the lead at 17-under 127. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gail Graham moved into contention with an eight-under-par 64 for a two-day 
total of 137 before heavy rain cut short the second round of the $525,000 Sara 
Lee Classic at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Leader Jane Crafter, at eight-under after 18 holes, and defending champion Meg 
Mallon and Laura Davies, both at seven-under, had just teed off when officials 
stopped play because of a thunderstorm over the Hermitage Golf Course.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; MARTIN ENDS WILANDER'S RUN ON CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Todd Martin overcame his own mistakes as well as a determined Mats 
Wilander on Saturday to take a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory in the semifinals of the 
USTA Clay Court Classic at Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, the only seeded player left in the field, will face Jared Palmer, a 
6-3, 6-4 winner over Mark Woodforde, in the final today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilander nearly proved himself to be a prophet in the match. He was hoping 
that he could force a three-set showdown so that he could wear Martin down. 
Although he did force that third set -- the match went 2 hours 17 minutes -- 
Martin regained his flagging composure and twice came back from the brink of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a poor second set and he played a very good second set," Martin 
said. 
</P>

<P>
 Martina Navratilova might be ready to retire, but she showed she still has the 
stuff to win on clay as she volleyed her way into the final of the Italian Open 
at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, seeded second at 37, trounced 20-year-old Irina Spirlea of 
Romania, 6-2, 6-3, in 66 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's title match, Navratilova will face top-seeded Conchita Martinez of 
Spain, who crushed Karina Habsudova, a qualifier from Slovakia, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, who has announced she's quitting the singles tour at the end of 
the year, has not won a clay-court tournament since Hilton Head Island, S.C., 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Young Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov continued his meteoric rise by defeating 
defending German Open champion Michael Stich, 6-3, 6-4, to reach the finals at 
Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent in today's final will be his childhood friend, Ukraine's Andrei 
Medvedev, 19, who ousted Spain's Javier Sanchez, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafelnikov, 20, charged back from a 4-2 deficit in the second set to add the 
top-seeded German to his growing list of prominent victims at the $1.72-million 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably mad at me," Kafelnikov said. "I've beaten him four straight 
times."

<P>
 The story of the eighth race at Churchill Downs on Saturday was etched on the 
faces of the 14 riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron's was clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the others were caked with mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin had turned what might have been the most exciting 2:03 3/5 in 
sports into a stroll in the slop. 
</P>
<P>
 No bull. Go For Gin did what Holy Bull was supposed to do. He got the early 
lead and improved his position to win by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, the Hall of Fame jockey, was happy to be along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience on Go For Gin had consisted of a single workout Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 2-year-old-old Eclipse Award winner Dehere looked as though he 
would be McCarron's mount the first Saturday of May in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dehere got hurt during the winter, it was going to be Numerous from the 
Charlie Whittingham stable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Numerous was a disappointment in the Santa Anita Derby and wound up 
winning the Derby Trial, but not racing in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Go For Gin, with Jerry Bailey aboard, finished second to 
Irgun, with Gary Stevens, in the Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 No fool, Bailey chose to ride Irgun in the Derby. Stevens already was booked 
on Brocco. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, how was Bailey to know that Irgun would come up with a hoof problem 
and wouldn't even be able to watch the Derby on TV? 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron's agent, Scotty McClellan, called Go For Gin's connections about the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision took about five or six seconds," co-owner William Condren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris' ride was perfect," trainer Nick Zito said. "That's why he's in the 
Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far less eventful trip than the one that brought McCarron his first 
Derby victory in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the stretch, Alysheba nearly went to his knees after clipping heels with 
Bet Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, McCarron got the job done more with brain than brawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructions from Zito were to press the pace if nobody else went after 
Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Bull didn't fire on the kind of off track that he was bred to love, 
and McCarron had the 9-1 fifth choice in front by the clubhouse turn. 
</P>
<P>
 He never looked back. Oh, McCarron did once or twice to see if anyone was 
coming, but nobody made a big move at him although Eddie Delahoussaye tried and 
got Strodes Creek within two lengths at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 None other than Jerry Bailey rode Blumin Affair to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The second choice of the public, Brocco, was fourth. It wasn't a case of 
nerves. In fact, he was too relaxed, taking in the Derby scene as the gates 
opened and getting left. 
</P>
<P>
 What Brocco saw was a lot of women wearing plastic hats, instead of their more 
fashionable and traditional bonnets, because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun was greeted by a tremendous ovation at 12:15 but didn't stay long. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed at 20-1 in the morning line, Soul Of The Matter was bet down to 16-1 by 
hunch players who liked the chances of a horse owned by the composer, Burt 
Bacharach, of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Santa Anita leading man Kent Desormeaux, Soul Of The Matter got home 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, the redhead from Massachusetts who lives in Beverly Hills, became 
the first Southern California-based rider to win the Derby since Patrick 
Valenzuela on Sunday Silence in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he didn't take up horseback riding until the advanced age of 17, 
McCarron, 39, replied that he was too busy finishing high school. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an articulate spokesman for the sport that he loves so much and tries to 
pay back. 
</P>
<P>
 While being interviewed after the Derby, he made sure to plug a benefit 
hoedown and barbecue for the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund June 16 in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, his wife, Judy, and comedian Tim Conway established the fund for 
disabled riders seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy hadn't planned on making the trip to Louisville this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got home Sunday from the workout back here and was feeling so good 
about Go For Gin's chances, I told her that she had to come," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her because she was my good-luck charm. That was a little joke. It 
seems that I hadn't been doing too well in big races when she was at the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I won the San Juan Capistrano with Bien Bien when she was there, and I 
told her that the jinx was over." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure seemed like it during the eighth at Churchill Saturday.

AS TENSION GROWS, U.S. GETS A RESPITE, 4-0; SOCCER: WITH PLAYER CUTS LOOMING, 
TEAM HAS AN EASY TIME DEFEATING ESTONIA AT FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the stress is starting to get to U.S. soccer Coach Bora Milutinovic. As 
his players await the impending World Cup roster cuts and perform on the field 
with a certain tense desperation, Milutinovic carries the roster around in his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 After the U.S. team scored a 4-0 victory over outmatched Estonia on Saturday 
night, Milutinovic addressed the question of player cuts in his usual oblique 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the toughest moment for myself," Milutinovic said. "We have players 
with us for three years. They make big effort. We analyze everything. We make 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 All World Cup rosters must be submitted on June 3, but some coaches choose to 
make their final cuts weeks before to avoid the sort of tension that has held 
the U.S. team in its grip. Three players have been released from the player 
pool so far, but a torrent of cuts are expected, perhaps as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are fighting for jobs on the 22-man roster with inevitable results: 
The last two U.S. games have featured pressing play in the front and tentative 
play on defense. Saturday night's game, in front of 2,158 at Cal State 
Fullerton, provided the American players a chance to relax as Estonia provided 
little resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The four U.S. goals were the most the team had scored in 15 matches and after 
the game players were talking about "confidence building," but the subtext to 
any discussion these days is always the roster: Mike Lapper was red-carded 
after an altercation with an Estonian player and was asked how it might affect 
his chance to make the team. Each of the goal scorers was asked if his chances 
had improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions can all be answered by Milutinovic, who has known for weeks the 
players he wants on the team. Milutinovic -- who has the unique ability to be 
gregarious and uncommunicative at the same time -- is increasingly the center 
of media attention, which he both loves and loathes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players on the team have been training together for more than a 
year, making the breakup all the more emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tough decision," Milutinovic said. "I am human, also." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, U.S. players were trying to make Milutinovic's decision tougher 
and used Saturday night's game as a showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to put together things we have tried in practice," Desmond 
Armstrong said. "The real test will come against a better opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Klopas scored in the 36th minute on a straight-on shot from 15 yards. 
Claudio Reyna scored the only other goal in the first half, on a direct kick 
from 25 yards out. His shot hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced in. 
</P>
<P>
 The third scoring play was initiated by Reyna, who tapped a free kick to Hugo 
Perez, who crossed the ball to Marcelo Balboa, whose booming shot from the top 
of the box got past goalkeeper Mart Poom. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe-Max Moore scored in the 87th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team lost a player when Lapper and Igor Prins were ejected in the 71st 
minute.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TWO RALLIES GIVE MARLINS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins refused to go away, rallying twice and finally getting 
pinch-hitter Rich Renteria's single that drove home Alex Arias with one out in 
the 11th inning Saturday night to beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 8-7, at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Marlins' fifth consecutive victory. Philadelphia has lost eight in 
a row on the road, its longest such streak in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie Lewis (1-1), who worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the 10th inning, 
pitched two hitless innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It came when Bret Barberie singled to open the 11th off David West (0-4). 
Arias followed with a bloop single and Chuck Carr bunted into a forceout. 
Renteria followed with a single to left that barely eluded a diving Milt 
Thompson, glancing off his glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Daulton homered and drove in four runs for the Phillies. Daulton's 
seventh homer of the season, a two-run shot in the fifth inning, gave the 
Phillies a 7-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins, who had rallied from a 5-0 deficit to tie the score, scored a run 
in the fifth inning on Arias' sacrifice fly and added one on Charles Johnson's 
sacrifice fly in the sixth to tie it again, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never gave up," said Marlin Manager Rene Lachemann. "We battled like this 
was the World Series. We are playing as well as we are capable right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 11, Houston 7 -- Hal Morris broke an 0-for-16 slump with four hits 
and John Smiley made up for poor pitching by going three for three and scoring 
twice as the Reds won at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati went ahead to stay, 7-5, with a three-run fourth inning. Smiley 
started it with the first of his two doubles, and Morris drove in the go-ahead 
run with the second of his three doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley (4-2) gave up six runs, seven hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 2, Montreal 1 -- Mark Lemke was 0 for 13 against Jeff Fassaro until 
hitting a game-winning home run in the ninth inning for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemke's two-out, two-run homer at Atlanta gave Tom Glavine (3-3) the victory 
after he had extended Atlanta's shutout string to 29 innings before giving up a 
ninth-inning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassero (2-2) had struck out 11 and was one out away from his first shutout 
when he issued his first walk, to David Justice. Lemke then hit his second 
pitch over the left-field fence for Atlanta's third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 1, St. Louis 0 -- Bobby Jones scattered eight hits for his first 
shutout as the Mets won at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (4-2) struck out five in his first complete game in the major leagues in 
16 starts. He ended the game by retiring pinch-hitter Brian Jordan on a 
grounder with runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 2, Colorado 1 -- Dave Staton homered in the ninth inning to tie the 
score and in the same inning Phil Clark doubled home Ricky Gutierrez, who slid 
round catcher Danny Sheaffer's tag to win it for the Padres at San Diego.

 Boston's clubhouse was quiet, and the players seemed stunned. Games such as 
this are the ones that are remembered when a team falls just short in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Velarde's sacrifice fly in the ninth inning gave the Yankees a 6-5 
victory Saturday at New York after the Red Sox had rallied to take a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That came in the eighth inning on Mo Vaughn's two-run, 457-foot homer into the 
upper deck against Paul Gibson. Reliever Jeff Russell, sidelined since April 28 
because of back spasms, came on to close the game out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Yankees reopened it. A walk to Luis Polonia, singles by Wade 
Boggs and Don Mattingly and Velarde's sacrifice fly gave New York the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you're going to get beat whether you're on or off," said Russell 
(0-2), who blew a save for the third time in 11 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston lost its second in a row to the Yankees after arriving in New York with 
a seven-game winning streak and the best record in the major leagues. The Red 
Sox haven't lost three in a row this season. The Yankees are 8-1 at home this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's problems began when he walked Polonia, who then stole second. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs singled Polonia to third and Mattingly's single tied the score. Danny 
Tartabull's fly to right advanced pinch-runner Gerald Williams to third and 
Paul O'Neill was intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Velarde then flied to short left, with Williams easily beating Lee Tinsley's 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Kansas City 2 -- Jack McDowell won for the first time in nearly a 
month, giving up seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, and Frank Thomas hit his 10th 
homer at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell (2-4), the Cy Young Award winner last season, had lost three 
consecutive decisions and not made it past the fifth inning in his two previous 
starts. He won for the first time since April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Seattle 4 -- Chris Gomez hit the first two homers of his career 
and the Tigers won at Detroit in a game shortened to six innings because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who had not homered in 158 at-bats, homered to left-center field in the 
third inning, then went to right field in the sixth. He also singled in the 
fourth inning and drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Pat Borders jarred the ball loose from catcher Dave 
Nilsson to score the tying run with two out in the ninth inning, and Paul 
Molitor followed with an RBI single for the winning run at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays trailed, 3-2, when Borders singled and moved to second on a 
groundout. Devon White, the potential winning run, was intentionally walked and 
Domingo Cedeno singled to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Ward's throw home beat Borders, but he knocked the ball from Nilsson's 
glove. Molitor's single off third baseman Kevin Seitzer's glove brought home 
the winning run and ended the Blue Jays' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 9, Texas 7 -- Shane Mack homered and drove in two runs, and David 
McCarty had three hits to lead the Twins at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Mahomes (2-1) had his best outing of the season, giving up two runs and 
five hits in six innings, and the Twins got eight hits -- six for extra bases 
-- against Kenny Rogers (2-4) in 6 1/3 innings.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SOLIS STAYS HOME, WINS FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any other jockey in the world, Alex Solis would rather have been sitting 
where Chris McCarron was Saturday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hollywood Park wasn't a bad place for Solis to be on the first 
Saturday of May. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in his career, Solis, 30, won five races, including an 
easy victory aboard favored Fumo Di Londra in the $105,625 Spotlight Breeders' 
Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintuple gave Solis eight winners in the last two days and, nine days 
into the 68-day season, he is Hollywood Park's leading rider with 18 from 63 
mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased for a reported $750,000 by Sid and Jenny Craig to be their Kentucky 
Derby horse, Fumo Di Londra failed miserably in the San Rafael Stakes in his 
first try on the main track. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Indian Ridge colt was beaten by 31 lengths by Tabasco Cat, trainer 
Ron McAnally, who had three winners Saturday, decided to put him back on the 
turf, which is where he will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent to the front by Solis from his inside post, Fumo Di Londra, the 2-1 
choice, set moderate fractions before pulling away from his seven rivals 
through the stretch and winning by three lengths in 1:35 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfinished Symph, making his first start on turf and on Lasix, outfinished 5-2 
second choice Timbalier by a half-length for second. Screaming Don, the upset 
winner of the California Derby last month, was a nose back in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke so well and I had the advantage of the rail, so I just said, 'Shoot, 
I'm going to save some ground and try to make my own pace,' " said Solis, whose 
other five-winner day came on July 24, 1989, at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just able to gallop out there and when I asked him at the 
three-sixteenths pole, he responded very well. I thought I had a good chance 
(to have a big day) because I had a lot of good mounts and things worked out 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis was aboard all three of McAnally's winners. He rode Sinag in the first 
and Potridee in the $61,200 Typecast. The jockey's other two victories were 
aboard La Frontera in the fourth and Buyimback in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park handled a single-race record $3,570,779 on the Kentucky Derby 
Saturday, breaking the mark of $2,986,676 for last year's Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $1,113,722 was bet at the track and $2,457,057 was handled at the 
numerous off-track locations. All told, $5,683,261 was bet on the Derby and the 
five other stakes that were simulcast from Churchill Downs. The total 
attendance was 66,625, with 22,779 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin paid $23.60 at Hollywood Park compared to $20.20 in Kentucky. The 
$2 exacta combining him with Strodes Creek paid $186.60 locally and $184.80 at 
Churchill Downs. The $2 trifecta paid $2,885.40 compared to $2,351.40 at 
Churchill. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Skimble, often close but a winner of only once in her last 11 starts, is the 
2-1 favorite in the $107,800 Wilshire Handicap today at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Third behind Corrazona and Cargo in the Santa Anita Budweiser Breeders' Cup 
Handicap last month, Skimble is one of two entrants in the race trained by 
Bobby Frankel. He will also send out 4-1 shot Lyphard's Delta, who will race on 
Lasix for the first time after finishing fifth in the Budweiser Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Bel's Starlet, a 7-year-old Bel Bolide mare, is the 5-2 second choice and she 
has shown a fondness for the Hollywood Park grass. She has four victories, 
three seconds and a third in 12 local tries. Kent Desormeaux will again ride 
for trainer Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other starters in the 1 1/16-mile Wilshire are Miami Sands, Dior's 
Angel and Blue Tess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Best Seven bet will begin on May 30 and will feature stakes from 
seven tracks, including the Hollywood Turf Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-cent bet, the National Best Seven will be run in a one-hour span, and the 
other tracks that will be featured in the kickoff to the wager are Belmont Park 
(the Metropolitan Mile), Sam Houston (Memorial Stakes), Arlington Park 
(Washington Park Handicap), Monmouth Park (Red Bank Handicap), Calder (Memorial 
Day Handicap) and Churchill Downs (Kentucky Breeders' Cup Stakes). 
</P>
<P>
 After Memorial Day, the Best Seven will be offered every Saturday as well as 
Monday, July 4.

MOTHERS & SONS; PEOPLE: PROFESSIONALS WHO FOLLOW IN THEIR PARENT'S FOOTSTEPS 
RANGE FROM A FRENCH RESTAURATEUR IN NEWPORT BEACH TO A LAGUNA BEACH REALTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Orange County, he is a provider of gracious French dining. To his mother, 
he is her "petit chou" -- little cabbage, a common term of endearment in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Therese Olhats journeyed from France to Newport Beach for the first time last 
week to witness the success of her 40-year-old son, Pascal, and his restaurant 
of the same name. There he uses the lessons of French country cooking learned 
in his mother's kitchen in Normandy. The two prepared a Norman feast together 
for restaurant diners on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But as most sons and daughters do at times, Olhats chafes at his mother's 
tendency to see him as not quite grown up. His return visits to France don't 
help: "I sit in the same seat at the table and eat the same food as I did 20 
years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For sons to follow in their mothers' footsteps is a trend still in its 
infancy. Logic -- and several experts -- suggests that such dynasties will 
become fairly common before long, because women have been starting businesses 
at twice the rate of men in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, however, mother-son teams are rather unusual, said Jon Goodman, 
director of USC's entrepreneur program, "because we're in the first generation 
where women in significant numbers are managing businesses. But I think we will 
see more of them in time."  
</P>
<P>
 Goodman has the numbers on her side. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Women now own slightly more than a third of the businesses in the United 
States, according to the National Assn. of Women Business Owners. The group 
also found that an estimated 6.5 million women-owned companies together employ 
more people than all of the Fortune 500 combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Among more than 600 family-owned companies surveyed last year by the Gallup 
Organization for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., 46% reported that a 
son was actively involved in the business. The survey did not differentiate 
between a father and mother as the business owner. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tremendous rewards to be had from mother and son sharing a vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of Pascal and his wife," Therese Olhats said in French, as 
tears came to her eyes. "They have a lot of ambition and have worked very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's thanks to her education," her son replied, becoming choked up himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen is a time-honored realm where sons can follow in their mothers' 
footsteps. In other professions, the mother-son combination is rare, but it is 
becoming less so, experts say, as women move en masse into the roles of 
professional and entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, famous exceptions. Mary Martin, who played Peter Pan on 
Broadway, and her actor son, Larry Hagman, the J.R. Ewing of "Dallas" fame. 
Cosmetics whiz Mary Kay Ash and her son, Richard R. Rogers, who now runs the 
company. Helen and David Copley of Copley Newspapers, which publishes, among 
others, the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Zee Allred and son Dean run a national swimming pool supplies 
business, Pool Water Products in Irvine, which employs 350 people. And Turner 
Associates Realtors in Laguna Beach embraces the talents of three generations 
-- from its founder to her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The combination can be a powerful one, said Jacqueline Freiberg, director of 
the University of San Diego Family Business Institute. It captures the 
strengths of both genders to compete fiercely yet form close, lasting 
relationships with customers and suppliers. And it avoids the rivalries that 
can arise in mother-daughter, father-son or husband-wife business teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moms who run businesses are probably self-sufficient, secure and 
independent," Freiberg said. "It's a sweet opportunity to work with someone you 
not only love, but respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Turner Arnold founded Turner Associates in 1964. She has a strong 
handshake, a direct gaze and a bright red blazer. It is difficult to describe 
her without using the word "zip." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said it was unusual for a woman to open her own real estate business in 
the mid-1960s. But she has been well-accepted in the role, she said, with one 
memorable exception: a fellow realtor who was showing a client one of Arnold's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought he knew everything, and I knew nothing," she said. "But I made the 
sale, so it didn't really matter, did it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's daughter, Nancy Turner Casebier, joined the company in 1975 when her 
youngest child was 4 years old. Nancy's oldest child, Kevin Casebier, joined 
the company right after college in January, 1990. He had planned to help with 
the firm's summer rental business, but he is now making a career in real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The three share the commissions of their individual sales; another 30 agents 
work from the Turner office, which specializes in luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Casebier said he brings a valuable male perspective to the business. 
From time to time, a buyer who appears quite wealthy and serious will take a 
real estate agent through all the steps of purchasing a home, then vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Casebier spotted one of these phony buyers. "I saw through him, that 
we were wasting our time," he said. "I think I spotted him faster than my 
mother or grandmother would have." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Casebier said she prefers the generational ties to working with a 
spouse. "This way, it's not directly competitive at home," she said. "My mother 
wants me to excel, and I want Kevin to excel." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Arnold added, two people in the same house with a realtor's 
seven-day-a-week schedule could be maddening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zee Allred can attest to the hurried pace that comes with a husband-and-wife 
business. She began her company with her husband, and their two sons spent many 
afternoons, summer vacations and spring breaks from college helping out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beginning when they were about 6 or 7 years old, I would pick them up from 
school and take them to the office with me," she said. "So, they grew up with a 
working mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Her younger son, Dean, 42, is now president of the national pool distribution 
company, and Allred is chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her older son left the business 10 years ago to start his own in Houston, 
doing the same thing. During the past three years, as Allred's company expanded 
to become a nationwide business, the two actually became competitors. She 
bought him out in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the competitive relationship existed, Allred sees it through a mother's 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wanted to experience his own time of being in business for 
himself," she said. "I thought that was a great idea." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Meta Strandberg is another mother who sees her son as "wonderful." Strandberg, 
70, lives and gardens in the Swedish countryside, throwing herself into the 
hobby that is her passion from mid-April to the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 Strandberg is a pioneer of organic gardening, having published a classic 
how-to manual in 1974 that has been translated from Swedish into five other 
languages. Roughly translated, its title is "Farming Without Poisons." She has 
written nine other books on food, including a vegetable cookbook that is 
available in Dutch, German and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son is Ulf Anders Strandberg, head chef of Gustaf Anders, the popular 
Swedish restaurant at South Coast Plaza Village in Santa Ana. The eatery's name 
comes from Strandberg's middle name and that of his partner, Bill Gustaf 
Magnuson. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant makes seven or eight kinds of bread daily, from coarse, 
unrefined grains, Strandberg said. "That is the big connection between my 
mother's ideas and my own," he said. "The importance of good bread." 
</P>
<P>
 As a small boy, Strandberg was interested in colors, materials and design, his 
mother said. He showed a love of artistry that she believes expressed itself 
ultimately in his cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I inspired him, just by being interested in food myself," she said. 
"But I never chose (a career) for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The passion for food runs in the family. Both of Strandberg's sisters are 
excellent cooks, their mother said, although they do not cook professionally.  
</P>
<P>
 Strandberg went to culinary school, but then he actually followed his father's 
career for about 10 years, working for a computer firm until he was in his 
early 30s. He ran into one of Stockholm's premier restaurateurs, Carl Butler, 
and began helping him in the restaurant from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience recalled his early love of elaborate family feasts. "In Sweden, 
there is not much else to do on the dark, cold winter nights but eat," he said, 
joking. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a partner opened a restaurant in Pacific Beach in San Diego, then moved 
to La Jolla. Henry Segerstrom, also of Swedish descent, invited the pair to 
move their operation to South Coast Plaza Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pity" that they live so far apart, Meta Strandberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therese Olhats said she feels the same way. In the early days, she used to say 
to him, "Have a restaurant, but save a small corner for me to cook in," her son 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream came true last week for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the country-patterned fabrics and bouquets of pink, peach and white 
roses, Therese and Pascal Olhats cooked apple pieces in Calvados, a sweet, 
strong apple liqueur made in the Normandy region. 
</P>
<P>
 Therese Olhats said that her son followed her around in the kitchen when he 
was a boy, tasting and learning. Pascal Olhats said he hopes that one of his 
three daughters will one day enter the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't force them, though," he said. "It must come from the inside, this joy 
in eating. Not everyone has it. It's a passion."

SMALL AD AGENCIES REAP TWO OF THREE TOP AWARDS; ADVERTISING: ONE-MAN ACME SHOP, 
TWO SMART GUY'S ARE HONORED. DGWB, A LARGE FIRM, IS CITED FOR BEST POSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In step with a national trend, small agencies walked away with two of three 
top honors during Saturday night's 36th annual Orange County AdClub awards 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 One of three "Best of Show" awards went to Acme Advertising, a one-man 
operation run by Sakol Mongkolkasetarin of Fountain Valley. He won in the print 
advertising category for his work for Pacific Snax Corp., which makes rice 
snacks shaped like popcorn.  
</P>
<P>
 The top honor in broadcast advertising was awarded to Smart Guy's Advertising 
Co. in Huntington Beach, a two-person agency. Tim O'Donnell and Pat Zimmerman, 
the owners, won for ads they created for Hovik Jewelry in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The top award for poster advertising went to dGWB in Irvine, one of Orange 
County's largest independent agencies, for its work for Vans canvas shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mongkolkasetarin, 27, the award caps a solo career that was forced on him 
after he had been laid off by two now-defunct agencies. He started Acme in his 
parents' living room, and in March, he won four Belding Bowls -- the West's 
most prestigious contest. dGWB hired him the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 His success is part of a string of recent victories by smaller agencies that 
has bigger agencies talking about how to return to their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the county's larger agencies, who meet frequently to discuss 
industry matters, talked privately Wednesday about the growing dominance of 
small agencies in awards ceremonies. Contests, to a great extent, measure the 
industry's most prized attribute -- creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives feared, in part, that big agencies and their clients have lost 
their nerve. "In this economy, no one is taking chances," said Greg Smith, a 
consultant who attended Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakup and downsizing of so many large companies during the recession has 
put many talented people on the street to fend for themselves. And technology 
has helped them do with computers in short fashion what artists and expensive 
typesetting equipment used to do.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County AdClub contest, the "Best of Show" awards are chosen from 
among gold medal award winners. In all, 26 gold medals were awarded, along with 
56 silver medals and 118 merit awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of entries declined from 951 last year to 653, but the number of 
awards rose from 152 to 200. About 500 people attended the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the highest number of awards was dGWB, with eight gold medals and 40 
silver and merit awards. Lawrence & Mayo in Newport Beach won 27 awards, 
including three gold. Acme Advertising won five gold and eight other awards, 
and Smart Guy's won eight awards, including two gold. 
</P>

Belding, six awards, two gold; Look Ma, No Budget, six awards; Lenac, Warford,

 Gee! I wish Mayor Richard Riordan would take my calls. I wouldn't mind if he 
had two secretaries listen to our conversation.

 * I was planning on calling the mayor some time soon, but in view of the fact 
that his secretary monitors his conversations sans knowledge of the caller, I 
don't think I will, after all. That's as bad as a secretary "accidentally" 
erasing 18 1/2 minutes of your tapes.

<P>
 * It was with great joy that I read of former Mayor Tom Bradley questioning 
the legality of Mayor Riordan's secretary listening in on his phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the same Tom Bradley that used to take "consulting" fees from banks 
and had to have an ethics bill passed by the City Council in order to know what 
behavior was ethical? 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you, Mr. Bradley.

<P>
 * What more can we voters expect from our mayor! He is obviously not afraid of 
any "-gates" and is willing to put a witness to all his conversations. Isn't 
his system more an indication of efficiency, openness and candor than of 
deviousness? Hasn't the public already expressed sufficient indignation at 
secret, behind-doors, official dealings? After all, these are calls to the No. 
1 city servant, in his city office, on "aboveboard" official business . . . 
aren't they?

 * I found Ron Harris' column particularly insightful ("The Riots Helped No One 
-- Except the Well-Placed Few," April 29).The headline would suggest that those 
who rioted, such as then-20-year-old Damien, haven't prospered much since April 
29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, Damien joined in a raging campaign in which he and a friend burned 
down a liquor store. Harris visited Damien recently and learned that Damien 
wasn't doing much better than when he participated in those riots two years 
ago.

 Guess rioting wasn't a good career move.

AMERICA'S ANXIETY ATTACK; THE COLD WAR IS OVER, THE FAMILY IS COLLAPSING, THE 
ECONOMY IS GOING GLOBAL AND THE MELTING POT IS BOILING--WHEN EVERYTHING'S IN 
FLUX, WHAT'S A NATION TO DO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein, Ronald Brownstein is a national political correspondent 
for The Times. His last story for the magazine was on the New York mayoral 
race. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton feels it every day as he sifts through the intelligence 
cables and economic reports that struggle to make sense of insistent change at 
home and abroad -- and typically leave him with as many questions as answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I feel in my job the way a lot of average people do in their lives," 
he says, leaning against a high-backed chair in the Oval Office. "They feel on 
the one hand these changes are exciting and may augur the beginning of the most 
interesting time in human history. On the other hand, they can be very 
threatening, both in general terms and personal terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Bennis, an adviser to some of the nation's largest companies, feels it 
in the anxiety of executives who gather expectantly at management conferences, 
like pilgrims at a shrine, to tug at his sleeve. "Why are they all there?" asks 
Bennis, a USC management professor and a prolific author. "They think someone 
knows what the hell is going on. They are spending $3,000 and looking for the 
new world order, and there is no new world order." Frank Luntz, a pollster for 
Republican political candidates, feels it whenever he gathers average Americans 
into focus groups to talk about their lives. "They're scared," he says. "They 
don't like it because they can't predict the future. People feel they don't 
have control over their own lives -- that they can no longer shape their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 In America, this is an age of uncertainty. In its economy, foreign policy and 
social structure, the United States is between worlds -- in a limbo where old 
rules no longer apply and new ones have not yet been written. The future is 
arriving before we are ready to bury the past, and the result is hesitancy, 
indecisiveness and inconsistency, as policy-makers, institutions and individual 
Americans struggle to understand the new realities. "We are groping in the dark 
for the new structures," says Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, "and the old 
keeps falling apart." It is as if we have closed one door but not yet opened 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Four trends, each of which has been gathering force for years, are converging 
to unsettle these times. One is the restructuring of the economy under the 
combined pressure of advancing technology and integrating global markets -- a 
vise that is forcing companies to re-examine their most basic operations and 
has undermined the upward mobility that Americans have long considered a 
birthright. Next is the global migration of workers from poorer to richer 
countries, which, in the United States, is bringing more than a million 
immigrants, legal and illegal, across the border every year, complicating 
already difficult questions about the racial and ethnic distribution of power. 
The third is the erosion of the traditional family, a trend that has seen the 
share of single-parent families more than triple in the past 30 years. And 
finally, the end of the Cold War has obliterated the foundations of our foreign 
policy and thrown open elemental questions of how America relates to the rest 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, any of these factors would be wrenching. Together they are 
inducing the widespread sense of vertigo that marks this, the Entropy Decade. 
"People feel like there is nothing they can depend on, there is nothing 
certain," says Stanley B. Greenberg, Clinton's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 These trends intertwine and reinforce each other. The Cold War's end has meant 
a shrinking of the defense industries, intensifying the pressure on the 
economy. Workers facing declining living standards have resisted immigration. 
The technological advances that have diminished the demand for low-skill labor 
have combined with the enormous rise in the number of children born to unwed 
mothers to drastically worsen conditions in poor urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 To a substantial extent, these trends set the political agenda -- pushing us 
to seek new rules for U.S. foreign policy, new policies to revive the growth in 
living standards and new welfare reforms to deter out-of-wedlock births. They 
shape the political climate, feeding partisan turbulence and the edgy 
alienation audible in the angry cacophony of talk radio. They determine the 
most influential voices of our time: An age of uncertainty lavishly rewards 
those who can convincingly draw a map of the future, people like Robert Reich 
or Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and would-be tollkeeper for the 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Even President Clinton increasingly seems to perceive his task as representing 
the future to the present -- easing insecurity not only through concrete policy 
steps but by persuading Americans that he has a vision for the future and a 
course to arrive there. And yet, he, too, sometimes feels almost overwhelmed by 
the rapidity of change -- and frustrated at government's limited capacity to 
recognize and respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing politicians and the country isn't unique to this nation 
or this time. Across the industrialized world, the absence of clear direction 
is seeding enormous frustration with political leaders. Over the past year, 
political shifts have come more suddenly and powerfully than anyone could have 
imagined in Italy, Japan and Canada (where the ruling Progressive Conservative 
Party was obliterated in a single election, falling from 153 seats in the House 
of Commons to just two.) In Russia, the power of anxiety to destabilize the 
political order is being perhaps most vividly displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Change is constant in American life. But now, as at other points in our 
history, it has become a more pressing, tangible, accelerated social 
phenomenon. There is a widespread understanding that existing institutions and 
arrangements are inadequate. At similar moments in the past -- the 1820s, the 
1890s, after World War I and World War II -- the nation has struggled with the 
same underlying question: Do we adapt to the changes or resist them? The answer 
has never come without turbulence, and these times are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER CENTURY AFTER WORLD WAR II, Americans enjoyed a period 
of almost uninterrupted economic stability. Industries jump-started by the war 
-- chemicals and electronics, appliances and airlines -- created millions of 
new jobs. American manufacturers, reading the commandments of mass production 
laid down by General Motors' Alfred Sloan, became the assembly line for the 
world. So many Americans filed into the office towers of giant corporations 
that sociologists wrote of "The Organization Man." Above all, living standards 
for the mass of the American public rose dependably year after year: From 1947 
to 1973, the median family income doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, it is clear that 1973 marked the pivot from the era of secure 
prosperity to a new era of economic anxiety. Over the past 20 years, the median 
family income has been virtually stagnant. At the current rate of growth, it 
will not double again for centuries, the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers recently calculated. One recent study found that among workers in 
their prime earning years -- between 22and 58 -- one-third experienced income 
declines in the 1980s, compared to about one-fifth in the 1970s. Hardest hit 
have been young workers and those without college degrees -- a pattern that has 
seen the gaps in the distribution of income steadily widen. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, economic anxiety has spread in ever-widening circles. 
In the 1980s, the image that conveyed economic insecurity was a middle-aged 
auto- or steelworker in the Midwest whose factory had failed in the face of 
foreign competition.  
</P>
<P>
 But now more white-collar Americans are caught in the same squeeze. Even 
software designers are competing with skilled workers in Eastern Europe or 
India who will write programs for a fraction of American wages. White-collar 
workers now find themselves imperiled as computer and communications advances 
render obsolete the layers of bureaucracy fattened during the years of 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the 1980s, two-thirds of Americans who permanently lost 
their jobs were blue-collar workers and just one-third white collar; by 1990, 
47% were white-collar workers. "People are trying to find their moorings," says 
John Challenger, executive vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., 
a Chicago-based firm that works with restructuring companies. "If you can't 
anchor yourself in a large company for a long time, where do you find your 
anchor?" 
</P>
<P>
 This erosion of security is a prime force behind the political discontent 
evident in Ross Perot's strong 1992 showing. But even more striking is the 
spread of insecurity to those issuing the pink slips. After watching giants 
like IBM stumble, even many of those at the pinnacles of American business are 
doubting the lessons they absorbed on their long climb. 
</P>
<P>
 In public, senior managers now boldly talk, like so many corporate Che 
Guevaras, about fomenting revolution and inspiring radical change. In private, 
they often acknowledge that they have more questions than answers. Does the 
traditional hierarchical structure of American business still make sense when 
desktop and laptop computers decentralize the bureaucrats' control of 
information? How can companies compete when even bitter rivals must cooperate 
to stay on the cutting edge of all the technologies they must master? 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise that the market for business advice is ballooning. "So 
desperate has the beleaguered corporate world become for functional leadership 
that training in the subject has exploded into an industry," reports Fortune 
magazine. Screaming from the covers of business magazines and best-selling 
books are the new buzzwords: re-engineering the corporation, the horizontal 
corporation, the virtual corporation, liberation management, total quality 
management -- all intended to give insecure managers a new compass for 
navigating disorder. "There is more idea turbulence in business today than at 
any point in the past 70 years," says William Taylor, a founding editor of the 
new business magazine Fast Company. 
</P>
<P>
 All this carries with it elements of creative destruction. The retooling and 
restructuring forced on American manufacturers by foreign competition have 
revived the growth in productivity; over time, that should help wages begin 
rising again. New industries -- software, biotechnology, fiber optics -- 
replace the old jobs. Even the efficiencies painfully wrung out through 
corporate downsizing should ripple through the economy "releasing resources 
that can be used to produce other things," says Richard McKenzie, a UC Irvine 
professor of management in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from certain that these transformations will revive the growth of 
living standards, but in a world where technology enables China or Mexico to 
develop low-wage, high-quality manufacturing, there's less chance of succeeding 
by trying to recapture the days of Alfred Sloan. Moving forward may be the only 
choice we have, but the ride is not going to be smooth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think the '80s was a white-knuckle decade for business," says 
Bennis of USC. "The '90s is going to be make the '80s look like a slow dance." 
</P>
<P>
 INTENSIFYING THE ANXIETY LEFT BY ECONOMIC change is the turmoil of demographic 
change. Between a massive wave of immigration and a steady rise in the number 
of children living in single-parent families, our social fabric is being 
reconfigured as rapidly as at any point in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 In net terms -- when emigration from the country is subtracted -- the number 
of new arrivals in the 1980s was greater than in any decade in our history. At 
current trends, by decade's end the share of the population that was born 
abroad will climb above 10% for the first time since 1930; by the middle of the 
next century, according to one recent projection, the foreign-born share of the 
population will reach the heights of the late 19th Century: almost 15%.  
</P>
<P>
 The influx has shattered a period of extraordinary demographic calm. Though 
America thinks of itself as a nation of immigrants, for four decades in the 
heart of this century, it accepted relatively few. After the great wave of 
European immigration that washed into America through Ellis Island, Congress 
virtually sealed off immigration, and from 1930 to 1970 the foreign-born share 
of the population dropped. As the sons and daughters of the European immigrants 
moved from the Lower East Side to the suburbs and learned English without an 
accent, the issue of how to assimilate newcomers virtually disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress revised the immigration laws in 1965, opening the gates for a second 
wave of migrants, predominantly from Latin America and Asia. In this new surge, 
uneasiness about racial change is compounding the inevitable tension of 
absorbing new ethnic groups. Given the current trends, Jeffrey Passel of the 
Urban Institute and a colleague recently calculated that by 2030, whites will 
constitute about 60% of the population (down from 75% today), with Latinos 
rising to more than 16%, Asians to more than 8% (compared with 9% and 3% now) 
and blacks holding steady at about 12%. In California and several of the other 
large states where immigrants concentrate, nonwhites will constitute an even 
larger share of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 This transformation is generating concerns about jobs, education, opportunity 
and culture, leaving everyone feeling unsteady, aggrieved. Blacks, Latinos and 
other minorities are frustrated that they remain on the fringes of power. Women 
and gays are pushing for their share of influence. Among white males, there is 
a deepening perception that their dominance is passing, if not past. Thus, 
close behind the publication of a book that heralds the rage of middle-class 
blacks, comes this cover of Business Week: "White, Male & Worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this concern about immigration and racial change is rooted in the fear 
of contracting economic opportunity. But here is a broader fear: that the 
nation won't be able to integrate this generation of immigrants as it did their 
predecessors.  
</P>
<P>
 The "politics of difference" infusing modern American life makes assimilation 
a trickier even the playing field for black Americans, have triggered a 
panorama of racial and ethnic competitions in business, education and politics. 
What was once was a tug of war now looks more like rugby. In many ways, public 
policy now encourages Americans to emphasize their differences, not their 
common bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet evidence is quietly accumulating that the integrative pull of American 
life remains as powerful as ever. Barry Edmonston of the National Academy of 
Sciences has calculated that about one in five Asian and Latino immigrants to 
the United States marry outside their racial group; for the first generation of 
children born in the United States, the figure rises to 1 in 4 Asians and 1 in 
3 Latinos; by the second generation, half of all Latinos and Asians in the 
United States marry outside their group. Studies show that the children of 
immigrants remain overwhelmingly committed to mastering English, the passport 
to American success. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this evidence, and the experience of history, testifies to the 
continued power of integration to renew and replenish national life. But the 
political impulses toward separatism are strong, and even stronger is the 
inherently polarizing force of massive new immigration, which endlessly adds 
new sources of tension even as the older arrivals move further into the 
economic mainstream. In the push-pull of immigration, "the forces pushing 
toward integration are very strong," says Passel, the Urban Institute scholar. 
But "they show up mainly in the second generation. The competing force is more 
immigration, which keeps adding more people to this mix." 
</P>
<P>
 EVEN AS THE COUNTRY STRUGGLES WITH THIS CHALLENGE FROM THE outside in, it 
faces an equally unsettling test from the inside out: the revolution in family 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1960 through 1991, the percentage of children living with one parent, 
almost always a mother, rose from 9.1% to 28.6%. In recent years, the divorce 
rate has slightly declined, but the growth in out-of-wedlock births continues 
to rise: from 5.3% in 1960 to 29.5% in 1991. For African Americans, such births 
now constitute two-thirds of the total. By the end of the century, sociologists 
have estimated, four of every 10 American children are likely to be born to a 
mother who is not married. 
</P>
<P>
 Many single parents provide loving, secure homes, but research shows that 
children growing up with only one parent are far more likely to be poor and to 
have emotional problems, drop out of school and encounter trouble with the law. 
"What is on people's minds as social problems today: 14-year-old girls with 
babies and 14-year-old boys with guns," says David Blankenhorn, president of 
the Institute for American Values, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. 
"What's the most important predictor of out-of-wedlock birth among young girls? 
Father absence. What's the most important predictor of criminal activity among 
young males? Father absence. It's not the only predictor, but it is the most 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists can come to blows over whether the negative effects of family 
breakdown are rooted primarily in the moral or economic void left by a father's 
absence. Likewise, some analysts believe that one reason for the rise in 
illegitimate births is the decline in wages for men with little education, 
which makes them both less attractive as husbands and less likely to form a 
stable family. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these debates illuminate the complex interactions of the trends 
driving American life in the 1990s. Economic polarization and family breakdown 
reinforce each other: Children who grow up in poverty, without fathers, are 
more likely to become unmarried parents themselves, transmitting poverty and 
fatherlessness across generations in a cycle of despair and dysfunction. To 
some scholars, that pattern suggests we are creating a new Berlin Wall that 
keeps children born out of wedlock (and, to a lesser extent, those dislocated 
by divorce) from the opportunities afforded those reared in traditional 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of uneasiness over immigration and the family breakdown is the 
fear that society is Balkanizing into antagonistic ethnic and economic 
enclaves. That fate is not inevitable. In fact, many see in America's diversity 
the chance to weave together a global nation -- well-suited to speak and sell 
to the rest of the world because it embodies it in miniature. But to get there 
we will have to find new ways of expanding opportunity and instilling belief in 
a set of commonly accepted social values. 
</P>
<P>
 The old America, where a white majority held all meaningful power, is gone, 
but the shape of the new America has not yet hardened. If we can find new ways 
to expand the boundaries of inclusion while maintaining common standards and 
responsibilities, we may build the world's first truly multiracial democracy. 
If not, we may construct our own Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 SINCE WORLD WAR II, IN THE MIDST OF UPHEAVALS IN DOMESTIC LIFE and politics, 
America has had one area of certainty: its role in the world. But with the fall 
of the Soviet Union that pillar, too, has crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1947 through the fall of the Berlin Wall, there were, of course, vast 
disagreements over individual decisions, with the Vietnam War rending the 
country. But the questions of whether and why the United States should be 
engaged abroad were essentially settled by a single phrase: containing the 
spread of Soviet power. Containment did not answer all questions about 
America's interaction with the world, but as crises arose, "there was a policy 
superstructure into which many problems could be placed into the right box," 
says one senior State Department official.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War's end has left the United States in the enviable but confusing 
position of defining its world interest at a time when there is no single 
immediate threat to our national security. Without a Soviet threat, neither 
George Bush nor Bill Clinton has produced a foreign policy that replaces 
containment as a rationale for American interaction with the world. Bush 
floated the idea of the "New World Order" but was unable to fill the balloon 
with enough content to keep it aloft. Last fall, Anthony Lake, Clinton's 
national security adviser, offered "enlargement" as the centerpiece of a 
foreign policy built around the expansion of democracy and free markets. But 
while those goals clearly remain important to Clinton, Lake's attempt to 
construct around them a doctrine "came and went without leaving any mark," says 
another Administration foreign policy planner. "Enlargement had the property of 
an abstraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Many inside the Administration consider the whole quest for a unifying 
principle of foreign policy a delusion -- a search for the Holy Grail. It is 
virtually a mantra in the Administration's upper reaches that the dilemmas of 
the 1990s can't be reduced to a single idea. "It is going to be a less ordered 
world because you don't have the discipline of the Cold War, frankly," says the 
senior State Department official. "And you are going to have tensions between 
priorities because none are dominant. You're not going to find a phrase or a 
word where people are going to say, 'that explains the world to me, every day.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 This has undeniably left an intellectual vacuum in the foreign policy 
community. On questions of whether to use force abroad, for instance, the 
political polarities appear to be reversing: Liberals have castigated Clinton 
for not moving quickly enough to intervene in Bosnia, while conservatives who 
bitterly resisted congressional restraints on the President during the Cold War 
have sought to prevent Clinton from committing troops abroad without 
legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the Cold War's end has brought a clear shift in priorities and 
approaches. Economic interests now dominate American foreign policy. In his 
first year, Clinton's largest foreign-policy successes were economic: the 
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the long-running talks 
to rewrite the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift was almost palpable to U.S. trade negotiators before their talks 
with Japan broke down in February. "Right from the very beginning there was a 
very explicit set of ground rules that the economic dimension of the Japanese 
relationship would have to be put at least on a par with the other 'security 
relationship,' " recalls Jeffrey E. Garten, the undersecretary of commerce for 
international trade. "As it got toward the end, that translated so directly and 
so simply into the proposition that, unlike during the Cold War, we weren't 
going to paper something over in the economic area in order to smooth over 
political relations or not undercut the security relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 But that certainty is a lonely example: In most other respects, the Cold War's 
end has left us confused about international engagement. What rules govern 
intervention in conflicts that pose no immediate threat to our national 
self-interest? For more than a year, Clinton has struggled to answer that 
question in Bosnia, pushing forward, climbing back and beginning the cycle 
again. Bosnia may be the mold for the dilemmas ahead: a conflict in which the 
spur to action is more an affront to the nation's moral sense -- provoked by 
media images of brutality -- than a challenge to our material and political 
interests. Thus one basic trend -- the advance of information technology -- 
accelerates a second, the reconfiguring of America's relations with the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's what we face," says one senior Administration defense policy 
strategist. "Mr. and Mrs. CNN sitting at home, they see some god-awful thing on 
television. They say stop the killing. They say, who can do that? The U.S. 
military. We struggle with it. We go in peace to do something not quite 
military; there is no single bad guy there. The party that is most 
disadvantaged from our being there has an incentive to kill Americans. That 
puts us in a pattern of dilemmas: add more people or get out. This is the new 
pattern for our generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise the new era has confused our alliances. NATO's purpose once was 
straightforward: to deter the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. Now, 
it does not know where to point its guns. The former Soviet bloc nations want 
into NATO because they fear resurgent Russian imperialism; but in theory, at 
least, Russia is still eligible for membership. Thus the core issue facing 
NATO: Is the alliance's purpose now to defend against Russia or to enfold it 
into the West?  
</P>
<P>
 In forging its Partnership for Peace plan, which allows the Eastern European 
nations, including Russia, to be associated with NATO without establishing any 
timetable for formal entry, the Administration concluded, in essence, that this 
question could not be answered today. As Frank G. Wisner, the undersecretary of 
defense for policy, candidly remarked in recent congressional testimony, the 
Partnership for Peace amounts to "hedging our bets." 
</P>
<P>
 The new conditions ruthlessly expose contradictions in old arrangements. 
Bolstering the stability of Russia and its former satellites is one of 
Clinton's top priorities. But U.S. trade laws prevent the government from 
taking the step that might most stabilize those regimes: opening U.S. markets 
to their exports of aluminum, uranium and other raw materials and products. 
That's because our laws, designed to prevent countries from dumping products 
into the United States below their world price, compel us to impose tariffs 
against imports from nations that lack a market mechanism to price their goods 
-- like the former communist economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that without more access to Western markets," says Garten, "the 
former Soviet Union doesn't have a prayer economically. They have to be able to 
sell to us and enter our markets." But there are domestic producers to 
consider, legislators who would resist rewriting the laws: "It's not that we 
don't recognize the problem," he says. "It is another thing to be able to act 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also one thing to understand that the Cold War's end demands new 
approaches -- and quite another to push new ideas past interests fattened on 
existing modes of thought. Last year, for instance, the Pentagon undertook what 
was billed as a "bottom-up" review of U.S. military needs in a world without a 
rival superpower. Most analysts considered it a serious effort -- and yet when 
it was completed, many were struck by how little it deviated from the Bush 
Administration's assessment of future military needs.  
</P>
<P>
 Even in international economic policy, where the Administration has been far 
more sure-footed, its focus is decidedly incremental. At Congress' request, it 
has begun to consider expanding NAFTA into other countries, but it has not 
looked further down the road at free trade arrangements across the Pacific or 
at integrating the former communist states into the world economy. "Do we have 
a blueprint? No, no one does," says U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
"It's not because we shouldn't. The question is resources and focus. The people 
you want most involved in the framing of the questions and the answers are so 
involved in the day-to-day they don't even have time to really do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor insists that the pace of change is so rapid that crafting a long-term 
blueprint would be an academic exercise. Making decisions incrementally is the 
natural instinct in an Administration heavy on deal-making lawyers (like Kantor 
and Secretary of State Warren Christopher) and light on conceptualizing 
strategists. And that approach may be prudent. But does an era of uncertainty 
demand prudence, or a vision bold enough to direct events?  
</P>
<P>
 ON A WINDY, WET MORNING IN MARCH, PRESIDENT CLINTON SITS BACK IN a chair set 
before the unlit fireplace in the Oval Office and considers that question. He 
has just come from a ceremony with Vice President Al Gore marking the continued 
effort to "reinvent government" -- a process akin to pushing a string up a 
hill.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is wearing a stylish double-breasted blue suit with oversized 
shoulders, a starched white shirt and a bright polka-dot tie, but the clothes 
look crisper than he does: He seems tired and a bit subdued. The Whitewater 
controversy lingers at the door like a fog: This morning he had been peppered 
with questions about meetings between White House aides and Treasury Department 
officials regarding the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the couch across from Clinton, I am acutely aware of the pressure 
of the clock: so many minutes to cover this ground before he must move on to 
something else. Yet the clock must tick even more loudly in his ears. That 
raises an initial question: When crises of some sort erupt almost daily, when 
the President's time is rationed out in minutes, how much can government set 
long-range plans for coping with massive shifts like those now facing the 
country?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think government is very well organized for those long-term 
solutions," Clinton says. "Because I think the agencies that would tend to deal 
with that are either overwhelmingly mired in the problems of the present -- you 
know, how are we going to get this budget passed, or deal with this program, or 
what's happening in this particular state. Or they're afflicted, literally 
afflicted, with the procedures of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 He leans back. "You know, a lot of times I don't think (that in the White 
House) I get as broad a range of views as I would if I could just read 10 good 
magazines a week. So I try to read 10 good magazines a week." And, he says, in 
his second year, he will try to spend more time with "people who think about 
these big problems" -- like the historians, political scientists and 
sociologists he met at a dinner last November. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways the problem of perspective is an artifact of the Cold War. David 
Gergen, Clinton's counselor, contends that the government is far better 
organized to provide the President with details about obscure potential threats 
in other nations than immediate challenges at home. But the larger problem, 
particularly for the President, is finding the time and exerting the discipline 
to set a long-range course. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Clinton if he ever feels as though he can't entirely get his hands 
around the country's evolving form. "Sure," he says quickly. Each change, he 
says, seems to carry equal measure of promise and threat. Globalization of the 
economy, for instance, may quicken growth, but also increase the number of 
low-skill people in each country who are "left behind" -- without jobs. The end 
of the Cold War has reduced the threat of nuclear war but unleashed "a lot of 
chaos."  
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, Clinton increasingly seems to define his job as helping 
people make sense of the times. "I do believe that a major part of the 
President's job in a time of profound change is getting people to first of all 
think about themselves as a community . . . and then to imagine the future in a 
good way, meaning both realistic and hopeful," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that goes way beyond any particular program I might pass. If I can get 
people to think about themselves as a people with a common purpose and then to 
imagine the future in a good way, I think that's half the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet only half. To lead, a President must do more than exhort: As Dean 
Acheson, Harry Truman's secretary of state, once observed, a President "is 
called upon to influence and move . . . his own country and the world around it 
to a purpose that he envisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Against that standard, how has Clinton done? 
</P>
<P>
 He has devoted the most thought and produced the most detailed response to the 
economy. He wants new efforts to increase the education and skills of American 
workers, encourage the development of new industries at home through 
investments in research and development and open markets for American products 
abroad. Critics can question whether this approach will be sufficient to turn 
around the wage stagnation of the past 20 years. (Indeed, Clinton is concerned 
that programs to increase skills may only produce a glut of trained workers and 
depress the value of a college education. "That's an open question," he says.) 
But there's no question that he has a guiding vision. 
</P>
<P>
 After the economy, Clinton seems to have the clearest direction on combatting 
the rise in out-of-wedlock births. He is still devising welfare initiatives and 
other policies that might attack the trend, but he has already focused more 
public attention on it than any President in memory. In effect, he has 
concluded the debate over whether this trend should be resisted, and begun the 
dialogue over how. 
</P>
<P>
 In immigration, Clinton has had less a policy vision than a political 
strategy: protecting legal immigration by proposing measures to crack down on 
illegal immigration. But he has focused only glancingly on the larger question 
of binding together the nation; as we spoke, he expressed more anxiety than 
ever before about that dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great challenges of this age -- you see it in Bosnia; you see it 
in the Middle East; you see it on that bridge shooting in New York; you see it 
all over this country -- we have to find a way to continue to value our ethnic, 
racial and religious differences, our cultural identifiers, without feeling 
that the only way to value them is to denigrate someone else," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we have to do it through times of change, when people are being uprooted 
from their neighborhoods, when their jobs are not secure," he continues. "We 
have to find a way to put that in as an anchor of American life, because if we 
do then I'm convinced that this country will be the most successful country 
well into the next century because of our diversity. If the world is becoming 
smaller and more globalized, a nation that is a microcosm of the world and can 
relate best to all the rest of it is going to do very, very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Can we achieve that unity while continuing to absorb new immigrants at 
historically high levels? Clinton pauses for a moment: "To be candid, I just 
don't know," he says. "Immigration has always been an enormous source of 
strength in our country. But now we're called upon to really examine whether 
there have to be more rigorous limits so that there will be enough economic 
security for the people who are here to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign policy, it is uncertainty that has paralyzed Clinton. On domestic 
issues, he steers as though he knows the bends in the road ahead; on foreign 
policy, he's more like a man hugging the white line on a foggy night. Clinton 
understands that many question whether he is pursuing changes in our relations 
with the world equal to the changes in circumstance. His response, in part, is 
to plead for patience. On some questions -- like NATO'S future and the West's 
relationship to the former communist countries -- moving slowly may be the best 
option until the new patterns sort themselves out, he says. "We don't want to 
just sort of expand NATO on the assumption that we have certain enemies out 
there that have a different name. This is like the period at the end of the 
Second World War, where we still had the institutions and values and ties of 
the war and we don't want to get rid of them," he says. "We know we need to 
build on them. We know we need something different. And we're in the process of 
figuring out what that is and reaching to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But at a time of unpredictability, I ask, should a President move cautiously 
or plant a flag and try to pull events toward that pole?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to go cautiously in areas where we have only a marginal 
ability to affect the outcome," he says. "Where we have a significant ability 
to affect the outcome, which is principally here at home but also in areas like 
NAFTA or GATT, we have to be more ambitious and leadership-oriented. It's very 
important to have a vision of what the world is going to look like and what 
life could be like for Americans and to try to keep working toward it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And of course it's difficult because there's never a time that's free of 
problems. There is never a time which is free of politics. But I think my job 
still is to try to plant that vision out there and keep pushing toward it and 
to get people to try to imagine how the future might be and to create it." 
</P>
<P>
 EACH AGE OF UNCERTAINTY has posed the same test of leadership: understanding 
which changes to resist and which carry the irresistible force of history. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the current debates are Clinton and others who would generally 
embrace the changes under way (except the breakdown in the family). On the 
other are Perot, conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan and other 
proponents of what might be termed "defensive nationalism," who resist these 
trends, taking positions tinctured with isolationism, protectionism and 
nativism. 
</P>
<P>
 The key dividing line is not party affiliation, but attitudes toward the 
changes. Issues like NAFTA, immigration and intervention abroad now cause as 
many divisions within the parties as between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Destabilized by these internal disputes, the two parties that have ruled 
American politics without serious challenge since 1860 could see their 
dominance shattered. Those predicting the emergence of new rivals to the major 
parties have always been disappointed. But the economic insecurity spreading in 
the middle class could well propel a populist, inward-looking anti-Washington 
party of the left or right. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot, who together with Buchanan and Jerry Brown exploited this appeal in 
1992, may be too discredited by personal peccadilloes to effectively carry this 
message again in 1996. But if Clinton is perceived as having failed, another 
outsider may find a surprisingly large audience for arguments that both parties 
have flubbed their chance to renew American life. "We are headed potentially 
for a major political meltdown in this country," says Tim Hibbitts, a 
Portland-based pollster not noted for flamboyant predictions. "You saw what 
could happen in Canada. What I would do is wag a finger at the Democrats and 
Republicans and say, 'Beware, beware, that could happen to you."' 
</P>
<P>
 History offers no assurance that the forces seeking to advance and manage 
change always carry the day. During previous periods in American history, those 
seeking to hold back the clock have achieved political dominance as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1820s and 1830s, the shift from a barter to a market economy -- with 
banks and corporations and cash transactions all growing more common -- 
precipitated a widespread period of flux and defined the political competition 
between Henry Clay's Whigs, who welcomed the economic revolution, and Andrew 
Jackson's Democrats, who resisted it. The Jacksonians dominated the political 
competition into the 1840s, though the forces of change were so strong that 
eventually the party was forced to moderate its opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last years of the 19th Century, a similar divide occurred when 
Americans struggled with many of the changes visible today: a dramatic economic 
shift as the nation industrialized and consolidated power into large 
corporations; a surge of immigration unmatched until now; and a reassessment of 
the nation's international role symbolized by the Spanish-American War and the 
acquisition of colonies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The populist movement was then the most powerful expression of those who 
sought to resist change. Opposed to the spread of giant corporations and wage 
labor, suspicious of cities, immigrants and blacks, critical of the imperial 
designs of William McKinley, the populists combined reform with nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could not hold back change -- or command majority support. Three 
times, the Democratic Party nominated the populist champion William Jennings 
Bryan for President; each time he failed. And through the 1890s, the populist 
struggle to resist the forces reshaping the country was supplanted by the 
Progressive impulse to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tide turned again after World War I, when the nation confronted a new 
wave of immigration and suffered widespread disillusionment over the cost and 
results of America's involvement in Europe. Americans said no to the League of 
Nations, immigration and domestic dissidents while raising tariffs, imposing 
Prohibition and banning the teaching of evolution. It was a national shudder, 
an effort to unwind intensifying complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, the years after World War II constituted the most successful 
effort in the nation's history to impose order on uncertainty, particularly 
abroad. The sense of making a new world was so powerful that Dean Acheson would 
later entitle his memoirs "Present at the Creation." But this genesis did not 
occur in seven days, or 70, or 700. 
</P>
<P>
 Some elements of the postwar system fell into place quickly. But the hesitancy 
that many now see in Clinton's dealings with the world also characterized 
Truman's early years. In January, 1946, columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop 
published an article that might have been written today: It was entitled "We 
have no Russian Policy." Yet only a few weeks later, order began to emerge when 
George Kennan, then the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, wrote 
his celebrated "long telegram," predicting a long period of struggle with a 
Soviet Union committed to probing for weakness in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennan crystallized a goal -- resisting Soviet expansion -- but left 
unresolved tactics, strategy, costs and capacity. The Truman Doctrine of 
fighting communism, which accompanied aid to Greece and Turkey, followed in 
March, 1947; the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe came that summer; NATO in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson: In times of uncertainty, new patterns take years to cohere. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a second lesson in the post-World War II experience. If the Truman 
Administration planners had not been so ambitious in their vision, the past 
half-century almost certainly would have been far more turbulent and tense. It 
is worth remembering that only by forthrightly defining the world they wanted 
could they steer events, however imperfectly, in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not invalidate the success of that vision to recall its costs. As 
historian Melvyn P. Leffler notes, the United States constructed logic chains 
in which threats anywhere in the world cascaded into challenges to national 
interests -- a habit that proved tragic in Vietnam -- and "squandered enormous 
sums of money on an arms race" that "may have eroded America's margin of 
economic superiority." 
</P>
<P>
 What that accounting suggests is that order does not constitute the only 
virtue in diplomacy. A final lesson of the Cold War thus bounds the other two: 
If we must become rigid to avoid uncertainty, the cost is too great.  
</P>
<P>
 While exploring these issues with Clinton, I read him a remark from Dean 
Acheson's memoirs. Looking back, Acheson's generation appears supremely 
confident, but he recalled the years around World War II this way: "Not only 
was the future clouded, a common enough situation, but the present was equally 
clouded. . . . The significance of events was shrouded in ambiguity. We groped 
after interpretations of them, sometimes reversed lines of action based on 
earlier views, and hesitated long before grasping what now seems obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Clinton if he ever feels that way now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he says, stiffening up in his chair. "You may take another time, 
the period going into the Civil War, where Lincoln said, 'I am controlled by 
events. My policy is to have no policy.' I think this is a time when we have to 
be highly flexible. We have to be willing to admit when we make a mistake and 
change course." 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded as though, like Acheson, he was resigning himself to living with 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he says again, more emphatically. "The difference was, though, 
they were not passive in the face of it. They were willing to admit that they 
had to be cautious, that they had to be humble, that they had to back and fill, 
they had to change. But they had their sleeves rolled up and they were active. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I want people in this country to feel about our Administration. 
Not that we have all the answers, not that we can solely foresee the future, 
not even that we won't make mistakes, but at least we are working toward that 
future. We are active in the face of uncertainty. Because I think that is your 
only chance, really, to shape it in a way that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 THOUGH THESE ARE nerve-rattling times, we may look back on them as the spur to 
a stronger nation, and see efforts to cling to the past as similarly 
short-sighted miscalculation. For all the dislocations introduced by global 
competition, it has forced American business to become more productive and 
competitive and quickened the development of new technologies and industries. 
Immigration is infusing cities around the country with new cultural and 
entrepreneurial energy. For all the confusion left in its wake, the Cold War's 
end has greatly increased both American security and its latitude to pursue 
neglected goals -- advancing its economic interests, for one, or protecting the 
global environment. In a different sense it may be equally short-sighted to 
accept as inevitable the growing share of births that come outside of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In his classic book, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," Thomas S. Kuhn 
notes that scientists often resist evidence that threatens a paradigm by which 
they have explained events. It is only when they accept the failure of the old 
rules that they can begin to construct the new. In that sense, scientific 
revolutions parallel political revolutions: In both instances, he writes, "the 
sense of malfunction that can lead to crisis is prerequisite." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be as good an explanation as any of the state in which America now 
finds itself. We feel a widespread sense of malfunction, with the components of 
our national identity and purpose evolving. Today, many Americans would still 
rather recapture the old than build the new -- as the debates about NAFTA and 
immigration show. Yet, as in the laboratory, our dominant assumptions must 
visibly fail before new approaches will flourish. Take one example: the growing 
anxiety about births to unmarried mothers makes it likely that in the next 
several years we will test the most radical ideas of left and right -- from 
intensive mentoring and guaranteed employment for young people who graduate 
from high school without having children, to denying welfare benefits to women 
who give birth outside of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the monolith of accepted wisdom cracks, there is no damming the flow of 
new ideas. Somewhere on the Internet, a young Californian born in Vietnam or 
Pakistan may be watering the seed that could germinate into the next Microsoft 
or Apple. Uncertainty is the price we pay for a society open enough to welcome 
him, and nurture his innovation. Uncertainty is the price of renewal.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The year 2000 . . . we've heard about that date all our lives. The phrase 
itself has become a staple of our language, signifying the moment when the real 
future begins. Our civilization has been talking about "the year 2000" 
incessantly, it seems, at least since 1905, when historian Henry Adams 
predicted that "every American who lived into the year 2000 would know how to 
control unlimited power." We've prophesied, fantasized, invented, planned, 
revised our plans and revised them again. Somehow it's always seemed so far 
off, that fabled year.  
</P>
<P>
 But in less than six years we'll be writing that date in our checkbooks and on 
our letters; we'll see that date on our newspapers and on our license plates. 
And after all this anticipation, we will wake to the year 2000 surprised, 
perhaps even amazed, to find that the citizens of the 21st Century are not a 
marvelous generation of some brave new world; no, they are only you and I. Just 
us folks. For, in fact, the 21st Century is our time, and its formation is our 
task. (Does a little voice say to you as it says to me, "Oh my God, if we're 
the A-team, we're in trouble?") 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that the first morning of the year 2000 will be very much like one 
of those birthdays that are supposed to mean so much, the "turning-point" 
birthdays: 21, 30, 40, 50. On such a morning you don't feel very different from 
how you felt the day before. You look the same. Your dilemmas haven't changed. 
Your political and religious views are the same and so are your feelings for 
your family. You are hours older and not very much wiser, and you still must go 
to work in the same car, or on the same bus, to pay the same rent or the same 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, your anxiety on such a morning is not at the arrival of change 
but at the lack of it. You may have feared turning, say, 40, but you also 
expected a certain level of maturity by the time you got that far. So on top of 
your usual anxiety there's a sense that something's missing. If you're at all 
like me on such landmark dates, you expect a little more of yourself, but you 
don't quite know how to go about being what you expect. This can make for a 
quiet but pervasive mood of disorientation.  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine an entire civilization going through such a turning point and feeling 
such disorientation. That, rather than any brave new world, is likely to be our 
society's general atmosphere in the year 2000, the first year of the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 For it's as though we've imagined, collectively, that in the year 2000 some 
huge ceremonial door would open, and we'd all walk through, in stately fashion, 
to a new world order that was somehow already laid out for us, as though our 
destiny required no more of us than that we show up. But if it's not like that 
. . . if Jan. 1, 2000, is not going to be so terribly different from Dec. 31, 
1999 . . . and since 1999 is only five years away . . . then in a sense we're 
already living in the 21st Century.  
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot that's happened in the past few decades, the 21st Century has 
arrived out of breath, earlier than expected, without asking anyone's 
permission and without waiting for us to get ready. The car you buy in the next 
couple of years is probably the car you (or someone who buys it used) will 
drive into the next millennium. Not Batman's car, not an anti-gravity car that 
floats above the road, probably not even an electric or ethanol car, but your 
car. So today is not a prelude, nor an in-between time, nor an interlude, nor a 
rehearsal. Today is it. Welcome to the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW ARE WE CREATING THIS 21ST CENTURY OF OURS? WE'RE NOT SITTING down and 
planning it. We're creating it by the impact of millions of people making 
hundreds of millions of small choices every day. The creation and re-creation 
of civilization is not about great thinkers and inventors and policians -- the 
"newsmakers" who number only a tiny percentage of the population. (After all, 
their innovations only count insofar as the rest of us take them to heart.) 
Civilization, or the lack of it, is about what normal struggling people do from 
morning till bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a basic human activity like shopping. Until about 40 years ago, people 
shopped at small stores and markets in their neighborhoods and towns. Shoppers 
knew their clerks and store owners by name. Credit wasn't based on a TRW 
rating, it was based on your personal reputation. Then "supermarkets" came in. 
There was more selection, higher volume, lower prices, and people liked that. 
But you didn't know the clerks anymore, you never met the owners, and you 
couldn't run up a tab. On a less obvious level, the money spent in the 
community didn't stay in the community; it went to the company that owned the 
supermarket. Things became more convenient but less personal. And the strength 
of the community went elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 It didn't feel like we were making a major decision about society; it felt 
like we were choosing to buy milk for a nickel less a carton. Nevertheless, a 
massive collective decision was being made that turned the direction of our 
civilization. Nobody was forced to give up community for convenience; the 
choice was presented to us, and we chose. We may bemoan the loss of community 
now, but this is one of the ways we lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 30 years ago, supermarkets begat malls. All over America, 
small-town and neighborhood storefronts became empty as malls grew. Again, 
malls were more convenient. All one's shopping could be done from one parking 
place. And again, we thought we were just going shopping. We didn't realize we 
were building the basic atmosphere of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Then some more inventors and entrepreneurs came along and offered us cable 
television. Dozens of channels will soon become hundreds of channels. Many of 
those channels are shopping channels, and they're already doing very well. Some 
predict that within a decade much of our shopping will be done electronically. 
So in half a century we will have gone from family stores to supermarkets to 
malls to a world in which stores as we know them may become an endangered 
species. And what will disappear with the stores? 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping by cable, of course, is convenient, and convenience is something we 
all like. But television shopping means we need fewer stores, and fewer local 
jobs -- fewer clerks, drivers, janitors, mechanics, plumbers, construction 
workers and managers. So people move, following the work, and our communities 
become less stable. We don't mean to destabilize them, but we do nonetheless -- 
just because of the way our shopping has changed. The decrease in advertising 
will decrease ad revenues for newspapers and magazines, so you'll have to be 
hooked up to a computer news service to get the in-depth coverage that 
broadcast news isn't designed for -- if you can afford a computer, i.e., if 
you're not one of the people who's lost a good job because of the way shopping 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rather innocent 21st Century activity, shopping. We take it for granted 
and yet willy-nilly we've each helped do away with the communities we miss so 
much. And nobody meant to. We were just trying to buy a carton of milk for a 
few pennies less, and we turned the 20th Century into the 21st. When we lost 
those communities we also lost our political stability. Political parties meant 
something in our old communities, both in small towns and big cities. Parties 
were organized into stable power blocs that, whatever their faults, could get 
basic things done for local people. But when we streamlined commerce and 
destabilized those communities, the power blocs went the way of the jobs, and 
on a political level it became much harder to get anything done. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have time to conceive of, or build, the new political institutions 
necessary for our new fragmented communities. We don't have time to make them 
accountable or even decipherable. We're too busy trying to find some kind of 
job security in a world where jobs are disappearing and changing faster than we 
can keep track. But the politicians don't really have time to reconstitute our 
institutions either. They're scrambling through a frantic agenda of patchwork 
and catch-up, trying (with various levels of sincerity) to make a rickety 
system cope with a situation that is not only new but that won't stay put. They 
can't help but be ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a majority of us have stopped voting because we don't believe in the 
political system anymore -- a political system that's changed partly (but not 
insignificantly) because of things like how we shop. 
</P>
<P>
 So we arrive at a 21st Century where we want more employment, but the choices 
we've made about commerce decrease employment. We want more cohesive 
communities, but the choices we've made about commerce take the economic and 
social spine out of communities. We want the politicians to address these 
issues, but the choices we've made about commerce make the politicians more and 
more powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought we were merely changing a form -- merely changing how we did 
something. We didn't mean to change the entire context and content of what we 
did. But the catch is: When you change a form, no matter how innocently, you 
often dump the old content. In the form of the old way of shopping, the content 
was community and familiarity. With the new form, one-to-one human contact is 
gone and with it eventually goes community. We could write to our 
congressperson, but what would we say? We could stage a demonstration, but what 
would we demand? We can't have the old forms back, and the new forms are 
driving us crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive effect of our millions of daily-life choices has left us in a 
millennium (albeit a few years ahead of time) that no one can fathom, predict 
or control. 
</P>
<P>
 WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS VERY MUCH DONE. I GET UP IN THE MORNING IN A small 
apartment in a big city, Los Angeles, 3,000 miles from where I was born. My 
family lives in Boston, New York and Florida. Most of my friends are scattered 
(one called today to tell me she might manage a restaurant in Hanoi.) There are 
32 apartments in this building. A close friend lives in one of them, and I'm 
thankful for that -- it's a blessing most people don't have in this or any big 
city anymore, a close friend down the hall. I know four or five other neighbors 
to talk to on the stairs as we pass. Every month, it seems, faces change, 
people I didn't know move out, people I probably won't know move in. With the 
exception of one couple, every person in this building lives alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in this society almost 25% of us live alone. This is extraordinary. 
No society ever organized itself this way -- although the word "organized" 
doesn't describe what's happened. It just fell out like this, with the 
dissolution of communities. This means that 25% of our people have no one to 
care for them if they are ill. No one to talk to when they come home from work, 
no sense of being footsteps away from people to whom our welfare is crucial. We 
exaggerate the importance of celebrities and pundits on TV because they're the 
faces we see most consistently, outside of work. That's what a cheaper carton 
of milk has come to cost in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 17% of American households with children are headed by single parents 
who are far from their families, without much adult companionship except at 
work and no social life. That makes it hard to build a sense of community -- 
hard even to feel a part of a neighborhood. Kids look at how their parents are 
living, isolated and worried about an economy in which they could lose even the 
life they have; this drains the children of a sense of purpose. It feels like a 
chaotic world in which just holding on is an exhausting exercise, and what 
we're holding to isn't really what we want. There is something humiliating 
about having to hold so hard to something so far from our ideals. It's no 
wonder that so many of us slip, no wonder that America has far higher 
percentages of its people in prisons and in need of psychiatric care than 
anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Our politicians don't talk much about the daily lives of their constituents: 
If they spoke realistically about how we live we'd expect them to do something 
about it, and who knows what to do? So they talk about foreign policy and 
international trade. Or they try to relate to us with issues like health care 
and crime -- important issues, but when we had real communities our health care 
was more personal and far less expensive, and crime was mostly something that 
happened in the movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Hence many Americans wake up as I do, in small apartments in big cities, 
confused about what's next, what to do, where to go, how to be. We talk to our 
acquaintances about the weather, sports or the week's most sensational news 
item, not because we're especially interested but because that's all we think 
we have in common. It's a lonely, frightened and insecure time, but we can't 
talk about our anxieties, so a lot of us think that we're all alone feeling 
lonely, frightened and insecure. Actually, that's what we really have in 
common. And the brave fronts we put up can't create that sense of community 
without which so much feels hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky is still blue, sunsets are still beautiful, spring still follows 
winter, and occasionally there's even a movie that can make you laugh or cry. 
But I watch my neighbors go off in the morning to jobs they don't seem 
especially happy about (though any job is better than no job). I stand in line 
for coffee at the corner cafe with people I see every day but barely speak to. 
And I know that they're looking at me the way I'm looking at them. We are all 
citizens of the 21st Century, people from whom all the old answers have been 
stripped, people looking for ways to live in this fast-forward world.  
</P>
<P>
 Many technologists, scientists, writers and even a few politicians assure us 
that the dilemmas of our new millennium will be addressed by what they call 
"the information superhighway." By this they mean the extension of a world-wide 
computer network already in the making -- a network which many are looking to 
with profound hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, any individual with a basic computer and modem can tap into this 
new world network, can call up information about almost anything from almost 
anywhere and communicate with people all over the world. With new electronic 
advances hooking up telephones, televisions, faxes and computers, a worldwide 
electronic nervous system will connect any place that can generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities can be rearranged. Many businesses are run and managed by individuals 
working in their homes connected by computer to "virtual offices," though the 
workers are miles and even whole states apart. "Virtual communities" link 
like-minded individuals who communicate solely by computer, whether their 
interest is chess, pornography or the stock market, and any individual with a 
computer can belong to many virtual communities simultaneously. You may be a 
citizen of Los Angeles or Austin, Tex., but your community can include China, 
Michigan, Brazil, Germany, Israel, India and Algeria. There will probably soon 
be computer programs that automatically and instantaneously translate any 
language into a language you can read on your screen. You can travel this 
information superhighway anywhere, for any reason, at any time, and you don't 
have to leave your desk. 
</P>
<P>
 But after you've spent some time as a computer citizen of the world, what 
happens to your allegiances? Multinational corporations have already eroded 
national power and national interests on a multinational scale; what will be 
the effect of multinational citizens? Totalitarian states like China have 
discovered that they can't compete economically without plugging into the 
incredibly fluid, and intrinsically empowering and freedom-expanding technology 
of the West. This has threatened their authority over their own people. But all 
states, even democratic ones, like to exercise at least a little authority over 
their own people. How does one govern millions of individuals whose daily 
interests cross national boundaries and whom one can't control except by 
shutting down the very system that one's economy is based on? After these 
millions are acclimated to an international world view, how does that change 
the way they vote in the country where their computer happens to be? Will the 
very idea of "nation" blur in individuals as it has in corporations? What 
interests will the President of the United States appeal to when both daily 
life and the national economy are international as a matter of course? A 
President today already has far less power than a President in the days of 
Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. Can our system of government stand a 
presidency that is even weaker? 
</P>
<P>
 Again: You can't change the form without changing the content. Both our 
economy and our technology are pushing us toward this new way of being, or not 
being, American citizens of the 21st Century. But what remains American when 
many of our most affluent, intelligent and productive citizens (for it takes a 
certain amount of affluence, intelligence and productivity to plug into the 
system) spend lots of "virtual time" away from America?  
</P>
<P>
 We assume, at least in rhetoric, that the information superhighway will solve 
our economic problems, but we forget that while information aids in the making 
of things, it doesn't, in and of itself, do the making. People working in 
factories do most of the making. The computers we use are made by factory 
workers in places like Japan and South Korea, which is why their economies have 
boomed while ours has limped. Information doesn't construct houses, harvest 
vegetables, herd cattle or build furniture. Even in the 21st Century work 
remains manual. And countries in which such jobs abound may have a better 
chance at a more viable future than those countries in which they don't -- 
especially when many millions of new workers join the worldwide work force 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The technocrats who want us to solve our problems by being more dependent on 
information industries tend to miss this point. We cannot be strong, 
economically or politically, when we're dependent on other countries for 
everything from socks to computers, no matter how much information we have. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the information superhighway is the best our most enlightened 
politicians can offer; and since the industries that make socks, computers and 
most everything else are gone for good; then American citizens of the 21st 
Century have to reframe their questions. If it's unrealistic to seek to be 
strong, shouldn't we seek to be something else? What is the point of being a 
superpower, on an information superhighway, if we can't afford what's at the 
supermarket? 
</P>
<P>
 WE CITIZENS OF THE 21ST CENTURY DON'T WAKE UP IN THE MORNING with this 
question at the tip of our tongues, but it is becoming implicit in our lives. 
It affects the way we walk down the street (secure or frightened?), the way we 
do our jobs, the way we watch TV. It affects whom we listen to and what we 
listen for. Bubbling under our discourse are other questions, such as: What is 
more important now, convenience or community? What should we spend our money 
on, military super-status or stable neighborhoods? Where's the balance, what 
are the trade-offs? The questions haven't been formulated in the public 
discourse yet, but our eyes are troubled with them. Issues like foreign policy 
will ultimately be decided not by the newsmakers, but by whether we might be 
willing to live in a less powerful country if we could live more cohesive 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 These questions hover on the edge of our daily lives, but we wake up concerned 
with more immediate things. Basic issues like the meaning of marriage, what it 
means to be a man or a woman and how we should behave toward our own and other 
people's children are like potholes in the sidewalk that we trip over every 
day. In these matters, so crucial to our daily happiness, we have no one to 
turn to but ourselves and each other in the 21st, as in any century.  
</P>
<P>
 It is no coincidence that when communities were stable, family life tended to 
be stable. Not necessarily happy, or even fulfilling (there is certainly plenty 
of data showing that women were not fulfilled), but stable. Now the way we've 
chosen to conduct commerce, and the inventions we've eagerly brought into our 
homes (and it's worth repeating that no one forced us to buy the TVs, the 
stereos, cable and the computers; we've worked ourselves ragged to have these 
things) -- these have fragmented our communities. So we're trying to make a 
life among the fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the example that's become apocryphal in America today: How do you react 
to a child you don't know? If the child's in some difficulty, do you ignore the 
child because you're afraid of being sued? Do you show kindness, though even 
kindness brings one under suspicion these days? Do you act according to your 
best instincts and take your chances? What are your responsibilities to the 
child and what are your responsibilities to yourself? Whatever you do, you're 
setting a precedent -- you're becoming part of a collective precedent-setting 
that's going on in all parts of our lives as we try to find manners for 
communities in which people do not know, and therefore do not trust, one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to conceive how different such communities are from those in 
which people have lived till this new millennium. In Africa they used to say, 
"It takes a whole village to raise a child." This means that everyone in the 
village was trusted, because to be born in a village -- an African, a European, 
a New England or a Southern village -- was to know in your bones that you would 
be seeing the people around you for the rest of your life. Now I live in an 
apartment building where there are new faces almost every month. To say "good 
morning" to a stranger is a small act of courage, often greeted with 
uneasiness; not to say it is an act of submission to an atmosphere of mutual 
suspicion. In such living conditions, every word makes or breaks a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the "politically correct" debate rages furiously, along with the 
issues raised by the religious right and the gay community. Rightly or wrongly, 
factions are trying, some by legislation and some by instigation, to force new 
patterns and set new precedents. The social stress of daily life is largely the 
stress of living in an absolutely new, raw era that gives us nothing to go by. 
What can a man say to a woman on the job? Men and women have never worked as 
equals before, at the same jobs, in any civilization we know about. Can 
teachers express their own views to a class or must they go by rigid codes? 
This is perhaps the most intimidating quality of our 21st Century. It is so 
malleable that no one can guess even so much as what will be considered 
acceptable manners in 10 or 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictions are pointless. All the fancy think tanks and all the best-selling 
authors, not to mention the CIA and the National Security Council and all of 
our elected officials, apparently did not know in 1988 what awaited us in 1989, 
the year the Soviet Bloc crumbled of its own weight with hardly a shot fired. 
There is no point in looking to that stratum of society for guidance. Nobody 
knows what's coming, except that it will be an extension of how we live every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 If we live with courage, there will be courage to draw on in the future. If we 
don't, there won't be. If we act out of fear and suspicion and intolerance, 
then fear and suspicion and intolerance will build the coming world. The 21st 
Century will be what we are, not what we imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 What am I then, in this small apartment, in this big city? In part I'm 
somebody who isn't interested in another statistic and who won't believe 
another prediction. I don't trust television, but I get most of my information 
there. Many people not so very different from me are showing up on talk shows, 
hosted by people like Oprah, talking on TV to strangers about what they don't 
usually talk about to their neighbors -- we're that hungry to share our 
anxieties and opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 We call in to radio shows to give opinions about what we half-know, what we 
have incomplete information about. Then we tune in to news shows, where our 
leaders seem to have little more information than we do (sometimes they seem to 
have less). When we look to where the centers should be, where they've been in 
the past, we often find a confusion that is greater than ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far the distinguishing feature of our 21st Century is that we are on our 
own. The dissolution of our communities and the helplessness of those in 
authority have left us exposed to . . . ourselves. Our limits, our depths, our 
lacks, our abilities. So who I am, in this small apartment, is a person whose 
era, whose time in history, forces me back upon my own resources, on my own 
spirit. How that fact is met in this apartment, and in all the other small 
apartments and mortgaged houses, will determine the history of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 For history is not a spectator sport. It is what you think and I do. There is 
no comfort but to remember that everything we do now is an exploration -- 
potentially as exciting as it is frightening. (It's frightening, after all, 
because it's exciting. Dull things aren't scary.) Far from being powerless, we 
who must move through our days making the millions of small decisions that 
create our world -- it is we who exert enormous power. How we shop, what we 
eat, how we entertain ourselves; our attitudes toward strangers, people of 
other races, our neighbors' children; whether we decide to vote and on what we 
base that vote; where we decide to live, and what we tolerate or do not 
tolerate in our surroundings -- these are the building blocks of what will 
come. 
</P>

 The new millennium has begun.

VOICES: GIVING BACK; AS A FEMALE ASIAN AMERICAN, A VETERAN RESERVE POLICE 
OFFICER SAYS SHE BRINGS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE TO THE LAPD. GETTING THE CHANCE TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE STREETS IS HER GREATEST REWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDI TAHARA, Randi Tahara has been a reserve officer with the Los Angeles 
Police Department for 10 years. In an unusual assignment, she posed last 
October as a prostitute in a sting that resulted in the arrest of a Little 
Tokyo business owner. The man is accused of running a prostitution ring that 
catered to Japanese-speaking businessmen. He is awaiting trial on two counts of 
pandering and one count of pimping, all felonies. Tahara, 34, is office 
administrator for a Downtown law firm. She was interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been helped by community groups, and I wanted to give some of that back. 
When I was in high school I was selected by the school district to represent 
Los Angeles in the sister city program with Nagoya, Japan. That was a 
three-week fully paid scholarship to Japan to serve as a student ambassador. 
That's not the sort of opportunity that comes along all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 So now I really want to make a difference. There are two things I find really 
important for a city, and that's education and law enforcement. So I found time 
and avenues to do volunteer work for both of these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the police reserve program I know that I'm able to make a difference 
working with people on a one-to-one basis. I consider myself a communicator. 
That's what being a police officer is about: communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Being female and being Asian American, I bring a unique perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is very diversified, but it doesn't have a lot of resources in 
some areas. There are a few LAPD officers who know Japanese, but I don't think 
any of them are females who are Asian. I was told that if I did not work on the 
pandering case, we probably would not be able to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
 I had some anxiety ahead of time, but once I sat there with the suspect it was 
acting time and I played that role. I dressed like I do for work, and he told 
me to wear something a little more flashy and more makeup. I met with him 
twice. He was trying to figure out where I was coming from. The way the 
Japanese communicate, they don't get right to the point. They like to chitchat. 
He asked me what I did. At the time I was shopping for insurance for my firm 
and I told him I was in insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to testify at the preliminary hearing. That case was my second time 
working undercover with the Asian Crime Investigation Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The other one involved an art forgery ring that was selling to Japanese 
businessmen. That was in '88 or '89. 
</P>
<P>
 I portrayed the secretary of a Japanese businessman. The man who portrayed the 
businessman was the same reserve officer who worked as a customer in the 
pandering case. In the art forgery case, another LAPD officer portrayed an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 We were in one of the hotels and pretended that we were just traveling through 
and were ready to make a purchase. They brought the art pieces with them and 
said they were authentic and if we would wire millions of dollars into their 
account, we could have the art right there. I wasn't nervous. It was carefully 
planned and there were officers in a room next to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day I work it's different. One thing I do is help teach human relations 
classes at the Police Academy. The purpose is to familiarize the recruits on 
who the Asian Americans are, what their attitudes are toward police officers, 
what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, normally if I'm talking to you and I'm not looking you in the 
eye, you might think I'm lying to you. But for Asians it could be a sign of 
respect, because it's considered very challenging and aggressive to look 
someone in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 I enjoy patrol and the foot beats the most, being out there with the people. I 
feel like I can do some good in Little Tokyo, where some of the merchants don't 
speak English and might be suspicious of the police. Sometimes I speak to Asian 
groups about crime and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 I make at least one arrest every time I'm out. Maybe it's arresting someone 
who has a warrant out. The crimes can range from robbery to breaking into cars. 
</P>
<P>
 I think being female and short helps me because I appear to be 
non-threatening. It has a calming effect. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember once on Broadway we got a call that a man was tearing up a shoe 
store and that the store employees had him in custody. My partner and I got 
there and I could tell the man was scared. He was a big guy and these two 
employees had a hold of him. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went up to him and said, "If I tell them to let you go, will you be nice 
to me?" And he said "OK." It was just a matter of talking to him in a way he 
understood and I had no problems after that. 
</P>
<P>
 I really think that people should look at becoming a reserve officer. It's 
very rewarding and it will help the community and it will open your eyes. 
People say, "Where's a cop when you need one?" Well, why don't they volunteer?

 For over 25 years, I have been involved with education and children's 
programs, first as an elementary school teacher and later as a supervisor and 
director of after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, I was appointed by then-Mayor Tom Bradley to the Education Council 
that developed L.A.'s BEST. 
</P>
<P>
 As with so many councils, I sat there fat and dumb and happy, until I was 
asked to visit some of the school sites. When I did, I was overcome with 
disappointment. I saw things like children in line, with no talking allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of my two sons, and how miserable they would be in that environment. 
I thought, "All this wonderful effort isn't going to last very long if kids 
don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 My experience is that children vote with feet -- if they like a program, they 
come, if not, no matter how great the program, they're not going to stay. So 
I've been here since 1988, still trying to get this program better and better. 
</P>
<P>
 What we provide is a safe, supervised environment of recreation, education and 
enrichment, not an extension of the school day. We are in schools that have the 
lowest test scores and are clearly the most vulnerable to gangs, crime and 
drugs. One-third of our staff are credentialed teachers, the rest come from 
recreation departments, youth services, and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a highly successful supervised homework program, which involves 
incentives and rewards to make it fun. There's also "reading for recreation," 
where kids read for pleasure. Some of these kids are starving when they come in 
after school, so we have snacks at each site. There's always outdoor team 
sports -- kick ball, football, basketball, softball. We have everyone come 
together and compete in citywide competitions. Everyone who participates wins 
something. The kids just love it. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have computer skills labs, and math and science clubs. Performing arts 
are a big part of the program because they are a constructive outlet for 
children's emotions. We also offer 15 yearly scholarships in music, dance and 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 We've recently been evaluated by UCLA, and some of their findings are quite 
significant. Over 75% of the kids like school better since they've been 
involved with L.A.'s BEST. They come to school every single day. They don't 
just pop in here and there; they come. That's incredible! 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA also found that parents and teachers are seeing both emotional and 
behavioral changes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a school in Watts, a teacher commented that there is less in-fighting 
because the program helps in social development. One parent said, "Before my 
son came to L.A.'s BEST, he had a chip on his shoulder. I don't see that chip 
anymore." Self-esteem has risen. They have direct quotes from kids saying, 'I 
feel like somebody,' 'I can do anything,' 'People like me.' Kids have also 
shown increased maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 These successes, even though they are amazing, aren't enough. The 3,800 
children we help are a drop in the bucket of the 100,000 children we know are 
unsupervised in this city after school. In the next five years, we would like 
to expand to 50 schools. In the short term, we would like to expand to two more 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At L.A.'s BEST, we value each child as he or she is, not as how we think they 
should be. We find some way to have that child experience a success every day, 
at least one success, whatever it may be. Many of these children haven't had 
any successes before they come to us at 2:30. Not in the classroom, not 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Our purpose is to make each child leave feeling good about something that's 
happened in the program. And it makes us feel good that we can do this.

MTA'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE BUS FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles City Council have heavily criticized the Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) proposal to 
increase bus fares from $1.10 to $1.55 on the grounds that the increase will 
hurt the Los Angeles residents least able to afford them. The council is 
correct. Most bus travelers use the bus because their resources do not permit 
them access to personal vehicles. Many bus users are members of the working 
poor, and these patrons are at genuine risk of being priced off the system by 
the proposed fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual ridership on MTA buses has already dropped by 121 million annual 
boardings as fares have risen from 50 cents during the peak ridership year of 
1985 to the current fare. This is almost one third of current system patronage. 
The message is clear. Price matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's position is too little too late. The city is just as responsible 
as the MTA for distracting the electorate and the media from the fact that Los 
Angeles' rail renaissance means spending much more to move many fewer people. 
Most of the North American transit systems that have rail lines have found it 
necessary to divert resources from buses to pay the large subsidies rail 
requires. Los Angeles is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's forecast 1995 budget pegs the Metrolink commuter rail subsidy at 
$21.02 per passenger trip in 1992 dollars. This is more than 60 times greater 
than the subsidy of 34 cents per passenger trip required by the MTA's most 
cost-effective bus line (Vermont Avenue's Line 204), and almost 18 times the 
subsidy for an average MTA bus line. In 1992, the annualized cost of the Blue 
Line train would have been sufficient to operate 17 of the MTA's 22 busiest bus 
lines. Collectively, these 17 bus lines carried 16 times the Blue Line's 
current ridership.  
</P>
<P>
 Widely perceived to be the incubator of freeway culture, Los Angeles is 
actually a very transit-intensive city. Buses play a larger role in the Los 
Angeles transportation system than in any other urban system in the country. 
According to U.S. Department of Transportation data, the Los Angeles bus system 
leads the nation in total passenger-miles of service, passenger-miles per 
vehicle and, most tellingly, passenger load per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA buses lead the nation in number of standees. Such crowding suggests that 
Los Angeles has a very high unmet demand for bus transit. New rail systems are 
too inflexible to satisfy this demand, and much more expensive than buses. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA continues to pursue its rail agenda, the net effect on transit use 
in Los Angeles will be devastating. Proposals to reduce bus service and 
increase fares will become routine, and the public transportation lifelines of 
Los Angeles' neediest residents will be permanently severed. Access to 
transport will be reduced for everyone, but the poor will feel it most. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA is serious about wanting to reduce its role in the nation's largest 
market for bus services, then the agency should move to legalize private 
transit operators. Owner-operators tend to be much more effective at 
controlling costs than are public entities. Even more important, the revenues 
earned by private operators depend on how well these operators match their 
services to what travelers want. Most of the MTA's transit revenues are tax 
dollars that have nothing to do with the quality of the service the agency 
delivers. 
</P>
<P>
 By opening the franchise to competition, the MTA would pave the way for the 
introduction of demand-responsive transit services at low fares.

 Jose Montenegro was a one-man wrecking crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Gate shortstop-catcher made his first pitching appearance of the 
season an impressive one, fanning six batters and tossing a two-hit, 3-0 
victory over Roosevelt.The Eastern League make-up game was Monday at Evergreen 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Montenegro also provided all the offense the Rams would need, doubling twice, 
driving in a run and scoring a run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams pounded eight hits off Roosevelt starter Fernie Garcia, who suffered 
his first defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia struck out eight batters, but had trouble finding the strike zone, 
walking six.  
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders squandered the few scoring opportunities they received, 
stranding a runner on third with no outs in the first and fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Alex and Juan Carlos Rodriguez managed the only hits for the 
Roughriders, with a double apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the Rams' eight hits were singles.

BUILDING A BETTER PRINCE; HIS WIFE HATES HIM. HIS MOTHER'S MAD AT HIM. HIS 
SUBJECTS THINK HE'S A WIMP AND THAT MAYBE THE ROYAL FAMILY IS OBSOLETE. CAN A 
NEW TEAM OF SPIN DOCTORS SAVE THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? 
</P>

<P>
By William Tuohy, William Tuohy is The Times' London correspondent; his last 
piece for the magazine was on former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fullness of time, historians may point to Jan. 26 as the day the waning 
fortunes of Charles, Prince of Wales, began to improve -- and with them the 
outlook for the British monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the monarchy and Charles' claim upon it were undergoing a severe 
crisis: The prince was deeply unpopular; he was separated from one of the 
world's most idealized women, Princess Diana; he was widely reported to be 
having an affair with a married woman, and speculation was rife that he might 
eventually step down as heir to the throne in favor of his elder son, William. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-planned royal tour to Australia was supposed to pump up interest in the 
beleaguered scion, but it got off to an underwhelming start, with small crowds 
and little interest. As one radio broadcaster described it, "Indifference is 
rising to a fever pitch." Prime Minister Paul Keating made it clear that he 
wished to take Australia out of the Commonwealth, headed by Queen Elizabeth II. 
And Keating's wife, Annita, declined to curtsy to the royal prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it happened. As Charles prepared to speak in Sydney's Tumbalong Park, a 
23-year-old Australian-born Asian named David Kang, in a fuddled attempt to 
protest Australia's immigration policies, stumbled onto the stage and fired two 
blanks from a starter pistol. He was quickly subdued as Charles, impeccably 
tailored in a dark, double-breasted Savile Row suit, fingered his cuff links 
and kept calm. "His Royal Coolness," headlined the Daily Mail, in a typical 
newspaper reaction. The tour, said the Times of London, was "an unqualified 
public relations success. His image, which a year ago was looking tarnished, 
has been noticeably polished."  
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, some skeptics suggested that Charles remained onstage simply 
because he didn't realize what was going on: He always fiddles with his cuff 
links. At public events, the prince often projects an uptight image, complete 
with many nervous mannerisms -- fingering his signet ring, adjusting his tie -- 
all of which suggests a certain royal insecurity in the outside world. This 
despite the fact that at 45, Charles Philip Arthur George, Duke of Cornwall, 
Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick and Baron of Renfrew, is one of the richest 
men in the world. He has the staffs of several palaces ready to do his bidding, 
the queen's aircraft poised to whisk him off to ski in the Alps, and the royal 
yacht Britannia available for vacations in warmer climes. Yet amid all the 
privilege, his perpetually pained expression suggests that life has been unkind 
-- and perhaps it has. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles might well complain that it's not easy being the heir apparent, 
spending your life being groomed for a job that has become, as one observer 
cruelly put it, waiting for your mother to die. Whatever the exact job 
description, Charles has, if the opinion polls are any guide, botched it. Until 
his Australian tour, he had been running at an all-time low for any member of 
the royal family, a feat that begs the question: Does the monarchy have any 
future after Queen Elizabeth II, now 68, leaves the scene? 
</P>
<P>
 After a vain attempt to ignore the situation, the palace has sought help: 
genuine spin-doctors and public-relations professionals hired by Charles' 
private secretary, former navy commander Richard Aylard, who have launched a 
full-out campaign to remake Charles' image into a more caring, warmhearted 
king-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 For any group of aides, advising a Prince of Wales heading toward the 21st 
Century would be difficult. There are no real guidelines and certainly no 
shining role models. The previous two princes of Wales were generally 
considered failures. Edward VII was a wastrel who made his way through a string 
of mistresses before he ascended the throne in 1901 at age 60, when his mother, 
Queen Victoria, finally died. Though a charming man-about-town, Edward VIII was 
a pro-Nazi weakling who gave up the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis 
Warfield Simpson in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 And Charles' new staff has one more obstacle to contend with -- the prince 
himself. Charles patently and publicly refuses to acknowledge that his image 
needs refurbishing -- or that it even matters. In an April interview in the 
Sunday Mail, Roy Hattersley, member of Parliament and former deputy Labor Party 
leader, asked Charles if it is important to be liked. "No, I don't go out of my 
way to court popularity," replied the prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that I am searching to redefine my job is rot," Charles told the 
Financial Times late last year. "It is just that, since the day I got married, 
people have chosen to ignore the things I continue to do, day in and day out."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Charles' views of himself, almost everyone else agrees that his image 
needs plenty of buffing. It reached a nadir 16 months ago when, in rapid 
succession, Buckingham Palace first announced that he and Diana, by far the 
most popular member of the royal family, were officially split. Popular opinion 
quickly took the side of Diana, now 32. Then came Camillagate, when, in 
January, 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped telephone 
call between the prince and Camilla Parker-Bowles, an old friend and wife of 
Brig. Gen. Andrew Parker-Bowles of the Household Cavalry, an elite army unit. 
It was an intensely private lovers' conversation, embarrassing to read. But 
read it the public did -- all 1,574 words, including the prince's awkward wish 
to become a Tampax in order to remain close to her. One commentator called it 
the most widely read royal document since the Magna Carta.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles' exchange with Camilla caused howls in pubs and posh drawing rooms 
around England and, for that matter, the world. The Italian press immediately 
dubbed Charles "Principe Tamponcino," Little Prince Tampon. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book "Behind Palace Doors: Marriage and Divorce in the House of 
Windsor," Nigel Dempster, Britain's leading gossip columnist, reported the 
private reaction of a close friend of Charles: "It was a terrible moment, the 
worst moment of his life. He wanted to be taken seriously. He sincerely 
believed he had important things to say. And in six minutes of private 
conversation, a conversation that was nobody's business but his and the woman 
to whom he was speaking, his reputation was ruined. . . . He really didn't 
deserve to be destroyed so publicly and so cruelly." 
</P>
<P>
 So Charles faced in 1993 the fury of his parents, the scorn of his wife and 
the laughter of his future subjects -- a humiliated object of derision; in 
short, a royal wimp. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal also inspired widespread examination of once-unquestioned 
tradition. Britain's largest-selling daily, the Sun, editorialized: "People are 
asking if we really need a royal family at all. And why we bow and scrape to 
them, treating them as demigods when many of them behave no better than the 
rest of us and in some cases a whole lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 And former Conservative member of Parliament and social commentator Matthew 
Parris declared, "Royalty in Britain is the single most potent symbol of class, 
and all the unfairness and all the waste of human potential that goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the queen could not ignore such widespread criticism. Although she 
maintains a steadfast public stoicism, sources close to the palace say that she 
has issued private warnings to all of the royals to clean up their act. 
Further, these sources say, if there were ever any hints that she might step 
down to give her son a decent reign as king, such thoughts are no longer 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, instead of the traditional courtier staff, Charles has a group of 
professionals who operate out of St. James' Palace, a dark brick, crenelated 
castle between London's Pall Mall and St. James Park. The central figure on 
Charles' staff is Aylard, 42. Bright, personable, knowledgeable and, most 
important, worldly, he is a departure from the usual inbred courtiers. "He is 
the architect of the new policy -- a good man, enthusiastic, a believer in the 
potential of the Prince of Wales," says Richard Kay, royal watcher for the 
Daily Mail. "The downside is that he fails to see the negatives of Charles." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Aylard are a deputy private secretary, Stephen Lamport, 43, a former 
political novelist who looks after the majority of foreign tours, and two 
assistant private secretaries: Matthew Butler, 34, who handles the prince's 
business and industrial interests and formerly was corporate affairs manager 
for Vickers Defense Systems, and Belinda Harley, a highly regarded former 
literary agent and professional in public relations who oversees the background 
reports for the prince, with a hand in speech writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Crucial to the new staffing is Allan Percival, 42, the press secretary, a 
career civil servant who has an engaging way with the media. He is assisted by 
Sandy Henney, 42, a former press officer for Scotland Yard, who helps schedule 
Charles' appearances to make him, as royal reporter James Whitaker puts it, 
"user friendly." Still, PR assistance to Charles, says Whitaker, has to be 
subtle. "The prince needs to be gently persuaded; some might say conned." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Aylard or Percival will call a strategy meeting with the prince's other 
advisers, including his personal friends of many years' standing, who range 
from pleasant, comfortable people like Lord and Lady Tryon to the more 
sophisticated Nicholas Soames, Conservative Party parliamentarian and grandson 
of Winston Churchill. Then there are confidants like explorer Sir Laurens van 
der Post and environmentalist Jonathon Porrit, to whom he turns for more 
philosophical insights. All want to improve the prince's popularity and with it 
the image of the monarchy, and they want to do it at once. Because, as Anthony 
Holden, a Charles biographer and author of "The Tarnished Crown," has said, 
"This is his make-or-break year to win the hearts and minds of the British 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 IN AN INTERVIEW WITH AUSTRALIAN TV, CHARLES ATTRIBUTED HIS COOLNESS in Sydney 
to a "thousand years of breeding." But throughout the kingdom, many 
commentators have wondered about the end result of that millennium of breeding. 
For Charles is an unprepossessing specimen: medium height with sloping 
shoulders, jug ears, narrow, squinting eyes and a forehead usually set in a 
frown. He speaks in an adenoidal accent that sounds faintly forced and affected 
even to upper-class Brits. And while he can trace his lineage back to 
Anglo-Saxon kings, more recently his family has had an infusion of German 
blood: King George V in World War I arbitrarily changed the family dynastic 
name from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor, after the town where they 
spent weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a distant, chilly father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Charles 
was raised in emotionless surroundings, his parents often absent or 
unavailable. However, he was the first royal to eschew education by palace 
tutors and attend private secondary schools and Cambridge University. He served 
in the armed forces, his longest hitch with the Royal Navy. But as Prince of 
Wales and heir to the throne, Charles could never be one of the boys. And he 
wasn't. Even at the height of his popularity, Charles seemed aloof, distracted 
and distant from his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Charles, in an effort to compete with his wildly popular 
wife, became interested in a series of worthy causes: the environment, 
architecture, organic farming, inner-cities improvement, and jobs and business 
opportunities for young people. It didn't help. His personal staff, unversed in 
professional media relations, failed to unify Charles' activities or coverage 
of them, and the whole effort seemed to drift. Supporters had difficulty 
discerning how the various enthusiasms tied together. Charles had an arrogant 
and stubborn side that was not helped by fawning palace courtiers. "They've all 
led sheltered lives," comments a former colleague. "There are a real bunch of 
amateurs and incompetents in Buck House." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' aides were baffled by their lack of success. The initial 
revolutionary idea of humanizing the monarchy -- in "Royal Family," a 1969 
BBC-TV documentary on the queen at work -- had been an enormous success. But 
while it allowed the populace to feel closer to Elizabeth II, it also opened 
the monarchy's closed doors forever. No longer could it be secret, mysterious, 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 The public appetite for news of whatever kind about the monarchy and the royal 
family became insatiable, and the tabloid press has done its best to satisfy 
that craving. Newspapers and television networks maintain court correspondents, 
who attend daily briefings on the activities of the royals and accompany them 
on trips -- all scrambling for the catchy or lurid headline bits that sell 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of the closer press scrutiny -- or more likely because of it -- 
Charles has failed to capture public affection. His enthusiasms draw criticism 
or provoke satire. In a long interview with ITV television in 1987 at his 
country estate, Highgrove, in Gloucestershire, Charles told interviewer 
Alastair Burnet that he sometimes talked to plants, "and they do respond in a 
funny way." It was meant half in jest to show he was a caring gardener. But it 
promptly earned him the name "the loony prince" by some anti-royal British 
tabloid papers.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles' enthusiasm for the environment again seemed a bit over the top when 
he wrote of 1,112-acre Highgrove, "As far as I was concerned, every tree, every 
hedgerow, every wet place, every mountain and river had a special, almost 
sacred, character of its own." Rather than a serious heir apparent, he came to 
be portrayed as an eccentric.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing he did seemed to go right. He was criticized when he espoused 
alternative medicine, to which the British Medical Assn. strongly objected. 
British architects complained about his distaste for contemporary design. When 
Charles visited Scottish crofters' huts in the Hebrides and traveled to the 
Kalahari Desert in Botswana, critics pointed out the inconsistencies of a royal 
prince arriving by air with a TV team in tow and encouraging locals to live the 
simple life. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, his concerns seemed to veer dangerously into the political 
field -- which is off-limits to the royals. Former Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, for instance, was not happy with the prince's statements on the 
plight of the inner cities because it smacked of support for the Labor Party's 
criticism of the Conservatives' inaction in this area. And in Paris, in 
December, 1992, the prince tactlessly defended French farmers -- contrary to 
the official British position in the GATT trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also said to be spreading himself too thin: In November, 1986, he 
supported Inner City Aid with a great deal of fanfare but then turned his 
attention to other programs while the original project withered, raising only 
about $50,000 of its $15-million target. It was shut down two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the public imagination," says Ross Benson, author of "Charles: The Untold 
Story," "he came to be regarded as arrogant and out of touch, a remote figure 
who speaks to his plants and treats his lonely, lovely wife with icy contempt." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, adds: "As his 
admirer, I think his heart is in the right place. But I think he must avoid 
being represented as a boring crusader." 
</P>
<P>
 In his younger years, Charles was billed as an "action man," because of his 
intense devotion to activities such as parachute jumping and flying a 
helicopter. But polo, off-trail skiing and fox-hunting were not your average 
Briton's pastimes. And as he grew older, he seemed to become accident-prone, 
breaking an arm at polo and nearly being killed in an Alpine avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
 What by all accounts has truly bugged Charles, however, was being upstaged by 
his glamorous wife. Unlike the late President John F. Kennedy, Charles did not 
delight in showing off his captivating spouse. In fact, he actively resented 
her popularity -- crowds often ignored him as they sought to get close to her. 
The prince was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Diana was not above upstaging her royal husband. She knew all 
the right photo angles and the tricks to get herself into the papers. Used to 
being the center of attention all his life, Charles resented her fame. And just 
as he was often chilly and ill-at-ease in pressing the flesh, she was outgoing 
and warm. A picture of Charles cutting a ribbon at a factory would be 
accompanied by a picture of Diana cradling a sick child. A speech by Charles on 
inner-city business opportunities was pushed aside by Diana's comments on AIDS. 
As author Anthony Holden says, "He keeps banging on about the environment while 
she visits hospitals and talks to lepers." 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear that the marriage was in trouble, and that Diana was 
stealing Charles' thunder, the palace courtiers stonewalled, insisting that the 
monarchy represented the best of everything. Meanwhile, Charles began heeding 
the instruction his father reportedly gave him shortly after the wedding: Give 
the marriage five years, then if it was not working out, look elsewhere. 
Charles did so. As one familiar with the royal family explained, "All the 
princes of Wales played around. So, he thought, why shouldn't he?"  
</P>
<P>
 The defining image of the Wales' marriage was a photograph taken during their 
joint trip to India in February, 1992: the princess, sitting alone on a bench 
gazing wistfully at that splendid Mogul temple to love, the Taj Mahal. Charles 
had remained in Delhi to speak to a group of industrialists.

 Inevitably, Charles turned to former flame Camilla Parker-Bowles, and she 
became an unofficial hostess at his country estate while Diana remained in 
London at their apartment in Kensington Palace. Friends and courtiers chose 
sides. Diana was furious that the queen continued to entertain the 
Parker-Bowleses in her box at Ascot and Windsor for horsy events. And palace 
sources, loyal to the family, began painting Diana as a spoiled, temperamental 
prima donna with no sense of responsibility -- given to frequent rages when she 
didn't get her way. Charles, friends told Ross Benson, realized he had made his 
"worst mistake" in marrying Diana. At one point he reportedly told his mother: 
"Don't you realize, she's mad. She's mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana's friends encouraged author Andrew Morton to tell the princess' side of 
the case, which he did in his best-selling book, "Diana: Her True Story." It 
describes her frustrations and her illness with bulimia and claims she made 
halfhearted suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The book tore it with the family. The senior royals and their courtiers viewed 
what they considered Diana's collaboration as rank disloyalty. They realized 
they were dealing with a princess who had no intention of knuckling under to 
their orders and instructions. Things were heading toward crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Diana-versus-Charles theme was rivaled by the collapse 
of the marriage of his brother, Andrew, the Duke of York, and the duchess, 
Sarah Ferguson, better known as Fergie. As a bachelor naval officer, "Randy 
Andy" had enjoyed rough sailor humor and nights on the town. But as a husband, 
he turned to golf and TV and couch-potato takeaway suppers. His wife, in turn, 
spent much time on vacations during his absences, most of them underwritten by 
American millionaires. She finally compromised herself with a couple of Texas 
jet-setters, Steve Wyatt and John Bryan, which led to a royal separation in the 
summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown of the Yorks' marriage -- precipitated by pictures of topless 
Fergie, her toes being sucked by John Bryan poolside in St. Tropez -- dispelled 
the notion that the Windsors were one big happy royal family. As London Times 
writer Valerie Groves observed of the Windsors' marital track record: "Great 
weddings; shame about the marriages."  
</P>
<P>
 The queen, too, received a rude, royal awakening -- as usual, she was 
unprepared by her own dim courtiers -- when she found out her overtaxed 
subjects objected to one of the richest persons in the world not paying income 
tax. Then, when Windsor Castle was badly damaged by fire in November, 1992, a 
government minister quickly agreed to earmark $90 million in public funds to 
repair the structure. The offer was met by a hail of protest on the grounds the 
queen could afford to pay for renovations herself. Another columnist needled: 
"While the castle stands, it is theirs, but when it burns down, it is ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the queen gave in and began paying income tax, at the same rate as 
her subjects. And she is paying for almost all of Windsor's repair, since the 
public trust fund raised only a fraction of the renovation costs.  
</P>
<P>
 But the year held yet another scandal: the tapes of a telephone call between 
Diana and a young male friend, generally identified as James Gilbey, a 
well-connected used-car salesman, who referred to her by a pet name, "Squidgy." 
Diana begins by answering his question about her day, New Year's Eve, 1989, at 
Sandringham Castle: "I was very bad at lunch. And I nearly started blubbing. I 
just felt really sad and empty, and I thought: 'Bloody hell, after all I've 
done for this f- - -ing family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He calls her "darling" more than 50 times in the rambling dialogue. But the 
general context seems to be that of courtship confidants rather than lovers. 
The story was splashed by the tabloids as "Dianagate Tape of Love Reveals 
Marriage Misery" and "My Life Is Torture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Squidgy tapes were soon overtaken by the devastating Camillagate 
recording. (Who made the Dianagate and Camillagate tapes is a mystery, but 
there is widespread suspicion that they originated in General Communications' 
headquarters, a government office that monitors radio and telephone 
transmissions.) If Charles could have chosen one act, short of murder, to turn 
public opinion against him, it would have been this. All his attempts at good 
works were forgotten. As Anthony Holden put it: "No one listens to sermons 
about the rain forests by a man who is said to be two-timing the world's most 
popular woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible that he didn't have the courage to give up Camilla," comments 
one London insider with connections to the royal family, whose views were 
shared by many other women. "He thinks he's living 50 years ago, when the 
Prince of Wales could get away with mistresses. But not with Princess Diana. I 
think he's very, very wet, pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 A negative reaction was expressed by some of the Anglican clergy, since the 
British monarch is temporal head of the Church of England and defender of the 
faith. The sharpest response came from George Austin, archdeacon of York, who 
declared, "I fail to see how the church could tolerate somebody whose moral 
standards are of the kind his apparently are. . . . If his attitude to his vows 
was so cavalier, has he the right to be trusted?" 
</P>
<P>
 The adultery charges even managed to bring into the open the long-simmering 
relationship between the church and monarch. As commentators are fond of 
noting, the Church of England had its genesis when King Henry VIII decided to 
divorce and remarry but was refused by the Roman Catholic Pope in Rome. Many 
officials believe the Church of England should no longer be the established 
church, since only about 2% of the British population are regular Anglican 
churchgoers. Poll after poll showed that the esteem of the royal family was 
falling drastically; people were questioning the future of the monarchy in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the queen in November, 1992, described the preceding 10 months as an 
" annus horribilis ," a horrible year. She was promptly criticized in the 
popular press for using Latin rather than the good old Queen's English. 
</P>
<P>
 AS HE ATTEMPTS TO BECOME a kinder, gentler prince, Charles must make several 
concrete decisions as well. Charles and Diana can petition for divorce like any 
other British subjects, but a divorced prince may not be allowed to ascend to 
the throne. If he wants to remarry, he would have to ask permission of the 
queen, who is supreme governor of a church that doesn't approve of divorce, for 
permission. Charles' remarriage, particularly to a divorced woman, would create 
a constitutional crisis, as was the case with Edward VIII, and he would 
probably have to renounce his right to the throne in favor of son William. 
Princess Diana could remarry without anyone's approval, but she would assume 
the rank of her next husband. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't divorce, "Charles could remain Prince of Wales for another 20 or 
25 years," says Holden. "Will he really want to spend all that time being 
subject to satire and criticism, becoming king at 70 for 10 years? Or step 
aside, return to Highgrove full time and marry the woman he loves?"  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Diana pursues a subplot in the royal soap opera. Currently she has 
cut back on public engagements, partly because, she has said, she needs to 
recover her privacy, but also, according to friends, because she doesn't want 
to be accused of upstaging Charles as he creates a new image. She is aware that 
she retains her popularity and hold over the British public in a way that 
Charles can't. She knows that many Britons agree with Tory MP Terry Dicks' 
view: "She would have made a far better queen than he will make a king." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana is also concentrating on raising her boys, 11-year-old William and 
Harry, 9, helping them to adjust to contemporary life despite living in the 
royal fishbowl. "One of the reasons she is leaving public life," says Ingrid 
Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, "is her concern over William. He's in a 
very sensitive, pre-adolescent growing period and has become much more 
introverted since the troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 More skeptical observers like Holden believe that once the Prince of Wales has 
had his year of new imagery, Diana will return to the public eye. "She can come 
back as mother of a future monarch," he says, "a cross between a magazine cover 
girl and Mother Teresa. This could be bad for him because everything she does 
makes him look absurd and eccentric. As if he still believes in the divine 
right of kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the one who captures the public's fancy with her real-life concerns. 
Diana is nobody's fool. She will continue to show the born royals the kind of 
royalty Britain wants, in a style they seem quite unable to master or even 
comprehend."  
</P>
<P>
 Charles' PR staff is hoping the new prince will fill that public desire before 
Diana makes her move. Charles and his aides are working on public appearances 
that will peak in July with the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince 
of Wales. The ceremonies will tie in with a BBC-TV documentary and an 
authorized biography, "The Waiting Years," both by Jonathan Dimbleby. These are 
expected to be flattering, depicting Charles as mature and purposeful, and will 
emphasize what his friends say is his "charming and witty private side," often 
lost from public view. The events are also intended to show that the monarchy, 
as a symbol of national continuity, is worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 How well the British public will warm to the orchestrated attempt to present 
the Prince of Wales in a more caring and coherent light remains to be seen. A 
recent BBC poll in Wales on the eve of Charles' visit showed that more than 
half of those polled thought the prince was not doing a good job -- nor would 
he make a good king. Perhaps more ominous for his spin doctors' hopes was a 
recent BBC feature pegged to his March visit to Wales.  
</P>
<P>
 Looking pained yet earnest, in response to a query on what was his goal, 
Charles rambled: "I think, more than anything else, what I'm trying to do is to 
encourage a more holistic approach to many of the issues which I think are 
important. I happen to feel that since the 1960s, a great deal of 
destructiveness has taken place in terms of throwing the baby out with the 
bathwater, in many of the things that matter, certainly to me and I think to an 
awful lot of other people. All I want to do is put the baby back, which got 
chucked out in the process. Which is one of the reasons why, for instance, I 
started my institute of architecture. Why I took an interest in architectural 
matters. Because again, I think it needs again a more holistic approach. Same 
thing with agriculture. I believe that a great deal needs to be done there to 
create a more holistic approach. Same with medicine. So I believe that all 
these things are part of my particular approach to trying to bring the baby 
back with the bathwater having chucked the bathwater out."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the TV program was a disaster," says the Daily Mail's Richard Kay. 
"And people at Buckingham Palace agree with me. He's not a natural TV 
performer. He came across badly. He went off on a tangent, and many in the 
audience didn't know what he was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Social historian David Cannadine may have pinned down Charles' essential 
problem and therefore that of his handlers. "The difficulty with the 
20th-Century British monarchy," he says, "is that it's more about 'being' than 
'doing,' and every now and then someone has come along who wants to do things 
rather than just be -- and that's obviously true of Charles. On the whole, 
people don't want British royals to do things, they just want them to be 
things, and the more Charles wants to do things the less likely he is to 
succeed, and the less likely people are to like him. The tragedy for him is 
that the harder he tries to do the job the way he understands it, the less 
public appreciation he's getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But in the April interview with Hattersley, after all the 
embarrassing phone taps, loony ramblings and adulterous exposes, Charles shared 
this view of royalty: "The people want an institution that can be looked up to. 
If you become like everybody else, what is the purpose of having a 
monarchy?"CHARLES (

ATTENDANCE AT CINCO DE MAYO FESTIVAL DAMPENED BY RAIN, NEW FEES; OXNARD: 
ORGANIZERS BLAME NEW SITE, ADMISSION FEES AND LATE-AFTERNOON RAINFALL FOR DROP 
IN ATTENDANCE.

<P>
 Hundreds of spectators meandered through College Park in Oxnard on Saturday 
amid the blare of mariachi music and the eager calls of churro vendors for the 
eighth annual Cinco de Mayo Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the brassy sound of trumpets and the rapid, colorful twirl of 
dancers' skirts served as a reminder of the victory their ancestors claimed 
more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really appreciate the battles that our forefathers fought and to this 
day we're still celebrating," said Mena Rios, vice president of the Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a freedom-loving nation," Rios said. "We have always celebrated the 
victories because they were won with so much struggle and without the help of 
any other nation. We treasure that freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo is one of the most important dates in Mexican history, 
commemorating the Battle of Puebla, where about 2,000 men held off the invading 
French army in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest celebrations of Latino culture in Ventura County, this 
year's festival was moved from Plaza Park in downtown Oxnard to College Park, 
near Oxnard College, to accommodate the event's growing crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move and a new admission fee may have deterred some people from 
attending this year's festival, vendors and event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission was $3 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and the disabled, and free 
for children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police officers and event organizers estimated that about 3,000 to 
5,000 people attended the first weekend day of this year's event. About 20,000 
people attended the two-day festival last year, chamber Treasurer John Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the organization had to charge admission to pay for the use of 
the park. "We've got a fee charged by the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the move and threatening clouds, Johnson said he was uncertain if the 
festival would attract the thousands of people who packed B Street in downtown 
Oxnard last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The festival enjoyed partly sunny skies until about 5 p.m., when dark clouds 
began dropping small amounts of rain, sending some people home before the 
evening's musical performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the jaripeo, a trick riding and roping show, delayed their 4 
p.m. performance because of poor attendance and said they might cancel because 
of the rain. The jaripeo is scheduled for 3 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, while chopping lettuce for tacos and tostadas in the 
cramped quarters of their food booth, Lucia Chavez and Maria Cuevas of Oxnard 
shared why Cinco de Mayo is an important holiday for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tradition every year," Cuevas added, gesturing to the ice cream stands 
and carnival games. "The music, the food, the rides." 
</P>
<P>
 "No diet today!" Chavez said with a laugh. "There's all different kinds of 
people (and) the children learn about our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby booth where a giant Mexican flag waved slowly in the breeze, 
Estella Lopez unpacked her custom-designed T-shirts from a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've created a line of clothes geared toward the Latino community," she 
said, folding a white shirt with an Aztec symbol on the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Rodney Saavedra, who travels with his churro and ice cream 
carts to various weekend festivals, admired Lopez's creations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them are peace shirts," he said. "They say, 'Chicanos don't fight -- 
unite.' They send out a positive message." 
</P>
<P>
 Saavedra, a 23-year-old Cal State Northridge student, has sold his sweets at 
Oxnard's Cinco de Mayo Festival for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings out the whole community, that's what I like about it," he said, 
adding that the move to College Park and the fee may have kept some people 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you didn't have to pay," he said. "You could stop and hang around. It 
was like a block party." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard resident Frank Cuevas said he was not deterred by the $3 admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind paying as long as my kids have fun and it's safe," he said, 
watching his two 3-year-old daughters spin past on the carousel. "Here there's 
a lot more room to do everything."  
</P>
<P>
 One of the festival's highlights Saturday was a performance of Mexican dances 
by Ballet Folklorico, a group of Hueneme High School students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's better than I've seen in Mexico," said Oxnard resident Jan Cooper, 
watching the girls and boys twirl and stomp on a temporary stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something from my culture and something I enjoy," said 17-year-old Norma 
Juaregui, one of 12 dancers who performed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do different dances, some from El Norte and another from Jalisco and 
Veracruz," she said. "Every time we learn a new dance, we learn a new culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Reyes, the group's instructor, tries to teach her students about the 
traditions of Mexico through dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them this (dance) is from Chihuahua, one of the most important states 
during the revolution," she said, gesturing to a dance the youths were 
performing at that moment. "I have to tell them of these things . . . I think 
we need to talk more about our customs and our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cinco de Mayo performances are the students' way of educating people about 
their heritage and participating in an important cultural holiday, Norma said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one day that we don't forget," she said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Cinco de Mayo festival continues today from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. at College 
Park in Oxnard. Entertainment includes the musical group Nuestro performing 
Latin jazz and salsa at 4:30 p.m., and singer Yolanda del Rio at 7 p.m. The 
jaripeo, which costs $15, will be at 3 p.m.

POLICE FAIR IN VENTURA ATTRACTS BIG CROWD; PUBLIC SAFETY: ABOUT 8,000 ATTEND 
ANNUAL BLOCK PARTY. HUNDREDS OF YOUNGSTERS CRAWL INTO EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND 
ACT OUT FANTASIES.

<P>
 Matthew Lasserre was in a world of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old Oxnard boy sat behind the wheel of a patrol car, jabbering on 
the hand radio. He fiddled with the flashing lights, played with the hand-held 
spotlight and swiveled his head, looking for bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Elissa Lasserre, watched her son fondly as he played police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a typical boy," Lasserre said. "He loves fire engines and police cars." 
</P>
<P>
 A second later, Lasserre broke into the tyke's daydreams when she saw him 
patting the locked shotgun attached to the dashboard. "Matthew, don't touch 
anything but the wheel!" 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew frowned at his mom for blowing his macho image but took his pudgy 
fingers off the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the numerous exhibits on display at the Ventura Police Department's block 
party Saturday, the patrol cars, motorcycles and fire engines were the biggest 
hits. Hundreds of youngsters such as Matthew crawled into the emergency 
vehicles and acted out fantasies while their parents looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event, which is geared toward educating residents on public safety 
issues, drew about 8,000 people, police said. With dozens of community groups 
and commercial businesses represented in nearly 200 booths, the event turned 
into a five-block street fair near police headquarters, laced with dozens of 
uniformed officers who mingled with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our one chance to really show off," said Lt. Steve Bowman, who helped 
organize the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual blowout, first held three years ago, has evolved into a major 
public relations event for the 120-member department. This year's attendance 
was the highest ever, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring law enforcement agencies and fire departments also turned out to 
promote their agencies. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department was there with 
its search and rescue helicopter, the Ventura Fire Department showed up with 
fire engines and the California Highway Patrol arrived with motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Private alarm companies, martial arts schools and other safety-oriented 
businesses also came to the daylong block party to drum up customers. About 200 
people signed up for classes on using pepper spray, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fantastic avenue for us," said Curt Waite, an instructor at the 
Reseda-based Evans Training Institute, which teaches civilians how to use 
pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Zandy Prosser, who lives in the Ventura Avenue area, complained that her 
neighborhood is chock-full of crime and eagerly signed up for the $39 pepper 
spray classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough there, and it doesn't hurt to be prepared," Prosser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers spent the day explaining their jobs to people, and in some 
instances giving demonstrations. They gave tips to residents on how to better 
secure their homes and businesses, and police dogs put on several shows to 
demonstrate how a trained canine can detect drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman got into the spirit of things by volunteering to be sprayed with 
pepper. With a huge crowd looking on, he received a faceful of the burning 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporarily blinded, he had to be led off the stage, and afterward immersed 
his face in wet towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mike Tracy, a 27-year police veteran, nearly lost his handcuffs while he 
was chatting with some children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy gave his handcuffs to a young boy who asked to see them, but the boy 
disappeared when Tracy turned to talk to other children. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, Tracy realized that child and cuffs were both gone. "What did 
he do with my handcuffs?" he asked in dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 After frantically searching the front seat of the patrol car where the boy was 
playing, Tracy heaved a sigh of relief when he found the silvery bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite forecasts of rain, the weather cooperated by being sunny and warm, 
much to the relief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of a staff meeting yesterday, we had a prayer meeting," joked Police 
Chief Richard Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there were minor glitches throughout the day (the public address 
system broke down during the opening ceremonies), but nothing major arose to 
dampen the party. Patrol operations elsewhere in Ventura were not affected by 
the event, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like this are great to put them at ease with police officers," said 
Robert Ramirez, who brought his 2- and 3-year-old sons to the event. "Now 
they'll know if they see a police officer, he's there to help."

COUNTY GETS $4.3 MILLION FOR CRISIS COUNSELING; MENTAL HEALTH: OFFICIALS ARE 
FILLING 100 SLOTS FOR WORKERS TO TREAT RESIDENTS WITH POST-QUAKE TRAUMA. 
CRITICS CALL FEDERAL GRANT EXCESSIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Was Chad Hubbard, the 14-year-old Simi Valley boy killed in a schoolyard 
stabbing, really a casualty of earthquake-related trauma? 
</P>
<P>
 Do as many as 39,000 Ventura County residents, one-third of them children, 
really need crisis counseling to heal the psychic wounds of the Jan. 17 
disaster? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Ventura County Mental Health Services asserts in a grant proposal 
that won the county $4.3 million in federal funds over the next nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 With verbal assurances that the money is coming from FEMA, mental health 
officials have already begun filling the 100 social worker slots needed for the 
program. Tuesday they will ask the county Board of Supervisors to lease a 
Ventura building for the additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, people are having problems," said Randall Feltman, 
director of Ventura County's mental health services. "Frankly, unless it's 
happening to you, it doesn't matter. Everybody understands rebuilding your 
house. Not everyone understands this." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many residents and city officials are baffled by the grant to keep 
crisis counseling going long after the actual crisis has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's excessive," said Roger Campbell, a Fillmore city councilman who 
lost his home in the quake. "I think it's money that could be better used in 
the community," rebuilding homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said he could excuse some exaggeration on the 
grant proposal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "When you're putting 
together grants, you try to be creative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was surprised that the federal agency was willing to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little shocked at $4.3 million," Stratton said, "especially when what 
I've gotten from people is that FEMA is being extraordinarily stingy in giving 
people checks for actual damage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of them would rather have the money (than counseling). Give me a 
check for $10,000, and I'll go away happy." 
</P>
<P>
 That, mental health experts say, is a short-sighted approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, a tragedy has hit their lives and shaken them up 
emotionally," said Bob Benedetto, director of the county's earthquake 
counseling program. "If we don't get to that, the money isn't going to do them 
that much good." 
</P>
<P>
 The pent-up stress eventually erupts in other ways: marital strife, bad 
behavior by children, health problems, even violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chad Hubbard stabbing, officials say, is a prime example of a case where 
existing tensions escalated in the days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad, an eighth-grader at Valley View Junior High School, was stabbed by a 
classmate Feb. 1 after an ongoing feud grew violent. Phillip Hernandez was 
found guilty last week of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campus was in turmoil because of the earthquake," Feltman said. "The 
whole campus was agitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Feltman's department used the schoolyard slaying and the suicide of a Simi 
Valley businessman, who lost his business to the quake, in a formula FEMA uses 
to measure the need for mental health funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of adding two deaths to the calculations -- which included 868 
injuries, 559 destroyed homes and 4,700 damaged houses -- was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more significant was the county's assessment of residents needing mental 
health counseling. Consider the formula used for schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health officials calculated that 90% of all students in Simi Valley, 
Fillmore and Piru were affected by the quake and that half of all those would 
need psychological services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one quarter of the affected students in Moorpark and Thousand 
Oaks were expected to need counseling, according to the grant. That totaled 
13,026 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems really high," acknowledged Jennifer Elson, who is directing the 
county's earthquake counseling for children. "I can tell you that we have not 
seen 13,000 students." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Elson said she can use every one of the 12 full-time social worker 
positions and contract agencies that the grant provides for Ventura's youth 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's not enough," Elson said. "This type of a natural disaster, it 
triggers other issues that (the children) haven't dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 One child became obsessed about a heart attack her father had a year ago. 
Others have brought up child abuse and other aspects of family discord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not seen one family that was like the Brady Bunch before the 
earthquake," Elson said. "This earthquake has really crumbled families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you, the families that call us are in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 One mother called to say her son was threatening to shoot himself because he 
couldn't sleep. Some teen-agers have regressed to sucking their thumbs. Model 
students have turned into discipline problems in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call from a mother whose kid got kicked out of day care," Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the problems in schools, mental health officials estimate that 1,000 
older adults, 8,646 farm laborers and Spanish-speaking residents, 4,600 
unemployed workers and as many as 12,000 mentally ill residents could all be in 
need of crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "To you, it may seem to be exaggerated," Feltman said. "It may be that we 
don't fully appreciate how many people are impaired." 
</P>
<P>
 His grant proposal estimates that 250,000 county residents were somehow 
affected by the quake and that as many as 39,000 may need counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 But the county and private agencies have had a mental health program operating 
since the day of the quake and have seen about 4,600 people. Only about half of 
those actually went through counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so long after the fact, I think a lot of the people have gotten over 
it and moved on," said Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell. "The emotional 
stress that I'm under is for financial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feltman argued that the investment in mental health has been relatively 
small, compared to rebuilding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first four months since the quake, FEMA has devoted $2 million in 
Ventura County and a total of $12.7 million across the region for crisis 
counseling, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the federal agency has put $773.3 million into temporary housing 
assistance on a regional basis. In addition, the Small Business Administration 
has provided $1.4 billion in loans to business owners. Ventura figures were not 
available. Still, many residents are not getting the help they need fast 
enough, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled one family now living in a trailer where their house used to sit. 
A Fillmore businessman, who lost his business to the quake, now risks losing 
his car and house to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the sort of person who shouldn't fall through the cracks," Campbell 
said. The poorest residents, he said, are covered by other social programs. 
"But the average guys, who go to work nine to 10 hours a day, they're hurting." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who lost his own home in the earthquake, said the counseling money 
could be better spent helping people rebuild the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Santangelo of Simi Valley agreed with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're talking about is a waste of time and money," said Santangelo, 
66, who lives in the Friendly Village mobile home park. "They should give it to 
the people to fix up their houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Santangelo considers himself something of an expert. He and and his wife were 
living in southern Florida when Hurricane Andrew struck. After losing two homes 
and two restaurants in the devastating storm, they decided to retire in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after they bought a mobile home in Simi Valley, the Jan. 17 
earthquake shook their new home to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Santangelo says he doesn't need counseling. He needs specially designed 
earthquake braces to secure his trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Alberta, isn't so sure. She recalls how she began having problems 
with high blood pressure and anxiety after the Florida disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wake up, and I feel that uneasiness, that pressure," she said. 
"But I don't know what someone could tell me that could change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedetto said many of the residents who most need counseling are resistant to 
the idea. Right now, he has teams of social workers spreading out through the 
affected communities, knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be intrusive. We don't want to force anything on anybody," 
he said. "A lot of people are just delighted to have us there . . . if you give 
them a chance to talk about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-month grant provides about 100 full-time slots, many of which could 
be filled with part-time workers. In addition, $1 million of the grant will go 
for contracts with private agencies already helping with mental health 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 About 44 full-time social worker positions will focus on adults, mostly in 
Fillmore and Simi Valley. Efforts to reach farm workers and Spanish-speaking 
residents will be supplemented by Catholic Charities and Clinicas del Camino 
Real Inc., a chain of health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 12 full-time positions would go toward serving schoolchildren. Elson 
said she intends to station a crisis counselor at every Simi Valley school that 
requests one. Fillmore has focused efforts on two sites. In addition, the 
county will contract with two private groups: Child Abuse and Neglect Inc. and 
Interface Children, Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also pays for crisis counselors at mobile home parks and senior 
citizen centers. The grant allots 20 full-time positions to serve the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna Day, 77, of Simi Valley, said she does not expect to use the counseling 
services. Nor has she asked FEMA to repair her trailer in Friendly Village 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is glad to hear about the new grant for earthquake counseling. After 
all, she said, she is still haunted by the quake that left her pinned in her 
bed beneath her heavy wooden furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not at all at ease," she says. "You go to bed at night and you feel your 
bed is rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if everybody answers real honestly, none of us is the same."

PORTUGUESE DESCENDANTS FACE HURDLES; TRADITIONS: OFFSPRING OF EARLY SETTLERS 
ACROSS VENTURA COUNTY FIND THAT HARD WORK ALONE IS NO LONGER THE KEY TO 
PROSPERING HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was 5:30 a.m. and the cries of a young woman kicking, swearing and weeping 
as she tried to start an old tractor could be heard from far away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 acres needed to be plowed. And, after that, the woman still had 
to do the laundry, cook dinner and pick up her five children from school. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1930 and the woman was a 34-year-old widow, Filomena Oliveira, a 
Portuguese immigrant who came to Ventura County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she died in 1989 she owned more than 60 acres in Ventura County, 
part of which has been named after her: the Oliveira Plaza in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliveira was one of the hundreds of Portuguese immigrants who came to Ventura 
County at the turn of the century, poor and uneducated. They worked as farm 
laborers and housekeepers, and many went on to later become successful 
landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of today's Portuguese immigrants are less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 They find that the land of opportunity that allowed Oliveira and her 
contemporaries of the early 20th Century to prosper now requires much more than 
hard work. To get ahead in the California of the 1990s, the immigrants say they 
find they need proficiency in English, advanced education and a bankroll behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliveira paid $9,000 for 30 acres near the ocean in Port Hueneme. She got a 
loan from the Bank of A. Levy on a handshake and good faith on her character. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, even a single lot in the Oliveira Plaza would cost at least several 
hundred thousand dollars. And banks do not lend money without collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio A. Medeiros, 68, who has lived in Ventura County for 34 years and 
worked 14 hours a day to save enough to buy his own home in east Ventura, knows 
about the struggles of recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He longs to visit the country of his birth, but that dream fades with each 
passing year. Raising six children never allowed him that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a tough life," said Medeiros, who arrived in Ventura in 1960 and 
worked full-time as an auto-body repairman for nearly 23 years in an auto shop 
in Ventura while doing all types of part-time work on the side. "If time 
allows, I will go back one day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a quiet weekday morning, in the Knights of Columbus clubhouse in downtown 
Ventura, Medeiros spoke proudly of his affiliation with the Catholic men's 
organization that gives him the sense of fellowship he left in his native 
community so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working here (at the Knights of Columbus) has given meaning to my life," said 
Medeiros, who has been a member and worked part time for the Knights of 
Columbus since 1964. "It would have been like this if I were part of the 
Cavalheiros de Columbus (Knights of Columbus) in Portugal." 
</P>
<P>
 As he displayed pictures from a thick brown scrapbook, Medeiros slipped in and 
out of English and Portuguese, sometimes pausing to search for words in his 
native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he said in a melancholy tone, "sometimes I feel as if I have never 
learned English and I have forgotten Portuguese." 
</P>
<P>
 Half in Portuguese, half in English, he said, "I am the manager of the 
clubhouse." He then stopped, his light blue eyes staring ahead, his gestures 
frozen in mid-word as he tried to remember how to say manager in Portuguese. 
"Manager? Chefe? Diretor? " 
</P>
<P>
 The stories of Oliveira and Medeiros reflect the hardship in the lives of 
Portuguese immigrants in Ventura County and the disparity over what two 
different generations can achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portuguese began arriving in Ventura County in the late 1800s. Young men 
and women, mostly from the Azores -- a group of six volcanic islands in the 
mid-Atlantic that were discovered and colonized by Portugal in the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrants came in search of wealth and opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men hopped on whaling ships, both to seek adventure and to avoid 
mandatory service in the Portuguese army. Some of the women followed relatives, 
seeking better lives for themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some settled first in New Bedford, Mass., a seaport city that became a 
jumping-off point for fortune-seekers, including the Portuguese. The California 
Gold Rush lured many of them west, and some came eventually to Ventura County, 
a land that reminded them of the home they had left behind, because of its 
mountains, beaches and warm, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
 As they arrived, they began to work as farm laborers or maids. They saved 
money and soon they owned land throughout the county, including properties on 
Ventura's beaches, the hills of Camarillo and Moorpark and the plains of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those earlier hard-working immigrants were Manuel da Terra Faria and 
Manuel Silva, who have become legends among the county's Portuguese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Portuguese settlers, Faria left the Azores at age 20. He first 
lived with relatives in Massachusetts, then came to Ventura County in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought with him an old leather trunk, cash to last a few days and a heart 
filled with dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, while taking a stroll on a stretch of oceanfront land, north of 
Ventura, Faria daydreamed that one day he would own that land, which reminded 
him so much of his home in the Azores.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years later his dream came true. He bought his first piece of land, that 
later came to bear his name, Faria Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Silva was another settler who came to Ventura in 1920. He worked hard, 
and in 1935, after borrowing money from the Bank of A. Levy, he bought 122 
acres on the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he died in 1975, Silva owned more than 900 acres in Ventura, 
Merced and Stanislaus counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of my parents," said Silva's only daughter, Mary Silva 
Gallagher, 60. "They did not have much education, but they were bright and very 
hard-working people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said that while her mother, Amalia Silva, was never directly 
involved in the family's businesses, she played a major role in its success 
because of her industrious personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she was more aggressive than my dad," said Gallagher, who lives in 
east Ventura. "She used to say that she never wanted to marry in the Azores 
because she did not want to work that hard," said Gallagher, who administers 
the family's remaining land. "But the funny part is that she was a very 
hard-working person." 
</P>
<P>
 Among many other early immigrant Portuguese women in Ventura County were 
settlers such as Laura Cananas Pallerino, whose life story is recorded in an 
oral history at the Ventura County Museum of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
 Pallerino, the oldest of two children, became the family's driver at age 12. 
According to her nephew, Robert Bianchi, 67, who lives in Ventura, Pallerino's 
parents were afraid to drive. So young Pallerino became the family's chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Pallerino was a handywoman on the family rancho in Moorpark. In her oral 
history in the county's museum, Pallerino said, "I worked plenty. I done 
everything that a man has ever done in a field: I cut beans and hoed weeds. I 
raked beans. I worked the thrashing machine and I sewed sacks -- I done 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, as the Portuguese community's wealth blossomed, so did its 
culture. Its members formed a close-knit and low-key community, deeply rooted 
in their home traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least 40 consecutive years, the community celebrated a Portuguese 
festival in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The festas , as the festivals were known, were part of a Catholic tradition 
that dated back to 1296 when Queen Isabel of Portugal was said to have invited 
the poorest man in town to a great feast in honor of the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the celebrations they had back home, Ventura County Portuguese carried 
that tradition from 1924 to 1964. During the four-day celebration, from Friday 
evening to Monday afternoon, people ate Portuguese food, danced to Portuguese 
music and attended a special Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Schiffer of the county's Museum of History and Art, who has extensively 
researched the Portuguese in Ventura County, said the festas were the year's 
most significant celebration for the Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Portuguese were a hard-working people," Schiffer said. "They would work 
seven days a week, the whole year, until the festas . That was their way of 
rewarding themselves for their hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 The festas were so important to the Portuguese that in 1929, Antone Baptiste, 
a Portuguese immigrant, built a club at Bradley Road in Oxnard. The club, which 
came to be known as the Portuguese Hall, was used for the festas . 
</P>
<P>
 But as time went by, enthusiasm for the festas began to wane. By the 1940s, 
people had to pay a fee to participate. In 1964, because of a lack of interest, 
the Portuguese had their last celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young people just didn't have the interest that the old-timers did," said 
Cecilia Nunes, 64, who was a secretary for the Portuguese Hall. "Some people 
were disappointed about it, but not enough to continue the festas ." 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time -- during the late 1960s and '70s -- many Portuguese 
immigrants and their descendants began to move away from Ventura County. Most 
of them went to San Luis Obispo County, where they still have a strong and 
active Portuguese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffer said he believes the low cost of land in Central California enticed 
many Portuguese who were farmers and dairymen to move from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dairy business from all over Southern California moved to the Central 
Valley," Schiffer said. "It is very likely that many moved away as the price of 
land in Ventura increased." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ventura's Portuguese community is only a shadow of what it used to be. 
Schiffer said it is no longer the close-knit community it once was. And the 
gatherings, which once were often, are now rare. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to recapture glimpses of the county's old Portuguese community, 
the county's Museum of History and Art opened a photo exhibit in March that 
ends today. The museum also sponsored a Portuguese celebration last month, 
featuring Portuguese food, music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first Portuguese festival in Ventura that I can remember," said 
Henriette Baptiste Edwards, 40, a fourth-generation Portuguese American. 
</P>
<P>
 On the museum's open-air patio, a group of dancers who had come from Santa 
Maria for the occasion executed the steps of Chamaritas, a traditional 
Portuguese dance. 
</P>
<P>
 From a chair in the audience of about 200, Edwards who is the 
great-grand-daughter of the Antone Baptiste who built the Portuguese Hall, 
watched the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Portuguese descendants celebrated the past, there were others at the 
celebration who had just become aware of Ventura County's Portuguese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea that there was a Portuguese community in Ventura," said Gail 
Walker, a Ventura resident for six years. "I just popped in and was taken by 
surprise. I did not expect this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Markley, 75, said even though he has been married for 54 years to a 
second-generation Portuguese American, he was surprised with the number of 
Portuguese descendants in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not know there were so many Portuguese people around here," said 
Markley, who has lived in Ojai for 25 years. "Where do they come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 They come from all over the county, but mainly from Camarillo, Moorpark, Ojai, 
Oxnard and Ventura. According to the U. S. Census, 1,130 county residents have 
parents who both have Portuguese ancestry. Of those, 216 speak Portuguese at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the festas are no longer celebrated in Ventura County and many 
Portuguese have either moved north, died or blended into the mainstream 
culture, there is still a small group that gathers every month trying to 
maintain the Portuguese heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Portuguese Protective Union of the State of California (UPPEC) 
have been meeting every month since 1939, when the Ventura County chapter was 
founded in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Corella, 63, and a member of the club for 31 years, said it has been the 
group's willingness to stick together that has kept the lodge going.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the lodge, the only time we would see each other would be 
in weddings and funerals," Corella said. "It has held us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Corella is one of nearly 30 women in Ventura County who are still members of 
the club. Besides providing its members with socializing opportunities, the 
lodge's main purpose is to provide its members with life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The lodge was created in response to a custom in which the Portuguese 
immigrants would help each other, said Barbara L. Fraga, a spokeswoman for 
UPPEC's state office. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when a woman was widowed and unable to pay for her husband's 
funeral, the community would get together and help. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, UPPEC was created. Its members would pay a small fee and be entitled to 
life insurance. UPPEC still exists today and has more than 9,000 members 
statewide, Fraga said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Ventura County members of UPPEC grow older, they have little hope 
that the new generations will continue their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Corella, who has enrolled her three grandchildren in the lodge, said the lodge 
nearly dissolved five years ago because no one wanted to take a position of 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then people realized how important it was for us as a community," Corella 
said. "So we continue having the meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 But like many other members of Ventura County's UPPEC, Corella said she does 
not expect the lodge to continue to be active for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cultural interest has died with time," Corella said. "Besides, things 
have changed, people now have television and the movies to entertain 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Change is what the descendants of the early immigrants have come to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 During the four years before her death in 1989, Filomena Oliveira fought hard 
to keep her land. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of negotiations, on April 26, 1988, Oliveira turned over the 
first shovel of dirt during a ground-breaking ceremony where plans to build the 
Mandalay Village Market Place were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the government and private investors vie to purchase the more than 274 
acres of oceanfront land that still belongs to the Faria family, Virginia Faria 
Baptiste, the oldest daughter of Manuel da Terra Faria, tries to accept change. 
</P>
<P>
 Baptiste sold about 51 acres to the state government in the early 1960s for a 
portion of the Ventura Freeway north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought, but it did not work," Baptiste said, looking over the freeway and 
the ocean from the hillside rancho that her father built. "You have to move on 
with progress. It is a waste of time to fight it."

AFTER-CLASS AMIGO; TUTOR OFFERS LATINO STUDENTS HELP, PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alberto Rios, 23, looks at his students and sees himself a few years ago. He 
sees Latino teen-agers struggling to stay in school and stay out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there," he said, "struggling with the language, trying not to fall 
behind, and every day dipping into American culture at school and then Mexican 
culture at home, but never being a part of either one." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios directs Moorpark Pride, a new after-school tutoring program developed by 
El Concilio del Condado de Ventura -- a nonprofit social services agency -- and 
paid for by the city of Moorpark and the Moorpark school district. 
</P>
<P>
 While the school district already has bilingual education, as well as special 
classes for migrant students, Moorpark Pride provides a place for students to 
get help outside school. School officials estimate that about 10% of the high 
school students in Moorpark are native Spanish speakers struggling with 
English. Rios "is a perfect role model for them," said Vishna Herrity, director 
of the school district's bilingual and migrant education programs. "He's been 
through the education system here. He's close to them in age and he knows about 
their concerns. He's an excellent model -- a product of the same environment. 
He went to college and now he's giving back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Moorpark High, Rios returns several times a week to his alma 
mater, trying to persuade students who are struggling in school to come to him 
for help. Of the more than 150 students there who might benefit from the 
program, only about 20 periodically come to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are you going to ask for help on your homework when your parents don't 
speak English?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Castro, 15, looks to Rios for help. Every day he rides his bicycle to the 
activity room at the old building where Moorpark High School was once housed. 
There, Rios has set up tables for students. Jose struggles over reading 
assignments, misunderstanding and mixing up English words he has heard or said 
only a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand this part about the chicken," he says in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not chicken, it's kitchen, " says a smiling Carmen Gutierrez, 17, who 
works for Rios. 
</P>
<P>
 Little problems like Jose Castro's constantly hound struggling students, Rios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start falling behind, and then it snowballs," he said. "Eventually you 
just stop trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan De La Cruz, 15, was one of those who stopped trying. The burly high 
school freshman did not come to Rios for help -- he was ordered to. A petty 
vandal who was caught tagging school buildings and then driving a car without a 
license, Juan came in to dust and mop up the floor as part of his probation 
sentence. When he finished his time, he decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Alberto, and maybe I can learn something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios, who has endeavored since he began working on the project a month ago to 
get youngsters like Juan interested, points to the former graffiti artist in 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he's here, and he doesn't have to be, is a success," Rios said. 
"Now we just have to get him to bring his books." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Juan arrived with his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dumb, but I get Ds -- except once I got a B in art class," he said. 
"I guess I'm lazy, but once you get behind it's hard to catch up, and I can't 
ask my parents for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios said he had the same problems when he went to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Third youngest in a family of nine that emigrated from Mexico in 1980, Rios 
was the only one in his family who spoke English when he was in high school. He 
said he didn't always know where to turn when he had questions. Sometimes he 
had to pester teachers after school to get the extra help he needed on 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he excelled and went from struggling with the language in his junior 
year to making a speech about following his dreams at his graduation in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I submitted my speech to a contest," he said. "You know, most minorities 
aren't noticed, and I felt like someone needed to make themself known. I wanted 
people to hear me and say, 'That's somebody who's going on to college, who's 
going to make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was his version of the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of my father's happiest moments," Rios said. "He had always 
wanted to see one of his children succeed like that." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Rios attended Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. He 
paid for school with grants and money from odd jobs. While majoring in 
international economics, he lived at home and worked alongside his father in 
the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final year at school, he began working for Supervisor Vicky Howard, 
looking at juvenile crime in Simi Valley and later organizing a youth 
conference at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to find people like that, who are able to work one on one with 
teens," said Howard. "He demonstrated a lot of leadership. He's a dedicated 
young man."  
</P>
<P>
 Rios graduated at the end of last year and was offered the Moorpark Pride job 
when another man quit after just a month. He said he considers it a rare 
opportunity, and plans to stay for at least two years before going to graduate 
school to study business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth the time," he said. "You end up learning more than you teach. I 
love the work, and I know it will eventually help me get into graduate school." 
</P>
<P>
 Striding through a lunchtime crowd at Moorpark High, Rios beams with 
confidence. He continually stops to greet students he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 " Orale !" he says to a guy in black baggy pants and white T-shirt. "When are 
you coming by?"  
</P>
<P>
 The response was noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios said he knows he has a long way to go. Keeping even the small number of 
students who come to him for help is a difficult task. But he said he is sure 
that he will attract more students. He has already seen the numbers grow in 
just the few weeks he has been at work and he has received praise from local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Alberto is ideal for this because he's home-grown," said City 
Councilman Bernardo Perez. "He can relate to a lot of kids that are in the 
program. I think they see what diligence and perseverance get you." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios uses other young Latino high school and college students as tutors, and 
plans to break up the work with other activities, like dances. He wants the 
after-school tutoring to be as warm and non-threatening as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to work for Juan, who said he likes to hang out even after he has 
finished his homework. During a break in his studies, he takes some time 
sketching out the image of a mad jester in green magic marker across a white 
board. The students smile and nod when they read the graffiti-style script, 
"Minds Under Craze," that highlights the bizarre drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a script for the kind of pressure they all seem to know about. While Juan 
touches up his drawing, a woman with two toddlers in tow comes in to talk to 
Rios about her 16-year-old daughter. The woman is desperate. She says her 
daughter stays out most nights past 2 a.m., and she thinks the girl is using 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk to her," he tells the woman in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he tries to talk to the girl at the high school, but she tells him she 
doesn't need any help. It is sobering for Rios, but he takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we can't work miracles," he said. "But I don't think we have to. We 
just have to show them that we're here to help, and they'll come around. " 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has not given up on the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to have this place packed within the next two weeks," he said. 
"I've just started."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOUSE BLAZE CAUSES $105,000 IN DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A two-alarm fire caused an estimated $105,000 in damage to a Thousand Oaks 
home about noon Saturday, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began in the attic of the garage and spread into the west wing of the 
home, according to the spokeswoman, who said investigators had not discovered a 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Koenig, 25, who lives in the house with his mother, said he was heading 
home on a lunch break from his job as a car wash attendant when he was passed 
by firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this big plume of smoke and said, 'Wow it looks like something near my 
house is on fire,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived, firefighters were already pouring water on the blazing garage 
as the fire spread into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I commend (the firefighters) for doing a good job. They saved this half of 
the house," Koenig said, pointing to the undamaged east side of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters about 40 minutes to douse the blaze, the spokeswoman 
said. No one was injured, she said. SCOTT HADLY

VENTURA CITY HALL HEARS PLEA FOR A SOUND BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura resident Greg Seiler would like to invite friends over for a chat in 
his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all the noise from the cars and trucks rattling along California 126, 
which runs right behind his house on Lafayette Street, he says he can barely 
hear his own words, much less anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, Seiler and half a dozen of his neighbors trekked to City Hall 
to seek help in their 20-year struggle to get Caltrans to erect a sound wall 
behind their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our windows shake all night long," Seiler told sympathetic Ventura City 
Council members on the traffic and transportation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they have little power over state bureaucrats. "You 
need to keep the pressure on the state and make sure it happens," Councilman 
Jim Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures advised the frustrated homeowners to nag state 
Assembly and Senate members. "Election year is the best time to go after those 
politicians," she said. "You know how we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Minter, a Caltrans sound wall engineer, said that whatever Lafayette 
Street residents do, they will probably not see their sound wall until the year 
2000 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound wall, which would cost $1.3 million, has not been included in the 
statewide Caltrans budget that targets projects up to 1999. If the agency were 
to build the Lafayette Street sound wall in 2000, he said, that would be only 
if the city or the county were to donate up to one-third of the cost of the 
project.  
</P>
<P>
 "But really, who's to say six years from now what the situation will be?" he 
said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BUY OPTION ON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers planning to build a senior housing project in downtown Oxnard have 
agreed to purchase an option on the city-owned property while they apply for 
federal housing grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council, sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, agreed this week 
to sell to Broadway Towers Inc. an option on the 49,000-square-foot parcel it 
owns at 6th and Meta streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the option, sold for $6,220, is good only until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers plan to apply to the federal department of Housing and Urban 
Development for grant money available under its senior housing program before 
the option expires.

<P>
 Any sale of the lot, which housed a rundown motel before it was purchased by 
the Redevelopment Agency, would be contingent on Broadway Towers being awarded 
the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Macri-Ortiz, a staff attorney with Channel Counties Legal Services, 
said any affordable housing in Oxnard would be welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a project that is probably the most appropriate housing project for that 
site," she said. "But it remains to be seen whether the developer can get the 
funding to pull off the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The city "has a lot of making up to do" as far as providing affordable 
housing, Macri-Ortiz said. "They're very far behind, but I'm hopeful they're 
going to move in the right direction." JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA COUNTY; VICTIMS IN FATAL ACCIDENT IDENTIFIED

 California Highway Patrol investigators are blaming a head-on collision that 
killed two people and critically injured four others on the rain and the 
excessive speed of one of the drivers, a CHP spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Sandoval, 20, of Fillmore, was driving about 65 m.p.h. when he changed 
lanes on the rain-slick northbound Ventura Freeway about 3 p.m. Friday, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval's van veered into the center divider near Bates Road at the 
Ventura-Santa Barbara County line and hit a dirt berm before flying into the 
top of a convertible carrying three British tourists, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Jonathan Jenkins, 32, was killed and two passengers in the car, 
Giles Borrett, 31, and John Ley, 32, were seriously injured, said a spokeswoman 
at Santa Barbara's St. Francis Medical Center. Ley is listed in stable 
condition, while Borrett, who has serious head injuries, is listed in critical 
condition, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After striking the convertible, Sandoval's van spun head-on into a car driven 
by David Much, 33, of Newbury Park, instantly killing his passenger, Rae Hansen 
Fenzi, 31, of Santa Barbara, the Highway Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Much and Sandoval were taken to St. Francis Medical Center and were in 
stable condition Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP investigators said tests done on Sandoval showed that he was not under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs, and he has not been cited in the accident. SCOTT

 An Ojai car merchant has received conceptual approval from the Planning 
Commission to construct a larger dealership, to be bordered by a new city park, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronk Vreeland Ford, the city's only new-car dealership, will move about 50 
yards from its current location along Ojai Avenue to a three-acre parcel it 
will share with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently authorized a zone change for construction of the 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's final approval is expected to come in two weeks, after the 
commission considers lighting and other details, said Planning Director Bill 
Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a big improvement from what we have," dealership co-owner Dick 
Bronk said of the new facility, an octagonal wooden showroom adjacent to a 
long, rectangular service building. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; LAWMAKER MEETS WITH STUDENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell's (D-Carpinteria) visit to Montalvo School in 
Ventura Friday was prompted by a barrage of letters he received from Montalvo 
students concerned about bicycle helmets and television violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But his discussion with 200 third- through fifth-grade students in the school 
cafeteria quickly turned to topics of more pressing interest to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell asked the students if there are any laws they would like to see 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Mallory Bricker suggested that the state should require 
students to stay in school longer each day so they can learn more, a comment 
that was met with a burst of jeers and boos from her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you're not planning on running for class president," O'Connell told 
Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student suggested that the state shorten the school day to two hours. 
And one child said schoolchildren should not have to work any harder than state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you only have to work four days we should only have to go to 
school four days," 9-year-old Heather McNally said. MAIA DAVIS

POWER OF CITIZEN ACTION AGAINST CRIME STRESSED AT SYMPOSIUM; THOUSAND OAKS: 
RESIDENTS EAGERLY EXCHANGE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIRD-SAFEST CITY IN AMERICA 
SAFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blending cutting-edge computers and old-fashioned brainstorming in the city's 
first Crime Symposium, Thousand Oaks citizens said Saturday that volunteer 
crime-fighters can help make the third-safest city in America even safer. 
</P>
<P>
 People from Thousand Oaks' City Hall, schools, police force and tree-lined 
neighborhoods met at Westlake High School to explore ways of confronting crime 
in Thousand Oaks before it grows beyond their ability to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before breaking into study groups to focus on crime-fighting ideas, the 120 
symposium attendees heard police and civic leaders stress that the power to 
stop crime lies in the hands of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising youth violence and a rash of post-earthquake robberies along the 
Ventura Freeway have threatened the safety of Thousand Oaks, even though 1993 
FBI statistics ranked it America's third-safest city, said Chief Deputy Robert 
Brooks of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve percent of violent crime in Thousand Oaks is attributable to gangs," 
warned Brooks. "The age of offenders is dropping. They're becoming younger, and 
weapons are being used more often." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is assigning two new senior deputies to coordinate 
street patrols in problem areas in Thousand Oaks, Brooks said, but police need 
more volunteers for Neighborhood Watch and other community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Massengale, a civic activist from South-Central Los Angeles, told the 
group, "You're the ones you've been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
 Without citizens working to stop crime in their own neighborhoods, he warned, 
cities can be overrun like the most gang-ridden parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community based policing is not going to mean diddly," Massengale said, "if 
we can't figure out that before crime becomes a problem, there are problems 
that pop up in neighborhoods that are solvable." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd then moved into a high-tech multimedia center set up in the 
cafeteria, where karaoke singers crooned beneath glaring white lights and 
cameras recorded the event for local cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hand-held computer terminals the size of videocassettes to tap into the 
computer via FM radio waves, attendees logged their reasons for coming, their 
thoughts on crime and their hopes for the symposium's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Computerized tallies glowed blue on a projection screen, showing that 49% 
believed increasing crime was caused by breakdowns in the American family, 
while 21% blamed a permissive society and 17% the low self-esteem of 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 After a box lunch provided by the Conejo Valley Unified School District, the 
audience was impatient to start work. 
</P>
<P>
 As facilitator Karen Livesay explained the principles of brainstorming and 
group dynamics, one woman yelled, "Could we just get on with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, the room hummed with conversation as group members began 
throwing out ideas on uniting neighborhoods, fighting crime and involving more 
people in anti-gang work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this community, there is a strong cohesion, and they want to be ahead of 
the curve," said Nora Hughes, a consultant whom the Thousand Oaks City Council 
and the city's Crime Task Force hired to run the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other cities waited till they ended up with problems and then dealt with 
them," Hughes said. "These people want to get ahead of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Sloan, a Crime Task Force member helping to run the symposium, said his 
group hopes to forge the citizens' ideas into practical plans for starting new 
crime-fighting programs and helping existing ones work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 p.m., ideas were stacking up as "scribes" appointed by each group 
recorded them with felt-tip markers on big paper sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood block parties, corporate-aided school curricula, job programs for 
gang members, a local juvenile hall in the old East Valley sheriff's station -- 
the concrete ideas were recorded one by one and woven into policies for action. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a member of each group read the ideas aloud, and computer consultant 
Chris Bui typed them into a vote-sorting program. 
</P>
<P>
 The group studying gangs urged schools to identify at-risk children earlier, 
warned parents to get closer to their children, and communities to offer more 
after-school activities and job programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel on law enforcement recommended seeking more volunteers, bankrolling 
a mobile command post for trouble spots and increasing the number of people 
learning about police work through the sheriff's Citizens' Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the spot, the group concentrating on families volunteered to form a new 
Family Action Committee to seek out other volunteers and help parents keep 
their kids out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the attendees voted by computer for the solutions they thought most 
important, choosing community involvement, better communication and closer 
relations among neighbors and families as their top goals. Some worried that 
the symposium would not reach the right people -- families with delinquent 
children or other such problems that might feed crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be proactive and address these families," said Thousand Oaks 
resident Marsha Watkins. "We keep holding these things (anti-crime 
conferences), and the same people show up, and we're not addressing the people 
who fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jill Roper, an insurance agent, said while the computer-voting process was 
an annoying distraction, she hoped the symposium would bring results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all know the community has changed drastically, with crime coming 
in," she said. "I think the kids are crying for help. They're our future, and 
they're creating the streets their kids are going to live on."

POSTER ARTIST WINS SHOPPING SPREE

<P>
 Jennifer Bundy, 13, is about to go on a shopping spree at the Buenaventura 
Mall, compliments of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Anacapa Middle School seventh-grader placed first among about 
50 entries in a poster contest for the Police Department's annual block 
party.Her prize: a $125 gift certificate at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to spend it on clothes and shoes," Jennifer said shortly after she 
was named the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Her poster, which depicts police officers and children dancing on a block, was 
selected primarily because it is very colorful, said Elisa Purnell, a 
background investigator for the Police Department and a member of the selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea kind of popped into my mind right after they made the announcement 
about the contest," Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four middle schools in Ventura participated in the contest, and police 
were surprised at the high level of interest, Purnell said. Jennifer's poster 
will be used to promote next year's block party, Purnell said. PEGGY Y. LEE

NEW DAY TO RING AFTER REPAIR AS MISSION BELL TOWER BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old San Gabriel Mission's bell tower and museum were already scheduled for 
restoration when the Jan. 17 Northridge quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake caused corner walls in the museum to separate and shifted the museum 
and bell tower 2 to 6 inches in some places, according to restoration director 
Helen Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 It added a new sense of urgency -- as well as $100,000 in repair costs -- to 
the project as bracing hastily went up to prevent aftershocks from causing 
further damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a historical landmark," Nelson said. "We have to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission church parishioners agreed, pledging $1.2 million for restoration. 
Nelson said the work on the bell tower and museum should be completed by the 
end of the year. "Our parishioners are great," she said. "Their generosity has 
been overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 The church, which was badly damaged by the 1987 Whittier earthquake, reopened 
in September after extensive repairs and seismic strengthening and was 
undamaged in the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Mission was founded in 1771 by Franciscan Padre Junipero 
Serra. It was the fourth of the 21 missions founded by Serra, who was beatified 
by the Catholic Church in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum and bell tower, more than 200 years old, attract thousands of 
tourists and students every year. But Nelson said many of the museum's 
treasures -- including Native American paintings, artifacts and vestments worn 
by the original padres -- have been inaccessible since the earthquake.

IT'S BREWIN'; IN MILWAUKEE, SURPRISING PLAY BY SURPRISING PLAYERS IS GIVING 
HOPE THAT THERE'S LIFE AFTER ROBIN YOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK NEWMAN, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Milwaukee Brewers had just finished April with an extra-inning victory at 
Kansas City and a share of the lead in the American League Central. Their 
winning pitcher was Jeff Bronkey, an offseason pickup from the Texas Rangers 
who threw two perfect innings of relief for his first decision with the club. 
So, Phil Garner, what do you know about Jeff Bronkey? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything," the Brewers' manager responds with a laugh. "I just 
put him out there and let him pitch. He might be interesting. He's kind of a 
quiet guy. I don't ask him any questions. When I call him in, I just give him 
the ball and I don't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronkey was born in Afghanistan, pitched at Oklahoma State and likes music, 
golf and fishing, but that's beside the point. Garner is still getting to know 
these guys, and the rest of us might have to do the same. Life after Robin 
Yount was supposed to mean no one on your rotisserie team, no one in your 
rookie-card collection, no home game worth attending. But as the Chicago White 
Sox and a few season-ticket holders have noticed, this has been the most 
surprising team in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers are Ricky Bones, finally giving the club a return on that lopsided 
Gary Sheffield deal; Turner Ward, seizing the opportunity he hadn't found with 
the Toronto Blue Jays; Jody Reed, not re-signed by the Dodgers and doing what 
Delino DeShields has not; and Teddy Higuera, refusing to take the money and 
run. Despite injuries to projected regulars Darryl Hamilton, Pat Listach, Greg 
Vaughn and Brian Harper, the club was off to a 13-9 start, its best April since 
1987 and only the fourth time in club history that it has won more than 12 
games. It is much too early to think about contending, but this has been a big 
change from 1993, when the Brewers finished 69-93 while escapee Paul Molitor 
went merrily toward his World Series MVP Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "To begin the season like this, after the year we had in '93, is a big step," 
says Bones, whose last name is pronounced bonus, as in incentive bonus. "It's 
built our confidence as a team. I'm in the same position as a lot of guys on 
this team. I've been learning and now it's time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers finished April with a 3.27 earned-run average, easily the best in 
the American League, and Bones was the biggest reason. When Bob Hamelin hit a 
solo home run off him in the fifth inning of a no-decision recently, it ended a 
streak of 20 scoreless innings by Bones and increased his ERA to a mere 1.11. 
The second-best ERA entering this week belonged to teammate Bill Wegman, who 
was at 2.19 and 2-0 after enduring a 4-14 season filled with various ailments. 
People talked a great deal about the pitching staffs of the White Sox and 
Cleveland Indians this spring, but attention soon will shift to a rotation that 
also includes Cal Eldred, Jaime Navarro and Higuera. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones came from the San Diego Padres in the 1992 spring-training trade that 
also brought prospects Jose Valentin and Matt Mieske for Sheffield. It was a 
trade that had to happen, because Sheffield and the Brewers were a mismatch. 
Sheffield flourished immediately, threatening to become the National League's 
first Triple Crown winner in a half-century and settling for a batting title. 
In that first full major league season, Bones, then only 23, went 9-10 with a 
4.57 ERA in 163 1/3 innings. That Brewer team, in its first year under Garner, 
just missed the playoffs. But the trade was widely viewed as laughable, a 
salvage job in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of the trade, I wasn't even thinking about that," Bones says. 
"All I wanted to do was prepare to be a big leaguer, to try and get a little 
better every game. Sheffield was in the big leagues a little longer than I was. 
I came over with an idea, and the important thing for me was that, at that 
moment, the Brewers wanted me. It didn't matter what anyone said, because they 
brought me here. A lot of people said, 'Who's this guy? What's he gonna do?' I 
can't control what the people are going to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield has since been traded to the Florida Marlins, for whom he is hitting 
home runs. It was a failed marriage, and the Brewers evidently will always have 
to live with it. But Bones has made that deal more palatable. He was 3-1 in 
April, holding opponents to a .196 average. That was second in the American 
League for April only to phenom Jason Bere, who was at .194 and suddenly 
regarded by many people as the No. 1 starter in the White Sox's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones, like the Brewers, is making a lot of baseball people look foolish. 
Consider this blunt assessment in STATS Inc.'s well-regarded book, "The 
Scouting Report: 1994": "Bones will only be 25 this year, but he has little 
chance of developing into a good starting pitcher." Venerable Chicago Cubs 
scout Hugh Alexander took in Bones' start last Saturday and says, "Bones is a 
completely different pitcher than he was three years ago. I saw him then, and 
he didn't really know how to pitch yet. Now he has confidence in his other 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Bones came to Milwaukee as an average fast ball-slider pitcher. Now he has a 
couple of breaking balls and a changeup, and most important, the ability to 
throw any of them in any situation. "One thing about Ricky is, he has great 
aptitude," pitching coach Don Rowe says. "The only thing he didn't have was 
experience. He was dedicated to big league success and not individual-oriented. 
Last year he threw 200 (203 2/3) innings, so it's been a matter of getting 
those innings. He's going to keep getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Bones has had a better-ranging defense behind him, and a shining example came 
recently in right field. Ward had been the only Brewer to start in every game 
this season, but it was his first start in right. He made a diving catch to rob 
Kansas City's Jose Lind in the third inning and on the next play ran down Greg 
Gagne's fly for a shoestring catch. Then, an inning later, Ward made the catch 
that everyone was talking about after the game. Brian McRae pulled a sure 
double or triple toward the alley, and Ward, angling on a sprint toward the 
warning track, dived upward and outward like Eric Davis to make the catch. 
McRae congratulated Ward after the game. "That was the first time I've made a 
catch in the outfield and the guy who hit the ball came and (shook my hand)," 
Ward says. "Brian came up and told me, 'Great catch.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ward has done just about everything right since the Brewers claimed him off 
waivers last November. He had hoped to fill the left-field vacancy in Toronto, 
but 1993 was another partial season there and the club eagerly turned to Rickey 
Henderson for the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward won a Milwaukee roster spot with a strong spring (.375), and he opened 
the season in left because of a rib injury that sidelined Vaughn for most of 
the month. Ward hit .313 in April with four home runs, 18 walks (fifth in the 
league), a .439 on-base percentage (10th) and 19 RBI, tying him with Larry 
Hisle (1978) for third most in club history for April behind Cecil Cooper's 21 
in 1979 and Rob Deer's 22 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's path to the Brewers was more circuitous. He improved his average 19 
points to .276 in 132 games as the Dodgers' second baseman last season, his 
first in the National League after a career spent with the Boston Red Sox. But 
when Reed and the Dodgers couldn't come to terms on a three-year contract -- he 
wanted a $1 million raise to $10.5 million, the Dodgers' offer was $8 million 
-- the Dodgers traded pitcher Pedro Martinez to Montreal for DeShields and that 
was the end of Reed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He was invited to the Brewers' camp as a non-roster player and, despite 
playing only two spring games because of tendinitis in his right shoulder and a 
left quadriceps injury, continued to improve: .297 with 16 walks and a .434 
on-base percentage in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about what happened with the Dodgers. I'm concerned about 
what we're doing," Reed says. "We've been competitive in just about every game. 
It's a long season, but we're staying focused. This team realizes what it has 
to do to compete. We know our limitations. We've got a pitching staff that is 
going to open a lot of people's eyes. This team is going to surprise some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the players who used to give Reed his most fits early in his career was 
Higuera, and the Brewers hope they are seeing that same Higuera now. He was 1-1 
with a 3.72 ERA in four April starts, although recently he was hit hard in a 
loss to the Royals. Anything at this point, however, is welcome, because 
Higuera underwent shoulder surgery in August 1991 and was told by the medical 
team that his chances of returning as a quality starter were minimal. Higuera 
had won at least 15 games in each season from 1985 to '88, 20 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You may be back, you may not be back,' " says Higuera, 35. "I 
think, I can come back. And I think I have. Right now it feels good. My concern 
is staying healthy the whole season (Garner wants 28 starts from him), but my 
main concern is just keeping the Brewers in a position where they can win." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Brewers took heat for the Sheffield trade, it was nothing compared to 
the fans' prolonged reaction to the four-year, $10-million deal they gave 
Higuera at the December 1990 winter meetings. It was a deal that ultimately 
facilitated Harry Dalton's departure as the club's general manager. Higuera 
never was the same after that, and now he is in the final year of that 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing a sentiment expressed by Garner, Higuera says, "It would have been 
easy for me to take the money back to Mexico. But I didn't want that. In my 
mind, baseball has been very good for me. It's helped me a lot, helped my 
family. The Brewer organization has helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the critics, Higuera says, "It's a part of baseball. You can get hurt 
with one pitch. That's it. One pitch, and you're career is over." 
</P>
<P>
 If Higuera can return to any semblance of his mid-1980s form, and if the 
Brewers can carry over what they did in April, then life after Robin Yount will 
be better than anyone in Milwaukee expected. Maybe even better than Garner 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indians have done a good job putting together their pitching staff, and 
they've got a solid defensive club," he says. "Chicago has got great pitching, 
good hitting, and they've got the Big Hurt (Frank Thomas), a dominant player 
who makes everyone else better. I said all along, 'Yeah, they may go ahead and 
win, but the Brewers are going to be pretty good.' We're going to surprise some 
people."

GRADING THE NFL DRAFT: RAIDERS AND RAMS GETS CS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY FREI, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Tennessee running back Charlie Garner tested positive for marijuana at the 
Scouting Combine in February and had a scrape with the law in high school. So 
San Diego State receiver Darnay Scott has gotten into trouble off the field. So 
USC receiver Johnnie Morton isn't going to be a candidate for the Olympic 
400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does it all mean? They'll turn out to be among the biggest "bargains" 
of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with Garner, who lasted until midway through the second round and went 
to the Philadelphia Eagles. Think of some of the mistakes of the past few 
years, and a lot of them come back to this: athletes who "slipped" in the final 
draft weeks before the draft. Thurman Thomas, who went at No. 40 to the Buffalo 
Bills in 1988, and Emmitt Smith, 17th in 1990, to name two. Louis Oliver, No. 
25 in 1989, to name another. 
</P>
<P>
 Often slippage has to do with overanalysis, with overreacting to the final 
data from workouts or the combine, and even with hypersensitivity to gossip or 
the whispers that have been going around the league in the final weeks before 
the draft. All of a sudden, somebody is too small because he measures a little 
shorter on his ninth remeasuring and he has a few too many hundredths of a 
second on that 40 time. And because he wasn't the Welcome Wagon representative 
when the 24th organization asked him if he would go through a private workout, 
he must be a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garner's case, the knocks were his size (5-foot-9, 182 pounds) -- but wait 
a minute, wasn't he just as small when he was projected as a No. 1 pick? -- and 
the marijuana red flag at the combine. He said marijuana smoke, not his own 
inhalation, caused the test result -- and that's not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, who gained 1,161 yards and averaged 7.3 yards per carry as a senior 
for the Volunteers, would have been a great pick from late in the first round 
on, and everyone not completely set at running back who passed on him is going 
to be sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much argument about Scott, who went in the second round to the 
Cincinnati Bengals: He was the best physical package at wide receiver in the 
draft. He hasn't been a model citizen, either in high school or at San Diego 
State. At last check, receivers didn't get a three-stride head start on 
cornerbacks if they are Eagle Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, who went 21st to the Detroit Lions, and Charles Johnson, claimed at 
No. 17 by the Pittsburgh Steelers, weren't downgraded as much as they fell 
victim to the run on defensive linemen. The talk that Morton fell short of the 
blazing speed category was right out of the Shrine of the Stopwatch dogma. But 
he has a fluid stride that will get him open. And he has the athletic talent to 
make the acrobatic catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is perhaps the antithesis of Scott. Johnson is the character guy you 
want in the locker room, so we're just wondering: If alleged character baggage 
drops players such as Scott and Garner, why did Johnson -- the extraordinary 
talent who earned his degree in three years from Colorado -- last until No. 17? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a team-by-team run through the draft, with grades. Keep in mind that 
the grades are handed out with three considerations: 1) In an age when players 
reach free agency after four years, it's wiser to draft for need in most cases; 
2) Because of the disparity in the number of picks available to each team, it's 
only fair to measure each team against what it could have done with its picks; 
and, 3) This isn't Yale and we won't have to hear any whining about how a "B" 
is going to keep somebody out of medical school, so the curve is strict. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Bengals, A: 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Wilkinson and Scott were no-brainers. Florida State defensive back Corey 
Sawyer was a great No. 4. They also needed offensive-line depth and likely got 
some help there with a sleeper: UNLV tackle Jerry Reynolds, the sixth-round 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Browns, A: 
</P>
<P>
 Needed defensive help and got it. Even Bernie Kosar might admit Bill Belichick 
knows defense, and Antonio Langham with the ninth overall pick was solid. 
Derrick Alexander, the 29th player chosen, adds speed at receiver. No. 3, 
defensive tackle Romeo Bandison, would have gone higher except for nagging 
doubts about a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Vikings, A: The No. 1s -- Tackle Todd Steussie and cornerback 
Dewayne Washington -- fill needs. No. 2 Fernando Smith, a Jackson State 
defensive end, is huge and raw, and could fill the void left by the Chris 
Doleman trade. He was involved in some off-field problems before straightening 
out as a senior, perhaps the only reason Minnesota could get him that late. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 49ers, A: Call it the Bill Romanowski draft, because the 49ers 
had to dump him to clear some cap room to be able to make some picks. But 
trading up for Notre Dame defensive tackle Bryant Young and adding fullback 
William Floyd and bump-and-run cornerback Tyronne Drakeford on the next two 
picks will help plug holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, A: They jumped on a couple of surprising "slips" -- 
Trent Dilfer and Florida running back Errict Rhett -- before turning to need 
along the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets, B: Though the big need was receiver, they took cornerback Aaron 
Glenn in the first round. He was too good a talent to pass up, which led the 
Jets to trade up one spot and perhaps fleece the New Orleans Saints in the 
process. Wyoming wide receiver Ryan Yarborough isn't a burner, but the 
second-round pick has Morton-like talent to get open. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Giants, B: OK, OK. Receiver Thomas Lewis, the No. 1 pick, was asleep 
and certain he would be taken far later. The Giants are hoping they're more 
astute than he was. But grant him this -- he has the speed, and he plays the 
right position for this team. What makes this draft look strong, though, are 
the second-rounders, DBs Thomas Randolph and Jason Sehorn, and No. 4 Chris 
Maumalanga, another of those slip bargains at his slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Redskins, B: They read the Indianapolis Colts correctly, deciding 
to sit at No. 3 and take Heath Shuler. Add Temple tackle Tre Johnson, a 
fascinating prospect in the second round, and the rebuilding plan is off to a 
good start. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Steelers, B: Charles Johnson was a gift at the 17th spot, 
especially for a team crying for receiver help. And then they added needed 
defensive-line help with Brentson Buckner, Jason Gildon and Taase Faumui. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Eagles, B: Mutt and Jeff draft, with huge tackle Bernard Williams 
in the firstand Garner in the second. The question is whether Williams' size 
made teams overrate him, which would make him the flip side to Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Seahawks, B: They waited nervously and were thrilled when Texas A&M 
end Sam Adams was still around in the eighth slot. He already is 20 pounds 
under his college high weight of 305, and the temptation is to state: If he can 
continue to keep his weight under control. . . . But then let's remember that 
Cortez Kennedy is on the Winchell's all-pro team. LSU center Kevin Mawae is a 
future starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Bills, C: A mercy grade, because they had some bad luck. They needed a 
cornerback but took a safety, Jeff Burris, and said they would try him as a 
corner. Most of the top cornerbacks had been picked by the time they drafted. 
They needed offensive-line help to replace free-agency losses and then saw a 
bunch of good offensive line prospects go between their first (27th overall) 
and second (48) picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Lions, C: Is there an echo here? Yes, Morton was a gift at the 21st 
spot, but the Lions failed in their desperate attempt to trade for another pick 
to land them a needed quality cornerback. In this age, they should have drafted 
one -- even a question mark -- somewhere. Extra credit for the quote of the 
draft from personnel chief Ron Hughes about the CB quest: "We even said, 'We'll 
trade your beat writers for ours.' . . . We offered everything you could think 
of -- short of children." 
</P>
<P>
 New England Patriots, C: Bill Parcells loved Willie McGinest, and the Patriots 
had to have a pass rusher. But the potential problem there is that while 
McGinest is a wonderful athlete, there is no assurance he can be a great 
pass-rushing outside LB. A risk more than a reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Oilers, C: They got end Henry Ford to step in for William Fuller and 
Sean Jones. One of Dilfer's college receivers, Malcolm Seabron, could replace 
Haywood Jeffires. But they would have been better off to address offensive-line 
holes with mid-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City Chiefs, C: Needed someone to complement, help or even replace 
Marcus Allen. Meet Texas A&M's Greg Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Raiders, C: Passed up Hill, Rhett and Garner -- all needed RBs -- 
for linebacker Rob Fredrickson. But don't trash the Raiders for drafting the 
underestimated Fredrickson, who will turn out to be a good pick for a club that 
wasn't set at linebacker, either. The bigger question was the -- who? -- pick 
in second round -- end-linebacker James Folston. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Dolphins, C: They didn't like the way Round 1 was unfolding because the 
top linebackers were going, going, gone. So the Dolphins traded down. Tim 
Bowens is a project, an interesting pick for Don Shula. But they did get two 
potential linebacker starters in Aubrey Beavers and Colorado's mercurial Ronnie 
Woolfork, plus a solid center in Notre Dame's Tim Ruddy. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Chargers, C: No first-round pick, but No. 2, 315-pound guard Isaac 
Davis, could be an impact player for a team that needed somebody at that spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Cardinals, C: Linebacker Jamir Miller might be overvalued at No. 10, 
but give Buddy Ryan credit -- he knows what he needs for his defense and rarely 
turns out to be wrong. Plus, running back Chuck Levy, the No. 2 pick, is a 
talent who even stepped in at quarterback for Arizona. Even if Garrison Hearst 
gets out of the doghouse, Levy will be good to have around. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bears, C: Hmmmm. Runner and receiver were the needs, but they took 
linebacker John Thierry and said: Hey, you'll like defensive end. And then they 
bid goodbye to Richard Dent, who joined Steve McMichael in exile. No. 2 pick, 
guard-tackle Marcus Spears, is a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboys, C: Get off Jerry Jones' case about one thing: Arizona State 
end Shante Carver is a find -- especially if he is locked in the weight room 
for the next two months. But the Cowboys didn't need to trade up to get him. 
Second-rounder Larry Allen, a guard from Sonoma State, needs to lose a few 
pounds and strengthen his shoulder but was worth taking at 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay Packers, C: The debate: Was a blue-chip offensive lineman, Aaron 
Taylor, worth taking at No. 16 for a team with a decent line? Or should the 
Pack have taken one of the wide receivers at 16 or their original spot -- No. 
20? Conclusion pending, but we're inclined to say Charles Johnson would have 
been a great complement to Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Saints, C: They had to get quality defensive-line help, but some 
rears are on the line about whether Joe Johnson fits that definition. Would 
rate lower except running back Mario Bates, the No. 2, might be a steal and 
quarterback Doug Nussmeier is an intriguing No. 4 choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Rams, C: They got all fouled up with the Alvin Harper trade talks, 
and an intraoffice debate over whether to stay at No. 5 and take Trent Dilfer. 
Ended up dropping twice, landing at No. 15 and taking a fine tackle, Wayne 
Gandy. Bottom line: Chuck Knox is sticking with his basics and staking his job 
on it. Under the circumstances, not a bad pick. If No. 2, receiver Isaac Bruce, 
is a find, the Rams can claim redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis Colts, D: Imagine what could have been -- the game-breaking 
running back, Marshall Faulk, and Trent Dilfer, the QB so desperately needed 
after the trading of Jeff George. Instead, they settled on Trev Alberts after 
moving up to the fifth spot. The Colts already have a good linebacking corps, 
and Alberts isn't such a compelling prospect that the Colts could afford to 
turn their backs on Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Falcons, Incomplete: The No. 1 went for Jeff George and a No. 2 was 
used as the first part of a two-year payment for Chris Doleman. They need 
linebacker help, and fourth-rounder Mitch Davis was the only one picked. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Broncos, Truant: They used a No. 2 on linebacker Allen Aldridge, a No. 
4 on cornerback Randy Fuller, and they had three No. 7s. On draft days, they 
pay the price for their hyperactivity on the free-agency front.

VIKINGS' ALLEN HAPPY TO BE IN TRAINING CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Allen is practicing again. After recovering from his second major knee 
surgery in three years, that's enough right now for the Minnesota Vikings 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just the happiest person in the world to be at training camp," the 
four-year veteran said Friday after running plays with his teammates for the 
first time since last summer. "Having to sit it out makes me appreciate it a 
lot more. I'm expecting good things this season for myself and the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings were expecting great things from Allen last year when he reported 
to training camp fresh from setting a single-season rushing record -- 1,201 
yards -- in 1992. The 5-foot-9 197-pounder from Clemson had just signed a 
three-year, $4.5 million contract extension and was to be the featured back in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But his season ended before it began. On July 22, Allen tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament in his right knee while planting his foot during a routine 
play in training camp. There was no improvement for about a month, so he 
underwent reconstructive surgery Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had prepared all summer for the season and in one play it was all over," he 
said. "The rest of the guys were out having fun and you want to be out with 
them. It makes you find out what kind of person you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of weaving between defensive backs, Allen was wandering from the 
weight room to the indoor bike and stair machine. He was on the sidelines for 
home games and watched road games on television. Sundays in general were not 
easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen dreaded going through exhaustive rehabilitation since the routine wasn't 
new for him. Three years earlier, he injured his left knee during training camp 
and had to miss the entire season recovering from similar reconstructive 
surgery.

PARADISE CREEK WINS AT CHURCHILL DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paradise Creek came on strong on the far turn and pulled away to a four-length 
victory over Lure, the 1-5 favorite, in the $233,950 Early Times Turf Classic 
at Churchill Downs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Name's Jimmy, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, set the pace through the three 
quarters of mile before Lure moved strong on the rail and Pat Day rode Paradise 
Creek down the middle in the 1 1/8-mile Grade II race. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure, under Mike Smith, appeared on target for his fifth consecutive stakes 
victory before Paradise Creek took command heading down the homestretch on a 
good track. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek, which had lost four previous races against Lure, finished in 
1:48 1/5 in a steady drizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yukon Robbery, ridden by Kent Desmormeaux, finished 2 1/2 lengths back in 
third while Memento Mori was another 2 1/2 lengths in fourth in the seven-horse 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek returned $8.60, $2.20 and $2.10. Lure paid $2.10 and $2.10 and 
Yukon Robbery $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek, a 5-year-old son of Irish River, came into the race with three 
consecutive stakes victories in Florida. He is owned by Masayuki Nishiyama and 
trained by Bill Mott. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was worth $152,067 to Paradise Creek, bringing his career earnings 
to $1,098,709. His record is 10-5-0 in 18 career starts, including four wins 
without a loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure, which has won the last two Breeders' Cup Mile races, was making only his 
second start of the year. He won the Grade II Elkhorn Stakes at Keeneland on 
April 15.

RUSSIAN BOXER BECOMES A BIG HIT DOWN UNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WINSOR DOBBIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's a Russian who's only lived in Australia for two years, but unbeaten 
junior-welterweight boxer Kostya Tszyu is well on his way to becoming the 
latest hero in this sports-crazy nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old from the Ural Mountains has an engaging smile, speaks English 
with an Aussie accent, and can fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tszyu turned professional after winning the world amateur title in 1991. He 
ended his amateur career with a 259-11 record and based himself in Sydney under 
the care of trainer Johnny Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest victory -- a ninth-round TKO win over Puerto Rican Angel Hernandez 
on Monday night -- was beamed on a pay-per-view basis to pubs and clubs around 
Australia and many venues reported sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks, a yuppie pub in the upscale Neutral Bay area of Sydney, up to 200 
fans crowded around the televisions, shouting and screaming encouragement to 
Tszyu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deck him!" shouted one woman. "Hit him hard!" screamed another. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 6,000 fans watched the fight at the Newcastle Entertainment Center, 100 
miles north of Sydney. Bill Mordey, Australia's leading boxing promoter, 
describes Tszyu's following as "phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kostya is not only an exciting fighter, but he has a great personality," said 
Mordey. "Australians respect him for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tszyu has fought only twice in the United States, knocking out Steve Larrimore 
of Bahamas in Memphis, Tenn., and outpointing Mexican Hector Lopez in Tampa, 
Fla., but he's already grabbing international headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 He's won all 12 of his fights and only three opponents -- two of them former 
world champions -- have lasted the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tszyu, already ranked No. 1 by the International Boxing Federation and No. 3 
by the World Boxing Council, bases his strategy on all-out aggression and 
clever defensive skills.

 "He is a freakishly talented fighter," says trainer Lewis, who has handled two 
world champions in Jeff Fenech and Jeff Harding. "He's special, and he'll be 
ready to win a world title whenever we get the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, whose only loss in 42 professional fights was in a world title bout 
against Julio Cesar Chavez, was the fifth of Tszyu's foes to make it past the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed 10 stitches in a gash over his right eyebrow after tangling with the 
baby-faced, pony-tailed Russian, who will become an Australian citizen this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tszyu has quickly settled into the Australian lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 He and wife, Natasha, live in the Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, five minutes 
from the beach, where he enjoys surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Mordey's plans for Tszyu include a world title fight one day in 
Moscow. His immediate target, though, is a challenge to the current IBF 
champion, Jake Rodriguez of the United States.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NEW NATIONAL LEAGUE PRESIDENT FIGHTING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 1961, but Frank Robinson remembers it vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to forget the side-winding Don Drysdale throwing three straight heaters 
behind your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale drew a warning from the umpire at that point but wasn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 His next pitch? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right in my ribs," Robinson said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, for the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, then with the Cincinnati Reds and now assistant general manager of 
the Baltimore Orioles, trotted to first as Drysdale was banished to the Dodger 
bench and the game continued without the interruption of a bench-clearing brawl 
accompanied by a Strauss waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish baseball from hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider only the series between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia 
Phillies in which Tony Gwynn accused Curt Schilling of intentionally hitting 
him with a pitch, Mariano Duncan emptied both benches when he swung at San 
Diego catcher Brad Ausmus after being decked twice by Andy Ashby's pitches and 
Philadelphia rookie Andy Carter was ejected from his major league debut, along 
with Manager Jim Fregosi, when he hit Ausmus and Luis Lopez with pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the rare game these days that doesn't find a hitter charging the mound 
or slowly, ominously walking to first, escorted by an umpire serving as 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Coleman, the new National League president, has already handed out two 
suspensions and "will continue to do all I can to discourage" what he perceives 
to be the negative impact of a hitter charging the mound or a pitcher 
deliberately throwing at a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first place, someone is going to get seriously hurt, and secondly, 
baseball has a role in wider society," Coleman said. "I don't want kids seeing 
it and emulating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman suspended Reggie Sanders of the Reds for five games when he charged 
Pedro Martinez of the Montreal Expos after being hit by a pitch while Martinez 
was working on a no-hitter. Benito Santiago of the Florida Marlins drew a 
four-game suspension for going after Kevin Rogers of the San Francisco Giants. 
And Coleman, on Friday, suspended Derek Bell of the Padres for five games for 
charging Martinez when the Montreal pitcher buzzed Derek Bell's chin with an 
0-2 fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman may be a tougher disciplinarian than predecessor Bill White or 
American League President Bobby Brown, who is considering the Tuesday night 
incident in which Eric Anthony of the Seattle Mariners went after Boston Red 
Sox pitcher Paul Quantrill when hit by a pitch, injuring Quantrill's right ring 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman wouldn't suggest that White or Brown have been too soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let my actions speak for themselves," he said. "I consider the brawling 
negative and will do what I can to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's penalty system hasn't been a strong deterrent. The modest fines 
represent pocket change to players earning millions of dollars, and the 
suspensions are almost always appealed, meaning the player can continue to play 
for weeks or months, or until the schedule puts him in New York, where he can 
meet with his league president in a hearing that frequently produces a 
reduction in the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, I'd expedite the penalty as quickly as possible, but 
the rules provide for an appeal and that can't be changed arbitrarily," Coleman 
said. "We have to live with the system." 
</P>
<P>
 The system, most say, is also flawed in that it provides for a free shot by 
the pitcher of one team, knowing that if it produces a warning, the pitcher of 
the other team can't retaliate without possible ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different game with different attitudes than when Robinson played. No 
one competed with more grit and intensity, but he recalled charging the mound 
only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one circumstance escapes me, but I remember going after Ron Herbel of the 
Giants when he hit me above the elbow only a few days after I had been hit in 
the same spot by Ron Piche in Milwaukee," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Gaylord Perry, who was scheduled to pitch the next game, standing 
in the Giants' dugout and yelling, 'If you think he hit you hard, wait until 
tomorrow.' I wasn't going to be intimidated. I hit two home runs off Perry." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson let his Hall of Fame actions speak for him. He did it at the plate 
and on the basepaths. If retaliation was called for, he went hard into the 
second baseman or shortstop on double-play situations, a philosophy endorsed by 
Don Baylor, who holds the record for being hit by pitches but also charged the 
mound only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Robinson and Baylor: How do you help your team if you're ejected by 
charging the mound? Common sense, but now players know only the one thing: Go 
after the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Robinson said, begins with the aluminum bat used at the amateur 
level. Hitters stand at the plate with impunity, knowing pitchers won't work 
inside because of the fear of aluminum handle hits. Then, faced with tighter 
pitching at the professional level, the hitter tends to feel his turf is being 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous, said Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of education," he said. "Hitters have to understand that 
pitchers have a right to pitch inside, to knock you down, to brush you back, to 
even hit you as long as it's not in the area of the head. It's part of the art 
of pitching, part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitchers are also human. Every time they knock you down it's not intentional. 
Hitters have to learn to take a closer look at the situation before they 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson knows that he will get an argument from many hitters on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I won't get it from the old-timers, although I'm not talking as an 
old-timer," he said. "I think I've bridged the gap. I'm not knocking all 
hitters. I'm not putting them all under the same blanket. They just have to 
understand that if the pitcher has a right to pitch inside, it doesn't mean 
they have a right to charge the mound every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman agrees. He said discussions are being conducted in the hope of finding 
a solution and reducing the number of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking this seriously," he said. "People may feel it's part of the game, 
but I'm not going to get into that. It needs to be dealt with and discouraged." 
Brawl Add 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson says Coleman can't deal with Martinez, the 
former Dodger, soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's going to kill him," Johnson said. "A whole bunch of guys are going 
to be after him. What's beyond me is he hasn't even gotten a warning. Don't 
umpires ever read the newspapers or watch ESPN and see what this guy is doing? 
He's hit seven guys already this year and four in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some old baseball purists told Leonard Coleman that's the way baseball is 
played. What he needs to do is get Bob Gibson and Frank Robinson together and 
hash this thing out on inside pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I hit a thousand batters," he said after the incident with 
Bell. "I'm not going to stop pitching inside." Missing Link 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range significance of the Atlanta Braves' 2-9 skid that ended with a 
victory over the Florida Marlins on Wednesday could be that it demonstrated the 
importance right-handed hitting Ron Gant played in a lineup that now includes 
lefties -Fred McGriff, Ryan Klesko, David Justice and Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 With right-handed hitting shortstop Jeff Blauser on the disabled list and 
righty outfielders Mike Kelly, Dave Gallagher and Bill Pecota batting a 
cumulative .219 through Wednesday, the Braves have little balance and were 1-6 
against left-handed pitchers before the weekend's early showdown with Montreal. 
The promising Kelly, in fact, was sent back to triple A on Thursday with a .192 
average and replaced by Jarvis Brown, a .216 lifetime hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, meanwhile, may be running out of options. Both the San Francisco Giants 
and Houston Astros bowed out of that pursuit this week, reluctant to sign him 
only through the '94 season, as he is asking. That would allow him to retain 
his free-agent eligibility when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Red Sox, who must now overcome the loss of Frank Viola, may try to 
do it with offense and could be Gant's best bet, although they are also keenly 
interested in Montreal outfielder Larry Walker while hesitant to give up either 
of their top prospects, Trot Nixon and Frankie Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, like Gant, is also eligible for free agency when the season ends and 
figures to be moved soon, with the Expos disturbed by his often less than 
intense approach and convinced that Rondell White, now at triple-A Ottawa, is 
ready to replace him. Ho Hum 
</P>
<P>
 The Sporting News has exhumed speculation that Gene and Jackie Autry are 
selling the Angels to the Disney Corp., linking it to the Autrys' sale of KMPC 
and their Palm Springs hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys have not sold the Palm Springs hotel. In fact, Jackie Autry said, 
they are trying to get a license that will allow them to build a 1,000-seat 
dinner theater on the hotel grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She also insists that the club is not for sale, adding, "How many times do I 
have to say that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, meanwhile, have begun negotiations with the city of Anaheim on a 
lease extension beyond 2001, predicating the extension on architectural 
improvements at Anaheim Stadium and financial improvements in the current 
terms. NAMES AND NUMBERS -- Big Ben: The Baltimore Orioles have averaged 7.5 
runs in Ben McDonald's 6-0 start, but that doesn't diminish his accomplishment. 
He was 13-14 last year when his support was fourth worst among American League 
starting pitchers. He has held the opposition to three runs or fewer in 46 of 
his last 54 starts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching coaches and other pitchers talked to me a lot, but for me there is 
no substitute for experience," McDonald said. "It never really sunk in until I 
got out on the mound and did it myself, experienced some failure, had some 
success."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Keeping Pace: Wilson Alvarez of the Chicago White Sox is also 6-0 and has 
won 13 straight decisions since returning from last season's minor league 
demotion. He led the American League in walks when sent down but has a 1.97 
earned-run average during his streak and has walked only 18 in 41 1/3 innings 
of his 6-0 start. Most scouts consider him the league's No. 2 power left-hander 
behind Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can walk a guy and it's nothing for me," he said. "I know I can throw 
strikes and challenge hitters more. That's what works for me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- March of Time: Jack Morris celebrates his 39th birthday May 16, but the 
Cleveland Indians aren't in a party mood. Morris, in five starts since beating 
the Seattle Mariners in his Cleveland debut on April 7, is 0-3 with an 8.01 
ERA. The Indians have three hot pitchers in triple A -- Albie Lopez, Julian 
Tavarez and Chad Ogea -- and there is suspicion that Morris may not reach 90 
innings, at which point he receives $500,000, the first of his $2.25 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is the lack of consistency in the location of his pitches," 
Manager Mike Hargrove said of Morris. "It's a concern that a pitcher with his 
experience is missing by that much." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Belch as in . . . Former Dodger Tim Belcher, one of the last free agents to 
sign, has yet to return a dividend on the $3.4-million contract he signed with 
received the generous Detroit Tigers. He is 5-0 with a 9.91 ERA and has 
survived the fifth inning only twice in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said that when it rains it pours," Belcher said. "This is more like 
a drowning." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mental Game: Kevin Brown was 0-4 with a 10.86 ERA as the Texas Rangers' ace 
when he resumed communication with psychologist, Harvey Dorfman. Brown is 2-0 
with a 1.06 ERA in two starts since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you need to be reminded of what you have to do," he said. "It's a 
full circle of things." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ouch: When Kevin Mitchell of the Cincinnati Reds missed Monday's opener of 
a three-game series with the Chicago Cubs because of a sore knee ligament, Cub 
broadcaster Steve Stone recalled Mitchell's spring prediction that he would 
play 150 games this season and told his listeners that Mitchell would have to 
play winter ball to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, listening in the clubhouse, responded, "I was including playoffs and 
World Series -- where Steve Stone won't be. He's up in the booth clowning me, 
and he's the one wearing makeup."

PITCHERS' MESSAGE: ON THE INSIDE, LOOK OUT! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WALKER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fastballs kept hissing closer and closer, and yet the batter just stood 
still. Even when Pedro Martinez whizzed one right under the chin, the hitter 
did not flinch. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this was no ordinary batter. It was a mannequin, dressed up in a 
baseball uniform, and Martinez was using it to practice pitching inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The real hitters Martinez has faced this season, though, have been no dummies. 
And when the Montreal pitcher has come too close, they haven't been so 
tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Bell and Reggie Sanders both charged the mound to get back at Martinez. 
But Martinez, who already has hit six players this season, has this message: 
Batters, beware! 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I hit 1,000 batters," Martinez barked. "I'm going to keep 
pitching inside." 
</P>
<P>
 So are a lot of other pitchers, apparently, especially if the home-run rate 
continues to rise at a record level. One month into the season, the number of 
HBPs is up 15% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has led to an alarming increase of basebrawls. More than a half-dozen 
bench-clearing fights have broken out, so many that new NL president Len 
Coleman and the baseball players' union have agreed to meet and talk about the 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pushing people off the plate has been around forever," four-time NL batting 
champion Tony Gwynn said. "You've got to be aggressive with it, but you've got 
to be in control with it because, as we've seen in the last couple of days, 
when it gets away from you -- whether they try to or not -- it just looks bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn's San Diego Padres were involved in brushback incidents in three 
straight games against Philadelphia. But after Gwynn was hit by Curt Schilling, 
he decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than charge Schilling, he spoke to Coleman, who said he would 
investigate the growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman could've had a first-hand look last Wednesday in New York. Barry Bonds 
homered off Eric Hillman early, then was hit in the elbow by Hillman in his 
next at-bat and left the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, if a guy hits a home run off you and the next time he 
comes up you drill him, it would be the same as me throwing the bat at him for 
striking me out," five-time AL batting champion Wade Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to stop it is with fines and suspensions," he said. "And if 
they're harsh enough, then they sort of take a second look on whether or not to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for batters rushing the mound. Coleman surprised some by suspending 
Sanders for five games for charging Martinez, a penalty more severe than for 
similar incidents in the past. Sanders is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerald Clark, who played for Colorado last season, recently found out how 
Japanese baseball officials punish such conduct. He was suspended for seven 
games from the Yakult Swallows after tackling a pitcher following a knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado manager Don Baylor, hit by pitches a major league record 267 times, 
understands the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with going inside for a strike. That's the way you have 
to pitch," he said. "As for guys charging the mound, there are way too many 
guys charging the mound. It tells me one thing: Guys don't like the ball 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a trend Jeff Reardon has noticed during his 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, sometimes they'll glare at you on a pitch that almost hits the inside 
corner. And you look back at them like, 'What the hell is wrong with that?"' 
the New York Yankees reliever said. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be understood in baseball that it was OK to throw inside, as long 
as it was below the shoulders. That, though, seems to have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad and I talk about it," said New York Mets catcher Todd Hundley, whose 
dad, Randy, caught for the Cubs 25 years ago. "In his day, the plate was the 
pitcher's plate. Now, it's like the plate is the hitter's plate." 
</P>
<P>
 That means hitters feel comfortable -- maybe too comfortable -- in leaning 
over the plate to drive outside pitches. Home runs in April were up 41% over 
last April's pace, and a lot of those were hit to the opposite field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the pitchers are tired of letting guys drill the ball out of the 
ballpark," said Baltimore relief ace Lee Smith. "A lot of guys that I've seen 
get hit, the ball wouldn't have hit the guys if they weren't diving and trying 
to yank the ball over the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a psychological edge, admitted Padres rookie A.J. Sager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much to make the hitter uncomfortable -- it is a little bit that 
-- but it's just the idea that the plate is 17 inches wide or whatever and you 
have to use all of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been that way for years, the eternal battle between pitcher and hitter. 
Only now it seems that the days when Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale ruled might be 
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I grew up and my dad played, that's the way it was then," said Danny 
Tartabull, whose learned from his father, Jose. "If a pitcher wants to brush 
you back, that's fair game. But I have a problem with pitchers throwing around 
the head." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tartabull talked in the Yankees' clubhouse, pitcher Terry Mulholland 
listened from the next locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, you have a batting helmet," Mulholland said with a sly grin.

WORLD CUP; SWEDEN IS LED BY GOALIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goalkeepers naturally hate giving up goals. For Thomas Ravelli, it was a 
relief finally conceding his first goal after four straight shutouts, including 
one for Sweden's national team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Letting in that goal was probably good," Ravelli says. "The media would have 
started writing even more about my shutouts, and that adds mental pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli, 34, is the most experienced goalkeeper in this World Cup. He was 
unscored upon for 8 hours 45 minutes during the first month of the Swedish 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch started April 10 after Ravelli gave up a 10th-minute goal for IFK 
Goteborg in the Swedish first division and ended 15 days later with just 10 
minutes left of another league game. In between, he also played for Sweden in a 
2-0 exhibition victory at Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, shutouts are nice," Ravelli says. "But only if you play well and your 
team wins. You don't play for the shutouts. You play to win. The shutout is 
just a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 IFK Goteborg started the season 5-0. Sweden's World Cup team also is off to a 
good start. Despite missing several key players who had commitments with their 
foreign-based clubs, Sweden won the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami by beating the 
United States, 3-1, in February. Ravelli's backup, Lars Eriksson, played in 
that game, but Ravelli earned a shutout in a scoreless tie against Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 World Cup was a nightmare for Ravelli. He gave up six goals as Sweden 
lost all three preliminary-round games by 2-1 scores to Brazil, Scotland and 
Costa Rica. Ravelli predicts better results for Sweden this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But only barring injuries to the key players," he says. "Don't expect good 
results if three, four players are not fully fit or if they're coming back from 
recent injuries and aren't match-tough. We don't have the depth compared to 
other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tommy Svensson, who led the Swedes to the semifinals in the 1992 
European Championship, is expected to keep Ravelli in goal throughout the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ravelli joined the elite group of players who have made at least 
100 appearances for their national team. Ravelli earned his 107th "cap" against 
Wales and if he plays the remaining exhibitions and first-round World Cup games 
against Cameroon, Russia and Brazil, he would be just one game shy of Bjorn 
Nordqvist's Swedish record of 115 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Two retired goalkeepers, Peter Shilton of England and Pat Jennings of Northern 
Ireland, top the career list with 125 and 119 games respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of my goals to break his record," Ravelli says of Shilton. "It 
depends on how I'm playing, but I plan to go on for at least two more years. We 
have the European Championship finals in 1996 and I'd like to play in England 
if we qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the 1992 European semifinals was great, but "we lost to the Germans and 
didn't make the final. So honestly, I hope the biggest moment of my career is 
yet to come before I retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe in the United States this summer.

JETS GRANT NAGLE HIS WISH AND RELEASE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Browning Nagle, considered the New York Jets' quarterback of the future just a 
year ago, was released by the team Friday, a day after the team signed Jack 
Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle, who a week ago signed a contract that would have paid him $875,000 next 
season, was deemed expendable by the Jets after they signed Trudeau, released 
last month by Indianapolis.Trudeau signed for $1,725,000 over two years, adding 
an additional burden to the salary cap of $34.6 million per team. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, the agent for both Trudeau and Nagle -- as well as Glenn 
Foley, a Jets' draft choice -- had asked that Nagle be released to pursue 
opportunities with other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets granted that wish Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Browning has a future in the NFL," said general manager Dick 
Steinberg, no relation to Leigh. "We would liked to have kept him and Jack 
Trudeau, but in today's environment, it's impossible to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle, a second-round draft choice in 1991 from Louisville, played in only one 
game as a rookie but won the starting job from Ken O'Brien in 1992. He 
completed 192 of 387 passes for 2,280 yards.

 Joe Carter's vertigo condition should not be compared to the cases that ended 
the careers of Nick Esasky and Ken Dayley, Toronto Blue Jay trainer Tommy Craig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not to misconstrued as the same," Craig said."Joe's is more the result 
of the residual effects of a virus." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who leads the major leagues with 39 runs batted in, woke up with a 
headache and dizziness Friday and was examined by team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given a CAT scan Saturday and the results were negative. Carter did not 
play either day for the Blue Jays, and was taking medication for an inner ear 
infection. 
</P>

<P>
 Tony Fernandez caused a scene in the Cincinnati Reds' clubhouse before the 
game and left in a huff Saturday night after an 11-7 victory over the Houston 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 The third baseman has been grousing all season about having to accept a 
$500,000 salary and move to a new position because he couldn't get a better 
offer from another team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez sat and stared into his dressing cubicle for several minutes before 
the game. Then he stood up, picked up his chair and dumped it in a clothes bin 
in the middle of the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he headed for the trainer's room, stopping to topple a clothes hamper on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour after the game, Fernandez packed up his cleats and other 
equipment in his two bags, shook hands with shortstop Barry Larkin and left the 
clubhouse. Pitcher Jose Rijo accompanied Fernandez and appeared to be trying to 
placate him.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS; OCC WINS MEN'S, WOMEN'S TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There wasn't a dry eye among the members of the Orange Coast swimming team as 
they celebrated their men's and women's titles at the three-day State 
championships, which ended Saturday at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCC women won their sixth consecutive title and the program's 10th in the 
last 11 years for Coach Don Watson. Watson, selected the State women's coach of 
the year, was the first to be tossed into the pool at the end of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, swimmers went around the pool deck tossing teammates and assistant 
coaches into the water, dressed for it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCC women finished with a meet-record 639 points and Saddleback, also a 
member of the Orange Empire Conference, was second with 294. Cuesta (227) was 
third, American River (205) was fourth and West Valley (195) fifth. Rancho 
Santiago (154) was ninth and Fullerton (149) finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCC men won with 521 points, Golden West (417) was second and Long Beach 
(351) third. It was the third title in four seasons for OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy seeing the kids happy," Watson said. "You grow fond of them and 
seeing them improve and grow up. That's the very best part." 
</P>
<P>
 The race of the day and the meet was the men's 200 backstroke, in which Santa 
Monica's Lenny Krayzelburg set a national record, finishing in 1 minute 47.91 
seconds. Krayzelburg beat OCC's Matthias Otte, who held the lead at 50, 100 and 
150 yards. But Krayzelburg was able to take the lead just before the final 
turn. Otte held the previous record of 1:48.26 set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Ferguson of OCC beat teammate Jim Emmons to win the 200 breaststroke. 
Ferguson's time of 2:02.96 was the fastest in the state this year. Emmons 
(2:04.39) came in second. OCC closed out the meet by winning the 400 freestyle 
relay in 3:05.51. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC's Brandi Kossub led an Orange County sweep in the women's 100 backstroke, 
winning in 59.11. She has won the 50 and 100 backstroke races in two 
consecutive State meets. Erin Snow (1:00.07) of Orange Coast was second and 
Rancho Santiago's Heather Burton (1:00.91) finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback, which barely lost to Orange Coast in the 800 freestyle relay 
Friday, came back to beat the Pirates Saturday in the 400 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC was ahead by less than a fourth of a second after three legs, but 
Saddleback's Emilie Paylovich passed OCC's Michelle Pereira in the final 25 
yards. Saddleback won in 1:40.46 and OCC was second in 1:40.61.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; SCC NOT IN SWING, LOSES SOFTBALL TITLE 
</P>

<P>
 Southern California College, the best hitting softball team in NAIA District 3 
all season, couldn't produce when it counted Saturday as Cal Baptist beat the 
Vanguards, 2-0, for the district championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crushing flameout for the host Vanguards (43-10), ranked fifth in the 
nation in the NAIA. They had outscored the unranked Lancers, 17-1, in sweeping 
their four Golden State Athletic Conference games and expected to continue 
their dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal Baptist beat SCC, 1-0, Friday, forcing the Vanguards to win twice 
Saturday to successfully defend their district title. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC came through in the first game, winning, 4-0. SCC's Beth Howard, district 
player of the year, pitched a two-hitter, facing only one batter over the 
minimum. The Vanguards scored four in the second inning against Lori Barker, 
the Cal Baptist pitcher, who shut them out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker (2-1), a rarely used junk-ball pitcher, was pressed into service during 
the tournament because the Lancers' ace Kim Sico pulled a muscle in her thumb 
in practice Thursday, and couldn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Colosimo took over for Barker in the third inning and gave up only one 
hit the rest of the way. Colosimo (17-4-1) continued her mastery over SCC 
batters in the second game, taking a no-hitter into the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC, which batted .324 this season, managed only two singles. The Vanguards 
had a baserunner in each of the last four innings, but weren't able to break 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit well the entire season; it just didn't happen this weekend," SCC 
co-Coach Bekki Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Baptist (36-9-1) advances to play host to second-ranked Hawaii Pacific in 
a regional playoff May 13-14. The winner will advance to the national 
tournament in Columbia, Mo. SCC has a slight chance of qualifying for the 
national tournament with an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Point Loma 2-6, Southern California College 0-2 -- Augie Pena was two for 
three in the second game for host SCC (18-18, 8-12), which had six hits in the 
doubleheader.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Hills' Brett Nista set an Orange County record for career hits Saturday 
as the Hawks swept a nonleague doubleheader from host Aliso Niguel, 9-2 and 
10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista, who passed Shawn Green's mark of 147 hits in the second inning of the 
second game with a triple, had four hits to reach 149. Green, the Tustin 
graduate playing in the Toronto Blue Jays' organization, set the record in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista, a senior shortstop, had one hit in the first game and three in the 
second game. Nista, a four-year letterman, has signed a letter of intent with 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron DeVito led Laguna Hills (12-11) in the first game with two hits, including 
a home run and five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 9, Cypress 1 -- Esperanza (12-11, 7-6) scored seven runs in the 
fourth inning to seal the victory. The game, which was suspended Friday because 
of rain, was resumed Saturday in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Bingham and Jeff Roth each had three hits for Esperanza, and Chris 
Stretch had two hits, including a double and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 3, Los Alamitos 2 -- Mike Villegas' two-run single in the third inning 
tied the score for Katella (15-8-1, 9-4), and Drake Gustafson followed with the 
go-ahead RBI single in the fourth inning. Gustafson finished with three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunset League:

Johnson hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning to lead the Seahawks (13-10, 
6-6).

Ocean View. Jim Brewer, top pitcher for the Oilers (16-8, 7-5), gave up five 
runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Century League tennis: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 12 2/3, Orange 8 1/3 -- Canyon's No. 2 doubles team of Warren Wang and 
Andy Chou rallied to win the first set and later the third set to clinch third

RENT WATCH: TOO MANY VISITS TO DISABLED MOM UPSET NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My 82-year-old mother shares an apartment with me. Because she has 
arthritis and a heart condition and requires several medications throughout the 
day, my sister and my cousin check in on her periodically while I am at work. 
They heat her meals, administer her medication and do quite a bit to cheer her 
up. We cannot afford a full-time attendant, and Mama prefers family anyway, so 
this seemed like the best possible solution. Unfortunately, last week a nosy 
neighbor complained to the manager that I have too many guests, and I just got 
a warning notice. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: It is extremely important to discuss this situation with the manager 
as soon as possible. Perhaps she will show more understanding once she knows 
about your family's situation. If she needs persuasion, point out to her that 
under the Fair Housing Act of 1988, your mother, as a disabled person, is 
entitled to the home support services she needs and that family members can be 
invaluable in providing disabled and elderly persons with assistance and with a 
comforting and supportive presence. If other tenants have concerns about noise, 
foot traffic or parking, these can be specifically addressed while your 
mother's needs are also accommodated. You may wish to contact your local fair 
housing agency for additional information or support. Can Manager Refuse to 
Rent to Deaf Person? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am deaf and I use a TDD (telecommunication device for the deaf) and 
American Sign Language to communicate with others. I was unable to rent an 
apartment recently because the manager would not talk with me through the 
interpreter that I brought with me. The manager said that he didn't know who 
would get the apartment, but that he couldn't be bothered with always having to 
deal with a third party where I was concerned. This is not the first time that 
I have encountered this situation. Do I have any recourse? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Fair Housing Act was strengthened in 1988 with an amendment that added 
people with mental and physical disabilities to the list of protected 
categories. The act requires that housing providers make reasonable 
accommodations in their rules, practices, policies and/or services to give 
people with disabilities equal access to use and enjoy the dwelling units of 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 In your case, the manager's failure to make a reasonable accommodation to your 
disability by allowing an interpreter to facilitate communication, constituted 
a violation of the law. If you need additional help, call your local fair 
housing agency. Project Sentinel, which answers the state-funded Housing 
Discrimination Hotline (415-HOUSING), now has a TDD number for the deaf and 
hard of hearing, which is (800) 321-9484. To reach other fair housing groups in 
your area, call the Pacific Bell phone relay system, (800) 772-3140. Is Rent 
Due If Tenant Never Moved In? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I agreed to rent my apartment to a young couple who signed a month-to-month 
rental agreement a month before they were supposed to move in. They immediately 
paid the first month of rent and the security deposit. Eight days before they 
were to move in, they called me and asked for their money back, saying that 
they changed their minds. Do I owe them a refund? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because they agreed to become tenants by signing the rental agreement, 
their month-to-month tenancy can be terminated with a 30-day written notice. 
Although a written notice is required by law, you may consider their call as a 
30-day notice to terminate their tenancy. Since they did not move in, they owe 
you 30 days of rent beginning with the day after they called. Since the couple 
did not move in, you cannot charge them for damages or cleaning expenses; 
therefore, you should return their full security deposit within 21 days after 
they called you. In the meantime, you must try to re-rent the unit. If a new 
tenant moves in before the end of the 30-day period, you should refund adjusted 
rent starting with the day the new tenant moved in.

HOT PROPERTY: HITTER TOUCHES BASE ON 2 COASTS

 New York Yankees outfielder DANNY TARTABULL has purchased a home in Malibu for 
about $2.5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull, one of the best power hitters in baseball, is in the second year of 
his five-year, $25.5-million contract with the Yankees. He, his wife Kellie and 
their three children have been bi-coastal for some time, with homes in New 
Jersey and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves Malibu and just wanted a larger house there," said co-selling agent 
Clive Egdes of Jon Douglas Co.'s Studio City office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull, 31, bought a former Malibu Showcase House, with seven bedrooms in 
nearly 9,000 square feet. The hillside home, built a couple of years ago, has 
an ocean view from every room and an underwater view of its swimming pool from 
a window in the changing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,700-square-foot master suite occupies the entire third level of the 
home, and it has two conversation areas and a marble fireplace. There is a 
circular entry-courtyard on the grounds with a fountain and flower gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull has had plans since the spring of 1992 to build an 11-bedroom, 
27,000-square-foot home on three acres in Rancho Santa Fe Farms, with a batting 
cage, water slide, indoor/outdoor pool and 11-foot-deep saltwater aquarium with 
a net separating sharks and swans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still has his property down there, and it might be where he eventually 
retires and builds," Egdes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull leased out his former Malibu home for six months, at $5,000 a month, 
to some victims of the Northridge earthquake. Egdes and Paul Skikne, of the 
Douglas Co.'s Brentwood office, represented Tartabull in leasing out his home 
and buying the new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim and Bobette Halverson of Jon Douglas Co., Malibu, and Myra Nourmand of 
Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented the sellers of the home that 
Tartabull just bought. The sellers built the home for themselves, then decided 
to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu retreat of DINAH SHORE, who died at 76 in February in her Beverly 
Hills home, has come on the market at $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as cheery and sunny as you would expect of this lovely lady," said Carol 
Rapf of Jim Rapf & Associates, who co-listed the home with Jerry and Jack 
Pritchett of Pritchett Realty. Both firms are in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore, who earned nine gold records and 10 Emmys as well as a Peabody, had a 
succession of TV shows from the 1950s until the 1990s. Known for years as "TV's 
reigning Southern songbird," the Tennessee-born entertainer hosted musical, 
variety and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the Malibu home from director George Seaton in 1978. Seaton, who 
died in 1979, directed the films "Miracle on 34th Street," "Charley's Aunt" and 
"Airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1962 and later remodeled by Shore, the 4,500-square-foot house, which 
has an elevator and media room, has a guest wing with three bedrooms and three 
baths in addition to a master suite that occupies the entire second floor, 
except for a small artist's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which has 42 feet of beachfront, has a dining area on the ocean side 
of the house. Shore loved to cook and did so often on her talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Malibu home also has a dining area off the kitchen that has a large round 
table, built by actor George Montgomery, with a Lazy Susan in the middle. 
Montgomery, who was married to Shore for 18 years until they divorced in the 
1960s, was at her side, with their two grown children, when she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer/songwriter MELISSA ETHERIDGE, who won a Grammy last year for her rock 
song "Ain't It Heavy," has purchased a Hollywood Hills home for about $1.3 
million, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Etheridge bought the house from Edward R. Pressman, co-producer of the Jack 
Nicholson film "Hoffa" and the late Brandon Lee film "The Crow." Pressman 
bought a home in Santa Monica last year for slightly more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The hacienda-style, walled and gated home that Etheridge purchased has four 
bedrooms in about 3,000 square feet, and was built in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 TERENCE YOUNG -- who directed such James Bond films as "Dr. No," "From Russia 
With Love" and "Thunderball" -- has put his villa in France on the market. It 
is for sale at $4 million and for lease, during the Cannes Film Festival this 
Thursday through May 23, at $2,000 a day. 
</P>

OSCAR-WINNING AD: 'BIG STAR LIVED HERE!'; 'THE TRADES': WANT TO RENT A RUSTIC 
WRITER'S RETREAT NEVER LIVED IN BY RICHARD GERE AND JUST VACATED BY A BIG-NAME 
DIRECTOR? CHECK THE REALTY ADS IN THE HOLLYWOOD TRADE PAPERS.

<P>
 One of the best ways to take a city's measure is through the real estate 
classifieds. Sifting through the hyperbole and maddening abbreviations (N/S 
tns. cts., anyone?) often reveals, with brutal accuracy, a town's unwritten 
social credo, its de facto class borders, as well as the aspirations of its 
citizens and their economic health. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this truer than in Los Angeles, in which where you live is 
challenged only by what you drive as a measure of status and station. And in a 
town dominated by the entertainment industry, it's fitting that some of the 
most telling, and weirdly amusing, real estate classifieds appear in Daily 
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. Real estate ads in "the trades" often 
betray a show-biz bent as aggressive -- and loopy -- as a screenwriter pitching 
"Die Hard IX" to a jaded producer: 
</P>
<P>
 "If Trigger Had Found This Place, He'd Have Left Roy!" "Nr. Fox and Sony." 
"Walk to Studios." "Looking near CBS?" "Ask about our special for SAG-AFTRA 
members." "Tara in West Hollywood." "TV Exec Moves to Connecticut -- Must Lease 
Now!" "Big Producer Sez 'Sell My Bel-Air Lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There are ads that tag all of the bases on the status infield and end up 
sounding positively surreal: "This perfect location with its Scottsdale-like 
business district is sought after by Hollywood celebrities, writers and artists 
as well as discerning horse owners." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even reverse snobbery. "Richard Gere," sniffed an ad for a Hollywood 
apartment building, "Does Not Live Here." 
</P>
<P>
 "No where else would you find 'Richard Gere Does Not Live Here,' " said Mark 
Wood, a real estate advertising account manager at Daily Variety. "That's 
typical of the flavor of the ads in the entertainment trades." 
</P>
<P>
 Why advertise real estate in the trades? Their circulation in California -- 
21,315 for Daily Variety; 19,000 for the Hollywood Reporter, according to 1992 
Audit Bureau of Circulation figures -- is minuscule compared to mainstream 
publications, such as the one you are reading. But, as both trade papers never 
tire of pointing out, they boast rarefied clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Variety's supercharged promotional copy promises "the power players who 
shape, influence and direct the entertainment industry." The average Daily 
Variety reader, according to Daily Variety, is 43 years old, earns $299,500 and 
owns a home with a $622,400 market value; 62% of their readers fly first class, 
44% drive a Jaguar, Mercedes, Porsche, BMW or Lexus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Reporter, of course, has a somewhat different spin. "I will tell 
you where we differ from Daily Variety," declared Lynne Segall, the Hollywood 
Reporter's associate publisher. "We keep hearing from the brokers that the 
higher priced the property, the better the response is from the Reporter." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper's audience research, she said, shows that "the Reporter has a little 
higher readership with executives, directors, producers." Then Segall drops the 
bomb. "I think Daily Variety has high readership with lots of actors and 
actresses," she says, adding parenthetically that lots of actors and actresses 
don't make lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "A portion of our readers are talent, but over 65% of them are management at 
corporations," countered Catherine Silver, Variety's North American sales 
director. "Our readers are the upper echelon of Los Angeles. Their income level 
is a documented fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Both papers have partisans, although not necessarily for reasons that make 
killer copy in the media kit. "I prefer the format of the Reporter," said 
Stephen Shapiro, a Beverly Hills realtor. "It doesn't come folded in half." 
And, he said, "I think everybody reads both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get incredible clients by going with Variety," said Lenore Rice, manager of 
the Wilshire Villa, a Westwood apartment building that reserves 10% of its 
units for the short-term rentals favored by the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rice and Shapiro have had luck with show-biz styled ad copy. An ad for 
the Wilshire Villa in Daily Variety featured the headline: "The Nominee's Home 
Away From Home!" and a lengthy list of past tenants, including "Olympia Dukakis 
(Super Star)" and "Alice Cooper (rock star)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried 'Oscar's Home Away From Home' but the Academy Award people told me I 
couldn't do that," Rice said. "I said, 'Come on, my brother-in-law's name is 
Oscar.' " Rice eventually settled for the "Nominee" come-on. "That little word 
helps," she said. "That's what industry people are looking for. They want to be 
where the winners are. And we've had lots of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro found success with headlines in the 
give-it-to-me-in-seven-words-or-less style of studio buccaneers. "It makes for 
good reading," he said with a shrug. His firm's Hollywood Reporter ad for a 
$3-million "authentic hacienda" in Bel-Air, for example, was: "Famous Director 
Relocates to New York." The approach, Shapiro said, was "surprisingly 
effective. We showed (the house) to 10 people in a couple of hours. Two of them 
showed up with the ad in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, when weekend film grosses are reported, and Friday, a traditionally 
strong day for classifieds, are the days of heaviest real estate advertising. 
"Tuesday," said Daily Variety's Mark Wood. "Box office day. Very high 
readership." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooting out the serendipitous-sounding ads that seem to appear only in the 
trades is a favorite sport of devoted readers. Who among the faithful hasn't 
wondered about the "Hansel & Gretel cottages built by Charlie Chaplin for stars 
to live in while filming his movies" that crop up every few months in both 
papers? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who actually answer the ads are directed to a gated lot on Formosa 
Street south of Sunset Boulevard. Winsome-looking stucco cottages framed with 
serpentine rust-painted timbers open onto a cobblestone courtyard. An enormous 
rubber tree shades the east end of the compound. Aaron Knudson, a music student 
in Hollywood who trades his carpentry skills for rent, gives a tour. "Check out 
that stove," he said proudly, pointing to a Silent-Era number that could have 
been used in "The Kid." "Tenants say it boils water faster than a modern one." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Larry Davis, who owns and is restoring the structures, Chaplin 
crony Douglas Fairbanks is a former tenant, along with Rudolph Valentino and 
Judy Garland.

CRITIQUE; SEWAGE TREATED TO FINE DESIGN; HYPERION PLANT PROVES ESSENTIAL PUBLIC 
WORKS DON'T HAVE TO BE BORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Whiteson writes on architecture for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architecture, it is said, is society made visible, and the architecture of the 
1980s was, like the times, flashy, flamboyant and overwhelmingly selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 In that boisterous decade many of our best architects poured their talents and 
ideas into the design of opulent private residences and hotels, trendy eateries 
and boutiques, and corporate skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the few major public projects completed in Los Angeles in the 
1980s tended toward such high-profile, icing-on-the-cake commissions as the 
Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, as the private sector economy has faltered, the 
pendulum has swung back to a concern with a more socially responsible and 
public kind of architecture. Increasingly, top local designers are turning 
their attention to the buildings that support civic life. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the series of recent projects designed for the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power by architect Mehrdad Yazdani has won national 
recognition for excellence. And many new local schools, recreation complexes, 
fire stations and other public facilities have attracted some of our best local 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles architect with the longest track record and most respected 
reputation in the design of public projects is Anthony Lumsden. As head of 
design for Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall, a major Los Angeles-based 
engineering and architecture company, Lumsden has for the past decade been 
responsible for the design of more than 30 buildings in the $2-billion program 
for upgrading Los Angeles' Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 The 144-acre Hyperion plant along Vista del Mar treats most of the sewage 
generated in Greater Los Angeles. It is the workhorse of a system serving 4 
million people in a 600-square-mile area. When completed, the upgraded plant 
will eliminate all the untreated waste that is now pumped into Santa Monica 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings in the Hyperion complex are easily among the best designed 
contemporary buildings in Los Angeles. Using strong profiles, bold colors and 
sculptured details, Lumsden has created a simple yet distinctive style superbly 
suited to the essential functions these buildings serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumsden's Hyperion buildings are excellent architecture in a context in which 
design considerations are often ignored. These powerfully honest structures 
don't disguise the nature of their functions, yet neither do they flaunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's more mature and sophisticated to develop a kind of style that 
doesn't hide what goes on inside these places, and find a way to turn that into 
interesting architecture," Lumsden said. "After all, the quality of our lives 
directly depends upon these facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 A mature sophistication is most manifest in the 10 largest buildings Lumsden 
has designed at Hyperion. These are a headworks building that controls the flow 
of crude sewage; an electrical switchyard and cryogenic plant; a 
compressor/operations facility; a utility compressor facility; an intermediate 
pumping station; a service facility; a technical support facility; a thickening 
facility; a parking structure and warehouse building. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumsden's design strategy in all of these buildings has been brilliantly 
simple. To keep costs low he developed a "modular kit of parts," a series of 
repeated units that can be economically constructed by reusing the same 
concrete molds over and over. This modular repetition has allowed him to 
develop elaborate structural profiles with concave and convex surfaces that 
provide a variety of shadows and highlights over extended building frontages 
that would otherwise be visually boring. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking of Lumsden's Hyperion structures is the 
compressor/operations building, a 200-foot-long structure sitting between the 
aeration basins where the active organic sludge is clarified for secondary 
treatment into inert matter. The building has been elaborated into an 
eye-catching fantasia with aluminum rooftop drum-rolls and loops of exposed 
piping, terminating in a dramatic end elevation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumsden has also worked his visual magic on other Hyperion facilities. The 
concrete-clad warehouse building has been enlivened with sloped, metal-clad 
roof surfaces that sparkle in the sun. The switchyard building features a 
sculptural profile with artful concrete and metal extrusions in bold primary 
colors, and the technical support facility explores the drama of concrete in a 
manner at once sturdy and light-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lumsden's main concerns has been to make Hyperion a better neighbor to 
its residential surroundings. (For many years the plant has been so 
deliberately anonymous it hasn't even been named in the standard Thomas Bros. 
map of the area.) 
</P>
<P>
 The vivid, sculptural forms of the new buildings are intended to enhance the 
quality of their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Hyperion complex is among his best work, its architectural 
honesty and aesthetic vigor is typical of Lumsden's style. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 65, and recently retired as head of design for DMJM, a position he held 
since 1965, Lumsden has always pursued the same central obsession: to explore 
the sculptural possibilities of the exterior skins of buildings and the ways in 
which they express what goes on inside. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the finest examples of this exploration occurred in the 1984 
administration building for the Tillman water reclamation plant at Sepulveda 
Dam. In this award-winning design, a rolling metal and glass membrane cascades 
like a waterfall over a bare-bones concrete structure bordering the lake in a 
Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Even earlier, Lumsden experimented with curved and sinuous building skins in 
several Wilshire Boulevard commercial high-rises, including One Park Plaza, 
3250 Wilshire Blvd., completed in 1971, and Manufacturers Bank (also known as 
Roxbury Plaza) in Beverly Hills, completed in 1974. In these towers, the glazed 
enclosure broke free of its structural skeleton to meander in sensuous 
undulations, which relieved the monotony of the standard commercial glass box. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Lumsden has developed a highly personal style admired by his 
peers. This is a unique achievement for a designer working within the corporate 
structure of an international company mainly concerned with the kind of 
large-scale engineering and architecture projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumsden's design signature is a kind of "Techno-Expressionism" -- a high-tech 
architecture infused with flowing shapes. While staying true to his early 
Modernist roots, Lumsden has evolved a flexible design vocabulary that can 
express a romantic kind of emotion even in buildings as workmanlike as those at 
Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style focuses on developing productive responses to complex realities," 
Lumsden said. "I see the buildings I've designed at Hyperion as the 
confirmation of my belief that architecture can be simultaneously bold, moving 
and useful."

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: SUN POWER PURIFIES SWIMMING POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: The chlorine in my swimming pool irritates my eyes and skin. Can I 
use free solar energy to power a "no-chemical" pool purification system. What 
new purification systems are available? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Pool purification chemicals not only irritate your eyes, skin and harm 
your hair, but there is growing concern about the long-term health effects of 
chlorine chemicals on the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several solar-powered ionization purification systems that allow you 
to reduce chlorine usage by up to 85%. These reduce chemical costs and the 
quality of the pool water is often better than drinking-water standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The small solar cells in the ionization system produce the required 
low-voltage electricity for free. Also, 120-volt ionization systems are 
available that operate for only about $5 of electricity per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ionization systems produce very low concentrations (less than 0.5 parts per 
million) of silver and copper ions in the pool water. This is harmless to 
people and animals, but lethal to bacteria and algae. Ionization purifiers have 
been used from Roman Empire times to today's space missions. 
</P>
<P>
 One solar purifier, called a Floatron, floats on the surface of the pool. It 
is about one foot in diameter with a solar-cell panel built into its top 
surface. A small copper/silver rod sticks out from the bottom into the pool 
water. This gives off the ions when the sun shines on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, you use a simple ion test kit to measure the concentration level. 
When it reaches the correct level, remove the Floatron from the pool. Depending 
on your pool and weather, you typically have to float it only every other week. 
You'll soon learn how often you must float it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another solar-powered model, called Solarcide, uses a separate, small 
(one-square-foot) solar panel that mounts next to the pool. It is connected by 
fine wires to the silver/copper rod in the pool strainer. 
</P>
<P>
 This design comes in several sizes for various size pools. Large models have 
several solar-cell panels and rods. There is also a new durable solar-cell 
panel for above-ground pools. You can lay it flat on the deck for maximum sun 
exposure and you can walk on it without damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-volt models provide automatic control over the ion concentration 
level. You simply adjust a dial to control the continuous copper/silver ion 
output. The voltage going to the electrodes is very low, so there is no 
electric hazard.  
</P>
<P>
 SOLAR-POWERED ION PURIFIER Solar cell panel for free low-voltage power Ring to 
secure to pool side Replaceable copper/silver rod Purifier rod gives off copper 
and silver ions when sun shines Permanent spring electrode Entire unit is one 
foot in diameter Attaches with thumb screw Write for Utility Bills Update No.

COLUMN LEFT/ FRANCES KISSLING: FOR CATHOLICS, IT'S 'HAPPY MARTYRS' DAY'; THE 
BEATIFICATION OF TWO WOMEN WHO SACRIFICED FOR THEIR CHILDREN SENDS THE MESSAGE 
THAT SUBMISSIVENESS IS WHAT COUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES KISSLING, Frances Kissling is president of Catholics for a Free 
Choice, based in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a feminist critic of the Vatican, I have at times harbored secret doubts 
that I am too hard on the leaders of my church, too hackneyed in my charges 
that hatred of women and fear of sexuality are at the root of Vatican positions 
on birth control and abortion. Could it not be true, as these male leaders now 
frequently claim, that they are genuinely motivated by respect for all life?  
</P>
<P>
 Events of the past few weeks have silenced my misgivings: Misogyny is alive 
and well at the Vatican; women's lives still rank at the bottom when it comes 
to respect, much less value. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 24, Pope John Paul II crowned this year's Vatican campaign to 
articulate a so-called traditional vision of family and women's roles therein 
by beatifying two women who would serve as "models of Christian perfection." 
Beatification, a status high on the ladder to sainthood, signals the Vatican's 
approbation of the honored one's life -- or death. "We wish," said the Pope, 
"to pay homage to all those courageous mothers who devote themselves 
unreservedly to their families and who suffer to bring their children into the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough, my moderated side says; you are always demanding that the Pope 
pay homage to ordinary women. Now he has done so and still you complain, seeing 
sexism behind even the most benign acts. But look at what's considered special 
about these two near-saints' lives, and think about the significance of holding 
them up as models, especially for young women. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, Gianna Beretta, an Italian pediatrician pregnant with her fourth 
child and suffering from a lethal uterine cancer, insisted that, if necessary, 
her life should be sacrificed for that of her unborn child. Of course, the 
sacrifice became necessary, and in 1962, she died so that her child might live. 
</P>
<P>
 I respect that choice; I would equally respect a woman who chose to live. I 
have a nagging suspicion, however, that in beatifying Gianna Beretta, the Pope 
is instructing us in the difference between a good mother and a bad one: A good 
mother will give her life for an unborn child; a bad mother might think that 
preserving her life would better serve her family and community. And only a 
very bad woman might think that she deserved to survive even if she had no 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I tell myself, Gianna Beretta's decision could be interpreted as 
heroic. But the second beatification is unambiguously disturbing. Elisabetta 
Canori Mora, a Roman who died in 1825, remained in a marriage where her husband 
abused her and finally abandoned her to care alone for their children. 
"Elisabetta Canori Mora," the Pope said, "showed, in the midst of numerous 
conjugal difficulties, her total fidelity to the commitment assumed in the 
sacrament of marriage and responsibilities deriving from it." For staying in a 
lousy and destructive marriage, she is on the road to becoming a saint. Now 
there's a good role model for Catholic teen-age girls. Consider, too, the 
context for the selection of these two women: The Vatican has been trying to 
influence the agenda for this fall's U.N. conference in Cairo on population and 
development. The Vatican delegate to a recent preparatory meeting sought to 
delete the notion of "safe motherhood" as an important health goal. In a 
restrained mood, I chastised myself for thinking that if you are not for safe 
motherhood, you are for unsafe motherhood. But these two beatifications 
reinforce the message that the Vatican does not value women's safety in 
childbearing and family life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are countless bricks in this ancient edifice of misogyny. Another recent 
example: Church officials were asked whether a man who had AIDS could use a 
condom to protect his wife from the transmission of the disease. This couple, 
the Vatican responded, is called by God to abstain from sex. If they find 
abstinence an impossible strain on their marriage and do have sex, they may not 
use a condom. Saving the marriage is more important than saving the woman's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of respect for women and the palpable aversion to sexuality are 
timeless. Read the words of St. Paul: "Let a woman learn in silence with all 
submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she 
is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not 
deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet woman will 
be saved by bearing children." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul was wrong, especially on the last point. In this church, it takes 
more than bearing children to pass the test of blessedness; total 
submissiveness is still the rule.

RESIDENTS PROTEST SITE FOR SEPTIC TANK SEWAGE; SANITATION: THEY SHOW UP AT A 
CITY-SPONSORED OPEN HOUSE AT THE NEARLY COMPLETED FACILITY AT THE SEPULVEDA DAM 
RECREATION AREA. IT'S ON HOLD PENDING STUDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 100 people, some wearing paper surgical masks, gathered at the 
Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area on Saturday to punctuate their opposition to a 
nearly completed central dumping site for septic tank sewage that has been put 
on hold pending environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted in November to delay for one year approval 
of the facility, situated within an existing water-treatment plant. Homeowners 
and environmentalists had successfully pointed out that the environmental 
report was made prior to construction of the $2-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A city-sponsored open house was held at the facility Saturday to describe -- 
using maps and photographs -- 17 possible alternate disposal sites and to 
explain the review process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Ireland of Van Nuys, president of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda 
Basin, said neighborhood groups were left out of the process of paring the list 
down from 70 sites to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot be trusted now to be forthright," Ireland said while standing 
next to five tall concrete stalls built to accommodate trucks that would 
dispose of residential septic waste from around the San Fernando Valley and 
nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't drop this site now, we will take the fight to the City Council 
and other government bodies," Ireland said to television cameras and protesters 
who chanted "Save the basin, Dump the dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Harris, a public relations consultant for the project, told the crowd, 
"We are looking at all sites. . . . There is no predetermined decision that 
this (facility) will ever be used." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary objections involved traffic -- the estimated 90 to 200 daily 
truckloads of waste that would enter the parkland off Woodley Avenue -- and 
potential contamination of parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Septic waste is now dumped into manholes in the Valley area. Sanitation 
officials have said the central dumping site at the Donald C. Tillman Water 
Treatment Plant would allow them more control over what is dumped into city 
sewers and let them charge septic tank disposal companies for the real costs of 
treating the waste. 
</P>
<P>
 At a small building where the open house was held, at least two dozen 
protesters went inside to look at maps and fill out forms with their 
suggestions or objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Francis of HDR Engineering, a firm participating in the environmental 
review, said that on Wednesday engineers will start gathering samples at 
existing dumping sites. "We will see what they are actually dumping into the 
manholes," Francis said.

<P>
 A New York City narcotics detective and two friends have been arrested in the 
rape of a 26-year-old woman they met at a local nightclub, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Police Detective Thomas John Kid, 27; John James Calimano, 27, and 
Richard Daniel Haime, 28, all of New York City, were arrested Thursday by 
Burbank detectives as the three men stood in line at NBC Studios for a taping 
of the Jay Leno Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank woman told police that she was raped early Thursday morning after 
she asked the men for a ride home from a popular dance spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men are each charged with rape, forced oral copulation and false 
imprisonment and are being held in lieu of $1-million bail each at Burbank City 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the three men were vacationing in California and staying 
at a local motel. They checked out soon after the alleged sexual assault and 
checked into another motel in Orange County, returning to Burbank to attend the 
Leno taping, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Police Department has temporarily suspended the detective, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are scheduled to be arraigned in Burbank Municipal Court on Monday.

INSURANCE EVEN TOUGHER TO FIND SINCE THE RIOTS; COMMERCE: AS MANY AS HALF THE 
BUSINESSES IN CENTRAL LOS ANGELES MAY BE WITHOUT POLICIES. CRITICS BLAME A LACK 
OF CARRIERS IN THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Should a major fire or other calamity befall his Boyle Heights auto parts 
store, Arturo Velazquez would see 21 years of work go down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last June, his business was insured for several years by a 
Caribbean-based company that was one of about 10 firms illegally selling 
policies in California. The bogus companies were exposed in the aftermath of 
the riots, when more than 100 business owners wound up with worthless claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Velazquez says, several insurance carriers have refused to cover 
him, saying that the stoves of a small diner next to his store at 1st and St. 
Louis streets create an excessive fire risk. Those companies willing to provide 
fire and liability coverage have quoted annual premiums of about $3,000, nearly 
twice his old rate and far more than the 65-year-old entrepreneur can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to hope that nothing happens," Velazquez says, "or else you're 
out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining insurance -- whether for automobile, home or business -- has for 
years been an iffy proposition in central Los Angeles. Today, two years after 
the riots left a swath of destruction across the central city, commercial 
insurance has become even more difficult to purchase. As many as half of the 
businesses in the area may be uninsured, based on surveys of area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two insurance carriers active in selling commercial policies in the inner city 
went out of business because of riot-related claims, and other firms that 
historically have been skittish about writing policies in the area are even 
more so now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, the industry has become a lot more leery," said Javier Rodriguez, 
an independent South Gate insurance agent who has been selling policies on the 
Eastside and in southeast Los Angeles County since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and brokers say the lack of commercial insurance can stifle 
business growth and retard economic development. For instance, even those 
businesses that can get insurance in central Los Angeles face premium costs 15% 
to 30% above that charged in more affluent parts of the city, creating little 
incentive for them to move to or open new branches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of carriers in central Los Angeles has fostered veritable insurance 
monopolies for the area, contributing to inflated premiums, critics of the 
industry say. 
</P>
<P>
 Further exacerbating the problem, they say, is that the void left by the 
departure of many legitimate insurance carriers has frequently been filled by 
unlicensed agents and companies that knowingly sell bogus policies.  
</P>
<P>
 The overall problem, according to state officials and insurance watchdog 
groups, is the result of years of redlining, the practice by which companies 
refuse to sell policies in poor or predominantly minority areas. Carriers 
redline by declining to write policies and refusing to contract with minority 
independent agents in certain ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the insurance industry blatantly discriminates against the 
inner city," state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said last month at a 
California Department of Insurance public hearing on redlining in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry representatives contend that the problem is not redlining 
but affordability. Because low-income neighborhoods often have higher crime 
rates and other risks, they say, premiums are more expensive and beyond the 
reach of many residents and business owners.  
</P>
<P>
 "Redlining may indeed exist. But if it does, it is to a limited extent and is 
far overshadowed by the affordability issue," said Richard Wiebe, the 
Sacramento-based spokesman for the American Insurance Assn., which represents 
270 carriers nationwide. "I have yet to hear anyone at any public hearing say 
they could not obtain insurance" because of redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 George Bivins, a board member of the Black Business Assn. and an independent 
agent who has been selling insurance for 25 years in the central city, said 
that some insurance carriers redline central Los Angeles by not allowing their 
policies to be sold by independent agents in the area at any price. 
Affordability is an issue, he said, because it is a direct result of redlining. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He added that independent agents sometimes take the brunt of criticism for 
high costs. "We just have to try to explain to them that the rates are 
established by the company and not us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bivins says that when he worked for Farmers in the late 1970s and early '80s, 
the carrier told him that he could not have his office in central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told my office had to be in Playa del Rey," Bivins told lawmakers at 
the recent hearing on redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Farmers, which along with other agencies has been openly 
criticized by state officials for allegedly discriminatory practices, denied 
Bivins' assertion. "It is completely untrue," said Farmers spokesman John 
Millen. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlining is difficult to prove because the state mandates few disclosure 
requirements for insurance companies. But under new state insurance regulations 
proposed by Garamendi that become effective this month, carriers will be 
required to file annual reports detailing the ethnic and racial breakdown of 
their customers, the number of policies they decline to write in specific areas 
and language skills of their agents, among other information. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major milestone in the fight against redlining," said Bob Gnaizda, 
general counsel for the Greenlining Coalition, an alliance of minority and 
consumer organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other measures -- a state bill sponsored by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) and federal legislation by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II 
(D-Massachusetts), both of whom attended the Insurance Department's hearings 
last month in Exposition Park -- would require similar disclosures by the 
insurance industry to determine the extent of redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 For small-business owners such as Velazquez, the issue is more than a 
philosophical debate over redlining versus affordability. Unable to obtain 
comprehensive coverage for whatever reason, they liken each workday to a game 
of economic Russian Roulette, where any unforeseen tragedy could spell the end 
for them and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a neighborhood store. We don't make that much," says Velazquez, who 
along with his 21 years in business has about $80,000 invested in his 
Mechanical Auto Parts store, which he operates with his wife, Eva. "We can't 
afford to pay too much for insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been uninsured since his broker informed him almost a year ago that he 
was no longer covered and would have to switch insurance companies and pay 
twice the annual amount of his previous policy, or about $3,000. He said the 
broker did not explain why he would have to obtain new insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 His former policy was with Pacific Fire & Marine Insurance, a Caribbean-based 
carrier that had been writing policies in the area without a license. The 
California Department of Insurance last year declared the firm ineligible to do 
business in the state. The department has no data on whether policyholders were 
able to collect losses from Pacific Fire & Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazquez was unaware that the company was illegally operating in the state 
until it was pointed out in a recent interview.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be damned!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he paid a $1,668 annual premium for several years, Velazquez counts 
himself lucky because he never suffered insurance losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others were not so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, 110 small-business owners -- most of them Korean Americans -- 
filed a lawsuit against about 50 insurance firms, wholesale brokers and agents 
who allegedly reneged on about $15 million in unpaid claims after the 1992 
riots. The lawsuit is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the merchants is Young Ki Kim, 47, who saw a business worth about 
$400,000 go up in flames when his liquor store at 95th and Figueroa streets 
burned to the ground the first night of the unrest. Kim had assumed that his 
annual $1,000 premium covered him for up to $550,000 in liability and fire 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 His insurance carrier was First Assurance & Casualty Co. Ltd. of the Turks and 
Caicos Islands, a small British colony in the West Indies. The firm was 
declared insolvent last year and ruled ineligible to do business in the state 
by the Department of Insurance. The lawsuit claims that the carrier is 
responsible for about $7 million in unpaid claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim says the company was recommended to him by friends who also owned 
businesses. When he found out that he had been duped, Kim said, he approached 
his broker. "He told me, 'I did my best.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has a bachelor's degree in agriculture and dreams of owning a farm far 
away from the crowded neighborhoods of the central city. In the meantime, he 
has started a new business with the help of a $200,000 disaster loan from the 
U.S. Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from behind thick, bullet-resistant glass, Kim operates a small gas 
station and convenience store in a neighborhood just south of Koreatown. He 
purchased a $3,000 annual fire and liability policy from Twin City Fire & 
Insurance Co. He found out about the carrier from a list provided the 
Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 No areawide analysis has been conducted to determine how many central Los 
Angeles businesses are uninsured. But consumer groups say two narrower surveys 
conducted after the riots offer a fairly accurate picture of the overall 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Insurance interviewed 1,859 business owners who suffered 
riot losses. Of those, 890 -- or 48% -- said they had no insurance. Another 
survey conducted by the Wilshire district-based Korean-American Grocers Assn. 
found that about half of its 3,300 members had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other riot victims, the Villa family had insurance for its 
South-Central flower shop, which was looted and burned the first night of the 
violence. But family members say their insurance carrier, Allstate, canceled 
their policy after it paid them the $14,000 for which they were insured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fair," said Maricela Villa, who operates the business near 
Manchester Avenue and Main Street with her husband, Luis. "This is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate spokesman Al Orendorff said the insurance company was unable to 
locate records indicating whether the Villas' policy was dropped. He said the 
carrier would be willing to write a new policy for the Villas or anyone else in 
South-Central provided they do not constitute an excessive risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that we take our urban business customers lightly is not true," 
Orendorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maricela Villa said that when the shop reopened last year, the family was 
unable to obtain insurance from a major carrier and had to take out a policy 
with the California Fair Plan.

PRIEST RELIEVED OF DUTIES AT SCHOOL; BELLFLOWER: PARENTS OF CHILDREN AT ST. 
BERNARD'S AND CHURCH OFFICIALS QUESTIONED HIS HANDLING OF FINANCES AND 
PERSONNEL. HE WILL REMAIN AS PASTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Catholic priest who has led St. Bernard's parish and elementary school in 
Bellflower for 19 years has been stripped of much of his authority by church 
officials who questioned his financial practices and personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Philip J. McGrath, 66, will remain pastor at the parish. But another 
priest is scheduled to take control Monday of parish finances and management of 
its school, which has an enrollment of 300 students in kindergarten through 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which has touched off a series of protests and has divided 
parishioners, came on the heels of an investigation by the archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Elizabeth Galt, who headed the inquiry, told about 200 
parishioners at a meeting April 29 that she was concerned about the budgeting 
process at the 71-year-old parish and the frequent turnover of principals at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Five principals have headed the school since 1987, when the parish began 
hiring outside administrators instead of appointing clergy members. McGrath had 
notified principal Kathleen Flynn, who arrived last year, that she would not be 
rehired. But the archdiocese overruled the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese also will conduct an internal audit of parish finances, a 
spokesman, Father Gregory Coiro, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath maintained that he has done nothing wrong, and said he was shocked by 
the archdiocese's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This I never thought would happen," he said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched after parents complained to the archdiocese 
that thousands of dollars of financial support earmarked for the school 
apparently had been spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the parents said the school received only a fraction of the 
money generated by bingo games at the parish, even though the bingo license 
filed with the city says the proceeds should benefit "grammar school 
education."  
</P>
<P>
 City records show that the bingo games at St. Bernard's raised $286,487 from 
July, 1992, to June, 1993. But, parents said, school budget documents showed 
that the school received only $24,430 in bingo proceeds during that fiscal 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 McGrath could not be reached for comment on the distribution of bingo 
proceeds, but he acknowledged after the April 29 meeting that the parish has 
been making payments on new buildings, including a school library, parish hall 
and rectory. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buildings are only two years old, and we're trying to pay for them," 
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, city records show, St. Bernard's application for a city bingo 
license was modified to list "grammar school education/parish needs" as the 
charitable purpose. The change angered some parents, who say the school should 
be the sole beneficiary of the weekly fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Galt said Flynn would be rehired as principal for at least the 
1994-95 school year. Galt said McGrath had failed to follow "correct 
archdiocesan procedures" in evaluating the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The trimming of McGrath's authority and the apparent endorsement of Flynn was 
met with boos from many in the audience. Since that meeting, some parishioners 
have picketed the campus, calling for Flynn's ouster. Critics question Flynn's 
commitment to the religious aspects of Catholic education. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that students once attended Mass every week, but now attend only 
once a month. Further, they say, some classes no longer set aside time for 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see Catholic values come back to our school," said Roy Ramirez, 
whose daughter is in kindergarten at St. Bernard's. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also complain that Flynn has proposed steep tuition increases for the 
upcoming year and would eliminate discounts for families who have more than one 
child at the school. 
</P>

PAROLEE ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SHOOTING GIRLFRIEND TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested a Palmdale man early Saturday 
on suspicion of shooting his 16-year-old girlfriend to death, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Manuel Sanchez, a 19-year-old parolee, shot his girlfriend once 
in the chest at about 3:50 p.m. Friday after the couple argued in Sanchez's 
living room.Nicole Inuma, of Llano, had gone to Sanchez's house to retrieve a 
pager he had been using, said Deputy Patrick Hauser of the Sheriff's 
Headquarters Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 After he shot her, Sanchez ran to a McDonald's restaurant across the street 
from his home on 2nd Street East, deputies said. There, he put a handgun -- 
believed to be a 32-caliber, nickel-plated revolver -- inside the bed of a 
white compact pickup truck that was pulling away from the drive-through window 
and then called 911, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 That weapon has not been recovered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inuma was pronounced dead at 4:20 p.m. Friday at Palmdale Community Medical 
Center; Sanchez was arrested shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no information about Sanchez's earlier conviction, Hauser said.

LANCASTER OWNER FIGHTS TO GET PIG OUT OF THE PEN, BACK IN THE HOUSE; 
ORDINANCES: RESIDENT HAD TO PUT HER POTBELLIED PETS OUT TO PASTURE, BUT THE 
CITY HAS AGREED TO LOOK INTO ALLOWING THE ANIMALS TO LIVE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Padding around a livestock pen in rural Kern County, Black Jack, a 2-year-old 
Vietnamese potbellied pig, is homesick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He squeals in protest when his owner, Laraine Schubert, steps out of the pen 
and heads home to Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert says she would like nothing better than to take the black-haired, 
110-pound animal back to her house, where Black Jack and a second pig, Bubbles, 
grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a problem: City code enforcement officers ordered Schubert in 
March to get rid of her pets because it is illegal to keep farm animals in a 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply, Schubert moved Black Jack and Bubbles out to a friend's ranch near 
Rosamond. She gave Bubbles to the family at the ranch, but she has been working 
in recent weeks to bring Black Jack back. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, she has urged city officials to change the law, insisting that 
potbellied pigs should be recognized as house pets. And she has vowed to keep 
lobbying until the law is changed -- and Black Jack can come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not giving up," she said. "He's like a child to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at Schubert's request, the Lancaster City Council instructed the 
city staff to look into the legalization of potbellied pigs and to review the 
matter with the Planning Commission. The issue then will be returned to the 
City Council, possibly as early as July. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a final vote is months away, council members said they are leaning 
toward granting pet status to the small pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Roberts said his niece raises potbellied pigs and boasts that they 
are brighter than dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner said he sympathizes with Schubert and other fans of 
potbellied pigs. "They want to bring home the bacon," Runner quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's debate is similar to others that have occurred in many Southern 
California cities since the small pigs, which originated in China, became 
popular in the United States over the last decade. Initially, the animals cost 
thousands of dollars and were often purchased by people who merely wanted to 
show off an exotic pet. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, the pigs have proliferated; their value as a status 
symbol has slipped; their price has dropped to as little as $250, and they have 
found their way into the homes of less affluent animal lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These owners argue that their animals are pets, but city laws usually mandate 
that pigs belong in a barnyard -- not a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, city officials in Oxnard and Glendale forced owners of potbellied 
pigs to get rid of their animals. Actor Luke Perry of TV's "Beverly Hills 
90210" had to get a special permit to keep three of the animals at his Tarzana 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cities, including Burbank, Beverly Hills and Monterey Park, allow 
residents to keep potbellied pigs as pets. In 1992, Los Angeles County 
supervisors voted to allow the pigs in unincorporated residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The county law restricts owners to one pig per household. The animal must be 
spayed or neutered, wear license tags and obey the same leash law that applies 
to dogs. The pig can stand no taller than 20 inches at the shoulder and weigh 
no more than 120 pounds. It cannot be any longer than 40 inches from the tip of 
its snout to the end of its buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials may use the county law as a starting point in drafting the 
city's own potbellied-pig rules. Nearby Palmdale also may change its laws to 
allow the pigs in residential areas, but the issue is not expected to come 
before the City Council until late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Carroll, who breeds potbellied pigs at Society Swine, her farm in Leona 
Valley, hopes these cities will be even more flexible than the county and allow 
two pigs per household -- for socializing, not breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals are happier when they have somebody to talk to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, who began breeding the pigs more than three years ago, believes they 
make ideal pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't bark, they don't have fleas, they don't shed," she explained. 
"They sleep from dusk until dawn. . . . They don't attack neighbor children. 
They don't jump fences and indiscriminately breed like dogs and cats. So you 
don't have pound pigs!" 
</P>
<P>
 One drawback, she admits, is that pigs do not make good guard animals. 
"They're absolutely useless for burglar protection. They'll show the burglar 
where the jewels are." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she was cited for keeping Black Jack, Schubert says, she often walked 
him through her neighborhood without causing any kind of uproar. She believes 
an acquaintance who held a personal grudge -- not one of her neighbors -- 
reported her pigs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert said she is determined to change the law so that she can walk Black 
Jack through the neighborhood again. "I've always loved pigs," she said. "I've 
always thought that pigs were cute."

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; BORG IS NOT QUITE BJORN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Bjorn Borg is finished playing top-level tennis, as he has indicated, he 
didn't exactly go out in a blaze of glory. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to the sport in 1991 after an eight-year absence, the 
five-time Wimbledon champion and six-time winner of the French Open never 
climbed higher than No. 762 in the ATP Tour computer rankings, losing all 12 of 
his matches before deciding at the end of last year to limit himself to senior 
tournaments and World TeamTennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Still trim and fit as he approaches his 38th birthday on June 6, Borg said he 
sometimes felt lost as he tried to regain his form. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you stay away for a long period of time, it's difficult to find yourself 
on the court or to play with a lot of confidence," he said last month in 
Anaheim, where he joined Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander for a 
senior tournament. "It's almost like you forget how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Borg's goal was to again play at Wimbledon and in the French Open, he 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing or winning, that was not the main thing," he said. "Obviously, I walk 
on the court trying to win, but I had fun playing tennis again. That was the 
major thing, the most enjoyable thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 And the results? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the end of the world," said Borg, who now wears his long hair, 
flecked with gray, in a pony tail. "It's not like I'm sleepless. I would be 10 
or 15 years ago, but today it's not the most important thing for me in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors, though, said all that losing frustrated Borg. He said Borg probably 
expected too much of himself when he launched his comeback with the same make 
of wooden racket he had used to win the French Open, the last of his Grand Slam 
titles, in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left for eight years, so he went back eight years and everybody else went 
ahead eight years, so he's 16 years behind, the way I look at it," Connors 
said. "He stayed in shape, but not grinding out matches and playing competitive 
tennis, it's difficult. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "And even though I'm sure he stayed in touch with tennis, he wasn't in the 
mainstream. He came back and tried to play with the same equipment, and 
everybody else was playing with rackets as big as this room. 
</P>
<P>
 "To all of a sudden come back and see that and play against it . . . had to be 
a tough thing for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Borg quickly switched to a graphite racket, but the losses continued to mount. 
His last match, a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 defeat by U.S. Open semifinalist Alexander 
Volkov last November at Moscow, might have been Borg's most encouraging, but 
didn't change his plans to end his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not my last match," he told reporters in Moscow. "Just my last match 
. . . in the big league." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Careful what you wish for: Connors and McEnroe were considered boorish and 
childish, their behavior a detriment to the game, when they ruled tennis in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The current No. 1, gentlemanly Pete Sampras, is called boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take what you get," Connors said. "Nobody's ever satisfied, are they? 
When we came along, tennis was much different. We got it out of the country 
clubs and got the masses in there, so that 20,000 people would come and watch 
in person and millions of people would tune into the television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were under scrutiny and under complaint every time we walked out there and 
played, but now it seems a lot of people would like to still see that." 
</P>
<P>

 Venus rising: Venus Williams, widely hyped as the next big thing in women's 
tennis, is expected to make her WTA Tour debut in the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles Aug. 8-14 at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Richard, said he will seek a wild-card entry into the tournament 
for his daughter if she maintains high marks in her school work. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll tell you something, her grades are ahead of where they should be 
right now," Richard said last week from Pompano Beach, Fla. "So, if I had to 
make that decision right now, she would play. She's going out of her way to 
bring her grades (up to) exactly where they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jan Diamond, tournament director for the Manhattan Beach tournament, "If 
she plays our event, we'd be ecstatic. I'll keep my fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6 foot 2 and 130 pounds, was born in Long Beach and grew up in 
Compton before moving with her family to Florida almost three years ago. She 
will turn 14 on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father said she will be brought along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 14, Venus probably will play one or two tournaments," he said. "At 15, she 
will be allowed to play about four or five. At 16, if she's doing very well, 
she can turn professional, but she shouldn't play more than eight or nine. At 
17, she can play full-time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Diamond: "We don't mind having the exclusive (this year)."

WESTSIDE WATCH: WOMEN BALLPLAYERS PITCH NEW 'LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hit movie "A League of Their Own" chronicled the true-life story of a 
women's professional baseball league that was launched during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, amateur baseball enthusiasts, including original members of the league 
and cast members from the movie, are trying to recapture some of that past 
glory by launching a nationwide women's league, albeit amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tryouts for six teams on the Westside and South Bay, open to women 
18 to 65, attracted 20 people at Westchester High School last Sunday, said Tom 
Duarte, president of the National Adult Baseball Assn.'s Los Angeles-South Bay 
Chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that the league -- which includes 42 cities nationwide -- will 
spawn a professional women's league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it go back to where it used to be," said Pepper Paire Davis, 
a catcher in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from 1944 to 
1953 (it was disbanded a year later). "We can get back that same enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Megan Cavanaugh, who played a plain-Jane character in the movie, will be among 
the cast members who have a team called Pepper's Peaches, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 More tryouts will be held in Westchester today.

 HITTING A LOW NOTE: Santa Monica has its share of strange burglaries. But last 
week's heist at Chez Jay, a celebrity hangout and popular eatery, no doubt 
ranks among the strangest. 
</P>
<P>
 When managers arrived at the Ocean Avenue restaurant Monday morning, they 
noticed that a prized possession of owner Jay Fiondella was missing: a 
450-pound, 8-by-6-foot iron rendering of a musical note. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiondella, also a character actor, was storing the sculpture, used in the 
Robert Altman movie "Short Cuts," in a crate against the back wall of the 
restaurant. The note was a gift from the director for Fiondella's role as a 
bartender in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my days would I have thought someone would steal it," Fiondella 
said. "I'm astonished, devastated, my feelings are hurt -- I feel invaded." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, a "high-class dive," as Fiondella put it, is known for its 
pepper steaks, banana potatoes and sawdust-covered floors and is so dark "you 
don't know who you're eating with." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiondella speculated that the ironwork may have been stolen to be melted into 
scrap metal, or perhaps it's residing in the home of a Hollywood collector. He 
has offered a $1,000 reward for its return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's turning into a real Hollywood whodunit, but what I really want is to 
just get it back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said police Lt. Bill Brucker: "This is reminiscent of some college fraternity 
prank -- they must have used a pickup truck or a van and a few people to carry 
this off. If it was only one person, I wouldn't want to meet them in a dark 
alley." 
</P>

 GUNS AND ROLLS: Sparks recently flew between Reps. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) and Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), whose district 
includes Malibu, when the subject of gun control came up at a Southern 
California lawmakers' breakfast in Washington for Los Angeles-area 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead derided the federal five-day waiting period in the Brady Bill, named 
after Jim Brady, former President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was 
critically wounded in the 1982 attempt to assassinate Reagan. Brady and his 
wife, Sarah, spearheaded the successful fight to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead called the measure "a turf war between the NRA and the Brady bunch," 
and said, "The Brady Bill will do nothing to stop crime." The veteran lawmaker 
said he doesn't "believe even in shooting rabbits" but maintained that most 
criminals buy their weapons on the black market, not from licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to those who commit crimes with firearms, Moorhead said, "If they 
didn't have guns, they'd do it with knives," to which one listener muttered: 
"Did you ever hear of a drive-by knifing?" 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Beilenson said, "We do things in incremental, modest ways." He 
added that he and other Brady Bill supporters had sided with law enforcement 
officials because "they are being outgunned by criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Under rhetorical fire, Moorhead said Congress is likely to prohibit minors 
from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big deal," Beilenson shot back.

CRAM SESSIONS; SCHOOLS SCRAMBLING TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR STATE ASSESSMENT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some schools are giving students mock reading and writing exams. One school 
district formed a math program partnership with a local university. And parents 
at a Westside elementary school held fund-raisers to hire teachers and buy lab 
materials to help fourth- and fifth-graders get up to speed in science. 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the tactics that Westside educators and parents have employed 
to prepare students for this month's California Learning Assessment System 
test, a statewide exam given for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Math, reading and writing tests will be given to fourth- eighth- and 
10th-graders. Fifth-graders will take a science and social science exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's poor test results, reported in March, cast a harsh light on the 
reading, writing and math abilities of California's elementary and high school 
students. Statewide, for example, scores showed that at least one-third of 
students in each grade that was tested demonstrated little or no understanding 
of basic math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, teachers and administrators hope the scores will improve because 
they have a clearer idea of what to expect from the exam, and are preparing 
themselves and their students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, 53% of Santa Monica High School's 10th-graders last year 
scored a "three" or below on a scale of one to six, meaning that at best they 
demonstrated a superficial understanding of the text they read in the exam. In 
the writing portion, 43% of the students scored three or below, meaning that 
their writing was limited in development and included errors in grammar, 
punctuation and spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve performance, teachers devised a new approach to strengthening 
reading and writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers now ensure that all students participate in group discussions to 
analyze the literary works they are assigned. While some teachers may have used 
such discussions before, they are now more intense and stress the development 
of analytical and creative skills. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, said Carol Jago, chairwoman of the English department, the 600 
10th-graders read the first chapter of "Like Water for Chocolate" by Laura 
Esquivel. The English department faculty then devised a reading and writing 
task for the students similar to the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 The students read, then met in groups to discuss the passage. A few days 
later, relating to the plight of the heroine in the novel, they wrote essays on 
their personal experiences in overcoming obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jago said teachers spent a day reading and evaluating the exams, based on the 
state test guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the papers, and the teachers later met with the students who 
needed more attention, to prepare them for the test," said Jago. The exercise, 
she added, "helps to diminish the (students') anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that it helped prepare us," said student Jenny Pearson. "Talking 
together in a group also helped, because someone might say something you might 
not have thought of." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Culver City Unified School District, officials are using a $180,000 
California Academic Partnership grant they received last September to improve 
math education for sixth-graders, and middle and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's math portion of the CLAS test, 80% of the eighth-graders at 
Culver City Middle School scored a three or below, meaning they showed only 
partial understanding of math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a partnership with California State University Dominguez Hills, teachers at 
Culver City schools have participated in workshops and training courses. In 
addition, the three-year grant is paying for part-time math specialists from 
the university who work with the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also instituted a weekly math problem for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, explained Marvin Brown, an assistant principal at Culver City High 
School, sixth-graders and algebra students in the eighth through 10th grades 
get a math problem to work on for one week.  
</P>
<P>
 At Coeur d'Alene Elementary in Venice, fourth- and fifth-graders were given a 
sample reading and writing test a few weeks ago. Before the test, the students 
were asked to read examples of essays written by fifth-graders from other 
schools who scored among the highest in the state in last year's exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Beth Ojena said the students were asked to compare their work to the 
samples. Then, meeting in groups, they scored each other's essays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids said it really helped them, seeing an example of a good essay and 
understanding what to strive for," said Ojena. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, fifth-graders will be tested in science, a new component of the 
CLAS test. Thanks to parental support, students at Mar Vista Elementary School 
may be well-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, some of the $16,000 raised by a parents' school booster club was 
used to contract with Science Adventures, a Fullerton-based educational 
consultant that markets science education programs, complete with teachers, 
science fairs and field trips. The company provided the school two teachers, 
who instruct students and help other teachers develop lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mar Vista Elementary, said Principal Monica Friedman, is one of the few 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District that has been able to bring 
in outside resources to help teach science. Many schools don't have the outside 
money for additional teachers and science labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, fifth-graders have gone through a 15-week 
hands-on science course. During the chemistry segment, for instance, the 
students made their own SLIME, the popular gooey substance sold in toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, trying to meet the state's standards in science aptitude, Friedman 
predicted, could take years.

PETS; PARK WHERE DOGS ROAM UNLEASHES A NEW DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS FIELDS-MEYER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are too many dogs at the dog park. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the consensus these days at Laurel Canyon Park, the four-acre slice of 
canine paradise tucked in a glen off Mulholland Drive west of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many poodles. Too many pit bulls. Too many Chihuahuas. Just too darn many 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood dog lovers campaigned for years to get a place where their pets 
could run free. They lobbied, they protested, they were arrested, they were 
tried, they organized. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1988, they got what they wanted: a park where dogs can roam free, 
unshackled by leashes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only park of its kind in Los Angeles. And that, said Jane Purse, is 
precisely the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the city has never been convinced that the hundreds of 
thousands of dogs in Los Angeles need something more than four acres of a dog 
park," said Purse, the octogenarian who led the effort to create the leash-free 
zone. (Park rules still require leashes between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 When she started the push for the park in 1982, Laurel Canyon Park was known 
as an isolated, graffiti-covered hangout for gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a combination of private money and public initiative, Purse and 
Parkwatch Inc., the local activist group, got the area spruced up and fenced 
off.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, mostly dog owners from the area, waged a vocal battle with the city 
and local opposition for several years, until then-Councilman Michael Woo 
helped negotiate a compromise, setting hours when leashes are required. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the leash-free hours in April, 1988, but only after 
a lengthy and sometimes contentious battle. One of the landmarks of the fight 
came in 1985, when dog owners literally fought with animal control officers 
sent to the park to enforce the leash law. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dog owners were jailed and charged with resisting arrest. (One was 
convicted and ordered to stay away from the park.) One dramatic hearing before 
the Board of Recreation and Parks was interrupted when a neighborhood opponent 
of the dog park delivered a plastic bag full of dog droppings she had collected 
at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The woodsy glen in the hilly, upscale neighborhood is somewhat more peaceful 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 But the park may be a victim of its own success. "It's going to sink under its 
own weight," said Purse, a 40-year resident who still strolls the meadow with 
her three dogs. "And I can't tell you how that breaks my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny afternoon last week, 50 or 60 dogs wandered the grounds, cavorting, 
carousing and barking in glee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like husky day," said Mark Henrickson, a West Hollywood resident 
whose 10-month-old Siberian husky, Teina, was enjoying a good-natured tumble in 
the grass with Dusty, a 2-year-old husky owned by Arash Binafard of Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrickson said he brings Teina to the park at least three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Conn, a writer for the NBC-TV series "Mad About You," said she'd been 
visiting the park daily during the show's production hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That section over there is the worst," she said, pointing to an area in the 
middle of the expansive lawn, where a herd of larger dogs was crowding around a 
picnic table. "That's where the bigger, more aggressive dogs hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is the only park of its kind in the area, Laurel Canyon Park draws 
people from miles away. On weekends, hundreds of people and dogs pay visits, 
parking their vehicles as much as half a mile away on Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowding has brought problems, said Tom Cotter, the city park ranger who 
supervises the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I didn't say there are people who get bit, or dogs who fight 
with other dogs," he said. "Whenever you have dogs off leash and you have all 
these different dogs with different personalities, you're going to have some 
challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 And some neighbors take issue with the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Janja Vujovich, an area resident who campaigned to stop the leash-free rule, 
said the abundance of dogs has made some neighbors in the isolated area in the 
Santa Monica Mountains feel like their local park has been stolen from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park was put there as a place where people could go play ball with their 
kids," she said. "Now we have to go down the hill to Beverly Hills or Studio 
City to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and foes of the park agree that the situation could be alleviated if 
the city were to open more dog parks, but city officials say none are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gatens, an actor who heads the Parkwatch Advisory Board, says he has 
pleaded with Los Angeles officials to open other leash-free areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the golf courses," he said. "If we could have just the 16th hole 
of one golf course, so many people would be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, the park is still a haven, said Purse, who is fond of 
quoting artist David Hockney, an early supporter of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said this is 'the most joyous four acres in Los Angeles,' " she said. 
"Which indeed it was and sometimes still is and can be again."

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; CITY HOPING TO CASH IN ON WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dismiss the fact that the World Cup soccer games this summer will be played 
miles away in Pasadena. City officials have some goals of their own in mind: 
They want Beverly Hills to be the social hub of the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities may have plans to woo tourists, too, but surely none will try 
with chimpanzees, enough paella to feed 500 people or a Swiss tradition 
involving 35 wooden cows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills stepped out, realizing there is an opportunity with 
international tourists coming to the Los Angeles area," said Mayor Vicki 
Reynolds. "And Beverly Hills is one of the top -- if not the top -- tourist 
destination in Los Angeles County. We're going to take advantage of the 
opportunity to promote Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's monthlong series of special events, "Beverly Hills Salutes the 
World," is aimed at cashing in on the estimated 800,000 visitors whom World Cup 
organizers predict will spend $621 million in Southern California during the 
June 17 to July 17 tournament at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has earmarked $70,000 for street banners and other expenses to 
organize the event in which each day will honor one of 24 countries 
participating in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The events range from the exotic to the excessive. Organizers of Nigeria's 
day, for instance, hope to bring a baby elephant, cheetah, lion and chimpanzees 
to Rodeo Drive to highlight the country's wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain is going to lead a cook-off with the preparation of a 2,200-pound paella 
-- stirred with a shovel. On Switzerland's day, to symbolize the tradition, 
there will be a re-enactment of leading cows up the Alps for grazing. In this 
case, 35 life-size wooden cows adorned with flowers will be posed as if walking 
through the faux-European shopping mall of Two Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 City eateries hope to get a piece of the action, said restaurateur David Slay, 
who predicted Beverly Hills will top tourists' lists of places to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, tourists will want to see the ocean, and will visit Santa Monica. But I 
have friends in the restaurant business there, and they have never been 
contacted by anyone about the World Cup," said Slay, who is organizing fellow 
restaurateurs to promote the eateries during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the West African country Cameroon said they were thrilled 
when Beverly Hills approached them to join in the events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly boosted our morale," said Sequoia Mercier, the local spokeswoman 
for JEMEA, a group of about 200 Cameroon artists who will promote their 
country's culture during the games. They will hold an art exhibition in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials said Beverly Hills would not be cornering the market on 
entertaining visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't see (Beverly Hills) as competition. We believe more people 
will want to stay here since we're the venue city," said Denise Nelson Nash, 
the city's World Cup coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it has been estimated that 1.6 million people will visit Pasadena -- 
100,000 spectators per game in the Rose Bowl. Nine games have been scheduled 
for the stadium. Pasadena will hold 30 events for residents and visitors during 
the monthlong tournament, which culminates in the championship match July 17, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills is quite a trek for some people," said Nash. "But the more 
activities and excitement surrounding World Cup, the better for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds agreed, up to a point. Beverly Hills, she said, is simply better 
known around the world than Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the numbers of tourists they expect, there is plenty for everyone. But I 
just think that with so many international tourists, their natural focus is 
here in Beverly Hills." SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; SKATERS ROLLING COAST TO COAST TO FIGHT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorists found an unusual source for a traffic backup Wednesday morning on 
Sunset Boulevard: A small group of colorfully clad in-line skaters was bound 
east for New York, hoping to raise AIDS awareness along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS has become part of the noise, just another one of society's ills. (Yet) 
people are still being infected with HIV, even in the communities hardest hit 
by the disease," Brent Nicholson Earle, organizer of the Rainbow Roll for the 
End of AIDS, a cross-country skate aimed at promoting AIDS education and 
prevention, said at a news conference in William S. Hart Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle, a longtime New York-based AIDS activist, is best-known for running a 
9,000-mile solo marathon around the perimeter of the United States in 1986-87 
to raise AIDS awareness. This time, he is doing the same thing with in-line 
skating, popularly known as Rollerblading. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle and six other skaters, including West Hollywood resident Roddy J. Shaul, 
began their trek in San Francisco on April 29, and hope to arrive in New York 
by mid-June to coincide with the Gay Games IV, a sporting event for the gay and 
lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew has charted a winding course through other big cities such as 
Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago and Philadelphia, where they hope to pick up more 
funding and skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they ride in a van over harsh terrain -- "Finding skateable roads is 
very difficult," Earle said -- but their spirit never wanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaul, a 38-year-old junior high school teacher, sees the trek as the 
culmination of a personal attempt to come to terms with his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out of the closet several years ago, it changed my life 
completely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving Los Angeles for the next stop, Palm Springs, the skaters 
received a proclamation from the city of West Hollywood and unfurled a 
signature square from the AIDS Memorial Quilt. Earle knelt and wept as he 
scrawled a message in memory of Swen Swenson, a Los Angeles AIDS activist who 
died of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liken this to the children's crusade," he said as he prepared to lace up 
his skates for the morning jaunt on Sunset. "We're flying without a net -- on a 
wing and a prayer, you might say." SCOTT COLLINS

<P>
 PROJECT ADDITION -- After a three-hour hearing, the Los Angeles Planning 
Commission voted to approve a 335-unit addition to Barrington Plaza despite 
concerns by opponents -- including city planners -- that the $60-million 
project is too large for the Wilshire Boulevard site. The commission's 3-1 vote 
Thursday means the proposed 24-story project will return in one month with 
specific conditions for final commission approval. From there, it will go to 
the City Council, where Councilman Marvin Braude will reiterate his opposition 
to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 DAY-CARE CENTER -- Approved a resolution that will allow an existing day-care 
center at 7301 W. Manchester Ave. in Westchester to expand, enabling the center 
to care for up to 47 children. Run by the Southern California Assn. of the 
Seventh-day Adventist Church, the center currently cares for 20 children. Some 
neighborhood residents complained that the expansion would increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 BIKE DAY -- Approved a resolution declaring May 19 to be Bike Day L.A. Its 
purpose is to encourage businesses in the city to develop programs that will 
promote riding bicycles to work. 
</P>
<P>
 STREET CLOSURE -- Approved temporary closures of the following streets May 15 
from 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the Spring Farm Festival sponsored by the 
Hollywood Farmers Market: Morningside Court between Selma Avenue and Sunset 
Boulevard, Cosmo Street between Selma Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, and Selma 
Avenue between Cahuenga Boulevard and Ivar Avenue. The festival will feature 
horse-drawn hayrides, music and a Western-style barbecue. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 SECURITY GUARD UNIFORMS -- Approved a motion that would allow off-duty Los 
Angeles police officers the option of wearing their LAPD uniform when employed 
as security guards at entertainment venues. It was thought that an officer in 
an LAPD uniform presents a more authoritative figure than one in a security 
guard uniform. Passed 14-0.

LINDA FELDMAN; AFTER 20 YEARS, HE'S MAKING HOUSE CALLS AGAIN AT VENICE CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people navigate their way through life plotting every step. By contrast, 
Dr. Bill Holden is an explorer of the opportunities that come his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider how he first got involved 20 years ago with the Venice Family Clinic, 
a nonprofit group that offers free health care to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil Rossman, who started the clinic, called me," Holden says. "After a few 
minutes on the phone, he said, 'Oh, by the way,' and starts to explain why he 
started the clinic. I remember thinking that I don't want to know about it. I 
told him I hope it's a success and was ready to get off the phone and he tells 
me he's having a problem getting doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden agreed to come the following week after work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he was a 60-and-something internist with a thriving Beverly Hills 
practice of 20 years. Then, the Venice Family Clinic functioned only at night 
because during the day the premises were used by the UCLA dental school. It had 
two volunteer nurses, two doctors, a pharmacist and a closet with cardboard 
boxes filled with doctor's medical samples that were collected by volunteers 
from physicians in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurse took me to one of the examining rooms which, of course, had a 
dental chair in the middle of it," Holden recalls. "I sat down and a 
10-year-old comes in. His eyes were popping out of his head. He had Graves 
disease. I asked him, 'How long have you been sick?' and he said, 'Two years.' 
He had never been to a doctor. It really bothered me that a kid this age with a 
terrible problem went untreated. It really disturbed me and because of that I 
came back regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden admits there were many nights over the next eight months when he was so 
exhausted he didn't want to go to the clinic. But he knew people counted on him 
and he went anyway. Then one night the nurse broke the news that he was the 
only doctor on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I couldn't handle the whole clinic myself and tried to leave," he 
said. "There were 25 people waiting, some for three hours. So I stayed, saw all 
the patients and arrived home after midnight. That was it. I was finished. I 
kissed the place goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, two decades later, Holden is back. After selling his practice three 
years ago, he realized he still wanted to be a doctor. So he began volunteering 
again at the family clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot has changed at the Venice Family Clinic, which is now housed in a new 
18,000-square-foot facility serving 12,000 patients per year. Five-hundred 
physicians donate their time. "I couldn't believe it," Holden said. "Beautiful 
building and full-time doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden feels that the most important factor in being a doctor is to like 
people. "Most doctors dislike people," he says. "Can't wait to get rid of them. 
The good doctors are the ones who like people, the lousy ones don't." 
</P>
<P>
 When Holden sees patients at the clinic he uses the same procedures he used 
when he was in practice. He brings them into the consulting room first and 
chats rather than have them wait for him wearing a paper wrap, uncomfortably 
perched on an examining table. Says Holden: "The most important thing is 
treating people well." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Holden can't remember when he decided to become a doctor. He says it was 
not when, at the age of 17, he lost his mother to a botched surgery or, six 
months later, when his father died of a heart attack. As a kid growing up in 
New York City there was only one thing which occupied him completely: playing 
baseball. If it weren't for his older brother, he says, he probably wouldn't 
have gone to college. They took the subway to New York University to enroll him 
there but the lines were too long, so they took the train to Long Island 
University, which he attended for two years until someone told him about 
Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He spent six years there, getting 
undergraduate and medical degrees, and returned to New York for a residency at

 Bill Holden has no complaints about life. Patients from 25 years ago still 
call him and seek his advice, he attends lectures and accompanies physicians on

something, accomplished something. It sounds highfalutin, but I feel I'm paying 
back what the public did for me."

RAPE ALLEGATIONS SPARK CONTROVERSY AT POMONA COLLEGE; DISCIPLINE: MAN FACES 
SCHOOL BOARD AFTER STUDENT CLAIMS HE ASSAULTED HER 2 1/2 YEARS AGO ON A DATE. 
CASE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHT TO CONDUCT SUCH HEARINGS.

 As Pomona College students file forward to receive their degrees at the 
school's commencement ceremony May 15, one graduating senior will be wondering 
whether the diploma is his to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a female student filed charges with the college disciplinary board, 
accusing the senior of date rape in an incident 2 1/2 years ago. Although she 
concedes that she never objected to having sex with him, she says she did not 
consent to it and was left traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 No police report was ever filed in the Pomona College case; no criminal 
charges were ever brought against the man. For that reason, The Times is 
withholding his name. The woman is not identified because Times' policy is not 
to name victims of rape or alleged victims of rape. Both students declined to 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Under school rules, the accusations pending before the college disciplinary 
board -- made up of 10 students -- could lead to expulsion. The accused student 
sued in court and won a stay of the board's hearing that allowed him to 
graduate but left open the possibility that his degree could be revoked if the 
disciplinary panel later finds him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has put college judicial procedures on trial, raising questions about 
the line between private discipline and public justice: How much authority do 
private colleges have to issue judgments on what might otherwise be criminal 
charges? To what extent can or should they regulate students' behavior? And can 
they deny a defendant at a disciplinary hearing an attorney and other rights 
guaranteed in the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions such as those have been under debate at colleges around the 
country. A Yale University basketball player who was expelled last year for an 
alleged rape sued the school over its disciplinary procedures. And a student 
accused of rape at Valparaiso University in Indiana demanded $12 million in 
compensatory and punitive damages, claiming the school violated his rights by 
excluding several defense witnesses from his hearing on the charge. The cases 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Even advocates of women's rights are split on the Pomona College case. A USC 
law professor who is an expert on gender law says she finds so many faults with 
the accusations that she fears the case will cause some people to discount the 
whole idea of date rape. But some students at the prestigious Claremont 
Colleges, which includes Pomona College, have held an ongoing vigil to protest 
the delay in the hearing on the charges, saying that the case typifies subtler 
forms of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Because date rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute, schools have created 
rules that are broader and easier to enforce than criminal codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our standard of proof is clear and consistent evidence," said Ann Quinley, 
the Pomona College dean of students. "It is possible for someone to be found 
guilty in a college hearing when they would not be in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rosen, the accused student's attorney, said the college should not be 
deciding the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not set up to deal with this charge, which is a very serious felony," 
Rosen said. "It's not the proper forum for that. . . . Do you really think if 
someone had been killed on this campus, this jury of juniors and seniors would 
convene to determine if it was premeditated or they acted in self-defense?" 
</P>
<P>
 The woman met the man at a Halloween party in 1991, when she was a freshman 
and he was a sophomore, she said in a written statement to the college's 
disciplinary panel. They were both drinking heavily, and at his suggestion they 
left the party for his room, where they began kissing and he undressed her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not explicitly consent to have intercourse with him, but 
never objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she said, "I lay there in shock and scared and mentally frozen." The 
incident has troubled her ever since and always will, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, she expressed her shock and anger to him, and said he seemed 
sorry and sympathetic. Their occasional interactions afterward "could not have 
been more civil," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two years later, though, she decided to bring disciplinary charges 
against him, although she did not explain the reason for the delay. The accused 
man was summoned to appear before the disciplinary panel on April 22, but filed 
a lawsuit against the school protesting the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20 a Superior Court judge stayed the hearing until May 24 -- allowing 
him to graduate. Last Friday the college filed an appeal, which was denied 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne said she would decide then 
whether the hearing will proceed. She added, though, that school rules 
prohibiting the student from bringing an attorney to the college hearing aren't 
appropriate in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a serious charge, and the circumstances are seriously open to two 
divergent interpretations," Wayne said. "He is entitled to an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations for rape is six years, Wayne noted, so the student 
conceivably could be charged after the hearing. And if the accused student 
speaks at the hearing, his testimony could be used against him in a criminal 
trial, she said. Although the student would not be forced to testify, Rosen 
said declining would limit his client's ability to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has the right not to self-incriminate," Rosen said. "He has the 
choice between waiving his privilege and giving his version of events at the 
disciplinary hearing or remaining silent and foregoing the right to defend 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona College's attorney Keith Johnson argued that the student code of 
conduct is independent of criminal law. And, he said, the claim that the 
hearing violates the student's due process rights "would apply to public, but 
not to private institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges "have a very long history dating back to the Middle Ages of autonomy 
in regulating their own environments," said Gary Pavela, an education lawyer 
and director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland. "It's 
particularly important in an allegation of violence that the college be able to 
determine for itself who can use its facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 While the events described in the female student's statement may be a 
violation of the student code, University of Southern California law professor 
Susan Estrich said it most likely would not hold up in criminal court as date 
rape or any other crime. And that sets a dangerous precedent that could hurt 
those accused of rape and those victimized by it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the facts are so weak, because she waited 2 1/2 years, (because) 
there was no force used, (and) by her own statement she never clearly and 
unequivocally said no . . . to turn around and say to this young man you're not 
going to graduate from college is really unfair," Estrich said. "And it 
provides ammunition to conservatives who would like to turn back the clock 
completely on date rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges recently have been crafting conduct codes that redefine rape and 
related conduct. At Antioch College in Ohio, a rule requiring students to 
obtain explicit mutual consent before exchanging even a single kiss became the 
butt of "Saturday Night Live" skits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona College's rules on sexual assault define consent according to the 
California penal code as "positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to 
an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes that a step further, adding; "Consent requires a clear, explicit 
agreement to engage in a specific activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at Pomona College say their campus rule requiring explicit 
consent is not a joke, but an important safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's too much gray area, and the rules they're making reduce the 
gray area," said William Clarkson, a recent graduate. "I guess it would reduce 
the risk of date rape, which is a very real threat."  
</P>
<P>
 Students learn about that rule in a workshop the first week of their freshman 
year, Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all part of the basic social contract," said senior Eumi Lee, who has 
participated in protests against the hearing's delay. "If these charges are 
true then he has violated that."

MATERIAL GAINS; FASHION INSTITUTE PLACES 2,000 STUDENTS A YEAR IN JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Lew is an up-and-coming fashion designer who has won accolades for his 
contemporary men's and women's clothing lines, which are sold at specialty 
stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But he likes to emphasize that he is a California designer, born and raised in 
Southern California, trained in Los Angeles and committed to staying here. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to know California has a (fashion) identity," said Lew, 27, a 
graduate of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, based Downtown. 
"For some reason, we don't get the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Los Angeles is now the top apparel market in the country, having 
surpassed New York in terms of annual retail sales, said Tonian Hohberg, 
founder and president of the institute, an accredited private college with an 
annual enrollment of 3,000. Hohberg points to the success of such major 
California-based manufacturers as Levi Strauss and Guess and cites an April, 
1993, article in Apparel Industry Magazine that reported that the state's 
fashion-apparel industry has seen employment increase by more than 22,000 jobs 
since 1978, even as national apparel employment figures have declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hohberg said that the institute -- which is celebrating its 25th anniversary 
-- and graduates such as Lew and his wife, Doris Tong, are integral parts of 
the L.A. fashion industry's past and future economic successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, we're placing close to 2,000 students in full-time jobs" in the 
fashion industry, Hohberg said. "We're a big part of L.A.'s future. There's a 
magic to the city. It's certainly a city of tomorrow, and not of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of ethnic minorities and international students at the 
institute may also be key to the institute and the fashion industry's future 
success. The school has been a magnet for Asian students and, to a lesser 
extent, Latino students, even though Hohberg said the school does not actively 
recruit in foreign countries or in local minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the students are minorities, Hohberg said, with more than 400 
students coming from 39 countries, a fact she attributes in part to Asia's 
reverence of the California fashion industry and closer ties being forged among 
Pacific Rim countries. Despite Los Angeles' image problems triggered by reports 
of crime, "Asia is still so excited about California," Hohberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hohberg herself remains excited and optimistic about Los Angeles as a 
place to do business -- and run a school. The fact that the institute finally 
moved out of rented buildings three years ago and into a new $35-million 
building at Grand Avenue and 9th Street is a symbol of her commitment to and 
faith in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our industry is growing like crazy, and I really believe in Downtown L.A.," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Hohberg saw promise in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 26-year-old graduate of a merchandising college in her home state of 
Ohio, Hohberg in 1969 sought to open a fashion and merchandising college that 
truly prepared students for the apparel industry. She considered several 
locations -- New York, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta as well as Los Angeles -- 
but was won over by the interest, support and commitment of industry leaders 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in two Downtown classrooms with a handful of merchandising students, the 
institute today has three other campuses -- in San Francisco, Costa Mesa and 
San Diego -- in addition to the main campus at 919 S. Grand Ave., near the 
garment district and close to manufacturing firms. Students from all over the 
world work toward two-year associate of arts degrees in fashion design, 
interior design, apparel manufacturing management, cosmetics and fragrance 
merchandising, merchandise marketing, textile design, and visual 
presentation-space design. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students are selected each year from the graduating class for a 
third-year, advanced-study program in fashion design, interior design and 
theater costume. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is run like any other college, with general studies, night classes 
and even English as a Second Language courses. Tuition is comparable to that of 
other local private schools, and scholarships are available. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes the institute different is the emphasis on hands-on vocational 
training in addition to academics. Students are encouraged from their first day 
of study to find part-time jobs in the industry. The school's placement office 
works diligently to help undergraduates, graduates and alumni find industry 
work, Hohberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimate that 96% of their 18,000 alumni work in the 
industry, most of them in Los Angeles and other parts of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lew and Tong, who run their business, Imaginary Concepts, out of a 
studio near Little Tokyo, the school boasts a number of major alumni success 
stories. For example, Karen Kane's 14-year-old namesake clothing firm, based in 
the city of Vernon, today grosses $80 million annually. Marlene Stewart 
designed costumes for "Falling Down," "JFK," "Terminator II" and other movies. 
And Joyce Johnson designed Levi's Dockers for Men. 
</P>
<P>
 Hohberg also hires working industry professionals -- designers, pattern makers 
and the like -- to teach and keep students updated on trends and information. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lew: "You're not being taught by a dinosaur. We always had young, 
exciting teachers . . . in touch with current times. They taught me to be . . . 
way out there, very avant garde. 
</P>
<P>
 "During one project, one teacher told me, 'Mike, this looks like so-and-so. 
Pull into yourself and delve into your own identity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The faculty also stresses learning the industry's technical aspects like no 
other fashion school, said Lew, who looked into several East Coast fashion 
colleges before deciding on the institute. "Someone has to teach you how to 
pattern. . . . They taught us to be business people and creative people."

SLAYING OF STUDENT ROCKS WASHINGTON HIGH -- AGAIN; CRIME: BASKETBALL PLAYER 
ANTONIO LEWIS IS FOURTH STUDENT OR RECENT GRADUATE TO DIE VIOLENTLY THIS SCHOOL 
YEAR. 
</P>

 Washington High School is in mourning again. This time students and staff are 
grieving for basketball player Antonio D. Lewis, who was shot in the back 
outside a Gardena house party he attended just four days after his 18th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 One other student and a recent graduate of the 3,000-student school in South 
Los Angeles were shot and killed in the last three weeks. Another student was 
killed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When is it going to stop?" asked tennis Coach Sylvia Collins. "It's just 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Principal Marguerite P. La Motte: "The entire student body has been 
traumatized." 
</P>
<P>
 They have good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, senior Michael Nasir, a member of the school's hip-hop club, 
was shot in the back on his way home from his girlfriend's house. Graduate 
Wallace Dumas, who played for the Generals' 1991-92 basketball team, was shot 
and killed by suspected gang members in front of his home while working on his 
car. La Motte said Dumas was mistaken for a gang member. And last fall, Ibn 
Shadeed-Glenn was shot in his home, a victim of a domestic incident, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel drained," La Motte said. "It's really difficult to describe the number 
of students who are getting killed. No one seems to find out who (the killers 
are). You reach a point where you don't know what to say to the other 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' death probably has had the most impact, because several Washington 
students witnessed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis attended a party with two friends when some intruders tried to crash the 
party. Lewis stood outside and witnessed a fight between the party crashers and 
some party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey Lewis, 37, a U.S. Postal Service supervisor, said the party crashers 
approached his son and demanded to know where the youth was from. He said his 
son's friends, who were at the party, told him that Lewis failed to respond and 
was told: "Today, you're going to regret you came here. You belong on the other 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the party crashers flashed a gun, Lewis ran down the street while 
others fled into the house. He was shot in the back and he died at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center, according to a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena police said Lewis apparently had no gang ties, and Lt. John Fodor said 
there are no suspects in the killing. "Based upon what we know now, we cannot 
determine if it is a gang situation," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some of the party-goers said gangs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Lewis, 36, described her son as quiet but friendly. "He liked to stand 
off in the corner and let other people do the talking," she said. "People 
thought he was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son liked to collect basketball and football cards, and he 
dreamed of having a son to give the cards to. He planned to attend college to 
play basketball and then raise a family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonio was a real good boy," she said. "Two months ago, he told me that I 
would never have to tell him to do something twice. I said, 'What, Tony? Are 
you doing something wrong?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'No, I'm going off to college and I know it's time to act 
responsible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' mother said she and her husband had warned their son about attending 
house parties. "I said, 'Antonio, I don't like house parties because they can 
get out of hand,' and he says, 'Ma, I will always try to stay out of trouble 
and watch my back.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He never messed with anyone. That's why I can't understand why my son is 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a 6-foot-2 1/2-inch starting forward for the Generals, averaged eight 
points and six rebounds in his senior season. He played basketball as a 
sophomore and part of his junior year at Gardena before he moved to Minnesota 
to live with an uncle. Lewis returned to Los Angeles to be with his family 
because he was homesick; his parents were planning to return to their hometown 
of Memphis, Tenn., but were delayed while they tried to sell their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students walk by, see me and start crying," Washington Coach Andy Davis said. 
"In the 21 years I've been here, I've never seen so many people grieving. It's 
a combination of all the deaths that happened this year. Everyone has known at 
least one of the kids who have died." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball Coach Rodney Tange of Gardena said Lewis was a typical teen-ager. 
"He got along well with everyone," Tange said. "I was shocked when I heard the 
news. It's unfortunate to keep saying it, but I think he was just in the wrong 
place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' girlfriend said she received a telephone call early the morning after 
the shooting from one of Lewis' friends. "I cried when I heard the news," she 
said. "He was going to be my prom date. Normally, he doesn't go to house 
parties, but his friend said he thought it was safe." 
</P>
<P>
 A press conference is scheduled for Monday at the Washington High gymnasium to 
discuss the dangers high school students face in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 La Motte has invited Mayor Richard Riordan, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams, County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke, ministers and media to 
discuss solutions with selected Washington students. A charity basketball game 
will follow with proceeds going to the Lewis family. Lewis' jersey, No. 30, 
will be retired at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable, a fine young man like that," said Collins, the tennis 
coach. "It shattered me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people need to witness death from a closer view and not standing away 
holding a gun. Maybe then they will understand what it is like to take a life 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is also survived by his half-sister, Latoya, 19, and sisters Stacey, 10, 
and Yolanda, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial was held for Lewis on Saturday at Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's 
Witnesses. Lewis was to be buried today in his birthplace of Memphis.

ORGAN DONORS FEW, WAIT LONG FOR MINORITIES; HEALTH: NEARLY 700 AFRICAN 
AMERICANS AND LATINOS IN THE COUNTY AWAIT NEW KIDNEYS, BUT THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 
200 POTENTIAL DONORS FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Eva Duvall, overcoming her failing health required pain and sacrifice -- 
seven operations, a rigid diet and no swimming or other activities she enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, Duvall has a new, fully functional kidney, after waiting since 1991 
for a successful transplant. Now she's ready to get on with life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was going through all those problems I really felt down," said Duvall, 
44. "Now I can think positive and be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Beteta of Watts has had similar luck. After nearly three years of being 
on dialysis while awaiting a kidney, Beteta, 26, received a successful 
transplant in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Duvall, who is African American, and Beteta, who is Latino, are the 
exceptions rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Many minorities wait as long as five years for organ transplants, about twice 
as long as the average wait for white patients. Although transplantation is an 
increasingly successful procedure, the number of organ donors is stagnant and, 
especially for minorities, not nearly enough to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Public awareness campaigns such as last month's National Organ and Tissue 
Donor Week usually spur only a minor increase in donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last six years, the number of donors has remained relatively flat" 
nationwide, said Elizabeth Flynn, community relations director for the Regional 
Organ Procurement Agency (ROPA). 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 5,000 people nationwide have signed up to become donors, Flynn 
pointed out, but there are more than 34,000 people awaiting transplants. In Los 
Angeles County, 1,470 patients are awaiting organ donations. Latinos account 
for 31% of that figure, and 17% are African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 700 blacks and Latinos in the county are awaiting new kidneys, the most 
commonly transplanted organ. But there are only about 200 potential donors in 
the two communities, 21% of them Latino and 8% African American, according to 
ROPA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, 72 names are added to the list of people needing donors, and every 
day, seven or eight people die waiting for donors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beteta was fortunate because his more common tissue type gave him a 50-50 
chance of having a successful transplant. Many minority patients, especially 
African Americans, have a smaller chance of getting organs with similar tissue 
types because of the limited number of donors from those racial or ethnic 
groups, said Dr. Lilly Barba, medical director of the renal transplant program 
at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvall was especially lucky to get her kidney as quickly as she did. Because 
of a high antibody count, it was probable her body would reject a kidney, said 
Barba, who treated Duvall during her dialysis. A January, 1993, transplant 
failed five months later, and she was forced to return to dialysis until her 
latest transplant, done late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always hoped I would get a kidney, to get off dialysis. I look at the 
number of people still waiting, and I know that I was blessed," Duvall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Flynn of ROPA: "The tragedy is, we can save these lives, but we can't 
without the donors."

HOMEOWNERS ANGRY ABOUT RVS; BUT CAMPER DWELLERS DENY THEY'RE THE SOURCE OF 
PROBLEMS ON RIVERSIDE DRIVE 
</P>

<P>
 Knock on Betty West's front door and Blondie, her cocker spaniel with large, 
chocolate pools for eyes, comes bounding out to greet you.  
</P>
<P>
 A well-stocked spice rack can be seen through West's kitchen window, which is 
adorned with cheery flowered curtains. She has most of the creature comforts of 
the average homeowner -- a television, a freezer for stocking food, a water 
heater. 
</P>
<P>
 But West is no ordinary Echo Park homeowner. Her home sweet home is on four 
wheels -- a 1973 truck camper -- that for eight months she has parked on 
Riverside Drive, just south of Fletcher Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of neighboring property owners, West has plenty of compatriots. 
As many as 20 recreational vehicles and vans have come to park on Riverside 
Drive over the past few years, forming a community of transients that has 
neighboring property owners concerned and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owners, who last year formed the Riverside Drive Neighbors' 
Alliance, say the ragtag RV encampment has blighted the busy street. They 
complain of RV residents urinating, defecating and littering along the street, 
accosting passersby for money and intimidating property owners by gathering on 
front steps and in the yards of homes. Residents of the encampment have also 
been blamed for a rash of car burglaries and graffiti in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The encampment has posed a dilemma for property owners and Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg's office. Rather than shooing the RV residents away with "No Parking" 
signs and aggressive police patrols, Goldberg's staff has been searching for 
city-owned property where the campers could establish a more permanent 
community, much like the Dome City near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, they are a part of the community. . . . They've been in the 
area as long as six years," said David Hershey-Webb, a member of Goldberg's 
staff. "They are our constituents. It's a careful balancing act." 
</P>
<P>
 But some area property owners are angry that the council office has tried to 
accommodate the campers. They were appalled when Hershey-Webb provided trash 
containers along the street, and many are outraged over a plan under 
consideration by Goldberg's staff to place portable toilets along the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not property taxpayers like I am," said Ray Jarvis, who owns two 
rental properties on Riverside Drive. "You get a bunch of homeless people and 
line them up in front of your home, and the value of your home depreciates." 
</P>
<P>
 But the campers say they have little other choice. West, for example, says she 
has a heart condition that prevents her from regular employment. She lives on a 
monthly Social Security check of $690, which she says is not enough for her to 
afford an apartment or house rental, or even a space in a mobile home or 
trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pay twice as much for a space in a trailer park as what I paid for an 
apartment in Houston," said West, 45, whose words are softened with a slight 
Texas drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 The campers say the close-knit RV community, which includes families and 
people of all ethnic backgrounds, actually helps the neighborhood by cleaning 
up litter, keeping an eye out for crime and scaring away would-be taggers.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the dining room/living room area of West's camper one recent 
afternoon, West and fellow RV resident Stan Carpenter scoffed at accusations 
that their community is the source of crime. "We try to keep it clean. We sweep 
the sidewalks, pick up the trash around us . . . and watch out for each other," 
West said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if we were criminals, wouldn't we leave?" Carpenter, 34, said. "Why would 
we break into someone's place right here where we're staying too?" 
</P>
<P>
 West and Carpenter also discounted charges that RV residents urinate and 
defecate on the street and private property, saying most of the vehicles have 
toilet facilities. But West acknowledged that some of the residents, herself 
included, don't know where official sewage dumping stations are. West said she 
empties her septic tanks in portable toilets around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 West and Carpenter both said they have considered moving to campgrounds, but 
they found that parks charge $7 to $20 per night without electricity and water 
hookups. Most of the Riverside RV residents could probably afford to pay only 
about $50 a month for a space, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 West said she spends less than $20 monthly for her "utilities," which consist 
of a propane tank to run her stove, water heater and refrigerator, and a 
battery for her electric appliances, which include a television and lights. A 
gas station at Fletcher and Riverside drives provides a pay telephone, and most 
RV residents have post office boxes for their mail. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the occasional hassles of life in a mobile home. City laws prohibit 
parking on the street for more than 72 hours at a time, so RV owners must move 
their vehicles every three days, Carpenter said. But parking enforcement and 
police officers have been fairly lax about issuing parking tickets, the campers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many property owners initially felt sympathy for the campers, but over time, 
frustration over the sanitation and crime problems and the transients' 
attitudes has clouded the compassion, said Micheal Frances, founder of the 
30-member Neighbors' Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not the classic homeless; some want to live this way," said 
Frances, who purchased a duplex on Riverside Drive six years ago and says he 
has had a hard time finding renters to move in. "One guy is a dog lover who 
lives with five or six dogs in one van. He spent $900 to have one dog's hip 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all started out wanting to be compassionate. . . . My heart goes out to 
people in need. But now, we want them gone."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; PROJECT IS POSITIVE SIGN FOR GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing against a backdrop of pale white and brick buildings at USC, Robert 
Moreno smiles at the contrast of a wall of bright green, orange and black 
aerosol paintings nestled in a small campus courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "People associate graffiti with drugs, violence and gangs and that's not 
true," said Moreno, 27, who attends USC's Graduate School of Architecture. 
"There's a difference between the scrawling on the side of the freeway and this 
work, which involves composition and technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno began the project last May, after spending hours walking along the 
railroad yards along the Los Angeles River. After seeing block after block of 
graffiti-covered walls, Moreno began to think of ways to incorporate graffiti 
into architecture -- and a master's thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started asking some of the kids what prompted them to do (graffiti) and 
they said it was a way to express themselves," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno decided to use his knowledge as an architect to create a model train 
station that included a graffiti art center. 
</P>
<P>
 That led Moreno to build a wall where artists could express their visions. 
Nearly 76 spray-paint cans later, the first part of Moreno's project has taken 
shape with the help of five young artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-by-24-foot wall that serves as a canvas for Man, Krash, Precise, Acme 
and Vile reveals images of Los Angeles from the perspective of its youths. A 
man falling out of a toppled skyline, and a face emerging from a spray-paint 
can are two of the scenes they've cast. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moreno is anxious to work on the second phase of the project, which would 
include converting an abandoned East 4th Street warehouse into a light-rail 
station and community center where local youths could practice their art. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that vision that attracted Krash, a 21-year-old art student at Cal State 
L.A. whose work is part of the wall. "This gives an alternative to the youth 
and a way to get into art," said Krash, who began painting near the Santa Fe 
Railroad yards in the early 1980s and is among the artists taking part in an 
urban design exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles beginning 
May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers in these areas today can't associate with Michelangelo or 
Picasso," he said, "but they can associate with our art. And 20 years from now 
graffiti will be recognized as an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said that he remains optimistic that others will adopt some part of the 
project into a design scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what he's is doing is great," said Maya Emsden, manager of ART, a 
Metropolitan Transportation Agency-sponsored public-arts program. "The interest 
is to create an alternative for young artists, whether that be in oil, 
watercolors or aerosol." 
</P>
<P>
 The wall at USC has already attracted the attention of Felix Padron, a 
public-art adviser who is trying to have the wall placed in Pacoima. Padron, a 
graduate student at USC, is developing a mural project for graffiti artists in 
the Valley. Moreno admits that his concept may not appeal to some who see 
graffiti as nothing more than vandalism. But Moreno said that after spending 
millions of dollars trying to make the images disappear, creating a place for 
youths to come and spray paint might help reduce signs of discontent. SANDRA

 Ask Mary Stalling the time of year and she most likely will say it's 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalling, the principal at 97th Street Elementary School, was among the 300 
who took part in Christmas in April, a one-day program that rehabilitates 
homes, schools and other buildings in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's marvelous, absolutely wonderful around here now," said Stalling, 
referring to newly planted petunia and marigold beds and freshly painted halls. 
"And the children have noticed it and talk about how pretty it is out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization brings together volunteers who donate their time, skills and 
resources to spruce up structures. On April 30 more than 800 volunteers armed 
with paintbrushes, hammers and wrenches fanned out across South-Central to 
tackle projects at 16 sites. About $200,000 in materials and labor were donated 
for the day's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's local chapter was formed after the 1992 riots as a way to 
take a more active role in communities hit by the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of this year's event proves that Christmas in April is more than 
just a good idea. It's become an institution assisting the South-Central 
community," Bob Morris, a spokesman for the organization. "Two years later, 
Christmas in April is still helping the precise area affected by the civil 
unrest and plans to continue to do so 10 and 20 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sites selected for work was the 990-student elementary school. In 
addition to the landscaping work, the school and adjacent mental health center 
were painted and the center's two bungalows were refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalling said she learned of the program while attending a public service 
group meeting in March. After filling out an application, Stalling got a 
telephone call a few weeks later notifying her the school had been chosen as a 
Christmas in April site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This signifies there is an interest from other agencies in making sure that 
schools can be places kids can be proud of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1988 with about $12,000, Christmas in April now operates nationwide 
with a budget of more than $500,000. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; SHELTER FACES ITS OWN HOMELESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Sarah Smith decided to open a homeless shelter, she knew some hard times 
lay ahead. And now, nearly a year after she began offering a respite for 
families, she is battling to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in her small office, Smith said she is unsure how to begin to confront 
the problems that threaten the Family Service Center at 250 E. 120th St.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just told my daughter the other day I feel like a homeless shelter without 
a home," said Smith, a former nurse who operates the shelter and helps families 
find permanent housing. The shelter has four paid employees who are assisted in 
their duties by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's trouble began in March, shortly after she assumed the lease for the 
shelter, the site of a former hospital and adult day-care center. Smith said 
most of the $22,000 in unpaid utility bills the shelter faces belong to the 
owner of the adult day-care center that shared part of the building until 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Water and Power would not discuss the case, but Odell 
Mathieu, a field collector for the department, said the problem has not been 
resolved.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she's received little help from the city in trying resolve to the 
matter: "I'm pretty upset with (the city) because it's as if they don't even 
care. I'm doing work for the community and they are supposed to support people. 
There aren't any other shelters in this area that will house men and their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith asked Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr.'s office in April for information on 
funding sources and help in sorting out the utility bills, but has not received 
any response since her initial meeting with an aide to the 15th District 
councilman. She also said she received no reply to a letter asking for 
Svorinich's endorsement from the councilman for an August fund-raiser for the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever she has asked us for we have given her guidance on," said Tom 
Kruesopon, a Svorinich spokesman. "We were just contacted a little while ago 
and we're trying to respond to her as quickly as possible."  
</P>
<P>
 However, Kruesopon acknowledged no response was sent out on Smith's request 
for an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was recently served with an eviction notice for falling behind on the 
$1,500-a-month rent and faces a May 18 court date. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owner did not respond to telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruesopon said that Smith's problem is primarily a tenant-landlord issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is trying to find alternative quarters for the 22 families housed at the 
shelter if the center should close. 
</P>
<P>
 While some can afford to pay $300 a month for a two-person family and may find 
shelter elsewhere, Smith said few homeless shelters take families. Many, she 
said, will be unable to afford any shelter because they receive no government 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep working at raising money and I'm even looking at other 
buildings, but that's why we need support," said Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 Fern Smith, a social worker with Para Los Ninos, a Downtown family support 
center, said family shelters are scarce in Watts and homeless families are 
often forced to break up. "It's almost impossible to find shelters and in fact 
most are always full in South-Central," she said. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Former city official Rudolfo E. Munoz has been sentenced to 90 days in County 
Jail and ordered to repay $24,000 he embezzled from the city in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz, 31, was the city's assistant director of development when he pocketed 
more than $24,000 in in-lieu parking fees from developers Manouchehr and Amir 
Masjedi, who were constructing a building at 6363 Pacific Blvd., said Efrem M. 
Grail, deputy district attorney with the Special Investigations Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of embezzlement, 
falsification and misappropriation of accounts by a public officer, a crime 
punishable by up to four years in state prison, Grail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz has paid $8,000 in restitution. His sentence includes five years' 
probation and his guilty plea prohibits him from ever again holding public 
office in the state. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; STUDENTS OPEN UP ABOUT GUNS, SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject was "Kids Killing Kids," and scores of junior and senior high 
school students sat motionless, listening as one of their own talked about the 
temptation of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's weird because I'm in my house and my parents pressure me a lot 
about my grades and that's when you start to think about suicide," said a 
seventh-grade student from Suva Intermediate School. "We have a gun in the 
house. My dad keeps it for protection and he taught me how to use it. 
Sometimes, I get it from my mom's room and I'm thinking of what I'm going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, a second girl, an eighth-grader, approached the microphone. 
"I've thought about suicide too . . . ." That was all she could utter before 
she choked on her words and ran out of Ross Auditorium to the privacy of the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 students attended a recent open microphone forum hosted by the city 
and the Bell Gardens Police Department, at which they were encouraged to talk 
about violence in their community and discuss alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expected talk of gangs and guns but the forum focused equally on 
other adolescent conflicts. Emotions ran so high that several students were 
whisked away for immediate crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The students had been assigned to watch a television special also titled "Kids 
Killing Kids," which dealt with teen suicide, gang violence and the dangers of 
guns, even if used in self-defense or to impress others. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the forum was to help students realize they are not alone and 
to help city officials better understand the needs of the community's youth, 
event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the ones who have to go out on the street and get the people who are 
bleeding and dying and we don't have the answers either," said Police Chief 
Andy Romero, adding that Bell Gardens officers responded to gunshot calls more 
than once each day in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times we adults discuss these issues of kids and violence, but we 
don't live it every day with them on campus so this may give us a better idea 
of what to do to help them in this battle," said Assistant City Manager Karen 
Nobrega. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially shy, students slowly came forward, prompted by Bell Gardens High 
resource officer Gilbert Gamboa. One described how a classmate threatened her 
with a gun, another described conflicts with her parents and her life as a 
runaway, a third told of being dumped by her boyfriend and of her subsequent 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials helped students come up with nonviolent solutions to some of 
their problems and urged them to seek outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let a negative response from your parents block you," advised City 
Manager Charles Gomez. "Go to your teacher or to the police . . . A lot of 
times the parent is the problem. Keep that in mind, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa said about 600 of 3,200 Bell Gardens High School students have 
approached him with various conflicts during the past year. They report seeing 
weapons on campus, conflicts with their parents and in their relationships, and 
talk about drugs, gangs and suicide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they may think it's really drastic but we say 'It may not be as bad 
as you think,' " Gamboa said. " 'We have resources and we'll help you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens High seniors Karen Ray and Christy Defries say they have sought 
Gamboa's advice many times. He recently helped them obtain a temporary 
restraining order against a classmate who threatened to shoot them. 
</P>
<P>
 But some students grumbled that ideas such as "conflict resolution" are 
unrealistic and seemed unconvinced that any adult would understand their world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say 'Go to counselors' and that they listen, but they don't know what 
you're living," said Angelica, an eighth-grader. "That's why people go to 
suicide." MARY HELEN BERG

 The doors of City Hall may once again open on Fridays if a proposal is 
approved by employees and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other Southeast cities, South Gate government offices have been closed 
on Fridays during the past year in an effort to reduce employee commutes and

 But Councilman Henry C. Gonzalez, making good on a campaign promise, has 
proposed opening City Hall five days a week to make services more accessible to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get paid on Fridays and they come to City Hall to do business," 
Gonzalez said. "They can't do it and have to take a day off the following week. 
City Hall is there to give service. . . . You can make everybody happy without 
making the transition too hectic." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has yet to complete talks with employee unions on the change and it 
is unclear what the new hours of operation would be. However, any change would 
likely require departments to stagger workers' schedules, reducing the number 
of employees available at certain hours, said Osie Harrell, president of the 
100-member Municipal Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting to see what the (city's) proposals are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping City Hall open five days would better serve the public and be less 
confusing, said City Clerk Nina Banuelos. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall is now open to the public 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday.

 A program to help merchants re-establish businesses destroyed or damaged 
during the 1992 riots and open new enterprises is working with more than 100 
clients, staff members say, but most cannot get government or commercial loans 
large enough to rebuild or convert their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for Neighborhood Economic Development, administered by the Korean 
Youth and Community Center, is working with 118 clients, most of whom are 
Korean American or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The program can count among its successes the opening of a self-service 
laundry, a mini-mall with five new businesses and a garment shop, said general 
manager Pat Wong. By the end of its first year of operation, the program's free 
technical assistance will have contributed to at least 18 new or expanded 
businesses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the merchants still need a $50,000 to $300,000 loan and 
conventional lending institutions have been unwilling to provide capital, said 
Sun M. Chung, a staff member with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Si-Yong Kim's market at El Segundo Boulevard and San Pedro Street 
burned down on the first night of the riots, but his insurance company reneged 
on his policy.  
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration approved a $407,000 loan package for Kim. 
But when he told the SBA he wanted to relocate to Kern County, the SBA reduced 
his loan to $250,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has scoured business listings in the classified ads for a business that 
can provide enough income to cover his mounting debts but can't find one he can 
afford with his reduced loan. Since Kim's equity went up in smoke during the 
riots, banks see him as a risky loan candidate, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I came here I thought America was a good country," said Kim, a 
59-year-old father of two. "Now . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice trailed off and he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Christian and my minister tells me that I shouldn't buy a liquor store. 
But now I'm broke and I have to look for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Im, an alliance staff member, said the program does not have the 
financial or investigative resources to provide sufficient loans, compile 
economic analyses and statistics or research every possible alternative for all 
the displaced merchants.  
</P>
<P>
 Im sees a lack of commitment from the city and banks to address the rebuilding 
issues faced by riot victims. "Banks need more flexible lending guidelines 
because they won't finance these people," she said. "The banks see them as 
risky loans, but their credit was fine before the riots, before they had to 
take on a debt through no fault of their own."  
</P>
<P>
 Chung put it this way: "If you take all the Korean merchants together (with an 
estimated $400 million in damages) it's like a major corporation was destroyed 
overnight. People talk about trying to keep big companies from leaving Los 
Angeles, but (with those who have yet to rebuild) it's like a huge company just 
left. Where's the city's response?" 
</P>
<P>
 The city and county funded the Alliance for Neighborhood Economic Development 
with $250,000, but those funds expire in June, Im said. A separate foundation 
grant will fund a wrap-up study through December.

<P>
 Members of the Wilshire Ham Watch, an all-volunteer citizen patrol working 
with the Wilshire Division of the Police Department, recently honored the 
officer who trained them and served as their liaison to the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ron Smith received a plaque from the patrol members as well as their 
thanks for his "service and dedication," said Jay Rhee, one of the patrol 
coordinators. "Because of his commitment and training we've never had any 
injuries or complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1991, the Wilshire Ham Watch now consists of two teams. One 
team of about 30 Korean American volunteers patrols Koreatown on Friday and 
Saturday nights. They are linked to the police through a system that combines 
their ham radios and the police dispatch frequencies, allowing them to keep in 
touch with police patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Another team, which fields about 12 people a shift, covers much the same area 
plus parts of Hollywood. But in addition to their ham radios, they are also 
equipped with high-powered cameras and microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more hi-tech," said volunteer Endi Maricevic, whose team includes 
doctors, lawyers and self-employed businessmen who initially organized in 
response to a rash of window-smashing incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, sometimes referred to as Hamsters, use their own vehicles and 
pay all their own expenses, including ham-radio training and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to their success has been their selfless dedication and genuine 
concern for the community," Smith said. "They are the motivating force that 
keeps me doing what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. John Mutz of the Wilshire Division commended Smith for his understanding 
and patience in teaching the volunteers observation techniques as well as the 
policies and code of behavior to which they must adhere as members of a 
citizens patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer Smith has given up a lot of personal time to help make this probably 
one of the most effective citizen volunteer groups possible," Mutz said.

<P>
 Life on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets might not be paradise, but 
Maria Guillen appreciates how much better things are now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because she remembers how bad things used to be.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of horrible problems before," she said. Guillen, a mother of 
three who has lived on Witmer Street for 17 years and is an apartment building 
manger, named a few: drive-by shootings, murders, assaults, drug deals, 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some ways, fear was the most crippling problem because it bred inaction 
and despair. Moreover, its source was not confined to gangs. "Before, people 
were scared of the cholos and the police too," Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 18 months ago a team of urban gladiators gathered on Witmer Street 
to do battle with fear and crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of those who helped residents turn the tide were Lance Reynolds, who was 
working in the neighborhood for a developer at the time, and Gary Swan, a 
citizen volunteer with the Police Department and former apartment manager, a 
man familiar with the street scene as well as the city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan and Reynolds organized meetings with Witmer Street property owners and 
managers and persuaded several to improve security by putting in lights, 
installing locks, painting out graffiti and screening prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncooperative owners who failed to clean up their buildings faced the prospect 
of a lawsuit in small-claims court based on anti-graffiti and public-nuisance 
ordinances, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining the trust of some residents, Swan served as their liaison with 
the police, prompting them to file crime reports, identify troublemakers and 
work with police officers, especially Amanda Serrano and Webster Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan also invited Miriam Negri, an environmental planner and architect, to 
take some "before" photos of graffiti-scarred buildings, and Negri soon became 
friends with Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that drew us together is that we're both mothers and we really care 
about our kids," said Negri, who organized art classes for neighborhood 
children. "If we don't all fight for a better city it's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maria's a real little fighter," Negri said. "For her, this is all about her 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen urged her neighbors to report crimes they witnessed or knew about. "I 
told them, 'We have to work together' and 'Don't worry, if you talk to the 
police they can help you,' "she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One result: Four of the street's worst troublemakers ended up in jail, Guillen 
said. Recently, organizers from the city Housing Department's Neighborhood 
Recovery Program, which marshals city services to combat drugs, decay and 
housing code violations in targeted neighborhoods, have been talking with 
residents and landlords about how the system can work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds set up a new company, Long Range Development, which will incorporate 
the organizing and legal tactics learned on Witmer Street in the management of 
new or rehabilitated housing throughout the city. He is also working on a book 
and video to document the Witmer Street effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen, who also holds down a second job at a local hotel, said she won't 
ever give up on her neighborhood: "I want my children to be proud of me and to 
succeed." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; WORD OF GOD SCHOOL TO GET COUNTY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After operating on the brink of closure for six months because a dispute over 
county funding left it insolvent, the Word of God Alternative School finally 
got a good word: The county will pay, although it is unclear how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Joshua Smith, who since November has been arguing that the county 
Department of Children's Services and Department of Social Services should pay 
tuition for 23 students whose eligibility the county questioned, was guardedly 
optimistic about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is the $15,000 that's owed to me so I can pay my teachers and some 
operating bills," he said. "I would like to close the book on this and continue 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 The county decided to offer Smith a settlement after officials from both 
county departments and the county counsel met last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Smith will get the full $15,000 he requested is still uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Louie, a program management consultant for the State Department of 
Education, investigated the matter after Smith repeatedly complained to him. 
The agency oversees disbursement of state funds to the Department of Children's 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie said that although he found that the county is not legally liable for 
the 23 students, it is still offering a settlement. "The department didn't do 
anything wrong," he said. "However, the kids in question may in fact be 
eligible (for funding). That hasn't been determined yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the settlement offer came as a surprise because county officials 
last month emphatically denied any financial responsibility for 23 students for 
whom Smith submitted paperwork last fall. Smith's private school, which serves 
mostly at-risk children and needy parents, relies heavily on government-funded 
child care programs to pay the $300 monthly student tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems began when Smith failed to receive payments after several weeks and 
eventually learned that the county refused to pay because officials said the 
students had not been approved by county eligibility workers, and therefore the 
contracts submitted could not be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith maintained that he had been assured by workers in the county financial 
department that he would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the school was forced to shut down except for the first 
grade, kindergarten and preschool. The student body fell from more than 100 
students to 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to meet its payroll, the school has been run for the last two months by 
three teachers and a few volunteers. Parents have pitched in, doing everything 
from pooling money to pay the school's utility bills to helping with 
administrative duties.  
</P>
<P>
 Myra Washington, who has coordinated the parent support, said parents staged a 
fashion and talent show last week at the South Park Recreation Center that 
raised about $1,500. The money will be donated to the teachers, who have not 
been paid since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten teacher Marie Hamilton said she has been hanging on simply 
because she feels the school is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping the problem is resolved soon," she said. "This school is really 
needed in the community." ERIN J. AUBRY

 UCLA dropped vandalism charges against students who were accused of causing 
thousands of dollars in damage to the Faculty Center in a campus protest last 
year, and accepted two Chicano artists' paintings in lieu of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction closes a yearlong chapter in the students' struggle and 
subsequent hunger strike, which resulted in the university establishing the 
Cesar Chavez Center for Chicano Studies.Seven students who were accused of 
misdemeanor vandalism and trespassing were ordered to pay the school for the 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronk's "The Mug," valued at $12,000 to $15,000, and Elo Carrillo's "La Mancha 
del Don," valued at $7,000, were donated to the university and will hang in the 
Faculty Center where the damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who held several fund-raisers and volunteered at a Downtown 
alternative high school to repay their debt, only came up with one-third of the 
$27,000 demanded by the university.  
</P>
<P>
 Gronk, who lives in the Eastside and was involved in protests in the 1960s, 
said he felt an affinity with the students. "I think we're all in a struggle in 
some way or another," he said. "It was something I hoped would help out, an 
offering that would be a gift." MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 Five months after her daughter was severely injured by a drunk driver in a 
crosswalk, Beatrice Gonzales has suspended her push for a traffic light at the 
intersection and instead is focusing her energy on establishing a neighborhood 
youth group. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said she realized that a traffic light would probably not save 
another child from a drunk driver, so at the request of Father Juan Santillan, 
pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians Catholic Church, and Rosemary Lopez of 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina's office, Gonzales started organizing the youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to work with the kids and show them things they can do to be 
involved," Gonzales said. "If this is what I can do to help them, I hope it 
does some good." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen youths have joined the new Lincoln Heights League of United 
Latin American Citizens Youth Council, said Gonzales, who wants to involve the 
teen-agers in crafts and activities at the Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales also hopes to raise money so they can attend the May 27-29 LULAC 
state convention in Cerritos. Gonzales wants the Lincoln Heights 14- to 
17-year-olds to be able to stay at a hotel so they can get a full taste of the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who helped Gonzales raise money for her daughter's medical expenses 
will host a $5 menudo breakfast from 9 a.m. to noon May 15 at the Lincoln 
Heights Boys and Girls Club, 2635 Pasadena Ave., for the new group. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have (LULAC youth groups) in Monterey Park and Alhambra but not in our 
area," Gonzales said. "We want to bring the kids to show them to be good 
citizens and to help the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said she is taking on the new project in part to thank the youths who 
were so supportive of her family in the aftermath of the Dec. 5 accident, which 
put her 14-year-old daughter in a coma for 15 days. Cindy Gonzales had been 
walking with her friend Frank Cifuentes, 16, on North Broadway at Sichel Street 
when a car driven by John Joe Gomez, 30, of Lincoln Heights hit them, throwing 
Cindy 30 feet. Cifuentes suffered a broken leg, cuts and bruises. Gomez, who 
had two prior convictions for drunk driving, was sentenced April 29 to three 
years in state prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jessica Pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Gonzales, who is now walking without the aid of a walker, will be 
returning to Lincoln High School soon. She had been attending Eagle Rock High 
School for classes that helped her review the several months of learning that 
she lost because of her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy's rehabilitation, in which she was in classes with other disabled 
youths, has helped her mother focus on activities the new youth group might 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a place with handicapped kids so we can spend a day with them 
and help them," Gonzales said. "Cindy's opened up new avenues for us because 
she doesn't see them as handicapped, whereas before, she probably wouldn't have 
paid any attention to them."

 The fifth-floor room includes a Japanese tea room constructed of bamboo, as 
well as enough space for classes, group gatherings and displays.Japanese-style 
sliding shoji windows allow muted sunlight to filter into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200-square-foot space, once an office, provides a more intimate 
environment than the center's 4,000-square-foot ground-floor art gallery, said 
Robert Hori, the center's gallery director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials decided to dedicate a room to cultural traditions such as tea 
ceremonies, flower arrangement and calligraphy because many of the center's 
visitors are disappointed to find mostly contemporary art displayed in the 
lobby gallery, Hori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Japanese cultural groups fear Japanese Americans' interest in traditional 
art is dying, Hori said, and the number of local instructors in the old arts 
shrinks as they age or retire. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural room's goal is to revive interest in the arts as well as 
introduce new audiences to them, Hori said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan Calligraphy Center, an organization initiated last year for 
calligraphy practitioners, will be using the room, Hori said. 
</P>
<P>
 In celebration of the inception of the calligraphy center and the opening of 
the cultural room, a calligraphy group in Nagoya, Japan, sent 100 original 
works for display and donated 30 brush sets. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a series of lectures by various art experts will be conducted in the 
cultural room. Initially, the room may only be open when classes are scheduled 
but center officials hope to also set public viewing hours for exhibits.

COVER STORY; THE LONG MARCH OF ENDESHA IDA MAE HOLLAND; HER STRUGGLE BEGAN IN 
MISSISSIPPI, WHERE SHE 'ROSE FROM THE DIRT OF SOCIETY' TO BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST, TEACHER AND PRIZE-WINNING PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She walks into the classroom wearing crimson tights, red Reebok's and an 
oversized red sweater spattered with odd-shaped gold buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she relies on the support of a large wooden cane, she radiates 
strength as she slowly maneuvers her way into the room, wearing a brilliant 
smile. She reminds her students that they will be reading their 
autobiographical essays aloud. And as they fidget with their notes, she lounges 
back in her chair the same way someone preparing to watch her favorite movie 
would sink into a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 To Endesha Ida Mae Holland, everyone has a story buried somewhere inside. Her 
job is to help unleash those stories and carve them into jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland is a prize-winning playwright, tenured college professor, longtime 
civil rights activist and a self-proclaimed nurturer of the human spirit. Her 
own life started out tragically, but she never gave up on the idea that she 
could do better. Now, her success is a source of inspiration to others 
struggling to realize their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you say, 'She went from being a prostitute to Ph.D,' it brings people 
some hope," Holland said. "That's why I don't mind people talking about my 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holland has been at USC only since January, she already has left an 
indelible mark at the university, where she teaches a playwriting class in the 
School of Theatre and an autobiography/biography class as part of a program 
called the Study of Women and Men in Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "She connects with you at a deep place," said Linda-Rose Myers, a graduate 
student in her playwriting class. "It's really exciting to be with her because 
you see her spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland has the ability to inspire because, as she puts it, she "rose from the 
dirt of society" to achieve great things. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1944 in the northern Mississippi town of Greenwood, Holland spent her 
childhood in a run-down home with her mother and three siblings. Her sister and 
brothers were the town drunks. But her mother was a strong woman who delivered 
the black babies that white doctors wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 On her 11th birthday, Holland was raped by the white grandfather of a child 
she was baby-sitting. Angry and frustrated, she became a prostitute at age 12, 
charging white men $10 and African American men $5. 
</P>
<P>
 She dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and then spent time in and out 
of jail for shoplifting and fighting until she was swept up by the civil rights 
movement of the 1960s. She had trailed a black civil rights worker from out of 
town, hoping to turn a trick with him. Instead, he recruited her to work on a 
voter registration drive in Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what I was doing until I started marching," Holland said. "My 
values changed after that. I didn't want to steal no more, and I didn't want to 
'ho' no more." Despite the excitement of being part of a historic movement, 
Holland still cannot talk about what happened next without tears welling up in 
her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, hooded men believed to be Ku Klux Klansmen killed Holland's mother, 
who was in a wheelchair, when they firebombed her home in retaliation for her 
daughter's activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one wish I have is that my mama was alive to see me now," said Holland, 
who does not know her real father's identity. "But when I told Oprah (Winfrey) 
that, she said to me, 'How do you think all this happened? Your mama's still 
with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A year after her mother's death, she moved to Minneapolis to attend school. 
Having received her high school equivalency diploma, she started taking classes 
at the University of Minnesota at the urging of fellow civil rights workers and 
her prostitute and junkie friends. Although Holland had stopped turning tricks, 
she established friendships with prostitutes and junkies in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979 -- 13 years after she first enrolled -- Holland received a bachelor's 
degree from the university in Afro-American studies. Five years later, she 
earned a master's degree in American studies, and two years later, she received 
her doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to write eight plays, including her autobiographical work "From 
the Mississippi Delta," which has been performed internationally and was 
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1988. Holland also is the recipient of more 
than two dozen awards, including the 1981 Lorraine Hansberry Award for her 
first play, "Second Doctor Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a prolific playwright, Holland has just completed her 
autobiography, which will be published by Simon & Schuster next year. She is 
also negotiating a movie deal about her life story. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime friends said they knew Holland's stories would be told one day, and 
that a lot of people would listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met Endesha, stories were coming out of her every minute," said 
Elaine Tyler May, a professor of American studies at the University of 
Minnesota who worked with Holland on her dissertation. "During the first day of 
class, everyone was supposed to introduce themselves and tell a little bit 
about themselves. Endesha had everyone in the class in tears by her brief but 
powerful story of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's break came when a New York City producer, Woodie King Jr., came to 
Buffalo in 1987 to see a performance of "From the Mississippi Delta," which 
began as a one-woman dramatic reading. At the time, Holland was an assistant 
professor in the American Studies Department at the State University of New 
York at Buffalo, and frequently performed her own plays. 
</P>
<P>
 King showcased the play in New York, and soon, "From the Mississippi Delta" 
made its way to theaters across the country, winning accolades at almost every 
stop. Producer Susan Quint Gallin saw the play in Hartford, and then turned it 
into an off-Broadway production with Oprah Winfrey as co-producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holland's passion for the dramatics has not ebbed, she can no longer 
perform because she suffers from ataxia, an incurable, degenerative 
neurological disorder that causes her to occasionally lose her balance. 
Although ataxia is not necessarily fatal, it has affected Holland's speech and 
her ability to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 She now spends much of her time writing from her spacious condominium 
overlooking the harbor in Marina del Rey. She lives alone among striking 
African artwork and portraits of her mother, who is the inspiration for much of 
her work. Her only child, Cedric, 32, lives in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Swahili, "Endesha" means "one who drives herself and others." She was given 
the name in 1979 by Kwanzaa creator and Cal State Long Beach professor Maulana 
Karenga, and she takes it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make an impact," she said. " . . . I know the reason why I made it 
was because people believed in me. That's what I want to give back to others -- 
a sense of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Students appear to feed on Holland's optimism. Although she can be brutally 
honest if she believes someone's writing is emotionless or awkward, she 
convinces her students that they have to keep trying until they get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also savvy enough to know that aspiring writers and playwrights need 
more than just encouragement if they want to make a living. Sometimes, she 
seems less like a playwriting professor than a shrewd businesswoman with a 
wealth of tips about how to get an agent, attract a publisher and play hardball 
when negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 She is upfront about the obstacles artists face as they strive for 
recognition, but she still manages to pump self-esteem into her students in 
clever ways. She recently invited professional actors to read her students' 
plays to give them a chance to hear their works performed by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 After the actors read senior Andrew Kamenetzky's play about a blues guitarist 
who sold his soul to the devil, Kamenetzky's first words to the principal actor 
were: "If this play is ever produced, you're hired." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really great to hear it performed like that," Kamenetzky said. "Dr. 
Holland has made me believe that I can do this. She's encouraged me to write 
from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason Holland is so effective at encouraging others is because 
she does not accept excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing "From the Mississippi Delta" in Detroit, Habibi Minnie Wilson 
wrote Holland a letter saying how moved she was by the play and including 
samples of her own poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Wilson told Holland that she was a similar age, and that she 
too had overcome a life of obstacles. But unlike Holland, Wilson said she had 
too many other obligations to pursue her writing dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Wilson's phone rang. It was Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flabbergasted," Wilson said in a telephone interview. "But she said she 
wanted to offer words of encouragement. I told her my self-esteem was low, and 
she said, 'No, homegirl, you've got to find a publisher.' I said I was too old 
to go to school, but the next thing I knew, I was moving to Buffalo to get my 
college degree." 
</P>
<P>
 About four years have passed, and Wilson is now preparing to graduate summa 
cum laude from the State University of New York at Buffalo with a degree in 
women's studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sees potential in everyone she meets, but particularly women who are 
middle-aged and don't feel they have any power," said Wilson, who is now 
Holland's business manager. "I do not think I could have done any of this 
without her." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Holland said she reached out to Wilson because she liked the way 
she crafted her letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was talking about ambition, and I said to myself, 'Now, here's someone 
who needs a break,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said she often receives letters and calls from people who want to do 
something creative but feel trapped by fear and lack of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear from whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos, males and females," she said. 
"They all tell me they can relate to my story." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland came to USC at the urging of Steven Sample, who was president of the 
State University of New York at Buffalo before being named president of USC. 
After her first semester of teaching, her colleagues see endless potential in 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are still a little bit in awe of her," said Robert Scales, the dean 
of USC's School of Theatre. "But we're thinking of doing creative things like 
performing her plays with professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Endesha is a real person who wants to give something back. She has a voice 
and it's more than just being a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holland almost moved back to Buffalo after the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
she likes Los Angeles and USC. She said part of the reason she came to USC is 
because it's at the edge of South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been here long enough to know what's really going on, but it seems 
like people here feel a sense of hopelessness," she said. "There's a sense of 
being unable to do things. I want to help people break down the barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 One young woman in Holland's playwriting class recently took a trip to 
Missouri to see her own play produced, courtesy of the Ida Mae Holland 
Educational and Artistic Scholarship Fund. The scholarship, which is named 
after Holland's mother, is designed for anyone who wants to go to school or 
needs funds to pursue his or her professional goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone says, 'I want to go to school,' I stay on them and make it so that 
they have no reason not to go," Holland said. "I even have a stack of community 
college applications that I keep in this apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's pride is evident when she talks about her work and accomplishments. 
She's not afraid to say she has made it, and she wants other people to know it. 
She almost seems haughty when she tells students in her class that she expects 
people to call her "doctor," but no one is challenging her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's someone who makes you think that if you just hang in there, great 
things can happen," said Felton Perry, an actor and friend of Holland's. "She's 
living proof of that." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 She was raped at 11, turned to prostitution at 12 and suffered through the 
violent death of her mother. But she was transformed by the righteous fervor of 
the civil rights movement, and Endesha Ida Mae Holland has spent more than a 
decade bringing her life experiences to the stage. Now, she's inspiring 
students at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has always struck me as a walking storehouse of wisdom," said Elaine 
Tyler May, an American studies professor at State University of New York at 
Buffalo, Holland's former employer.

CITY ARTS; PICTURED PALACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Downtown gallery is giving 12 of the city's most lavish landmarks a chance 
to take a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 The free exhibition, "The Final Curtain: Endangered Movie Palaces of Downtown 
Los Angeles," opens Friday and features more than 30 color photographs of the 
ornate interiors of the magnificent movie palaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway theater district is home to the nation's largest concentration of 
historic movie theaters, including the Cameo, Roxie, Mayan and Los Angeles, all 
built between 1910 and 1931.  
</P>
<P>
 Photographers Robert Berger and Anne Conser began the project three years ago 
as part of an effort to preserve and restore the Orpheum Theatre and the other 
Downtown landmark theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orpheum opened in 1926 as an important stop on the vaudeville circuit and 
hosted such performers as the Marx Brothers, Will Rogers, Count Basie and Duke 
Ellington.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mayan is now a nightclub, the United Artists Theater and the Million 
Dollar Theater serve as churches and the Arcade, Globe, Rialto and Roxie 
theaters operate as swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start changing the function of these theaters and take away their 
original look they become endangered," said Francie Kugelman, director of the 
Gallery at 777. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Final Curtain: Endangered Movie Palaces of Downtown Los Angeles," The 
Gallery at 777, 777 S. Figueroa St..; through July 29; 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, also 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. May 14, 15 and June 18; (213)

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The student council at Malabar Elementary School in Boyle Heights recently 
sponsored a one-day toy swap in which students were invited to trade in their 
toy guns, knives, swords and other "toys of violence" for cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 toys were handed in during the April 20 swap and a couple days 
after, Assistant Principal Regina Goldman said.Two police officers from the 
Hollenbeck Division of the Police Department were on hand to encourage students 
to turn in their toy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Student council members heard on the news that cities around the United 
States were asking people to turn in real weapons of violence," Goldman said. 
"Someone had an idea to imitate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said she believes the school will hold more toy swaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was successful because we did it without much planning or 
advertising," she said. "We simply spread the word, then sent home flyers. 
Students enjoyed it because they felt like they were doing something useful for 
the community."

VOTERS ALLEGE THREATS IN BELL GARDENS RACE; ELECTIONS: TWO COUNCIL CANDIDATES 
BACKED BY THE NO RE-ZONING COMMITTEE DENY USING STRONG-ARM TACTICS TO WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Voters who allege that volunteers for No Re-Zoning Committee City Council 
candidates Maria S. Chacon and Ramiro Morales harassed and threatened them 
before the April 12 election have joined losing candidates in complaints that 
the committee used illegal tactics to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Chacon and Morales have vehemently denied allegations that their campaigns 
strong-armed voters or did anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bobby Sausedo, 56, said No Re-Zoning representatives visited his home 
two or three times a week in the months before the election in an effort to 
harass him into voting for their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 During one visit, Sausedo said, a committee volunteer dropped off 
absentee-ballot applications and encouraged him to fill out and sign one for 
his son who lives in Whittier. When Sausedo received his mailed absentee 
ballot, committee representatives called again, saying they could pick it up 
and mail it for him. 
</P>
<P>
 One 22-year-old woman who asked that her name not be used because she fears 
reprisals said committee representatives have bullied her family in each of the 
last three elections, threatening to have them evicted if they did not vote for 
the committee's candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 During one campaign, she said, committee volunteers knowingly registered two 
non-citizens who lived in the house to vote. The woman, who is a citizen, said 
that in April's election she voted by absentee ballot for the committee's 
candidates against her will. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me an example of how to vote and I voted in front of them," she 
said. "Then they stamped and mailed it for me. . . . I just voted for them to 
get them off my back because they were after me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Chacon and Morales said the complaints have been manufactured by sore losers 
and will only further divide a community that has been fractured by years of 
infighting and scandal.  
</P>
<P>
 But Veronica Soto, campaign manager for Hugo Escalera, one of four losing 
candidates, alleged that the voters' stories only scratch the surface of 
criminal practices this year and that the incidents call into question the 
outcome of the city's last two elections, when No Re-Zoning candidates also 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The No Re-Zoning Committee) figures the D.A. didn't do anything the last 
election so he's not going to do anything this time," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also charges that as many as 500 non-citizens were registered by No 
Re-Zoning.  
</P>
<P>
 The losing candidates in the campaign plan to challenge the election results 
within the week and are collecting information to turn over to the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said she hopes their efforts will result in voter reform such as stricter 
regulation of registration and absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what it takes to do it," Soto said. "It has to be done. 
Otherwise, voting is just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate Select Committee on Voting Practices and Procedures is 
expected to sponsor a hearing on voter fraud Downtown within the next few 
weeks, and representatives from Bell Gardens are expected to speak at the 
hearings, a committee spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) hopes to revive AB 2483, which 
would, among other things, require voters to supply two forms of 
identification, a driver's license, birth certificate and/or Social Security 
card to register to vote. The bill was recently rejected by the Assembly 
elections committee.

DESPITE DANGER, HOUSE PARTIES STILL ATTRACT ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 House parties. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the ones. A bunch of teen-agers cram into a small house. Music blasts 
the curtains out the windows. Guys scam on girls. Girls flirt with guys. 
They're all doing their thang.  
</P>
<P>
 Then the police arrive to break it up because the neighbors want to get some 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Marques Johnson remembers house parties when he was a high 
school senior at Crenshaw in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I used to go to them all the time," said Johnson, a former NBA and UCLA 
basketball player. "They were on the cusp of being dangerous. There were only a 
few isolated cases where there was gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
 But times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting death of Washington High basketball player Antonio Lewis at an 
April 30 party in Gardena has made apparent the increasing dangers of house 
parties to athletes who have promising college and professional futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my kid out of the house," said the father of a Gardena Serra 
basketball player. "I told his mother, 'He can go to the prom and that's it.' 
It's been a sore subject since I read the story about Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he lets his son, Crenshaw senior forward Kristaan Johnson, make 
his own decisions about parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very uneasy about house parties," Johnson said. "I ask him, 'Where is 
it? Who is giving it? And who is going to be there?' When he was a junior last 
year, I told him a couple times he could not go to certain house parties. Now, 
he's 18 and pretty responsible. I talk to him a lot because it's one venue 
where someone can get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always people who want to get in and they're not invited," Crenshaw 
football Coach Robert Garrett said. Often the intruders are gang members who 
are met by opposing gang members. "They leave and say, 'We're going to come 
back and show you,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont basketball player Calvin Patterson said that most athletes are not 
associated with gangs. "Everyone is trying to get out of (the inner city) and 
make something of themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean athletes can avoid the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I advise my kids not to go to house parties," Garrett said. "But there are no 
set team rules against them. I beg and plead, but kids still go." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the athletes themselves have become more apprehensive about house 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to go to too many, because fights and violence break up the 
parties," said Manual Arts senior forward David Rickenbacker. "There is always 
somebody who has a personal beef with someone else or somebody who has a bad 
attitude and a chip on his shoulder. You look at him wrong and something 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will still go, but I'm more aware of the situation around me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont basketball player Calvin Patterson said his mother forbids him to 
attend house parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not me," he said. "I stay home and watch TV. It's cool. The next two or 
three days later, I hear about them and I'm glad I didn't go. I just come to 
school and play some ball and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington High star Dayron Harris' mother also voiced her objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids haven't attended house parties since junior high school," said Bobbi 
Harris, a mother of five. "People see you're from a different neighborhood and 
if they don't approve, they get violent. It makes me nervous to have 
teen-agers. It's sad you can't go from one neighborhood to another. Most of the 
time the innocent get hurt, and that's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers want to be accepted by their peers," Washington basketball Coach 
Andy Davis said. "You can't be a prisoner in your own neighborhood. You can't 
isolate yourself from all your friends and not go to functions. A teen-ager 
needs to have a social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't go to the movies. They can't go to the malls because something 
might happen. And they can't sit around the house and look at television all 
the time. They have to venture out sometimes. I know I'm not the only person 
searching for a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Collins, Washington's tennis coach, offered one alternative: "I tell my 
boys and girls to stay home and play their music real loud. It's the same thing 
as being at a house party."

YOUTH CENTER OPENING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening of youth facilities at the Grand Olympic Auditorium have been 
delayed until the sports complex receives building permits to complete 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly refurbished Grand Olympic Sports Complex will house a boxing and 
fitness center for youths from the central city and was scheduled to open last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing trainer Richard Allen, director of the Hoover Street Gym, is going to 
run the boxing program when the training gym and fitness center are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has been delayed because of the earthquake," said Allen. "It's 
impossible to get a (building) inspector unless it's related to earthquake 
damage. I expect the gym to be open in June or early July."

BUTCHER CLEARS MIND OF TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time we saw Mike Butcher, he was going bonkers in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that was Manager Buck Rodgers' succinct description of Butcher's 
performance April 21 when he threw a pitch a foot behind the head of Oriole 
second baseman Mark McLemore, hit Brady Anderson and gave up four runs while 
recording just two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a case of crazy-for-a-day, either. Butcher's earned-run average 
after that outing was 16.62, not exactly what the Angels were hoping to see 
from the man projected as their closer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all only mental, everyone insisted. Butcher, who had eight saves and 
struck out 24 in 28 1/3 innings in 1993, underwent season-ending arthroscopic 
elbow surgery last September. He brought the same fastball and the same mean 
streak to spring training, but somewhere along the way, he lost his way. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't throw a strike when he wanted, and all too often, he admitted, he 
didn't want to. "I'm trying to catch the corners and I'm no nibbler," Butcher 
said at the time. "And I really don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels decided a bit of desert air might clear his mind, so on April 23, 
they sent him to join their triple-A affiliate Vancouver on swing through 
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Tucson. Butcher seemed to find himself. He had five 
opportunities to save games with Vancouver and recorded five saves, giving up 
one earned run in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brian Anderson suffered a broken thumb and Butcher was recalled Saturday 
to help bolster a depleted bullpen. He immediately was pressed into duty and 
retired all six Oakland hitters he faced in the Angels' 7-4 loss to the A's on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 On an evening when the teams combined for 20 hits and every out seemed to be a 
line drive or a fly ball to the warning track, Butcher put down the A's in the 
eighth and ninth innings on four groundouts, a fly ball to center and a strike 
out -- against former Angel Stan Javier to end the game with an exclamation 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Butch pitched very well," Rodgers said. "That was the big plus we got tonight 
. . . and there weren't many of them. He was smooth. He had good velocity. He 
was throwing all his pitches. He looked like the Mike Butcher who ended up the 
1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like his mental rehab is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher doesn't cringe at that assessment of his assignment to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two days before they sent me down, I had made the decision to start enjoying 
the game again," Butcher said. "I had stopped allowing myself to enjoy the game 
because I was so frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver pitching coach Gary Ruby helped with healing process by not getting 
into any detailed discussions about mechanics, arm position or pitch selection. 
He just told Butcher to go throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really work on anything," Butcher said, "and I didn't change a 
thing down there. I just went back to trusting my stuff and concentrated on 
going out there and having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Was he worried that his early season struggles would keep him in the minors, 
no matter what he accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, that never entered my mind," Butcher said, smiling. 
"And, to tell you the truth, I didn't really care. I was having fun again."

 Angel reliever John Dopson has been diagnosed with a bone spur in his right 
elbow. If he feels the spur confines him, he will undergo arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still will have to make room for Langston this week, but Dopson 
needs surgery, the team will place him on the disabled list and keep relievers 
Bill Sampen and Scott Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson is tentatively scheduled to start Wednesday against Texas, Rodgers 
said. 
</P>

<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test 
on strained ligament of his left hand. He suffered the injury April 26 in New 
York, and his hand has not healed. Perez has been told not to pick up a bat 
until at least Monday. Team officials hope the swelling will subside during the 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Mike Butcher figured he'd be back from his minor-league stint 
in 10 days. He was wrong. It took 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who was demoted April 23 to the Angels' triple-A Vancouver team with 
a 16.62 ERA, returns after having been successful in all five of his save 
opportunities, for a 1.59 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot better about myself now," Butcher said. "I was in control of 
myself down there. And I wasn't in control here. I was just frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be myself again, and I know I will." BOB NIGHTENGALE

MIKE PENNER: FRONT OFFICE HOLDS CARDS FOR MIGHTY DUCKS' NEXT MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . . 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Sharks: If not for an 0-6 record in head-to-head meetings, there go 
the Ducks? Probably not. Detroit 4, Anaheim 1, would have been more like it, 
considering the Red Wings' advantages in team speed (huge) and offensive depth 
(don't even start). No team in the league created worse matchup problems for 
the Ducks last season than Detroit. That said, San Jose reached the Stanley Cup 
quarterfinals in its third season with 1) superb goaltending, 2) a 
tight-checking/grabbing defense, and 3) a front office willing to do what it 
takes to punch up the scoring. Already the Ducks have demonstrated the first 
two. Still waiting on the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto Maple Leafs: Down, 2-1, to the Teal Things, and in worse shape than 
they presently think. San Jose stands a serious chance of advancing another 
round, provided Arturs Irbe continues to play "like wall," because Toronto's 
grind-em-down style plays straight to the Sharks' strengths. Where have you 
gone, Felix Potvin? Any more of these five-goal cave-ins and Toronto's playoff 
run is going to hit something hard. Like wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Red Wings: Blew the Stanley Cup when they refused to trade for a 
blue-ribbon goaltender -- Grant Fuhr, Bill Ranford -- and settled instead for 
plain-wrap Bob Essensa. They simply couldn't part with young goalie Chris 
Osgood, the Red Wings insisted. Got to plan for the future, you know. The New 
York Rangers said the same thing in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers: Pittsburgh's out. Montreal's out. Detroit's out. Calgary's 
out. Toronto's teetering. The Rangers haven't had it this good in 54 years. 
It's either now or 2048. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle SuperSonics: Which is it? Are the SuperSonics the Red Wings of the 
NBA? Or are the Red Wings the SuperSonics of the NHL? Can we get a 
clarification, please? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal: Wasn't this supposed to be the Year of the Center? 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson: Or did they mean next year? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman: Out of the running. Banned in Utah. No longer a contender for 
No. 1. In 1994, Madonna can relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley: The Wit And Wisdom? Fifty-six points? The man's a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan: His next book will be titled, "I Can't Accept Pippen Winning 
It All Without Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Tarkanian: Tanned, rested and ready to coach San Diego State at any 
moment. Judging from the desperate pleas from Aztec boosters calling XTRA last 
week, San Diego State is shorthand for San Diego's Statute of Limitations Runs 
Out After Two Years. What blatant disregard for the NCAA code of conduct? What 
code of conduct? Lloyd Daniels? Who's that? Besides, Tark has spent the last 
year of his life undermining Rollie Massimino's program at UNLV. He's paid his 
debt to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler: First Chris Miller, now Chris Chandler. The Rams are 
determined to make their quarterback position safe for the Jim Rome show. 
</P>
<P>
 T.J. Rubley: He spends a season and a half backing up Jim Everett, Everett 
leaves and now he's third string. Ask him how he feels about the Rams not 
drafting Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Cardinals: The Rams' season-opening opponent. Buddy Ryan, who didn't 
get the Rams' head coaching job in 1992, versus Chuck Knox, who did. Got to 
like a schedule-maker with a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Ward: Someone should have signed him as a two-point conversion 
specialist. As soon as someone loses, 18-16, in the final minute next season, 
someone will. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' starting rotation: First Magrane's out and Dopson's in. Then 
Langston's out and Anderson's in. Then Magrane's in and Dopson's out. Then 
Anderson's out and Langston's coming back. Where's Finley? Good question. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' batting order: No Angel has hit more than six home runs so far. 
Only two Angels, Chili Davis and Tim Salmon, have driven in 20 runs. 
Apparently, the ball is juiced only when the Angels are pitching. 
</P>

.273; 3B -- Gary Gaetti (Kansas City) .300; SS -- Dick Schofield (Toronto) 
.327; LF -- Luis Polonia (New York Yankees) .266; CF -- Devon White (Toronto) 
.316; RF -- Dante Bichette (Colorado) .333; C -- Lance Parrish (just signed by 
Pittsburgh); DH -- Dave Winfield (Minnesota) .242. I ask you, is this the 
lineup of a 12-19 team?  
</P>
<P>
 The National League West: Name another baseball division with no team playing 
above .500. That's right -- today, the San Francisco Giants lead the NL West 
with a record of 15 victories and 15 defeats. What this means is that no city 
west of Houston has a major league team with a winning record. Maybe we should 
re-name it the Half A National Pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Cubs: They win at home once every five weeks. Just like the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillies: Blue caps ruined them. Yeah, that's it. So how do you 
explain the Toronto Blue Jays? 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog: He says he'd make the Jim Abbott trade all over again. We wish 
Whitey well and hope he enjoys the fishing.

UNNERVED PIERCE STOPPED IN FINAL; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: ORANGE COAST FOILS 
BRAHMAS' BID TO WIN SECOND STATE TITLE IN THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting on the bench before the match, his voice low so as perhaps not to 
alarm his volleyball players warming up nearby, Pierce College Coach Ken 
Stanley made an observation that proved prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are nervous," Stanley said. "I know the (Pierce) coaches are. I 
think (Orange Coast) might step it up a bit and we might slip a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley read his charges correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas looked out of sync and unable to make things happen as Orange 
Coast took a 16-14, 17-15, 15-13 match from Pierce to claim the state 
championship Saturday night at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
 What started as an ugly, rainy day for the Brahmas (20-1) ended even darker in 
an upset that prevented Pierce from winning its second title in three years. It 
also erased a near-perfect season in which they already had defeated the 
Pirates in four games in a match at Pierce in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Orange Coast (17-3) went after Pierce with everything working 
smoothly and managed to hold off several Pierce rallies. It is the second state 
championship for the Pirates, who won it all in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my whole starting lineup returning from last season and I kept saying 
that '94 would be our season," said Chuck Cutenese, the second-year coach at 
Orange Coast. "We took advantage of our experience this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates also exploited the Pierce blocking schemes with powerful spikes 
that found their mark repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast had 80 kills against 56 for Pierce, including 21 from opposite 
hitter Dave Kellar. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to do was to attack from behind the 10-foot line to free our 
hitters up," Cutenese said. "That really paid off for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pierce who went on a blitz to take a 7-3 lead in the first game, but 
Orange Coast rallied to take the game, scoring the final three points on kills 
by outside hitter Mike Melcher. Outside hitter Jason Crone, who finished with 
15 kills, had eight in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up and they came back, and psychologically, that gave them a big lift 
for the rest of the match," Stanley said. "They played absolutely great." 
</P>
<P>
 The story in the second game were the missed opportunities by Pierce, which 
committed six hitting errors and again had to watch an early lead evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Higa, Pierce's powerful opposite hitter, was held to seven kills by the 
Pirate defense and outside hitter Jason Ring, the other key man in the Brahma 
attack, had only two. They kept hammering at the Orange Coast blockers, often 
slamming the ball past them, only to see the back-row players save the day with 
outstanding digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were setting Higa but they were making the saves," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutenese said the effort by the Pirate defense was the culmination of a season 
in which he stressed that part of the game over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of time this year working on defense," Cutenese said. "It 
really paid off tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas made a desperation run at Orange Coast in the third game, but the 
Pirates wore them down slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading, 3-2, the Brahmas were never in control and Orange Coast scored 
two consecutive points to win, the clincher on a service ace by Dave Mays. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa finished with a match-high 22 kills and teammate Felipe Placencia had 10.

BASOWSKI SETS STAGE FOR A GRAND FINISH; COLLEGE BASEBALL: HIS SLAM IN THE NINTH 
BEATS MOORPARK, 10-6, IMPROVES PIERCE'S CHANCES FOR A REGIONAL PLAYOFF BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Basowski, without a hit in four at-bats and without a grand slam in his 
life, reversed course dramatically with one mighty swing of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Basowski, a sophomore outfielder, blasted a bases-loaded home run in the 
bottom of the ninth inning Saturday to give Pierce College a 10-6 victory over 
Moorpark in a Western State Conference tie-breaker game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory likely will earn Pierce (26-15), the conference's third-seeded 
team, an at-large berth in next week's Southern California regional. Pierce 
tied Bakersfield for the South Division championship, but the Brahmas will be 
seeded behind Bakersfield because of tie-breaking criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (21-18), the WSC's fourth-seeded team, probably will miss the 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only one scenario crossed Basowski's mind as he dug in against 
right-hander Rob Lanouette with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told myself, 'I'm a sophomore and this could be my last game of junior 
college baseball,' " Basowski said. "I was just trying to get it up in the 
air." 
</P>
<P>
 Basowski got all of a 3-and-2 fastball, sending a line drive over the 
left-field fence and the Brahmas' dugout into frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Basowski's fourth home run of the season provided a dramatic rescue to what 
might have gone down as a bitter season-ending defeat for Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas scored four runs in the third to overcome a 2-0 deficit and added 
a run in the fourth. However, they squandered the lead when Moorpark scored 
single runs in the fifth and sixth, then went ahead, 6-5, in the seventh while 
chasing starter Adam West. The Raiders scored on a passed ball by Brian Sturges 
and a wild pitch by reliever Rusty Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning ugly is acceptable," Pierce Coach Bob Lofrano said. "We weren't 
really crisp today. The victory is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce scrambled for a run in the eighth. Robert Vazquez drew a leadoff walk, 
advanced on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Edgar Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard (5-0), a 6-foot-1, 220-pound freshman right-hander, held Moorpark in 
check, recording the final two outs of the seventh and allowing only one batter 
to reach base the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pierce ninth, Heath McElwee, who hit a solo home run in the third, led 
off with a walk and Lou Tapia followed with a bloop single. A sacrifice and 
intentional walk to load the bases set the stage for Basowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Basowski fouled off a pair of two-strike pitches and nearly was caught looking 
at a third strike on a fastball that appeared to be just below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ump said it was low," Basowski said. "That's baseball."

COMPETING NO BREEZE AT GOLDEN LEAGUE FINALS

 The rain that hit Southern California on Friday afternoon bypassed the Golden 
League track and field finals at Cerro Coso College in Ridgecrest, but 
inclement weather hampered performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions -- 40-degree temperatures with wind gusts exceeding 40 m.p.h. 
-- were so bad that Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill won the long jump and triple 
jump with distances of 19 feet 10 inches and 42-6 1/2.Chase has personal bests 
of 24-2 1/4 in the long jump and 49-3 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Davis of Burroughs Ridgecrest, the proud owner of a 47.45-second best 
in the 400, won that event in 52.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill's Michelle Perry and Felicia Fletcher won the girls' long jump at 
15-5 and triple jump at 29-11 1/2. They have respective bests of 17-1 1/4 and 
33-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill co-coach Don Crimin said the elements were "the worst I've ever 
seen for this time of the year for a track meet." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when kids were almost stopped in their tracks in the middle 
of a race," he said. "The wind was that strong." JOHN ORTEGA

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / PAIGE A. LEECH; GIVING AWAY LITTLE, DONATELLA PUTS SYLMAR'S 
FOES ON TACTICAL ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Call Sylmar High baseball Coach Gary Donatella the Sultan of Surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the big games, Donatella continues to reach into his bag of tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a key East Valley League game against Poly last week, Sylmar pulled out all 
of the stops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans stole home, tried a ruse to pick off a runner at first, and 
relied on a squeeze bunt to win in the 11th inning, 6-5, sweeping a two-game 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (21-3, 12-0), The Times' top-ranked team in the region, beat Poly, 1-0, 
in eight innings Monday behind Carlos Velazco's two-hit gem and took a two-game 
lead over the Parrots (17-4, 9-3), The Times' No. 3 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly desperately needed to stop Sylmar two days later if it was to maintain a 
shot at the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning, Art Diaz stole home on an 0-and-1 pitch to give the 
Spartans a 2-0 lead. Diaz later stole another base, giving him 12 this season. 
The number of times Diaz has stolen home, however, remains a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't want other teams to find out about him, would we?" Donatella 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was in on the Spartans' second surprise as well. With a runner at first 
and two out in the second inning, Sylmar pitcher Mario Cervantes threw to first 
baseman Diaz in an attempt to pick off the runner. Donatella came out of the 
dugout, appearing irritated. "You got two (outs) now," he yelled. "There's no 
need to throw it away. Come on, you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Cervantes faked a pickoff throw to Diaz who jumped with his 
glove high above his head. Cervantes started toward first. He pointed beyond 
Diaz and yelled, "Ball, ball, get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretending to retrieve the ball, Diaz took off into foul territory and the 
runner started toward second. Cervantes, who had not actually thrown the ball, 
applied a diving tag as the runner tried to get back to first. Nice play? 
Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The base umpire called a balk, saying Cervantes had stepped off the rubber but 
then made a move toward home plate before faking the throw to first. The call 
upset Donatella, but after his team swept Poly he couldn't complain too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done that in years," Donatella said. "We brought it out of the 
archives." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th inning, Donatella called for a bases-loaded squeeze with one out 
and Velazco delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left in Donatella's arsenal? He's not telling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might need 'em later down the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the start of the high school football season just four months away, there 
is plenty of action in the Sylmar camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Marquez, the quarterback at Saugus last year, enrolled at Sylmar on 
Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, who threw for 1,134 yards and 10 touchdowns last season, would have 
been the top returning quarterback in the Foothill League. Now he will have to 
compete against Eddie Lopez for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seven-on-seven period will really tell," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said. 
"But Eddie's got a head start." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sylmar's success (City Section 4-A Division champion in 1992, 
semifinalist in '93 and '91), a productive quarterback is something Spartan 
teams have lacked the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense has been run-oriented since Engilman took over in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Greg pans out and is as good as everybody says he is, that's just another 
weapon to use that we really need," Engilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez is the third player to transfer to Sylmar this semester, joining 
former Kennedy linebacker Erik Sweet and former Poly running back Gerrod 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see a couple (of) linemen," Engilman said. "Our problem now 
is we're almost transparent." 
</P>
<P>
 With tailback Durell Price (6-foot, 210 pounds) headlining the cast, the 
Spartans are strong at the skill positions but lacking up front. However, few 
will probably feel sorry for Engilman: Price is a powerful and explosive runner 
who averaged 10.8 yards a carry last season as a sophomore fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Durell is not gonna come off the field. He's too big and too fast to take 
off," Engilman said. "The colleges are starting to come around and drool a 
little bit. It's kind of nice to build something around him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Alemany softball slugger Krista Gomez could call him a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Gomez, Krista's father and first-year assistant at Alemany, has been 
working with junior Esmeralda Macias on slap hitting and drag bunting, which no 
one at Alemany did better than Krista. Until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias went four for four against Louisville to increase her season hit total 
to 54, which ties a school record set in 1992 by Krista, who is now playing for 
top-ranked Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned her around and batted her left-handed last year," said Alemany 
Coach Dudley Rooney, who credits Bruce Gomez with Macias' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really turned this kid into a hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Macias is batting .600 (54 of 90) after hitting .320 as a sophomore.

PREGNANCY JUST A PAUSE FOR CAMPOS; AFTER DELIVERING BABY, SHE'S BACK ON FIELD 
FOR BUENA, CHASING DREAM OF A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Campos is not your typical high school student athlete -- not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at Buena High, she was among the finest softball players in the 
region and a prime candidate for a Division I scholarship. She was well on her 
way to becoming the family's first college student. She was the family hope for 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the summer before her senior year, however, Campos learned she 
was pregnant. She considered an abortion, questioned why God would "do this" to 
her and grew deeply depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I let everybody down," Campos said. "I was so scared. I couldn't 
even grasp my own feelings. I didn't know what to feel. I didn't know how to 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 One month after her 18th birthday, Campos gave birth to Alexis Jocelyn, a 
6-pound 13-ounce girl. 
</P>
<P>
 And seven weeks later, Campos was back in uniform for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My proudest part in all this is that she had the guts to come back and try 
this," Buena Coach Sharon Coggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnancy among high school students -- even athletes -- is hardly unique. But 
few who become pregnant return to school immediately after delivery. Campos not 
only returned to campus, she returned to the diamond to resume her quest for a 
college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her route has recently grown more circuitous, she is determined to 
avoid total derailment. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll probably play at a junior college next year -- perhaps Ventura or 
Moorpark -- where she will face a difficult sales job on Division I recruiters. 
She must impress them not only as a top player, but convince them that she can 
handle motherhood as well as her college course load. Can she handle day games 
and midnight feedings? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that there must be somebody out there willing to give her a chance," 
Coggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Campos, who gave birth Feb. 6, the road back begins on the field. She is 
about eight pounds heavier than she was as a junior and at least a step slower. 
What remains intact, however, is her desire to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the field, she is a fierce competitor," Coggins said. "She'd take anybody 
out if they were in the way. If she had to sacrifice her body, she'd sacrifice 
her body. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we missed with her (in the preseason) is that she set the tone at 
practice," Coggins said. "She out-hustled everybody else and we needed that 
intensity back. That's here (now)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Campos' mere presence is motivating teammates, Campos hasn't yet 
regained her starting role and leadoff spot for Buena (16-4). Last season, as a 
premier utility player, she started in all of the Bulldogs' games and played 
every position but pitcher and catcher. She batted .417 and led the team with 
30 hits. But as a slap hitter who hits from the left side and relies on speed, 
Campos needs to regain that lost step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her wheels aren't quite where they were," Coggins said. "(But) I see the 
potential for her to earn (back her starting position). I'm hoping she'll come 
back to where she was. We need it." 
</P>
<P>
 As though Campos doesn't have enough to deal with now that she is a mother and 
a student, she is spending extra time on weekends trying to improve her speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To go out there and (perform) the way I used to, it's hard," she said. "I 
know it's gonna take time to get my timing down." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Campos often feels like she is spinning her wheels. In her mind, 
she is running the way she once did. In reality, she has dropped from 
second-fastest player on the team to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one girl who blows us away," Campos said. "And I'm thinking, that 
should be me out there . . . yeah, well, have a baby and then see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Telling her mother that she was pregnant was one of the hardest things Campos 
ever had to do. She was expecting a shouting match. What she heard, however, 
was her mother's level tone saying, "I already knew. I could tell by the look 
on your face -- the way you acted." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Cynthia Navarro, knows that look. She got pregnant during her 
senior year at Buena High. And Navarro's first child, James Campos, became a 
father 15 months ago -- three months before he turned 18. About 15 babies are 
born to Buena students each year, according to the school nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of Mary Campos' friends have babies and are also Buena students. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the world surrounding Campos, giving birth at this stage in her life is 
hardly a surprise. Even her mother couldn't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My mother) said, 'I can't really tell you that this is wrong, that you 
messed up, because it happened to me,' " Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Campos, raising Alexis has become a family affair. They live with Campos' 
mother, along with brother James, his girlfriend and their baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos' grandmother looks after Alexis while Campos is at school. When 
Navarro's workday as a plastics laminator at Northrop ends, her double shift 
begins. She picks up Alexis about 4 p.m., takes her home and starts dinner. 
About an hour later, Navarro picks up Campos from softball practice. It may 
seem like a crazy schedule, but Navarro wouldn't trade the travel time with her 
granddaughter for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my time with (Alexis)," Navarro said. "I only get to spend a little 
bit of time with her, so that's my time. It may be selfish, but I love it. I 
don't mind it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos and Alex Alcantar, Mary's boyfriend and father of her child, plan to 
marry when they are more financially stable and can afford a place of their 
own. Meanwhile, Alcantar remains at home with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 What Campos wants most for her child is something she herself never had -- a 
father who wants to be part of her life. Navarro and Campos' father divorced 
when Campos was 4. She has seen him only three times since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him about five years ago. He comes around every five years," said 
Campos, who isn't sure where her father lives. "People say he lives in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing I want for (Alexis) -- to have both of us, because I know 
how much my mom struggled for us by herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the birth of Alexis has definitely disrupted Campos' regular 
schedule as a carefree teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not one thing in my life that's the same," Campos said. "It used to 
be just (me and Alex). We'd hop in the car and just leave. But now we have to 
get the diaper bag, get the car seat and the stroller and make sure she's 
covered." 
</P>
<P>
 During the latter part of her pregnancy, Campos missed seven weeks of school 
but stayed current by taking home-study courses. Campos, who has a 2.5 
grade-point average, plans to graduate with her classmates in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball is her motivation. She has been playing since the age of 5 and she 
doesn't intend to stop now. Her mother was a softball player, and Alexis, who 
usually sucks on a pacifier with a softball emblem attached to its base, seems 
destined to continue the athletic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pregnancy kept Campos off the field. The baby, however, will not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still gonna play," she said. "I'm still going after my goals. I'm still 
gonna go to school. I'm still gonna play softball and I'm gonna have the career 
I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, she'll have another cheerleader in her support group.

 For the second consecutive night, rain forced the cancellation of racing at 
Ventura Raceway.

 Saturday night's SCRA sprint car opener was called off by track management 45 
minutes before the scheduled 7 p.m. start when a light drizzle became a 
downpour.

<P>
 It was only the third rainout in seven years at the 5/16-mile clay oval, the 
first coming last June, the second coming Friday night.

RECRUIT CONTRERAS LEAVES NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linebacker Albert Contreras, one of Cal State Northridge's top football 
recruits, has left the team. The former Sylmar High and Valley College player 
was expected to be one of six junior-college transfers to make an impact for 
the Matadors in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras and Matador Coach Bob Burt could not be reached for comment, but 
Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said Contreras left the team for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother is having a real tough time right now, health-wise, and she has 
two jobs," Engilman said. "Albert feels real obligated to help her. His dad 
died early and he doesn't want that to happen to his mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had come a long way and I chastised him (about his decision) at first. But 
we talked about (why) on Thursday and now I know where he's coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, 6-feet-2, 240 pounds, turned down a scholarship offer from Northern 
Arizona to be close to his family. Engilman said Contreras missed most of his 
sophomore year of high school because he had to work, and he failed most of his 
classes. As a senior, however, Contreras won a school award for most-improved 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what made going to college a remarkable thing for him," Engilman said.

COVER STORY; SEATING NOW AVAILABLE; IT USED TO BE THAT THE ONLY ROUTE TO A 
WESTSIDE ASSEMBLY JOB WENT THROUGH THE BERMAN-WAXMAN MACHINE. NOT ANYMORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The odds of going to Sacramento as a Westside legislator used to be about as 
good as, say, the chance of snookering Michael Ovitz in a movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not that good. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because for more than two decades, the Westside has been essentially a 
closed shop, open only to those Democrats who belonged to the political 
organization headed by Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 And once ensconced in Sacramento, the legislators handpicked by the 
Berman-Waxman apparatus tended to stay on forever -- or at least until a 
demographically friendly congressional seat opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1992, the voters spoke two words: term limits.  
</P>
<P>
 Largely as a result, three Assembly Democrats who together represent the vast 
majority of the Westside have decided to give up their seats and run for other 
offices -- Terry B. Friedman of the 41st District, Burt Margolin of the 42nd 
and Gwen Moore of the 47th. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing ejection from the Assembly in two years under the term-limit law, 
Friedman, a Brentwood resident, is running for a judgeship, while Margolin and 
Moore -- both of Los Angeles -- are competing, respectively, for state 
insurance commissioner and secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the political heavens have opened over the Westside, raining down 22 
Democratic and five Republican candidates for the soon-to-be-vacant seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates, many of them political newcomers, have been scooting 
everywhere -- raising money, securing endorsements, seeking media attention 
and, above all, trying to separate themselves from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock is ticking. With Democrats enjoying a large voter-registration 
advantage in two of the three open Assembly races and a slight edge in the 
third, the future representation of the districts could well be decided in the 
June 7 primary.  
</P>
<P>
 Making the competition all the more intense is the mostly hands-off approach 
taken so far by the Berman-Waxman group, which appears to be reorganizing after 
seeing several of its candidates go down to defeat in elections two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly candidates are quite open about their efforts to turn to 
the political organization that has delivered in the past. Many have tried, and 
continue to try, to get endorsements from the Berman-Waxman folks -- or at 
least a spot on the group's slate mailer. So far, only one candidate -- Ed 
Johnson in the 47th District -- has made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The silence of the Berman-Waxman forces has left political operatives in the 
races perplexed -- and edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Westside) is the heart of the Berman-Waxman machine," said political 
consultant Rick Taylor, who is working for a candidate in each of the three 
races. "Where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are two other state legislative races on the Westside this year. Veteran 
state Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) is running for reelection in a redrawn 28th 
District that stretches from Venice to Wilmington. Meanwhile, Assemblywoman 
Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) is seeking a second term as representative of 
the largely coastal 53rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the Westside's primary campaign action has been concentrated in 
the three wide-open Assembly districts. The following is a preview of those 
races: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 41st ASSEMBLY DISTRICT: Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Malibu, 
western San Fernando Valley, Agoura Hills, Westlake.  
</P>
<P>
 In this coastal swing district, the low profile of the Berman-Waxman group is 
most apparent in the fortunes of candidate Bill Rothbard, a close friend of 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Friedman, first elected to the Assembly in 1986, surprised one and all by 
deciding to give up his seat, he told supporters privately that Rothbard was 
his heir apparent. But in doing so, Friedman broke the rules of the 
Berman-Waxman clan by not getting their approval for his kingmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had expected Friedman to run for reelection, figuring he could get a 
judicial appointment -- even from a Republican governor -- after his Assembly 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's faux pas, campaign watchers say, has kept the Berman -- Waxman 
group from endorsing Rothbard. Complicating matters for Rothbard, Friedman has 
not felt free to campaign openly for him because, even though he has yet to win 
his judgeship, judicial canons of ethics allow judges to endorse only in 
judicial races. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, hasn't stopped Rothbard from letting it be known that he has 
Friedman's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard, a Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy director who last year tried 
unsuccessfully to win appointment as Santa Monica city attorney, also has 
gained law enforcement and labor support. His opponents grumble that this would 
not have been possible without Friedman's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard, a resident of Pacific Palisades, has set up a campaign office in the 
strategically important Valley, home to 52% of the district's Democratic vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica portion of the district appears likely to be the preserve of 
women's rights attorney Sheila James Kuehl, who once played Zelda Gilroy on the 
"Dobie Gillis" television show. She has the endorsement of key officeholders 
connected with the town's powerful renters' rights political group, including 
state Sen. Tom Hayden. Still an open question, however, is whether she can 
raise enough money to get her message out. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Santa Monica could account for 25% of the Democratic primary vote, a big 
win there could put her over the top in a crowded field of six that also 
includes constitutional lawyer Roger Jon Diamond, resources manager Pat 
McGuire, transportation commissioner John D. Shallman and attorney Edward 
Tabash. 
</P>
<P>
 With endorsements from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, state Sen. Diane Watson and 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina, Kuehl is hoping that the strong support for 
women candidates shown in the 1992 elections will be repeated this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicos see Diamond as the wild card in the race. The conventional 
wisdom is that the Pacific Palisades resident, who led the fight against oil 
drilling in the Palisades and pushed for nonsmokers' rights before that cause 
became a trend, will appeal to the same constituency as Rothbard. Diamond is 
better known out of the gate, though neither is exactly a household word. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond got a late start in fund raising, but Taylor, his consultant, says the 
candidate has made up for it and will have raised $100,000 by the end of the 
current two-month reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McGuire, who is from Tarzana, and Tabash, who is from Malibu, are 
staking claim to the moderate Democratic voters. Both have spoken out strongly 
against illegal immigration, with Tabash especially determined to stop spending 
tax money on those who lack legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have a similar fund-raising strategy, having lent their campaigns 
about $150,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Shallman, the sixth candidate, is a businessman who worked in Mayor Richard 
Riordan's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 After this district was redrawn to reflect the results of the 1990 Census, it 
was considered winnable by either a Democrat or a Republican. Yet Friedman 
easily won reelection in 1992, despite facing a potentially strong Republican 
dream candidate, Christine Reed, the former mayor of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, GOP registration has slipped from 40% to 36%, while the 
number of registered Democrats has risen slightly, from 49% to 50.5%. (Ten 
percent of the voters declined to state a party preference.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two moderate Republicans, both of them political newcomers, are squaring off 
for their party's nod in hopes of beating the registration odds in the general 
election. They are Calabasas banker Peter Eason and Santa Monica law student 
Michael T. Meehan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 42nd ASSEMBLY DISTRICT: Most of the Westside east of the San Diego Freeway and 
north of Wilshire Boulevard, plus portions of the southeast San Fernando 
Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 From the standpoint of the Berman-Waxman group, the candidates in the 42nd 
Assembly District represent an embarrassment of riches -- so much so that there 
was a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage any two of the three with ties to 
the organization to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 If that had happened, insiders say the remaining candidate might have gotten 
the group's muscle behind him. Instead, the trio -- Los Angeles Unified school 
board member Mark Slavkin, Community College board member Wally Knox and West 
Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz -- all stayed in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 That says something about the competitiveness of this election year -- and the 
Berman-Waxman group's apparent ambivalence thus far in the primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which grew out of a college friendship between Berman and 
Waxman, is still licking its wounds after a disastrous 1992 election season. 
Three of its highest-profile candidates lost -- Mel Levine and Gray Davis in 
runs for the U.S. Senate and state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal in his bid to win 
another a term in a district created by reapportionment. After that debacle, 
there was much speculation about whether the dynasty would rebound or fade away 
as a political force. 
</P>
<P>
 For awhile, the group's leaders "left the radar screen of politics in 
California," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "Now they have to 
decide whether to reinvent themselves. . . . They have to be very careful (and) 
pick their spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Michael Berman, who is Rep. Berman's brother, and his 
partner, Carl D'Agostino, are believed to be working on statewide slates that 
may include picks in local Assembly districts. They could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such slate mailers, typically sent to party voters close to Election Day, can 
have a big influence in primary races in which candidates are not well known. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll know who they're for when you see who they put on the slate card," 
said Republican political consultant Allan Hoffenblum. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42nd Assembly District candidates say Waxman has foregone his role as 
local kingmaker in favor of national politics. Margolin, who has his race for 
state insurance commissioner to worry about, isn't getting involved. Other 
Berman-Waxman members have for the most part been silent, but not all. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman of North Hollywood, a member in good 
standing of the organization, has endorsed Knox, whose wife is an old friend. 
Knox also has labor support. But the winner in the elected officials' 
endorsement derby appears to be Slavkin. He has both retiring Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Ed Edelman and longtime Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills), whose district includes several Westside neighborhoods, to put on his 
mailers, provided he raises the money to send his campaign literature out. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin had a disappointing early fund-raising effort, coming up with only 
$52,504 by March 17, the end of the first filing period this year. By contrast, 
Knox lent his campaign $200,000 and Koretz raised $164,908. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights attorney John Duran, meanwhile, had raised $150,000 as of March 
17, the end of the first filing period. Duran won 35% of the vote against 
Margolin in the 1992 primary for the Assembly seat, so he has some name 
identification.  
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who wrote the 1992 state law prohibiting discrimination against gays, 
hopes to draw strong support from the district's estimated 16,000 gay and 
lesbian voters. If he and Kuehl win, they would be the first openly gay state 
legislators in California, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate benefiting from strong name identification is homeowner 
activist Laura Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake has sought support from the Berman-Waxman organization, attempting to 
breach any ill will that might remain in the wake of her two attempts to unseat 
Zev Yaroslavsky, one of the group's allies, from his Los Angeles City Council 
seat. The Westwood-based activist said the district has a large overlap with 
Yaroslavsky's 5th Council District and her image there is positive, even though 
she lost twice to the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake is one of two women among the seven contenders in a race that thus far 
has been notable for its friendliness -- indeed, most candidates admit that 
many of their opponents would do a good job in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The other woman, running with backing from several women's organizations, as 
well as Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and the county sheriff's 
association, is West Hollywood City Councilwoman Abbe Land. 
</P>
<P>
 Land, however, has suffered from a lack of money. Her base of support also is 
likely to be split with Koretz, her colleague on the West Hollywood council. 
</P>
<P>
 Koretz has endorsements from Rosenthal and several Los Angeles council 
members, including John Ferraro and Joel Wachs. He has distinguished himself 
from most of the other candidates by not shying away from his opposition to the 
death penalty, a position that would be the kiss of death in many other 
districts and might not go over too well even in the traditionally liberal 
Westside these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, Slavkin's consultant, said he has been surprised by how the candidates 
are, as he puts it, "running to the right," especially on crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no clear front-runner here -- or even pair of front-runners -- in 
many people's opinion. Political mavens agree this seat is truly up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the seventh candidate, Bruce Margolin, a criminal defense attorney 
who has fought for decades to legalize marijuana? With nearly the same moniker 
as the incumbent, Burt Margolin, perhaps he has the best name identification of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidate in this heavily Democratic district will be 
businessman Robert Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 47th ASSEMBLY DISTRICT: Culver City, Crenshaw, Cheviot Hills, Baldwin Hills, 
Mid-City.  
</P>
<P>
 With nine Democrats and two Republicans running, this district defines the 
cliche "crowded field." 
</P>
<P>
 The district was drawn to favor the election of an African American, and all 
but two of the 11 candidates are black. Because the district is affluent, the 
candidates describe the 47th as one of the premier African American legislative 
districts in the country, a good base from which to move up the political 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the Berman-Waxman team acted according to its past practice of picking a 
candidate who has paid his dues to the organization -- or to one of its 
members. Their guy is Ed Johnson, a longtime deputy to Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles), who won the endorsement of the state Democratic Party at its 
convention last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson has stiff opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Willard W. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) has exercised his parental 
prerogative by getting behind his son, attorney Kevin Murray. The elder Murray 
has friends, so the younger Murray has some big-name backers of his own -- 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), state Sen. David Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys) and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), to name a few. Murray 
also has the advantage of having secured a spot on his dad's slate mailer, 
which targets black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidacy of commmunity activist Valerie Lynne Shaw is also getting some 
attention from political prognosticators. Shaw, who used to be an aide to Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, was recently rated along with Johnson 
and Murray as one of the top three candidates in the race by the political 
newsletter Calpeek. 
</P>
<P>
 Another grass-roots candidate, teacher Jimmie Lee Gray, who is active in the 
teachers union, could surprise people if she gets a large bank of volunteers 
from the union to knock on doors for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Geoff Gibbs is a standout in the fund-raising department. The former 
deputy to Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun had loans and contributions of 
roughly $75,000 by the March 17 filing period. But he is not a longtime 
Angeleno, and many question whether his local roots go deep enough to enable 
him to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining contenders are attorney Marsha F. Kimble, writer Neil Liss, 
businessmen Leslie Roberson and Rudolph Valentino Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Republicans, businessman Jonathan Leonard and attorney Kathleen Lee 
Brundo, will square off in the GOP primary. But they face an uphill battle in 
the 47th, where 75% of registered voters are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 With the large number of African American candidates likely to split the black 
vote, the district's white voters may prove the deciding factor in the race. 
Such a scenario was played out two years ago when County Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke beat state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 At least among the estimated 8,000 Jewish households in the district, Berman's 
and Waxman's endorsement should help Johnson a great deal, as will his ties to 
the popular Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 But as all the candidates admit, it's a field of unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is going to be won by the person who shakes the most hands," said 
political newcomer Roberson. "And I'm a-shakin'." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two decades, the Westside has been essentially a closed shop, 
open only to those Democrats who belonged to the Berman-Waxman political 
organization. But things changed in 1992 with the passage of term limits by 
California voters. Suddenly, the political heavens have opened over the 
Westside, raining down 22 Democrat and five Republican candidates for three 
soon-to-be-vacant seats in Sacramento. Assembly District 41

CHAVEZ REGAINS CROWN AS FIGHT ENDS AFTER CUT; BOXING: HE DEFEATS RANDALL BY 
TECHNICAL SPLIT-DECISION AFTER HEAD BUTT OPENS A GASH IN THE EIGHTH ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't revenge, it wasn't anything close. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez got back his title in as bizarre a circumstance as could 
have been imagined Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez and Frankie Randall were getting into the heart of their bout, then 
they had to stop. Then everybody had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the MGM Grand Garden crowd of about 14,000, almost completely pro-Chavez, 
expressed relief and bizarre merriment when Chavez was announced the winner of 
a technical split-decision, giving him back the World Boxing Council 
super-lightweight title he lost to Randall last January. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chavez, who was getting hit hard all night and was trying to keep close 
to avoid Randall's long rights and lefts, received a large cut over his right 
eye with two seconds remaining in the eighth round because of an accidental 
head butt from Randall, the fight was stopped because Chavez was ruled not able 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight went to the scorecards through all eight rounds. Following WBC 
rules, Randall was deducted one point for the inadvertent butt. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Tamotsu Tomihara of Hawaii scored it for Randall, 76-75. But judges Ray 
Solis of Mexico and Dalby Shirley of Las Vegas both ruled in favor of Chavez -- 
Solis (who favored Chavez in the first Randall fight) by 77-74, Shirley by 
76-75. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the point deduction for the butt, it would have been a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like winning this way," Chavez said. "I don't want any controversy. I 
wanted to win without any doubt. I think open-scoring should be a part of 
boxing so the public doesn't walk away with a bad feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) I don't think that butt was unintentional." 
</P>
<P>
 If the butt had been ruled intentional, Randall would have been deducted two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision was announced, Randall and his trainer, Aaron Snowell, 
bolted from the ring at a near sprint in visible disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds before the decision, Randall said: "It was close all night, we were 
going in and out, we were both trying to get off first. I didn't want to butt 
him. . . . If I did, it was an accidental butt, but I think I still won the 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began as an accelerated repeat fo the first, with Randall (49-3-1) 
delivering more punishment more swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez (90-1-1), who said before the fight that he would put constant pressure 
on Randall, opened up on the attack and landed a few of his famous hooks to the 
body in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 But also in the first, reminding of when he lost two points for low blows in 
the first bout, Chavez was warned by referee Mills Lane for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round came the exact left-right to the jaw combination from 
Randall that knocked down Chavez for the first time in his career in the 
January fight. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, moments into the second, Randall's straight right arched over 
Chavez's lowered left and buckled Chavez, almost putting him down again before 
Chavez regained his balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall was warned himself later in the round for a low punch that had Chavez 
grimacing in pain for about 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third was more of the same, with Chavez chasing and being punished for it 
by Randall's apparently unblockable right hand. By the third, Chavez was cut 
over the bridge of his nose -- again, similar to the circumstances of the first 
bout, when Chavez sustained several welts on his nose and cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth Chavez slowed the charge and seemed to locate a better rhythm by 
landing several left hooks to the body and staying away from the more violent 
Randall shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth saw the best action of the fight -- for one 40-second period, 
Randall caught Chavez against the ropes and fired long right after long right 
to Chavez's face. Chavez answered with a couple of hooks to the body, but 
Randall came out of the round having scored the hardest and most punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis gave Chavez the fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez was more effective in the sixth, but Randall came right back at him in 
the seventh and eighth, leading off the combinations with sharp lefts that had 
Chavez teetering back two or three steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the eighth, and, and Chavez was a champion again.

MCCARRON IS GIVEN A GIN DANDY; KENTUCKY DERBY: HE TAKES OVER ON 9-1 SHOT GO FOR 
GIN TO WIN THE ROSES FOR THE SECOND TIME. BROCCO FINISHES FOURTH, HOLY BULL 
12TH. 
</P>

<P>
 Trainer Nick Zito and the rest of the Strike The Gold guys have struck again 
at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zito and Strike The Gold's owners, Bill Condren and Joe Cornacchia, blew 
into town in 1991, their flashy colt was not a secret. He had won the Blue 
Grass Stakes at Keeneland three weeks before, and when he won the Kentucky 
Derby as the third choice, the price was $11.60. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Zito-Condren-Cornacchia combine hit Louisville with what 
appeared to be damaged goods. A three-time stakes winner as a 2-year-old, their 
Go For Gin had been beaten by both Dehere and Holy Bull in Florida this year 
and couldn't outrun Irgun in the stretch of the Wood Memorial in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on those races, the horse looked like he might be washed up," said 
Chris Antley, who rode Strike The Gold to his Derby victory. "He appeared to be 
tailing off." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 130,594 shivering, dampened fans felt the same way Saturday, 
making Go For Gin the 9-1 fifth choice. The colt had gotten even less respect 
on the pre-Derby morning line, on which he was 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
 All last week, Zito couldn't figure out why his horse was being dismissed. 
"People would come to my barn and I'd tell them, 'Please watch my horse the way 
he's attacking the ground since he got here. He loves Churchill Downs.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That affection for the track continued Saturday, in a Derby that played out in 
none of the ways many trainers had planned. Favored Holy Bull was hammered 
leaving the gate; a roughhouse run around the first turn hurt the chances of 
some other contenders, and Go For Gin, moving to the front heading down the 
backstretch, was never threatened, winning by two lengths for jockey Chris 
McCarron, who had never ridden the horse in a race before. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull finished 12th in the 14-horse field that was reduced by the scratch 
of Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby winner, because of the sloppy track. Holy Bull 
became the 15th consecutive Derby favorite to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our horse had been underestimated by some of the astute 
handicappers in this great game," Condren said. The 60-year-old New York 
businessman and Cornacchia, 61, saw their partnership with Strike The Gold's 
other owner, B. Giles Brophy, end in acrimony, but Condren and Cornacchia 
stayed together and bought Go For Gin for $150,000 at a Saratoga yearling 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 They hired McCarron when jockey Jerry Bailey jumped ship after the Wood. Go 
For Gin gave McCarron another Derby victory to go with his aboard Alysheba in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 While McCarron and Eddie Delahoussaye were having dinner Friday night at the 
home of Alex Harthill, a local veterinarian, Delahoussaye turned to his fellow 
rider on the Southern California circuit and said: "You Irish son of a gun. 
You're probably lucky enough to pick up that horse and win." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye was also riding his Derby mount for the first time, and Strodes 
Creek, making only his fifth start, finished second, 2 1/2 lengths ahead of 
Blumin Affair. Blumin Affair was ridden by Bailey after his first Derby choice, 
Irgun, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, the Santa Anita Derby winner, finished fourth after breaking 
lackadaisically and falling behind early. The rest of the order of finish was 
Soul Of The Matter, Tabasco Cat, Southern Rhythm, Powis Castle, Mahogany Hall, 
Smilin Singin Sam, Meadow Flight, Holy Bull, Valiant Nature and Ulises. 
</P>
<P>
 In windy, 58-degree weather, Go For Gin ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03 3/5 over a 
track that had absorbed about an inch of rain Friday night and early Saturday. 
The son of Cormorant and Never Knock, the same dam as Pleasant Tap's, paid 
$20.20 and earned $628,800 of the total purse of $878,800. Go For Gin now has 
five victories and three seconds out of 10 races and earnings of slightly more 
than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking from the No. 8 post, Go For Gin veered to his right at the start, 
pushing Tabasco Cat into Brocco on the outside. From the No. 4 post, Holy Bull, 
who went off at 2-1, didn't break alertly and was squeezed by Powis Castle on 
his inside and Ulises on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse got away flat-footed," said Mike Smith, Holy Bull's jockey. "He 
usually breaks like a rocket. Then we got cremated. It seemed like every step 
we took was the wrong one. On the middle of the (first) turn, the three horse 
(Powis Castle, ridden by Antley) came out and got me. It was like being thrown 
down and trying to get up again. My horse never got into the bridle after all 
that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 On the clubhouse turn, Powis Castle came out, affecting several horses besides 
Holy Bull. Laffit Pincay, riding Valiant Nature, was forced to take up with his 
mount to avoid clipping heels. Delahoussaye, who was behind Valiant Nature, had 
to swing Strodes Creek to the outside, losing some momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulises, who had figured to challenge Holy Bull for the lead in many a pre-race 
scenario, led for a quarter of a mile. Down the backstretch, Go For Gin was 
cruising along comfortably, with Ulises ahead of Powis Castle in third place. 
Tabasco Cat was fourth, Holy Bull fifth and Brocco, who had expected to be 
close to the pace, was in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse was too relaxed in the gate," jockey Gary Stevens said of Brocco. 
"He was star-gazing. We must have broken two lengths behind everybody else. He 
just walked away from the gate. We must have been 11 lengths behind (going past 
the stands the first time). We got up to about six lengths behind (down the 
backside), but I had to take too much out of him to do that. Then by the 
three-eighths pole, I had an empty tank.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was just happy that we got fourth after that, because he got tired in the 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle and Smilin Singin Sam, who had rushed up into contention, were 
through after a mile. At the top of the stretch, Go For Gin had increased his 
lead to four lengths over Strodes Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been galloping along," McCarron said, "and I thought that if he was 
able to do that, he was going to be very tough. He finished very strong. I 
could hear somebody (Strodes Creek) coming on the outside in the last 70 yards 
or so. My horse was drifting out, but I just let him drift a little bit and 
kept him running." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time McCarron got on Go For Gin was for a six-furlong workout in 
1:15 last Sunday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it sounds corny, you have to be lucky and blessed to win the Derby," 
said Zito, who has been lucky and blessed twice. "My dad, may he rest in peace, 
once told me: The underdog is a dangerous animal." Kentucky Derby Chart

JIM MURRAY: PASTIME NOW A BAD COMEDY

<P>
 There used to be a beautiful symmetry to baseball, a sense of order, 
continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 There were eight teams in each league and they played each other exactly 22 
times a season, 11 on the road and 11 at home. Each team had exactly the same 
challenge, no variables. You had a true champion. The World Series pitted the 
best against the best. Thus, it was often in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this Eden of sport crept the serpent -- television. Television was not a 
fan, it was a participant. And it couldn't stand still for, say, a September 
game between two teams, one or both of which would be hopelessly out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had to change. Expansion diluted it. TV perverted it. Other sports 
plundered it. 
</P>
<P>
 They carved the game into divisions, multiplying the end-of-season contenders. 
Even this was not enough. Television's idea of Nirvana is to have everybody 
still in the hunt at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Other sports do it. Hockey and basketball play whole seasons simply 
to run a couple of ribbon clerks out. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, an instructive thing happened to the grand old game: A strike 
truncated the season. So the sages of baseball -- with a little input from 
those in TV -- put together a package in which they split the season in two. 
The winners of the first half played the winners of the second half in each 
division. The survivors met in the finals and the survivors of that got in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 That noble experiment resulted in the Dodgers winning the Series. They won the 
National League West title in the first half with a 36-21 record. But they 
finished fourth in the second half with a 27-26 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, they finished second to Cincinnati, which had a record of 66-42 for 
the whole season, vs. the Dodgers' 63-47. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in baseball history, a non-winner had played in -- and won 
-- a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers played the Yankees, whose record was even sorrier. The Yankees won 
the first half of their American League division with a 34-22 record. But they 
finished next-to-last in the second half with a 25-26 posting. And they 
qualified for the World Series with the fourth- best record in the league for 
the season overall. 
</P>
<P>
 When they got away with that, when the skies didn't open or the oceans dry up, 
and the media didn't grumble mildly, the custodians of the grand old game took 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing sacred about baseball. Show business is business, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 That baseball had broken faith with the game's longtime devotees, who had been 
snookered into thinking it had been handed down on Mt. Sinai, bothered the 
lords of the realm and their TV ventriloquists not at all. When the game 
finally expanded to 28 teams, they knew they could take any liberties with it 
they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they not only cut the baby in half, these Solomons cut it in three. They 
split the leagues into three divisions, with the champions in each plus one 
"wild card" team, i.e. the team with the best second-place record, eligible for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball had now reduced the playing field to a crapshoot. Gone was precocity. 
In came mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, their worst nightmare appeared to be taking shape. In each league, 
the West Division came into focus as a study in ineptitude. In the American 
League, a team with an 12-15 record, Texas, is leading the division. Oakland, a 
team with a 9-21, .300 percentage, was only 4 1/2 games out. In the National 
League, the Giants are a little better -- .500 at 15-15.  
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a team getting into the World Series with a losing season 
record looms large. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the playing field is no longer level. As in pro football, one team can 
chance upon a far easier schedule than its competition. In pro football, it's 
deliberate. They penalize the stronger teams and come to the aid of teams with 
inferior records by giving them inferior competition. It's called rewarding 
failure, something new in the American experience. There are other 
considerations: To win the West Division title of either league, you have only 
to beat three other (weak) teams. To win in other divisions, you have to beat 
four other (strong) teams. A palpably unfair balance of power.  
</P>
<P>
 The charm of baseball has always been its continuity, its linkage with the 
past. You are looking at the same game your great-grandfather looked at. It is 
an heirloom sport. There is an inheritance at work. Prowess is measurable from 
one era to another.  
</P>
<P>
 Sports Illustrated recently pointed out that in the wild, wild West of the 
American League, the Seattle pitching staff gave up 10 runs on one hit in three 
innings the other day and that the Yankees, playing against West teams, 
received (count 'em!) 33 walks in four games -- eight of them with the bases 
loaded! 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a division, it's a sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
 And what will it do to the record-setting process? Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth and 
Willie Mays and Henry Aaron set their marks batting against the same quality 
opposition in the same orderly fashion each year. The mild, mild West teams 
play only 39 games against each other and the other 123 against the real world. 
The Humane Society or those who throw eggs at fur coats should picket those 
games.  
</P>
<P>
 Should the fattened averages count? In a recent game against the Yankees, with 
two out, Seattle pitchers walked seven in a row and hit an eighth.  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine if Connie Mack or John McGraw came to life and gazed upon this 
shambles. As Casey Stengel once asked plaintively, "Can't anybody here play 
this game? " 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the national pastime anymore. It's the national follies. These guys 
should come out in noses that light up and pants that keep falling down. Were 
the Marx Brothers ever any funnier? They better hope Letterman never gets a 
look at their act.

FLORIDA STATE MIGHT BE FACING NCAA PENALTIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SEMINOLES ADMIT 
THAT AT LEAST TWO PLAYERS ACCEPTED GIFTS FROM AGENT RECRUITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an admission that could conceivably lead to an NCAA investigation and, in a 
worst-case scenario, the forfeiture of games and perhaps the loss of its 1993 
national championship, Florida State officials said Saturday that at least two 
Seminole players accepted illegal gifts from sports agent recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Florida State President Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte, school 
authorities launched an in-house investigation of the alleged improprieties 
after being confronted last Thursday with information uncovered by two Sports 
Illustrated reporters. Since then, according to a statement issued by the 
university Saturday, "we were able to determine that two members of the team 
received a gift of clothing on one occasion from a recruiter for an 
out-of-state, unregistered sports agent." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also said that one of the players (Florida State declined to 
disclose names) also admitted receiving $40 last fall from one of the 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Tallahassee Democrat reported in its Saturday editions that a 
prospective agent allegedly spent as much as $6,000 on several Florida State 
players at a local mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned there were indeed some problems we need to address," said 
D'Alemberte, who formerly served as president of the American Bar Assn. "We've 
only begun the investigation. There are a great deal of things we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the allegations, Florida State has informed both the NCAA and 
the Atlantic Coast Conference of its inquiry and also has retained the Overland 
Park, Kan., sports law firm Bond, Schoeneck & King to oversee the school's 
investigation. The firm, which is based in the same Kansas City suburb as the 
NCAA headquarters, is well known in intercollegiate circles and has represented 
an assortment of universities in NCAA infractions cases. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Alemberte also said that quarterback Charlie Ward, the school's Heisman 
Trophy winner, was not a target of the inquiry. In addition, none of the 
allegations reportedly involved coaches or alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an important distinction. According to Rich Hilliard, NCAA director of 
enforcement, a school could be held accountable for the infractions if it had 
knowledge or should have had knowledge of the wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if, as Florida State officials are insisting, the university was 
completely unaware of the illegal gifts, the Seminole program probably would 
not be penalized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hilliard said, if a university simply looked the other way or failed to 
pursue legitimate tips concerning such payoffs, "then institutional 
responsibility will kick in." That could mean players being ruled ineligible, 
the forfeiture of games and, in Florida State's case, an asterisk placed 
permanently next to the Seminoles' 1993 season that saw the team go 12-1 and 
win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something you're so afraid is going to happen any day," Florida State 
Coach Bobby Bowden said at a Saturday news conference. "It's a time bomb 
sitting out there ticking, ticking, ticking and you hope that big old hand 
doesn't hit on our number. . . . It's embarrassing, but this too shall pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The school seemingly has several factors in its favor. Florida State officials 
are quick to point out that its players are required twice a year to sign an 
oath that says they have accepted no extra benefits or violated NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is a matter of history. The football program, which has never been 
on probation during Bowden's 19-year stay in Tallahassee, is generally regarded 
as honest, forthright and vigilant. In regards to monitoring its players, David 
Thompson, ACC assistant commissioner of compliance, told the Associated Press: 
"It seems to me (Florida State) has done everything it ought to have done."

WORLD CUP '94 / 40 DAYS AND COUNTING; GETTING A KICK START ; JAPAN IS SHOWING 
THE UNITED STATES HOW IT'S DONE WITH THE SUCCESS OF SOCCER'S J-LEAGUE

 Here's a quick question to test your knowledge of international sports: 
</P>
<P>
 How many applied for tickets to the opening match of the inaugural season in 
Japan's professional soccer league -- 800? 8,000? 800,000? 
</P>
<P>
 The third figure is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick question to test your knowledge of American sports: 
</P>
<P>
 How many will apply for tickets to the opening match of the inaugural season 
of Major League Soccer, the United States' latest effort to launch a 
professional soccer league -- 800? 8,000? 
</P>
<P>
 The first figure is as likely to be correct as the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 The J-League, as Japan's newest sports venture is called, will be one year old 
next Sunday. Major League Soccer is expected to make its debut one year from 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the opinion of many observers, rather than being separated by only a 
couple of years, the two leagues already are light years apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer has conquered Japan, or at least a good portion of it, in only 12 
months. The sport is now the hottest ticket in town, every bit as popular as 
baseball or sumo wrestling. Companies such as Nissan, Toyota, Mitsubishi and 
others are pouring tens of millions of dollars into soccer. The media is giving 
it extensive coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 How was all this accomplished and can the same formula be followed by Major 
League Soccer? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a wonderful job, but it's not something that we can package 
easily and bring back to the United States," said Hank Steinbrecher, executive 
director/secretary general of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF). 
</P>
<P>
 The main obstacle, it appears, is cultural. What the Japanese government, 
industry and fans are willing to accept, the American government, industry and 
people are not. It's as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbrecher, along with Alan Rothenberg, chairman and chief executive officer 
of World Cup USA 1994 and president of the USSF, traveled to Japan to study the 
J-League and see what lessons could be applied on this side of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 What they learned is that it won't be that easy. One reason is contained in 
this quote from Sauburo Kawabuchi, chairman of the J-League: 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to lose $250 million in the first five years," he said without so 
much as blinking an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In difficult economic times, that would seem a staggering statement to make, 
but the Japanese take a different view of such things. Their goals are much 
different than quick profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese are very long-term thinkers," Steinbrecher said. "All this 
(investment in professional soccer) is part of an integrated plan to stage the 
World Cup in 2002, when they can showcase Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 So, unlike the United States, which was awarded this summer's World Cup on 
condition -- or at least in the sincere belief -- that a professional league 
would be established, Japan is going about it in a more logical manner. It has 
established a professional league in the hope of being awarded the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 After months, indeed years, of planning and promotion, the J-League was 
launched on May 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a spectacular opening night. The Olympic Stadium in Tokyo was packed to 
the rafters. Celebrities were everywhere. Politicians rubbed elbows with 
entertainers and sports figures, including Pele and, in a diplomatic bow to 
baseball, Sadaharu Oh, Japan's greatest baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 A spectacular laser, fireworks and music show preceded the first match, 
between Yokohama Marinos and Yomiuri Nippon. The entire event was televised 
live nationwide. It was all a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months later, the same could be said for the entire season. One million 
fans had passed through the turnstiles within the first month. Sold-out 
stadiums were commonplace. Soccer quickly earned its place alongside baseball 
in terms of attendance and prime-time television coverage. It was more than a 
novelty, it was an escape from conformity. It was bright, it was colorful, it 
was lively. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas baseball obeyed the do-what-the-coach-tells-you ethic of an earlier 
era, soccer allowed and indeed encouraged freedom of expression, both in 
appearance and in the game itself. By season's end, both Kawabuchi and the 
media were hailing the J-League's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great success," Kawabuchi said. "Everything turned out for the best. 
I think the Japanese have understood for the first time that soccer is an 
aggressive, speedy and colorful sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's best-selling newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, made it official in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league has exceeded all expectations," the newspaper said. "There were 
full houses everywhere. Its popularity was due to a feeling that the game was 
new and exciting, to attacking teams, strong foreign players and fast play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, sports typical of Japan are not just sumo and baseball. We can say that 
soccer has taken root in the national culture." 
</P>
<P>
 But how? 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbrecher believes it was done by targeting a specific audience and by 
being willing, with some government prodding, to invest millions in making it a 
commercially viable venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've hit a bonanza," he said. "The advertising, the marketing, is 
absolutely a stroke of genius. The thing that struck me first is that the 
marketing of the league itself is very youth oriented. The J-League is 
associated with vibrancy and youth and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really young, whereas the traditional sport, baseball, caters to the 
older crowd. This is something that we should learn from -- that in our 
marketing we gear things toward the lower end of the age spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is that the structure of the J-League, in my opinion, 
certainly will not work in the United States. They (in Japan) were able to get 
an infusion of capital very early and have some guarantees (of success) because 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't expect our government (local, state or federal) to come and say to 
corporate sponsors, 'Listen, we want you to come in and sponsor this team for, 
say, $5 million a year.' It doesn't work that way. We have to structure the 
finances of the league and the league itself a little bit differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Local government did play a large part in helping the J-League get off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In the town of Kashima, for example, civic leaders spent $75 million in 
building a 15,000-seat stadium and all the attendant facilities for its club, 
the Kashima Antlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 10 teams that started the league -- increased to 12 this season -- 
play in small stadiums of that size. But each one of them has plans to either 
expand or build huge new stadiums in the hope that if Japan is awarded the 2002 
World Cup, their city will be one of the venues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's yet another example of the long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, is the emphasis on developing Japanese stars. Fewer than a third of 
the players in the league are foreign. Each team is limited to signing five 
foreigners and can play only three at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are not making the same errors that scuttled the ill-fated North 
American Soccer League, the most recent attempt to sell soccer to the American 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "That league was geared to profit and in the end there was no active promotion 
or nurturing of promising American players," Kawabuchi said. "We shall not be 
making the same mistake. The J-League has a majority of good, home-grown 
Japanse players who have moved up from high school and semi-professional 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, J-League teams did scour Europe and South America in search of stars to 
bring in the fans. Top names such as England's Gary Lineker, Brazil's Zico and 
Argentina's Ramon Diaz were among the big attractions in the first season and 
also among the most highly paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lineker, for instance, was signed by Nagoya Grampus Eight for $4.5 million for 
three years. Diaz pocketed $1.8 million for his two years with the Yokohama 
Marinos, and Zico, who took the Kashima Antlers all the way to the first league 
championship game, got a three-year, $1.5-million contract even though he was 
40 when he signed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese players are not hurting. Japan national team striker 
Kazuyoshi Miura earned $900,000 last season from Kawasaki Verdy and that figure 
was increased to $2 million this season. Kawasaki is also making plans for a 
state-of-the-art, 100,000-seat stadium for World Cup 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 It is small wonder, then, that viewed with such examples, American soccer 
officials and fans become a little despondent. Politicians in the United States 
are, understandably, not about to commit tax dollars to a sport, especially one 
such as soccer. Private enterprise will not do anything to promote the game 
unless it can guarantee its shareholders a quick profit. And the media are not 
going to pay serious attention to soccer until soccer shows that it is worth 
the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a nutshell, are three reasons why the Major Soccer League is in 
trouble even before the first ball is kicked. Steinbrecher provides another: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Major League Soccer will be up and running in some form or other by 
1995," he said. "Will we have the initial success of the J-League? I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I say that is that we have a much more complex, convoluted 
sports-entertainment industry in the United States than they do in Japan. It's 
just far more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not have all these entrenched brands that we do, the NFL, the NBA, 
major league baseball, NASCAR, college basketball, college football. We have a 
much, much more difficult market to penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the answer lies in letting the Japanese do it. Perhaps the 12 J-League 
teams would like to establish a farm system in the United States. After all, 
American baseball made the transition into Japanese culture. What is to stop 
Japanese soccer making the transition into American culture?

PARRY AND THRUST ; TWO DAYS AFTER ROGER BANNISTER BROKE FOUR MINUTES IN THE 
MILE, USC GRADUATE O'BRIEN BROKE 60 FEET IN THE SHOTPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years ago today, a USC graduate named Parry O'Brien broke an athletic 
barrier and went on to set a standard few in sports have since surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 8, 1954, on the floor of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, O'Brien put 
the shot where every other post-World War II shotputter had been trying to put 
it -- beyond the 60-foot mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, two track and field barriers had fallen within 48 hours. Two days 
before, a British medical student and miler, Roger Bannister, had broken the 
four-minute barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a powerful 22-year-old Santa Monica athlete whose single-minded, sharply 
focused competitive spirit was already a legend in his sport, was at center 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 On this sunny Saturday afternoon in 1954, he was already the holder of the 
world shotput record at 59 feet 2 1/2 inches. He was competing in a special 
shotput added to a USC-UCLA dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
 That O'Brien was the first man to put the shot 60 feet was no surprise. As a 
USC senior, he had won the Olympic gold medal at Helsinki in 1952 -- and would 
go on to win another in 1956.  
</P>
<P>
 And in the spring of 1954, he was roughly midway in a streak of 116 
consecutive shotput victories.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, anticipation mounted with his first warm-up throw that day, and 
most in the Coliseum crowd of 5,000 then knew that this, surely, was the day 
O'Brien would get Babe Ruth's number -- 60. 
</P>
<P>
 In his revolutionary half-turn style -- starting with his back to the target 
area -- and wearing sweats and tennis shoes, O'Brien's first warm-up bounced 
just past the 60-foot chalk line. It was measured, unofficially, at 60-4. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first of his six official throws, the 16-pound shot slipped off his 
hand, a foul.  
</P>
<P>
 Then: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 60-5 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 60- 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 59-10 1/4 (foul).  
</P>
<P>
 -- 59-10 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
 -- 58-10 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides breaking 60 feet, O'Brien had beaten his world record on four of his 
six throws.  
</P>
<P>
 It can be said today of Parry O'Brien that he not only mastered his event and 
then dominated it, he revolutionized it, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Until O'Brien, shotputters lumbered across their seven-foot circle at a 
90-degree angle to the throwing area, nearly coming to a stop just before 
shoving their steel spheres into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, in 1951, found a better way. He had just lost at Fresno's West Coast 
Relays to Otis Chandler, who later became publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, his father was awakened at 3 a.m. by the sound of grunts and 
thuds in the vacant lot next to their Santa Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
 Parry was putting the shot by street light. And he was launching it from a 
180-degree turn, starting with his back to the throwing area.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, look what I've found," he said, and demonstrated.  
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said recently that he likes to take credit for an assist on the first 
60-foot shotput, for upsetting O'Brien at Fresno . . . and for some advice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was heavy into weight training at that time, when few other athletes or 
coaches were," Chandler said.  
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, if you wanted to lift weights, you literally had to do it when 
the coach wasn't watching. Coaches associated weightlifting then with 
body-beautiful stuff. Olympic-style power lifting, of course, had nothing to do 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parry, like a lot of other athletes, believed weightlifting would make you so 
muscle-bound you couldn't move. I said, 'Look, I'm not a natural at this, but 
you are. Come on, lift weights. Get stronger.'  
</P>
<P>
 "(Jim) Fuchs would have easily made 60 feet if he'd lifted weights, but he 
wouldn't do it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parry did, and he went from about 210 (pounds) to 240 and continued to 
improve over a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who had also been first to reach 59 feet, went on to become the first 
shotputter to break 61, 62 and 63 feet. He set 13 indoor and outdoor world 
records. He was on four Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fuchs, who dominated the shotput in the five years after World War II: 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe in weight training then, and I didn't know many shotputters 
who did, other than Chandler. I competed at around 212 pounds. I probably could 
have gotten up to 260 with weights." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs also said that he, not O'Brien, had first tinkered with the half-turn 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to realize that we were all coming to a stop and cocking our bodies 
with the 90-degree turn," he said. "A Yale physiology teacher told me that your 
legs were three times stronger than your arms, so I was just trying to find a 
way to get my legs into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was turning 120 or 130 degrees by the time I retired, in the early 1950s. 
Parry accentuated (the style), but it became known as the O'Brien technique." 
</P>
<P>
 When interviewed recently, O'Brien seemed happiest that the central theme to 
his athletic career was constant improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I'm really proud of is that at four Olympics, I improved my mark 
every time," said O'Brien, now 62 and retired from a banking career. He lives 
in Mission Hills and will be inducted into the USC athletic Hall of Fame at the 
inaugural ceremony and dinner May 21 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien won the gold medal in 1952 at 57-1 1/2, repeated in 1956 at 60-11 1/4, 
was second in 1960 at 62-8 1/2 and fourth in 1964 at 63-0. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, in 1966, he achieved his best mark, 64-9 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 And for 10 consecutive years, he was ranked among the world's top 10 in the 
discus. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among the first athletes to bring psychological warfare to sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parry was a tough guy to get to know, but he was really a bear in 
competition," recalls USC track Coach Jim Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't talk with or look at anyone when he was competing. And then there 
was that little bottle he always brought to the meets. That bothered a lot of 
competitors."  
</P>
<P>
 The taped-up bottle contained honey. But when he competed, O'Brien would never 
say what was in it. Yet he always made sure everyone saw it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get guys I competed against to be more worried about me than about 
what they were supposed to be doing," O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bush said, "I'll always remember him as an athlete who totally mastered his 
event with discipline and dedication." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, O'Brien defined discipline. The foot foul, even today, is common in 
the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he could recall foot-fouling "no more than two or three times" in 
his 16-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Of O'Brien's competitiveness, former world record-holder Randy Matson said, 
"There was always a feeling with Parry that if you didn't get an early throw 
way out there, he was going to beat you. If it was close and it came down to 
his last couple of throws, he almost always won." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, Fuchs and Chandler all said the world record in their event would be 
about 67 or 68 feet today, had performance-enhancing pharmaceuticals never been 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 That indicts many, including Randy Matson, who broke the 70-foot barrier in 
1965. Matson denies having used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of steroids on performance in the shot may be overstated," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems perfectly possible to me a guy could go 75 feet without them. I do 
think steroids have benefited a lot of shotputters, but I don't think it's 
necessarily helped (advance) the world record. I never used them.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you see so many shotputters today who are so big, so strong -- I think 
steroids have something to do with that. But it's tough to call. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my mind, in the shot, there's no substitute for sound weight training. I 
weighed 215 and had never lifted weights when I was a freshman at Texas A&M. 
One year later, after a full year of weight training, I was 265." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, 40 years have passed since O'Brien's historic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs, 65, owns a career-counseling business and lives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, 66, is a board member and chairman emeritus of Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson, 49, is director of the Texas A&M alumni association.  
</P>
<P>
 And the world record in the shotput is 75-10 1/4.O'

NHL PLAYOFFS; RANGERS' TRAIN DERAILED BY CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seldom souls of moderation, New York's tabloids had found the Rangers provided 
the fodder headlines are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invincible!" "Juggernaut!" "Dominance!" have trumpeted a sweep through seven 
games of their first two NHL Eastern Conference playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 How about "Whoa!" for Game No. 8? 
</P>
<P>
 Washington failed to get a shot on goal in the final period but still ruined 
the Rangers' bid for a second consecutive playoff sweep Saturday night in 
Landover, Md. The Capitals got two goals from Todd Krygier in a 4-2 victory 
that cut New York's series lead to 3-1 with Game 5 on Monday in Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an exercise in humility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let things slip away. They turned it around in this one," New York 
defenseman Brian Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning seven in a row doesn't mean much now," captain Mark Messier said. 
"We've got to play a little smarter and a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvain Cote had three assists for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pride for us to beat them, but just to beat them one game 
isn't what we're here for," said Washington goalie Don Beaupre, who stopped 25 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only time in franchise history the Capitals have gone an entire 
period without a shot, but by then they were well on the way to accomplishing a 
much more significant first: a victory in May. 
</P>
<P>
 They had lost eight previous May games. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Boston 4 -- Stephane Richer scored on a breakaway 14:19 into 
overtime to give the Devils a victory at Boston and tie their Eastern 
Conference playoff series, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Richer took a loose puck near the Boston blue line and came in alone on Bruin 
goalie Jon Casey. He faked Casey to the ice and then gently slid the puck into 
the open net for his second goal of the game.

NORRIS TAKES TITLE FROM BROWN; BOXING: MCLELLAN STOPS JACKSON IN FIRST. LEIJA 
ENDS NELSON'S REIGN WITH UNANIMOUS DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A grinning, assured, immeasurably wiser and nimbler Terry Norris found 
redemption, regained his World Boxing Council super-welterweight title and 
showcased a blazing new fighting style in a unanimous decision over Simon Brown 
Saturday night at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, whose knockout loss to Brown last December raised serious questions 
about both his chin and aggressive style, dominated Brown Saturday night by 
moving in for bursts of action, then immediately swooping away from any danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He outmoved me and he outboxed me," said Brown, whose record dropped to 41-3. 
"He moved a lot. I expected that, but he just wouldn't stand still at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris (38-4) won easily on all three cards. He said he hurt his right hand in 
the first round, which increased his desire to stay out of a war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the difference was I was able to move," Norris said. "I boxed 
superbly. I think I surprised Simon Brown more than anybody by my ability to 
box, and I'm pleased with my performance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two other undercard rematches, Gerald McClellan retained his WBC 
middleweight title -- and improved on his earlier knockout of Julian Jackson -- 
with a vicious series of punches that led to a first-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first fight, James Leija knocked around Azumah Nelson enough to emerge 
with a unanimous decision and the WBC super-featherweight title, eight months 
after their first fight was ruled a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his rematch, Norris said he had learned his lesson from his chin-first, 
knockout-or-be-knocked-out attack in the first Brown fight, and he never 
wandered from his stick-and-move game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round, Norris hurt Brown early with a straight left hand on the 
chin and followed it up 30 seconds later with three chopping right hands on the 
forehead of a bending Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In between attacks, Norris stuck to his strategy of moving away from danger 
and, in the early going, was not touched with anything heavy. But Brown rocked 
him in the third with a right to the chin, and Norris' retreats got quicker 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was Boxing 101," said Norris' manager, Joe Sayatovich. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown started to showboat in the fourth, circling his right hand high as 
a taunt, Norris crushed Brown with a huge left hook under Brown's right arm 
that sent Brown whirling against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 11th, Brown was clearly frustrated with the unsuccessful chase, and 
several times in the round backed away -- demanding that Norris come to him, 
which only shortened the time Brown had to make up lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The McClellan-Jackson fight, in contrast, was all power and brutal efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 A devastating left-right combination by McClellan 10 seconds into the fight 
wobbled Jackson, and he absorbed about 30 unanswered shots against the ropes 
before sliding to the canvas to get a slip stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the end, judging by Jackson's suddenly vacant eyes, was inevitable, and 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten seconds later, McClellan (31-2, 29 KOs) slapped a sizzling left hook to 
the body that crumpled Jackson forward, achingly slow, to the canvas. After it 
was clear Jackson (49-3) was dazed beyond recovery, referee Joe Cortez stopped 
the fight at 1:23 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I hit him," McClellan said, "I knew he was going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Jackson and McClellan exchanged bombs for four rounds before a 
sharp McClellan right hand led to a fifth-round technical knockout victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a far more active fight than the tactical, mostly passionless, first bout 
between the two, a sharper, stronger Leija (28-0-2) caught a charging Nelson 
with a sweeping overhand right to the side of the head in the second round, 
which sent Nelson to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knockdown surprised me," Leija said. "That one caught him right on the 
button." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a frustrated Nelson (37-3-2) was penalized a point in the ninth round 
by referee Mitch Halpern for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 12th, it was clear that the reign of Nelson, 35, who had made 10 
successful defenses of his title and was the longest-holding world champion, 
had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt my left hand, I couldn't jab," Nelson said. "Maybe I'll retire."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; VIOLENCE? THEY'RE LUCKY CALVIN MURPHY IS RETIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no more overrated issue than violence in pro basketball. If you 
believe your eyes, ears and TV, the game is beset by hooligans and none of us 
is safe anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it has never been more peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is certainly too physical, but there have never been fewer fights, 
and the ones they have are laughable. The definition of fight has been 
stretched beyond recognition. In the '70s, fights often included real punches. 
Calvin Murphy, the game's smallest player, indulged in several memorable 
punch-outs of men a foot taller -- such as the Atlanta Hawks' John Brown and 
the Boston Celtics' Sidney Wicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was that other classic matchup, Maurice Lucas vs. the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' Portland teammate, Bill Walton, once asked him why he was so unpopular 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Walton: "Luke told me, 'Bill, I have punched out the star player in every 
city I've ever played in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the age that time forgot, the loser of a fight got a mouse under one eye 
and a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a fight consists of an insult, a push and a wild windmill punch that 
misses or glances off the side of the target's head. This is followed by a 
mammoth fine, suspension or both, depending on how red David Stern's face got 
and whether the New York Times took an editorial stand. 
</P>
<P>
 For that little poke he took at Kevin Johnson last spring, the Knicks' Greg 
Anthony lost $86,000 in fines and wages. Anthony's jab set off a melee, but the 
only damage was suffered by Pat Riley, whose pocket was torn out of one of his 
free Armani suits. Johnson was unmarked. If that was a fight, Murphy was Mike 
Tyson, Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis wrapped up in one and Lucas was Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
 What we lack in fights these days, we make up for in hype. 
</P>
<P>
 With sports-talk radio, all-sports cable networks and sports-talk TV, there's 
a dizzying amount of discussion, replay and commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the electronic news hole is a mile wide and thirsting for issues. 
What was once minor is now a huge story. 
</P>
<P>
 So after last week's Atlanta-Miami melee and the latest Dennis Rodman 
escapade, we get an ESPN piece informing us that the once-tame NBA is now as 
violent as the once-laughable NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Got that? 
</P>
<P>
 The boys who popularized such colorful phrases as goon , run him into the 
boards , mucking in the corners and my favorite, butt-ending, who have 
everything but an instruction manual for fighting -- drop your stick, pull 
opponent's sweater up to pin his arms, box his ears until you are arm-weary -- 
are now held up as models of decorum, if only by the cable network that has a 
contract to televise their games. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons are nonsensical. If the NBA is fair game on this issue -- and it 
is -- it's because Stern has vowed to quell all violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after ESPN presented its first peace prize, the New Jersey Devils and 
Boston Bruins went at it and the Boston coach had to be restrained from jumping 
over his bench to join in. BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO ABOUT IT? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the fights, the first thing basketball has to clean is the pushing, 
shoving and hacking that have become part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate the hard foul.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to understand why so much attention continues to be focused on 
taunting and so little on hard fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's because taunting isn't in any coach's game plan, but most of 
them, in their little warrior hearts, like to see their players laying out 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The first rule of the playoffs was, is and unless legislated out will always 
be, "No layups!" 
</P>
<P>
 Calling flagrant fouls was only a first step. The league should expand the 
rule to punish any intentional foul the same way -- two free throws and the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 What place do intentional fouls have in a game supposedly embodying grace and 
fluidity? Does someone think fans like seeing players hogtied under the hoop or 
grabbed in the open floor? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Move the three-point line in. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Newell suggests from the present 22 feet 9 to 22-3 or 22-0. Larry Brown 
suggests the international distance, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
 That will bring the defenses out of the lane and cut down on the contact. 
</P>
<P>
 This slow-down, bumper-pool Eastern basketball is a joke. One night, Charles 
Barkley made 23 field goals, or two more than the entire Net team had in one of 
its games against the Knicks. THANKS FOR COMING, OH MIGHTY ONE 
</P>
<P>
 The interesting question about Quinn Buckner, recently fired as coach of the 
Dallas Mavericks, is: 
</P>
<P>
 Where did the arrogance come from? 
</P>
<P>
 Did tossing soft questions to Michael Jordan for NBC with a camera man, a 
sound man, and a producer ready to fetch a Perrier persuade him he was a 
superstar, too? 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner, once considered a down-to-earth, hard-working, nice guy, showed up in 
Dallas and alienated everyone: veterans such as Derek Harper, whom he didn't 
need; young stars such as Jamal Mashburn and Jimmy Jackson, whom he certainly 
did need; the front office, 
</P>
<P>
 reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was too much for even owner Donald Carter, who is the 
long-suffering, loyal type and has the record to prove it. He fired Buckner 
last week and the franchise sighed aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Terry Davis: "We can move on now, man. I guess I'm off parole." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tim Legler, an unknown whose hustle made him a Buckner favorite: "He did 
so many things early on, I think it stripped his credibility. When he came in, 
acting like he knew everything with no experience, that was not the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving he was, indeed, in his own world, Buckner said he would absolutely 
like to coach another NBA team, although the only imaginable way would be for 
him to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the absolute pluses is I feel I can coach effectively in this league," 
Buckner said. "I was confident of that when I came into the league. I'm even 
more certain of it now." SO THESE ARE THE PLAYOFFS! 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the hot teams? 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns, seeded third in the West, and the Indiana Pacers, No. 5 in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns' sweep of the Golden State Warriors was the perfect tuneup. Barkley 
awoke, averaging 38 points a game. More important, Johnson averaged 30. Dan 
Majerle averaged 20 and shot 42% on his three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's Pacers are 34-12 since Jan. 29, the best record in the East. Although 
they are longshots, they are big, young, deep and hungry. Reserve power forward 
Antonio Davis is well known to general managers who have been calling all 
season to trade for him. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the No. 1 seeds? 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, only one No. 1 had to go five games in 20 first-round 
series. This spring, both did. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like we don't have to listen to the Seattle SuperSonics complain about 
not getting their due anymore, does it? They become the first top-seeded team 
to lose in the first round since the system went in 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Hawks finally showed up. Mookie Blaylock shot 22% the first three 
games. Danny Manning was loath to take over, Stacey Augmon isn't a jump shooter 
and Jon Koncak has all he can do to make a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to see the basket when you're double- and triple-teamed," Kevin 
Willis said after failing to make a shot in the Game 3 loss at Miami. "I can 
play through it as long as my teammates step up." 
</P>
<P>
 And the No. 2 seeds? 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets' Vernon Maxwell proved he was in playoff form by ignoring 
Hakeem Olajuwon in the post and forcing up a three-pointer in the final seconds 
of their Game 3 loss at Portland -- when they needed only two to tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell said later he didn't know the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley insisted all along there would be no John Starks watch, and when Starks 
returned, six weeks after arthroscopic knee surgery, you could see why. Starks 
is still a gamer, but a one-legged gamer. On drives, he looks like Chester from 
"Gunsmoke." Charles Smith is still doing his New York tango (17 points in Game 
1, four shots in Game 2) so the Knicks have to hold teams to 85 points to win. 
If Riley wins a championship with this band, they ought to bronze him and put 
him on a pedestal outside the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 What were the playoffs like, Grandpa Shaq? 
</P>
<P>
 How would he know? 
</P>
<P>
 The Orlando Magic lasted only three games, and Shaquille O'Neal averaged 
barely 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers grabbed him whenever he got near the basket. In one game, he took 
eight shots from the field, 18 from the free throw line. He missed nine of the 
latter and the Magic lost by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Nike trying to inspire its star client, Barkley? 
</P>
<P>
 How else does one account for the timing of that ad, released for the 
playoffs, showing Chris Webber dunking over him, then joking that Barkley had 
told him: "I don't 
</P>
<P>
 believe in role models -- but you're mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley proceeded to outscore Webber, 112-57. What a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, who must have been wondering what to do for an encore, took up with 
Madonna, another cartoon character, but one from a different strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman missed a practice, then returned to San Antonio to take out Utah's Tom 
Chambers and John Stockton in Game 2 and was suspended for Game 3, a 33-point 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting a strange defense at this late date, Rodman said everyone does this 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to stress one thing," 
</P>
<P>
 he said. "When have you ever seen me in seven years that I've been 
</P>
<P>
 in this league throw one punch? Not one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a rule book that says what I do is wrong? What I do is what every 
NBA player does." 
</P>
<P>
 Only in their dreams.

WHITTINGHAM FEELING GOOD ABOUT SECOND; KENTUCKY DERBY: HE ISN'T SURE IF STRODES 
CREEK WILL RUN IN PREAKNESS. NUMEROUS IS PROBABLE.

<P>
 Even though Strodes Creek had finished second in the 120th Kentucky Derby, 
there was a smugness at trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham, 81, hadn't won his third Derby, but he had come very close with a 
colt that was the most inexperienced horse in the field. Go For Gin beat 
Strodes Creek by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough horse, and he's just learning," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek had run in only one stake before Saturday, finishing third 
behind Brocco and Tabasco Cat in the Santa Anita Derby. He outran both of those 
rivals in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he would run Strodes Creek in the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 
Preakness at Pimlico on May 21, Whittingham said: "The best race for this horse 
would be the Belmont. But we'll consider the Preakness. It all depends on how 
he recovers in the two weeks between now and the Preakness." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belmont Stakes, the finale to the Triple Crown, is the longest race in the 
series at 1 1/2 miles. It will be run on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham is more certain about running Numerous in the Preakness, at 1 
3/16ths miles. That colt won the Derby Trial here a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's different owners, so if they both belong in the Preakness, I could 
run them both," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Strodes Creek on Saturday, was part of the crush 
that hindered several horses on the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big, gangly colt," Delahoussaye said. "So he didn't kick back in 
right away after I had to stop with him. If I didn't have to stop with him, 
maybe he would have been closer. But when he learns to run, he's going to be 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Jimmy Croll's barn, Holy Bull's trainer bemoaned his colt's racing luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had been a good, clean race, but it didn't turn out that way," 
Croll said. "My horse didn't have a chance. Ron McAnally's horse (Valiant 
Nature) didn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first stride out of the gate, my horse's hind end was out. He got hit by 
the other horses on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull suffered a small cut on his right hind leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing serious," Croll said. "It's just superficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Croll indicated that Holy Bull will run in the Preakness, which will probably 
draw a large field because of all the hard-luck cases in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Randy Winick said that he would also like to run Brocco in the 
Preakness, but will first discuss the possibility with his owners, Albert and 
Dana Broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right out of the gate, I knew we were in trouble," Winick said. "We wanted to 
be on the outside and in fourth or fifth place early. Instead, we were in 11th 
or 12th place and on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of Valiant Nature's trip, jockey Laffit Pincay said: "The inside horse (Powis 
Castle) came out. That horse was running straight and all of a sudden he came 
out. My horse seemed to come out of the race OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Delahoussaye: "Laffit nearly went down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Derby was Go For Gin's sixth start on an off track. He broke his maiden in 
the slop at Aqueduct in October, won his first stake in the slop two weeks 
later and had three seconds on the other off tracks.

JAPAN HAS PLENTY OF PRACTICE FOR ROLE OF A WORLD CUP HOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan failed by seconds to qualify for this summer's World Cup tournament when 
it was tied by Iraq, which scored the tying goal in the final minute of the 
final qualifying match. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult as that blow was to bear, it has not deterred Japanese soccer 
leaders from continuing their quest to make Japan a soccer power.Key to that 
aim is the continuing exposure of Japanese fans and players to top-level 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the J-League, whose season runs from April to November, Japan 
also stages the annual Kirin Cup tournament. This year's event, starting next 
week, features the national teams of Japan, Argentina and France, the 1998 
World Cup host. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the Toyota-Intercontinental Cup, which is played each December 
between the club champions of Europe and South America for what amounts to the 
world club championship. The Toyota Cup has been played in Tokyo every year 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the Emperor's Cup, featuring all Japanese teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan also staged the Under-17 World Championship in 1993 as part of its 
preparation for possibly playing host to the World Cup in 2002. Japan's main 
rival for that event is South Korea. The decision will be made in 1996. GRAHAME

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STARTING PITCHING HAS BEEN A RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers have received solid -- and lengthy -- performances by all three 
starters in the series against San Francisco, which has helped a well-used 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ramon (Martinez) got us into the ninth inning Thursday night and that's what 
we needed," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "Kevin (Gross) pitched a great game 
today, nine innings, and that's what we needed. And (Pedro) Astacio pitched one 
hell of a game the other night." 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, who faces Salomon Torres tonight, has been the most consistent 
on the staff, with a 2-0 record and a 2.75 earned-run average. Tom Candiotti 
(3-1, 3.92) has also pitched well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You live and die as a staff, but it was nice to see the way Ramon threw," 
Candiotti said. "That was Ramon's first win, and that's a real big thing, 
getting that is like taking a load off your back. And Pedro's curveball is very 
explosive now. Before it used to be a rolling curve, but he's learning how to 
pitch and is throwing off-speed stuff when he needs to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman, the target of criticism the last two seasons, is receiving 
praise from his teammates for his defensive play. In the seventh inning 
Saturday, Offerman combined with Delino DeShields to turn a double play, 
foiling the Giants' last scoring opportunity. Dodger pitchers combined to 
retire the next nine batters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's comfortable and relaxed and playing well," Gross said. "That double play 
was key." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's bruised left heel hurt before Saturday's game, but Gross told 
him he had to play. "He said to me, 'My heel really hurts today, do you want me 
to play?' " Gross said. "I said, 'Yes, I'm pitching and I want you to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, in his rookie season, had X-rays taken of his heel after Friday 
night's game, and they were negative. "If I had played five years already, 
maybe it would be all right, but not now, I have to play with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stomach virus that made Roger McDowell unable to pitch in Wednesday's game 
at Montreal was food poisoning, and he has lost 10 pounds since then. McDowell, 
who is still weak, pitched a scoreless eighth inning Friday night, but felt 
dizzy when he finished. . . . Manager Dusty Baker said Barry Bonds will 
probably start in today's game. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * BIG BEN: The Baltimore Orioles have averaged 7.5 runs in Ben McDonald's 6-0 
start, but that doesn't diminish his accomplishment. He was 13-14 last year 
when his support was fourth worst among American League starting pitchers. He 
has held the opposition to three runs or fewer in 46 of his last 54 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching coaches and other pitchers talked to me a lot, but for me there is 
no substitute for experience," McDonald said. "It never really sunk in until I 
got out on the mound and did it myself, experienced some failure, had some 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 * KEEPING PACE: Wilson Alvarez of the Chicago White Sox is also 6-0 and has 
won 13 consecutive decisions since returning from last season's minor league 
demotion. He led the American League in walks when sent down but has a 1.97 
earned-run average and has walked only 18 in 41 1/3 innings during his streak. 
Most scouts consider him the league's No. 2 power left-hander behind Randy 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can walk a guy and it's nothing for me," he said. "I know I can throw 
strikes and challenge hitters more. That's what works for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * MARCH OF TIME: Jack Morris celebrates his 39th birthday May 16, but the 
Cleveland Indians aren't in a party mood. Morris, in five starts since beating 
the Seattle Mariners in his Cleveland debut on April 7, is 0-3 with an 8.01 
ERA. The Indians have three hot pitchers in triple A -- Albie Lopez, Julian 
Tavarez and Chad Ogea -- and there is suspicion that Morris might not reach 90 
innings, at which point he receives $500,000, the first of his $2.25 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is the lack of consistency in the location of his pitches," 
Manager Mike Hargrove said of Morris. "It's a concern that a pitcher with his 
experience is missing by that much." 
</P>
<P>
 * BELCH AS IN . . . Former Dodger Tim Belcher, one of the last free agents to 
sign, has yet to return a dividend on the $3.4-million contract he signed with 
the generous Detroit Tigers. He is 0-5 with a 9.91 ERA and has survived the 
fifth inning only twice in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said that when it rains it pours," Belcher said. "This is more like 
a drowning." 
</P>
<P>
 * MENTAL GAME: Kevin Brown was 0-4 with a 10.86 ERA as the Texas Rangers' ace 
when he resumed communication with psychologist Harvey Dorfman. Brown is 2-0 
with a 1.06 ERA in two starts since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you need to be reminded of what you have to do," he said. "It's a 
full circle of things."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NEW NATIONAL LEAGUE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 1961, but Frank Robinson remembers it vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to forget the side-winding Don Drysdale throwing three straight heaters 
behind your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale drew a warning from the umpire at that point but wasn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 His next pitch? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right in my ribs," Robinson said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, for the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, then with the Cincinnati Reds and now assistant general manager of 
the Baltimore Orioles, trotted to first as Drysdale was banished to the Dodger 
bench and the game continued without the interruption of a bench-clearing brawl 
accompanied by a Strauss waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish baseball from hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider only the series between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia 
Phillies in which Tony Gwynn accused Curt Schilling of intentionally hitting 
him with a pitch, Mariano Duncan emptied both benches when he swung at San 
Diego catcher Brad Ausmus after being decked twice by Andy Ashby's pitches and 
Philadelphia rookie Andy Carter was ejected from his major league debut, along 
with Manager Jim Fregosi, when he hit Ausmus and Luis Lopez with pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the rare game these days that doesn't find a hitter charging the mound 
or slowly, ominously walking to first, escorted by an umpire serving as 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Coleman, the new National League president, has already handed out two 
suspensions and "will continue to do all I can to discourage" what he perceives 
to be the negative impact of a hitter charging the mound or a pitcher 
deliberately throwing at a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first place, someone is going to get seriously hurt, and secondly, 
baseball has a role in wider society," Coleman said. "I don't want kids seeing 
it and emulating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman suspended Reggie Sanders of the Reds for five games when he charged 
Pedro Martinez of the Montreal Expos after being hit by a pitch while Martinez 
was working on a no-hitter. Benito Santiago of the Florida Marlins drew a 
four-game suspension for going after Kevin Rogers of the San Francisco Giants. 
And Coleman, on Friday, suspended Derek Bell of the Padres for five games for 
charging Martinez when the Montreal pitcher buzzed Derek Bell's chin with an 
0-2 fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman may be a tougher disciplinarian than predecessor Bill White or 
American League President Bobby Brown, who is considering the Tuesday night 
incident in which Eric Anthony of the Seattle Mariners went after Boston Red 
Sox pitcher Paul Quantrill when hit by a pitch, injuring Quantrill's right ring 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman wouldn't suggest that White or Brown have been too soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let my actions speak for themselves," he said. "I consider the brawling 
negative and will do what I can to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's penalty system hasn't been a strong deterrent. The modest fines 
represent pocket change to players earning millions of dollars, and the 
suspensions are almost always appealed, meaning the player can continue to play 
for weeks or months, or until the schedule puts him in New York, where he can 
meet with his league president in a hearing that frequently produces a 
reduction in the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, I'd expedite the penalty as quickly as possible, but 
the rules provide for an appeal and that can't be changed arbitrarily," Coleman 
said. "We have to live with the system." 
</P>
<P>
 The system, most say, is also flawed in that it provides for a free shot by 
the pitcher of one team, knowing that if it produces a warning, the pitcher of 
the other team can't retaliate without possible ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different game with different attitudes than when Robinson played. No 
one competed with more grit and intensity, but he recalled charging the mound 
only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one circumstance escapes me, but I remember going after Ron Herbel of the 
Giants when he hit me above the elbow only a few days after I had been hit in 
the same spot by Ron Piche in Milwaukee," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Gaylord Perry, who was scheduled to pitch the next game, standing 
in the Giants' dugout and yelling, 'If you think he hit you hard, wait until 
tomorrow.' I wasn't going to be intimidated. I hit two home runs off Perry." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson let his Hall of Fame actions speak for him. He did it at the plate 
and on the basepaths. If retaliation was called for, he went hard into the 
second baseman or shortstop on double-play situations, a philosophy endorsed by 
Don Baylor, who holds the record for being hit by pitches but also charged the 
mound only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Robinson and Baylor: How do you help your team if you're ejected by 
charging the mound? Common sense, but now players know only the one thing: Go 
after the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Robinson said, begins with the aluminum bat used at the amateur 
level. Hitters stand at the plate with impunity, knowing pitchers won't work 
inside because of the fear of aluminum handle hits. Then, faced with tighter 
pitching at the professional level, the hitter tends to feel his turf is being 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous, said Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of education," he said. "Hitters have to understand that 
pitchers have a right to pitch inside, to knock you down, to brush you back, to 
even hit you as long as it's not in the area of the head. It's part of the art 
of pitching, part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitchers are also human. Every time they knock you down it's not intentional. 
Hitters have to learn to take a closer look at the situation before they 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson knows that he will get an argument from many hitters on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I won't get it from the old-timers, although I'm not talking as an 
old-timer," he said. "I think I've bridged the gap. I'm not knocking all 
hitters. I'm not putting them all under the same blanket. They just have to 
understand that if the pitcher has a right to pitch inside, it doesn't mean 
they have a right to charge the mound every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman agrees. He said discussions are being conducted in the hope of finding 
a solution and reducing the number of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking this seriously," he said. "People may feel it's part of the game, 
but I'm not going to get into that. It needs to be dealt with and discouraged." 
Add Brawls 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson says Coleman can't deal with Martinez, the 
former Dodger, soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's going to kill him," Johnson said. "A whole bunch of guys are going 
to be after him. What's beyond me is he hasn't even gotten a warning. Don't 
umpires ever read the newspapers or watch ESPN and see what this guy is doing? 
He's hit seven guys already this year and four in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some old baseball purists told Leonard Coleman that's the way baseball is 
played. What he needs to do is get Bob Gibson and Frank Robinson together and 
hash this thing out on inside pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I hit a thousand batters," he said after the incident with 
Bell. "I'm not going to stop pitching inside." Missing Link 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range significance of the Atlanta Braves' 2-9 skid that ended with a 
victory over the Florida Marlins on Wednesday could be that it demonstrated the 
importance right-handed hitting Ron Gant played in a lineup that now includes 
lefties -Fred McGriff, Ryan Klesko, David Justice and Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 With right-handed hitting shortstop Jeff Blauser on the disabled list and 
righty outfielders Mike Kelly, Dave Gallagher and Bill Pecota batting a 
cumulative .219 through Wednesday, the Braves have little balance and were 1-6 
against left-handed pitchers before the weekend's early showdown with Montreal. 
The promising Kelly, in fact, was sent back to triple A on Thursday with a .192 
average and replaced by Jarvis Brown, a .216 lifetime hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, meanwhile, may be running out of options. Both the San Francisco Giants 
and Houston Astros bowed out of that pursuit this week, reluctant to sign him 
only through the '94 season, as he is asking. That would allow him to retain 
his free-agent eligibility when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Red Sox, who must now overcome the loss of Frank Viola, may try to 
do it with offense and could be Gant's best bet, although they are also keenly 
interested in Montreal outfielder Larry Walker while hesitant to give up either 
of their top prospects, Trot Nixon and Frankie Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, like Gant, is also eligible for free agency when the season ends and 
figures to be moved soon, with the Expos disturbed by his often less than 
intense approach and convinced that Rondell White, now at triple-A Ottawa, is 
ready to replace him. Ho Hum 
</P>
<P>
 The Sporting News has exhumed speculation that Gene and Jackie Autry are 
selling the Angels to the Disney Corp., linking it to the Autrys' sale of KMPC 
and their Palm Springs hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys have not sold the Palm Springs hotel. In fact, Jackie Autry said, 
they are trying to get a license that will allow them to build a 1,000-seat 
dinner theater on the hotel grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She also insists that the club is not for sale, adding, "How many times do I 
have to say that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, meanwhile, have begun negotiations with the city of Anaheim on a 
lease extension beyond 2001, predicating the extension on architectural 
improvements at Anaheim Stadium and financial improvements in the current 
terms.

<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi sat in the dugout four hours before game time 
Saturday, watching the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers and Assistant General Manager Tim Mead stood behind the 
batter's cage, pitching coach Chuck Hernandez was crouched behind the mound, 
and nearly a dozen Angels were on the field wanting to take a good look for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston was pitching his first simulated game since undergoing 
arthroscopic elbow surgery April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Langston concluded his four-inning stint, it was as if the Angels 
had just received permission to print playoff tickets. He yielded only three 
hits and struck out seven while pitching to Rex Hudler, Chris Turner and Spike 
Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston is scheduled to be examined today by Dr. Lewis Yocum, and if he is 
provides clearance, Langston will start on the upcoming trip in either Texas or 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't feel better," Langston said. "I feel I've got more extension on 
the arm than I did before surgery. Really, this has worked out as good as it 
possibly could." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Reliever John Dopson has a bone spur in his right elbow, and if he feels the 
spur confines him, he will undergo arthroscopic surgery. . . . First baseman 
Eduardo Perez underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test on the strained 
ligament of his left hand. He suffered the injury April 26 in New York, and his 
hand still has not healed. BOB NIGHTENGALE

CIF RETHINKS TRANSFER RULES; PREPS: STUDENTS WHO CHANGE SCHOOLS WILL BE GRANTED 
IMMEDIATE ATHLETIC ELIGIBILITY, WITH SOME RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students who transfer high schools under the state's new open-enrollment law 
received a reprieve concerning athletic eligibility Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After voting down two proposals on the matter Friday, the California 
Interscholastic Federation Council reversed itself a day later by deciding to 
grant immediate eligibility to open enrollment transfer students. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rule takes effect beginning with the 1994-95 school year and includes 
several provisions. For starters, the transfer must take place no later than 
the first 15 days of the school year and can only be done once during a high 
school career. Also, students who transfer for disciplinary or athletic reasons 
will be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 By this July, public school students in California will be allowed to transfer 
to schools within their districts, space permitting. The new legislation has 
created special problems for the CIF, which has strict eligibility rules 
regarding transfer students. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the CIF's 10 sections, including the Southern and City sections, grant 
athletic eligibility only when a student has a change of residency or receives 
a special permit. These rules will still be followed when the new one does not 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials fear open enrollment will create the shopping of athletes and 
building of all-star teams. Because of that, the council voted down two 
proposals Friday that would have granted immediate eligibility to such transfer 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Because open enrollment will be in effect statewide by this summer, the CIF 
was left without a policy on the matter. Thomas Byrnes, CIF commissioner, said 
the sections would individually have to deal with eligibility until the council 
could reconsider the issue at its next meeting in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members met late Friday, however, to see if they could come up 
with a uniform policy. Gary Smidderks, president of the Southern Section 
Council and principal of Los Angeles Baptist High, helped draft the rule and 
presented it to the CIF Council on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us in the council felt something had to be done so every section 
wasn't doing something different," Smidderks said. "Otherwise, we were looking 
at some potential legal troubles."

ON DIFFERENT TRACKS; TALES FROM TWO TRAINS THROUGH SOUTHEAST ASIA; FROM BANGKOK 
TO SINGAPORE, LUXURIATING AMID THE WELL-HEELED ON THE NEW EASTERN & ORIENTAL 
EXPRESS

 Passengers must maintain an exotic fiction aboard the new Eastern & Oriental 
Express train between Bangkok and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-night, 1,200-mile journey of pampered luxury, they must learn 
to live in the past, back in the colonial days when Europeans and Americans 
could scold the "natives" for not polishing the silver or remain aloof from 
Asian villages just outside their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiction on the E&O starts with gracious greetings from the carriage 
stewards. They are all Thais, whose inbred humility goes over well with the 
wealthy Western traveler who seems to want to be treated like a monarch, or to 
act like one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am your steward during this trip," says a young Thai man dressed in a 
faux-silk uniform, as he stows my bags in a well-appointed compartment that 
includes a hot-water shower stall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need anything -- more caviar . . . your shoes polished . . . your bed 
turned down -- please push this button," Weera Ounpak says softly. 
</P>
<P>
 He offers to unpack my dress suit. "You will need it for dining in the 
restaurant car," he says, "The first sitting is at 7:30." 
</P>
<P>
 The E&O, which is an improved clone of Europe's Orient Express, comes packed 
with many myths. For one, no such luxury train ever existed in colonized East 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man who revived the Orient Express in 1982, James Sherwood, launched 
the E&O last fall hoping to create a legend from the start. He has put on rails 
all the comforts, charm and history of the old Oriental Hotel in Bangkok or the 
Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Sherwood, an American shipping and hotel 
entrepreneur, bought 24 railway carriages from the defunct Silver Star line in 
New Zealand and, with the help of designer Gerard Gallet, remodeled them into 
the stunning opulence of a five-star train, if ever there was such a rating for 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the lotus-flower bouquets and small lacquered Chinese panels that 
adorn each carriage, however, the E&O lacks Oriental flavor. Instead, the 
exterior is painted British racing green, while the interiors glow with 
beveled-glass doors, brass lamps, granite sinks, rouge-colored textiles and 
wood marquetry handcrafted in crisscross patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lounge car, passengers can listen to a pianist play Noel Coward and 
other prewar tunes. An observation car offers a lofty view of the passing 
landscape from on high. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the train, the wet, hot air of the tropics hangs "as heavy as 
remembered sin," as one colonist put it. (The Malaysian peninsula lies just two 
degrees north of the Equator.) Inside, however, an air-conditioner provides a 
scrubbed flow of cool air through decorative Victorian-style vents. 
</P>
<P>
 The windows are triple-sealed to keep out train noise and smells such as the 
smoke of burning rice husks, the mossy dampness of bamboo forests or the stench 
of a ditch outside thatched huts. 
</P>
<P>
 The train's chef, Kevin Cape, complains that passengers are reluctant to eat 
the spicy food of Malaysia or Thailand. At best, he uses small amounts of lemon 
grass, coriander, cumin or soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people want a neo-colonial experience," he says, "but they prefer food 
from the old country." As it is, he puts on a movable feast of the highest 
European culinary standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers can choose three types of cabins -- standard, state or presidential 
-- with the last offering hotel-size rooms, floor beds instead of bunks, the 
most elegant decor and separate quarters for a personal servant. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the local train that plies the same track offers three types of 
seats: upholstered, padded leather or cushioned plastic. Most people in this 
part of the world consider trains today dirty and perilous, suitable only for 
peasants. A train, states detective M. Hercule Poirot in "Murder on the Orient 
Express" by Agatha Christie, "is as dangerous as a sea voyage." 
</P>
<P>
 Weera, my steward, seems to enjoy pointing out the dangers, the few there 
might be. He tells of previous trains that have hit tigers, water buffalo, 
elephants and other jungle creatures still found in this part of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 For 19th-Century English explorers, this journey would have required a month 
riding on an elephant, dodging snakes in trees, panthers in the dark, or 
Sumatran rhinos on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look! Look!" Weera yells as the train waits at the Malaysia-Thailand border. 
"The police are taking that man away in handcuffs!" Another smuggler, like 
pirates of ancient times, has been nabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Malaysia's landscape consists of bright-green rice paddies, endless 
plantations of rubber, coconut or palm trees, and the occasional limestone 
karst -- spires that resemble those is Guilin, China. Women wearing sarongs add 
splashes of color to the passing scenes. The few patches of jungle are thick 
with tropical trees, air ferns, creepers and hundreds of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Muslim mosques and Hindu and Chinese temples, many of the buildings 
en route reveal an English colonial heritage. The most compelling is Kuala 
Lumpur's railway station. It mixes the Indian Mogul style of onion domes and 
arches with Gothic elements, all painted white. Its main restaurant is an A&W 
Root Beer stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the E&O's poshness is to offer a leisurely tour in place of 
hopping from airport to airport. And a train's pace allows for a different 
social atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orient Express, writes Dame Agatha in her mystery novel, "lends itself to 
romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all 
nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one 
another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot 
get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, . . . never, 
perhaps, to see each together again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the E&O, passengers love to be autocrats for three days, complaining about 
this and that. The Thai stewards, whose country was never colonized by the 
West, play their role well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restaurant car, amid the clinking of crystal glasses, the passengers 
let their barriers down. A group of wealthy Italians, dressed in the latest 
Milan fashions, eats with gusto. Across from them, two English couples with an 
expressionless air of disapproval seem ready to snap at the waiters. At the end 
of the carriage, an American man in a loud blue jacket sits with his wife, who 
wears an an equally loud print dress and fake pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 Only occasionally do the travelers watch the scenery flowing by. It's a pity. 
If you look closely into the homes of rice farmers and plantation workers, you 
can sometimes see them watching such popular TV shows as "Lifestyles of the 
Rich and Famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Hugh Clifford, a 19th-Century British official in the Malay states, may 
have been the first to describe the impact of the West here: "In these days the 
boot of the ubiquitous white man leaves its marks on all fair places of the 
earth . . . reducing all things to that dead kind of conventionality which we 
call civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 Weera comes to my compartment to bring me afternoon tea and cakes. He looks 
out the window and smiles at the monsoon rain on the muddy rice paddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain is good for growing rice," he says. To the passengers, the rain is a 
view spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be passing my village soon," he smiles, covering up a sadness. He 
then reveals that he left his village at age 19, learned English in Bangkok, 
and eventually got his current job. He pulls a necklace from under his shirt 
and shows me an image of Buddha, whom he credits with providing him a job and 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things to see in these villages," he says, "but we are rushing 
by." He then tells me all the steps in growing rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now feel homesick when we pass by my home," he says. His father is so poor 
that he plows his field with a cow. Weera, the first in his large family to get 
a good job, is trying to save about three months' wages to buy his father a 
tractor, which costs about $2,000. I tell him that many of the passengers paid 
about that much money for a one-way ticket on this two-day trip. He laughs in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I say, foreigners pay big money to lightly sample your homeland. He 
slowly backs out into the hallway. "That is very . . . exotic," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly.  
</P>

ON DIFFERENT TRACKS; TALES FROM TWO TRAINS THROUGH SOUTHEAST ASIA; FROM SAIGON

TRANSINDOCHINOIS LOCAL

 It was a bright, noontime heat that seared the platform at Ho Chi Minh City's 
municipal railway station, yet it was only a little past 6 in the morning. The 
mid-May monsoon was weeks overdue, and today the air was wet and oppressive. In 
the still of the railway compartment, sunlight danced on worn upholstery and 
faded brightwork. And drifting through the open window came the hawking tones 
of the station vendors, touting crisp baguettes, pungent coffee and 10-cent 
paper fans. 
</P>
<P>
 From this corner seat I had planned to see an enormous amount of Vietnam. 
Beginning here, in the Saigon of old, the iron rails of the Transindochinois 
would carry me northward 1,240 miles along Vietnam's coast on the South China 
Sea, to the capital at Hanoi. Over the next three days, my journey would 
traverse seven degrees of latitude and some of the most dramatic vistas in the 
world. But as I gazed out at the bustle of departure, I pondered what else had 
lured me to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adventure" destinations can have a magnetic appeal. It's like skiing virgin 
snow or emerging into an undiscovered cave. President Clinton's lifting of the 
U.S. trade embargo was still 10 months in the future, so Vietnam was powder of 
the freshest kind. There was also the matter of resilience. For more than 2,000 
years, the Vietnamese had fought outsiders for this tiny corner of the Asian 
continent. The legacy of that conflict, I was told, is to be found in their 
language, culture and customs, and is said to be what most defines their 
character. On this train I thought I might have a chance to touch that. 
</P>
<P>
 A little before 6:30 a.m., the bright-red diesel thrummed to attention, 
sending a shudder the length of the train. Uniformed officials hustled 
stragglers aboard, while bags and boxes tied with string piled higher and 
higher in the passageways outside each four-person compartment. Amid the chaos, 
no one checked tickets or berth assignments on this all-sleeper train. But I 
saw no arguments over seating or baggage. As I was to discover again and again 
in Vietnam, there is a natural, unspoken order of things, where mutual respect 
is derived from common cause. As the 16 pale green carriages slid from the 
sweltering platform, I marked this to be the first of many lessons I would 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The train picked up speed; through the shanties on the outskirts of Saigon, 
past rail crossings with waiting hordes of bicyclists, and across the Saigon 
River, where the sampans made their lazy passage from shore to shore. As the 
clatter on the sleepers hit rhythm, I settled deeper into the upholstery, 
ready, eager and expectant.  
</P>
<P>
 Like all the great rail journeys of the world, the Transindochinois evokes 
memories of a time past as it plays its role in life present. As in Egypt and 
India, Vietnam's railway system has colonial roots. Construction began in 1899, 
when the French sought to link the three provinces of Annam, Tonkin and Cochin 
China. The terrain was difficult; the climate was worse and it took 37 years to 
complete the 1,072 miles of narrow-gauge rail from Saigon to Hanoi. By 1936, 
trains in both directions were covering the distance in a speedy 40 hours and 
20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, France's grand achievement serves farmers on their way to market, 
distant relatives making family connections and businessmen rebuilding a 
shattered economy. After decades of track damage and reconstruction, the 
journey from Saigon to Hanoi now takes 52 hours -- 12 hours longer than 40 
years before. But then again, as a man on the train told me, "Vietnam is not a 
place that's in a hurry." At this particular moment, however, I was in a hurry 
to take advantage of a far simpler invention. At the end of each carriage, in a 
commodious booth, was the classic Gallic hole-in-the-ground, over which I had 
to perch for relief -- a difficult proposition on terra firma, made worse by 
the swaying motion of the train. At our measured pace, we pushed east toward 
the coast at Phan Thiet, some 6 1/2 hours distant. In time, the picture at the 
window changed. Forests of coconut and casuarina gave way to endless 
waterlogged plains that mark the beginning of the south-central Vietnam rice 
basket. Levees crisscrossed the broad expanse of paddy, creating a patchwork 
quilt of green that stretched to the horizon. And knee-deep in water, men 
threshed, women sowed and oxen plowed in the traditions of the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun had climbed high in the sky, the mercury inched a little higher. 
Overhead, an electric fan hummed and whirred sporadically. And across the 
compartment, two men in short-sleeve shirts and suit pants worn shiny with 
wear, cooled themselves with paper fans. My stomach growled at the obvious 
foolishness of not traveling well-stocked with food, when the carriage 
attendant, a young woman of no more than 17, came to the door and made an 
announcement. "You want lunch?" translated one of my companions in halting 
English. They were schoolteachers from Da Nang, returning from a training 
seminar in Saigon. "I have known many Americans," he said, over small bowls of 
warm rice and dried fish. He had the steady face and quick eyes of a man who 
had been under fire, but I didn't ask if he had been with the army of South 
Vietnam. "You have children?" he asked. We shared the wrinkled photos that 
every father carries in his wallet, and spoke of wives and family, like two 
neighbors across a fence in suburban America. 
</P>
<P>
 Moung Ma is the station that serves the coastal city of Phan Thiet. You can't 
quite see the South China Sea from here, but you can feel its cooling breeze. 
Beneath a ragged stand of banana trees, two old men in dark clothes and rubber 
sandals spit betel juice in the dust as they sat playing dice. An old woman 
swept the dirt in front of the waiting room, swiping at a pair of scrawny dogs 
scavenging for scraps. The station buildings, like most along the route of the 
Transindochinois, were once an expression of European civilization in the 
wilderness. Today, the shutters hang at the windows by rusty screw and nail, as 
one might find on an abandoned house in the French countryside; the neat flower 
beds, devoid of living color, retained their whitewashed wooden borders, and 
the flagpole still stood tall, only flying different colors. During the 
30-minute stop, the tableaux barely changed, like a Rockwell painting of a 
bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 In motion again, the picture at the window changed once more. The late 
afternoon saw rice paddies give way to gently undulating hills covered with 
giant cacti and poinciana trees, and looming at the horizon, the low mountain 
range that is the southern extremity of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Storm 
clouds had gathered and the air was wet with expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Thap Cham, sandstone statues of the Hindu gods, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, 
stared downfrom a hill to the west. The stop was for but a moment, but long 
enough for a young boy of about 7 to sell thin purple volumes to eager, 
outstretched hands. "Today's prayer," said one of my companions. The thunderous 
skies grew deep charcoal and hastened the night. Scattered showers danced in 
the distance as the train turned northward. Rain began to spatter the window, 
as a young man who had boarded at Thap Cham began to tell me of his visit to 
his grandfather. "It is traditional for the dying to receive visitors for two 
weeks, to formally take leave," he said. My condolences were greeted with a 
wave of the hand. "There is no dying. Only departure to another place." It is 
theory central to the Vietnamese culture. Each person is part of an extended 
family, bound together in unending bloodlines, through the spirits of the dead, 
of children unborn, and even of those not conceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 6 that evening, the carriage lighting came on dimly, flickering with 
each bump and shudder. The train slowed into Nha Trang, the "Cannes" of 
Vietnam. This night, however, its golden beaches and sparkling waters were 
hidden by darkness and rain. At the station, passengers boarded, the locomotive 
crew was changed, and the rest of us ate. Rain drummed on the roof as bowls of 
aromatic soup, pungent with basil and lemon grass, were passed through carriage 
windows from makeshift cook stands on the platform. Vendors selling beer, 
cigarettes and hard candies spilled into the compartments. Fistfuls of grimy 
dong, Vietnam's near worthless currency, changed hands. "Watch your bags," a 
voice whispered earnestly. Rail journeys in Vietnam are relatively crime-free, 
but the young boys who ride the roof of the train are known to take opportunity 
where they find it. 
</P>
<P>
 The diesel's whistle blew and the soup vendors scurried to collect their 
bowls, finished or not. About 9 that evening, the carriage attendant brought us 
clean white sheets and lowered the cantilevered sleeping berths for the night. 
The teachers settled in, but I was mistaken if I thought that sleep would 
beckon me. Across the compartment, a young man who had joined us at Nha Trang, 
turned to me and said softly in Vietnamese, "Han hanh duoc gap ong." He 
continued on, louder now, "Chao ong." I bravely fiddled with the pages of a 
throwaway phrase book found in a drawer at Saigon's Rex Hotel. He mercifully 
took it from me, indicating the words he was saying: "Hello . . . glad to meet 
you," I said, pronouncing the English translation. As he pointed to the 
appropriate response, I gingerly tried the Vietnamese words: "Ong manh khoe 
khong." A voice from above gave out a big belly laugh.  
</P>
<P>
 With that simple phrase book, the young man and I conversed throughout the 
night. As the train clattered on through the rain, the intricate tones of the 
Vietnamese language curled around and lingered in the back of my throat, 
exiting now and then to peals of laughter, and sometimes applause. At some 
point, we drifted into sleep, rocked by the rhythm of the train. Dawn broke in 
the Central Highlands and the diesel's whistle blew, prompting salutary waves 
from a group of peasants on their way to the rice paddies. The rain had 
stopped, the skies were clear and the golden hues of early morning bathed the 
countryside with a coat of amber. 
</P>
<P>
 The train began a series of gentle arcing turns that carried us into the 
backwater town of Quang Ngai. It's a peaceful spot, famous only for its 
proximity to My Lai, the hamlet where women and children were brutally 
massacred by U.S. troops one afternoon in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 From here, the rail tracks run parallel with National Route 1 for a distance. 
Here, evidence of another war and another time dot the hillsides. Gray stone 
pillboxes that once guarded this strategic highway during the Franco-Viet Minh 
War, now are covered in moss and lichen, but their sniper slits still stare 
down with anger. And then, there is Da Nang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Da Nang marked the halfway point on my journey north to Hanoi. It is Vietnam's 
fourth largest city and second most important port. It was also to be the place 
where my companions would bid me farewell. The teachers were cheered to be 
going home. "Today I will see my sons. Soon you will see yours," said my 
talkative friend. My all-night language friend said goodby in his own special 
way: "I have some linen to take to the laundry." The diesel shuddered. And we 
were gone.  
</P>
<P>
 Da Nang to Hue by rail is the most scenic journey in all of Vietnam. The 3 
1/2-hour journey covers a scant 62 miles, but climbs high into the Annamite 
Cordillera, giving breathtaking views of the most beautiful coastline in the 
world. Lush green forests of coconut, betel and plantain descend from the 
mountain tops to the curving strips of golden sand that mark the water's edge. 
The South China Sea shimmers in the sunlight. The locomotive's brakes screeched 
steel-on-steel as we descended into the ancient capital of Hue. It was a 
journey of anticipation. Without visiting Hue, one has not visited Vietnam. 
Straddled across the Perfume River, it is the confluence of everything 
spiritual and intellectual in Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
 It is where the Nguyen Emperors, the last Imperial Dynasty to rule Vietnam, 
held court; their Citadel and Forbidden City still stand in majestic ruin. Ho 
Chi Minh, the father of the nation, received some of his boyhood education at 
the French Lycee here in the 1920s. And in 1963, Buddhist monks from Hue 
shocked the world when they used self-immolation in the streets of Saigon to 
protest the corrupt Saigon government. Today, Hue is still what Somerset 
Maugham called "a pleasant little town with a leisurely European air." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain grace and splendor here that transcends the poverty so 
apparent elsewhere in Vietnam. It is also renowned for the most beautiful women 
in Asia. The train, however, had no time for such dalliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Northward from Hue, the tracks returned to keep company with National Route 1 
as we forged into Quang Tri Province and toward what was once the Demilitarized 
Zone (DMZ). Vietnam was partitioned here in 1954, and despite reunification, 
this place remains a demarcation line. The smiles and waves along the railroad 
tracks that were so common in the South, were suddenly replaced with sterner 
faces. The multicolored hues of Saigon laissez-faire, became the drab monotony 
of olive green military shirts and pith helmets. I sensed restraint. And a 
little sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transindochinois continued north, for miles, for hours and for what seemed 
like days. The view from the window became so monotonously drab that we, the 
passengers, became theater. Walking the passageway, I discreetly peered into 
each compartment and found people doing what boredom demands -- eating, 
sleeping, playing cards, reading novels. Afternoon became evening and the 
twilight lingered, longer now at this higher latitude. And around 10 that 
night, the train ambled into Dong Ha, where the soup vendors were waiting and 
the tableaux of commerce was played out once more. Thirty minutes later, we 
were in motion again on the longest leg of our journey -- seven full hours to 
the provincial capital of Vinh. Sleep came mercifully. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the third day was greeted with rice and eggs, sizzling on the 
carriage attendant's oil stoves in the passageway outside the compartment. With 
a steaming cup of cafe sua , I peered into the gray dawn and saw Vinh disappear 
in the dust of its poor soil and harsh climate. I imagined I hadn't missed 
much. The capital of Vietnam's most populous province has never really 
recovered from the bombing it received in the Franco-Viet Minh War. It is now 
just a traveler's stop on the way to Hanoi. It did, however, mark the beginning 
of the closing stages of my journey. Hanoi was now about eight hours distant; a 
scant 155 miles. As we forged onward, the bomb craters that dotted many of the 
bridges and railheads along the Transindochinois, became more numerous. In the 
brown waters that now filled them, women washed their clothes while their 
children splashed and frolicked. And on the highway that had kept us company 
for much of this journey, two men rode a bicycle, each with a foot upon a 
pedal, both sharing the burden of forward progress.  
</P>
<P>
 Pushing into the Red River delta, the fields, by degree, became greener; and 
across the flat plain, the timeless picture of agriculture was painted once 
again. A cantilevered bridge held sway across the river, and through its 
rusting stanchions, Hanoi flickered into view. The French had once thought this 
city to be the most elegant in the East. And as we approached, it wasn't hard 
to imagine that beneath the grease and grime of the shuttered architecture, the 
colonial jewel still lurked, waiting only for a good sweep and a fresh coat of 
paint.  
</P>
<P>
 The wheels of the Transindochinois clattered in to Hanoi's rail terminal about 
3 that afternoon. As the passengers emptied into the bowels of the station, I 
was struck by that special melancholy of travelers, when so many half-told 
stories are left at stations along the way. It was the end of the line.  
</P>
<P>
 But Hanoi was the perfect place to end this adventure. I had come looking for 
the soul of Vietnam, and found its humanity everywhere. Like the city in which 
I now found myself, all it took was to scratch beneath the surface.

 The Vietnam File 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo earlier this 
year, travel to Vietnam has become less complicated and more affordable. But 
since formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam have yet to be established, no 
U.S. airlines offer regular passenger flights there. So for the time being, 
getting from LAX to Ho Chi Minh City is still a two-stop undertaking. The most 
economical, hassle-free connections are through Singapore (Singapore Airlines) 
or Taipei (Singapore Airlines, China Airlines or Eva Airways), with round-trip 
fares currently running $1,100-$1,200.  
</P>
<P>
 Visas: Americans traveling to Vietnam need a passport and a visa. The easiest 
way to get the latter is through a tour operator (if you are using one for 
other arrangements) or through a visa service such as Zierer, with offices in 
San Francisco and Washington, D.C.; telephone (800) 843-9151 or (800) 421-6706. 
Allow a month for processing.  
</P>
<P>
 Tour companies: A handful of companies have experience in arranging 
all-inclusive tours to Vietnam -- providing the necessary paperwork, visas, and 
comprehensive travel and tour arrangements covering your stay, including 
accommodations and guides. Among those on the West Coast are: Asian Pacific 
Adventures, 826 Sierra Bonita Ave., Los Angeles 90036, tel. (213) 935-3156; 
Travcoa, P.O. Box 2630, Newport Beach 92658, tel. (800) 992-2004, and InnerAsia 
Expeditions, 2627 Lombard St., San Francisco 94123, tel. (800) 777-8183 or 
(415) 922-0448.  
</P>
<P>
 Self-booking: The more adventurous may prefer to make less-structured (and 
cheaper) arrangements. For my trip, I pre-purchased a limited stop-over package 
(three nights' accommodations in Ho Chi Minh City, two nights in Hanoi and all 
visa arrangements) for $660 from Adventures in Paradise (now doing business as 
Absolute Asia), 155 West 68th St., Suite 525, New York 10023; tel. (800) 
736-8187. I booked airline reservations through a travel agent. The remainder 
of my three-week trip (including train journey, $80 one way) was arranged after 
arrival in Vietnam with OSCAN, the competent and highly accommodating 
government tourist agency. Their offices in Ho Chi Minh City are at 2D Pham 
Ngoc Thach St., near the Catholic cathedral; from the United States, tel. 
011-84-8-231-022, or fax 011-84-8-231-024.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; SPANISH TOWNS WILL CLOSE TO CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few monuments capture the spirit of past rulers as does El Escorial, the vast 
monastery-palace built by the brooding Phillip II, who presided over Spain's 
Golden Age in the second half of the 16th Century. Phillip, great-grandson of 
Ferdinand and Isabella, was so pleased with the buildings that he spent the 
last 14 years of his life there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remote little village that so pleased Phillip in 1562 has grown into 
the lively provincial town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, where the more than 
800,000 tourists who visit annually have taken a toll on the castle. Or, to be 
more precise, their cars have taken a toll on the 400-year-old stone buildings, 
which have been eroded and blacked by vehicular air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the monastery and palace -- about 25 miles northwest of Madrid -- will 
early next year join other tourist sites in Spain by closing off its grounds to 
cars and other motor vehicles. This follows a conservation trend already 
underway in some of the Spain's other ancient cities -- including Toledo (the 
beautiful fortress city on a hill), Granada (site of the Alhambra) and Cuenca 
(site of the famous "hanging houses" that cling from a cliff). In these places, 
visitors this summer may notice construction of escalators and elevators that 
will be used to connect the hill-top enclaves with parking lots being 
constructed nearby. (Free buses will carry visitors to the sites from the 
parking areas.) 
</P>
<P>
 El Escorial is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., April through September; and Tuesday 
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., October through March. Admission is 
$3.50 per person with reduced prices available both for children and senior 
citizens.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: GREECE; ATHENS OPENERS; TRADITIONAL APPETIZERS GOOD ENOUGH FOR 
THE GODS ARE MAKING THE MEAL IN MODERN OUZERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AGLAIA KREMEZI, Kremezi writes for Athens' Sunday Eleftherotypia newspaper 
and is the author of The Foods of Greece (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $50) and the 
forthcoming Mediterranean Pantry (Workman). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mezedes were always my favorite dishes. As a child growing up in Greece, I 
don't remember going to restaurants much. But I distinctly recall the calm, 
simple and leisurely appetizer-like meals my family and I savored in tiny 
seaside taverns during summer holidays on the islands of the Aegean. The smell 
of grilled octopus, of freshly cut tomato and cucumber,the aroma of dried 
oregano and, of course, the sweet perfume of ouzo are forever tied to those 
happy summer days by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is the reason small, simple ouzeries where mezedes are served are 
still my favorite restaurants, even now that I must eat in all kinds of fancy 
places for my newspaper food column. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is not just the food but the tradition that makes it so appealing to 
me, and to tourists, who might not have had the best food experiences in 
Athens. The problem is that our best food is still found in homes. While 
Athenians do go out to restaurants, our dining-out experience often has more to 
do with socializing than with eating. It has only been recently that the young 
people -- who don't cook as much as previous generations -- have begun to 
demand quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The one exception to this is the meze experience, which in addition to being 
food of very good quality, is an excellent introduction to Greek cuisine. It is 
a tradition that we know has existed for centuries, with dishes that were 
written about as far back as the 3rd Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Italians call antipasti and the Spanish call tapas , we call mezedes 
(plural for meze ). But unlike the Italian and Spanish snack tradition, when 
Greeks invite someone "for a meze ," we usually mean a meal composed of several 
little dishes, which often replace lunch although they can also be dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, a meze is a bunch of friends sitting around a small table, each one 
with fork in hand, diving into small plates that keep coming at a steady pace. 
Whoever manages "the quickest fork" -- as the Greek saying goes -- will succeed 
in tasting all of the dishes. The rest must wait for the next round that will 
inevitably follow. Such a meze lunch can last for hours, and takes place in 
restaurants around the city, as well as at home in the kitchen, the sitting or 
dining room, on the balcony or, perhaps, in the garden on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
 Special restaurants that serve meze are mainly the ouzeries, which are named 
for ouzo, the strong aniseed-flavored drink that usually accompanies mezedes. 
Ouzo can be drunk neat, but most people dilute it: three parts water to one 
part ouzo. This sweet tasting drink compliments well the strong flavored meze 
dishes, especially the pickles and the very garlicky sauces and spreads whose 
flavors would kill the more delicate wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouzeries used to be shabby little corner shops, typically hangouts inhabited 
by men, where blue-collar workers and small-time merchants went to get a bite 
and a karafaki (pitcher or small bottle) of ouzo, share it with friends and 
discuss soccer, politics and women . . . usually in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. The new breed of ouzeries -- like those in this story -- are 
located in the downtown Athens area and are becoming more sophisticated in 
order to attract a new clientele. More and more popular among middle and upper 
Athenian society, ouzeries have become the favored lunch meeting places of both 
men and women. Shoppers and shop owners, office clerks and CEOs spend their 
lunch breaks there, now that most businesses observe continued hours, rather 
than going home for lunch and a siesta and then resuming work in the late 
afternoon, as was the custom until the last five years or so. 
</P>
<P>
 But ouzo is not the only drink that accompanies a meze. The typical old 
Athenian taverns, also known as krasopoulia (wine shops), customarily still 
serve house retsina (resinated wine) along with mezedes . Resinated wine is not 
a modern invention. Ancient Greeks threw pieces of pine tree bark into wine, 
thinking that the resin would keep it from spoiling. The result was similar to 
what we drink today. Although some people dislike it, there are many who love 
retsina, especially in its lighter, modern version. And like ouzo, retsina goes 
well with the more zesty Greek meze dishes, especially those with smoky, 
garlicky or acidulous flavors, such as roasted eggplant spread or pickled 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still a few krasopoulia operating in Athens around the Central 
Market and in some old neighborhoods. Most are located in basements with a few 
tables set next to large barrels containing the wine. The whole setup would 
transfer the visitor right back to the '50s. These taverns have no printed menu 
and the four or five dishes they serve (differing each day) are usually humble 
and not remarkable. But if you are lucky, you may stumble upon an exquisite 
fasolada (bean soup) or revithada (chick pea soup) that will taste like good, 
hearty home-cooked food. Although not necessarily part of a meze, it is so 
common to these krasopoulia that locals often ask for it. It is particularly 
prevalent in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pleasures of going out for a meze lunch or dinner is sharing a tiny 
table with friends. Hardly anyone goes to an ouzery or krasopoulio alone. It 
wouldn't be much fun. The conversation could never be as sprightly and it would 
be impossible to taste more than two or three mezedes by yourself. Of course, 
in the more sophisticated restaurants there is always the possibility of 
ordering a pikilia, a plate of different meze samples. But somehow the ouzery 
tradition is synonymous with sharing food and drink that is ordered "for the 
table." (In most ouzeries you will also find a selection of Greek wines and 
beers, but krasopoulia only serve their own retsina.) 
</P>
<P>
 A typical meze may include simple things, such as feta cheese drizzled with 
olive oil and sprinkled with dried oregano, different kinds of olives -- green, 
cracked olives, smooth, black Kalamatas and wrinkled black olives -- pickled 
octopus and lakerda, or marinated slices of smoked mackerel. It may also 
include more complicated dishes such as spinach or wild greens pie wrapped in 
phyllo pastry, either fried or baked, stuffed vine leaves with or without meat, 
salt cod fritters served with garlic sauce, eggplant or zucchini slices dipped 
in batter and deep fried and served with garlic sauce or tzatziki, a garlicky 
yogurt with mint or dill and shredded cucumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Marides -- tiny fried fish eaten whole (head and bones, included) -- is very 
much sought after as a meze , when the catch provides, and so is fava, a thick 
paste made by boiling down yellow split peas into a dish similar to Indian 
dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 A specialty of the island of Santorini, fava is mixed with chopped scallions 
or pungent red onion, dill, oregano and capers and moistened with fruity olive 
oil and fresh lemon juice and served cold. It is eaten with fresh country bread 
or as a side dish. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic Greek spreads: Eggplant and taramosalata (made of fish eggs, 
bread, scallion, lemon olive oil), are seldom missing from a meze table. Fried 
lamb's liver, spleen or other innards are meze dishes very much appreciated by 
the Greeks. And you will often hear the locals ordering ameletita (the 
unmentionables), which are fried lamb's testicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, of the old breed of Athenian ouzeries, only Apotsos has survived. It is 
only a few blocks from Syntagma (or Constitution) Square, the central area of 
downtown Athens that contains Parliament; on the back of a dark but safe 
shopping arcade. Like many other old-fashioned ouzeries, Apotsos first opened 
in another location as a grocery store and ouzery at the beginning of the 
century. In its present guise, it is located in a large but charming, 
high-ceilinged, typically Greek room decorated with old Greek and European 
posters. Apotsos' specialties include meat and cheese dishes, rather than the 
vegetables and legumes that are popular in many other places serving mezedes. 
Fried liver, country sausage and small meatballs served with mustard on the 
plate, as well as saganaki -- fried slices of kasseri, a cheese similar to 
Italian Pecorino -- and, of course, ameletita, are the most sought-after 
mezedes here . The marble tables are filled with journalists and politicians, 
as the place is only a few blocks from Parliament. A few years back Apotsos 
used to be the place for people to go for a meze lunch but recently its clout 
seems to be fading as the fashionable crowd has, literally, moved up the hill 
to the Kolonaki ouzeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Three restaurants in Kolonaki -- a posh neighborhood within the center of 
Athens, on the slope of Mt. Lycabettus -- represent the new breed of ouzeries 
that Athenian yuppies prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 To Grafeio (The Office) is situated on Dexameni square and its decor is high 
tech with old-framed architectural engravings decorating the walls. There is a 
long window where the foods served each day are displayed. Shrimp baked in 
individual clay pots with tomato sauce and feta cheese, several different 
salads, and expensive delicacies such as smoked eel and trout, are served along 
with the traditional fried salted cod, calamari, taramosalata spread, meatballs 
and fava. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is served beginning at noon, and by 2 p.m. on weekdays the place is 
packed with smartly dressed people from the neighboring offices and shops. To 
Grafeio was until recently open late at night (from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.), serving 
soups and especially patsa -- the tripe soup traditionally eaten in Greece in 
the wee hours, as the ideal food to settle the stomach after a long night of 
cigarettes and drinks. But earlier this year the Ministry of Public Orders 
passed a law through Parliament that obliges all bars, cabarets and restaurants 
to close at 2:30 a.m. There was quite an outcry by many Greeks who like to stay 
up late and thought that their civil rights had been violated by this law, so 
it is possible that the restrictions will soon be forgotten. But at the moment, 
To Grafeio only opens for lunch and serves food until 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Yali Kafene -- a few blocks from the Byzantine Museum, is a small place with a 
lot of character. Its small marble tables are set on two levels and its walls 
are filled with bric-a-brac and Greek crafts. In the spring and summer there 
are a few tables set on the sidewalk outside. The food is freshly cooked and 
varies from one day to the next, but it always has an unmistakable home-cooked 
quality. I particularly love the chickpeas with spinach, the seafood risotto, 
the fried salted cod and also the mayeritsa -- a spring lamb soup with lots of 
lemon, dill and scallion. Hardly an ouzo meze, mayeritsa is the soup served 
traditionally on Easter night, right after the 40 days of fasting that precede 
Greek Orthodox Easter. But it can be found at Yali Kafene after Christmas, when 
spring lamb is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One block uphill from Yali Kafene, To Kafeneio is the only one of the ouzeries 
that has tables with tablecloths. The place has no character but the food is 
good. I particularly like the zucchini patties scented with mint, and the 
gardoumbakia (lamb's innards wrapped in lamb's intestines and cooked in a 
lemony sauce with olive oil and oregano). Eggplant baked with cheese, fava, 
squid with spinach and an unusual salad with all kinds of seasonal vegetables 
and shredded uncooked zucchini -- a vegetable rarely eaten raw in Greece -- are 
other dishes worth tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Salamandra is another interesting ouzery. Lodged in a transformed old 
neoclassical house -- a block from Athens University law school in an area 
filled with bookstores -- Salamandra attracts a more intellectual crowd. Tables 
are set on three levels and the food served is imaginative. You will find 
lahanodolmades (stuffed cabbage leaves with meat and rice in egg and lemon 
sauce), boiled wild greens, potato salad with black-eyed beans, shrimp with 
saffron, mussels cooked in wine, stuffed spleen in tomato sauce and grilled 
meatballs served with boukovo (a condiment that is a combination of dried hot 
and sweet red pepper flakes from Northern Greece) on the side. As a dessert you 
can have a plate of walnuts with thyme honey, or yogurt with a few tablespoons 
of honey and walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the many kinds of ouzo, all of those ouzeries also serve tap 
beer by the glass, as well as a wide selection of Greek white and red wines. 
You will also find wines by the glass. For those who would like to try a 
versatile fruity chilled wine with their food, I recommend Mantinia, from the 
region of the same name in the Peloponnese. 
</P>
<P>
 For more adventurous tourists who want to get a glimpse of how old Athenian 
taverns used to be, I suggest a visit to Diporto, after a tour of Athens' 
Central Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Diporto has two doors, as its name implies: One on Sokratous and one on 
Theatrou street. It is in a small basement situated under the most spectacular 
olive shop in the Central Market area and is a typical krasopoulio.  
</P>
<P>
 The tables -- laid next to the huge barrels -- are few but large and you are 
likely to be seated with other guests. The waiter will recite the day's menu 
but if you don't speak Greek you can go to the kitchen and point out the foods 
you want. Fried or grilled small, inexpensive fish -- the catch of the day from 
the Central Market fish purveyor across the square -- fried innards, bean or 
chickpea soup or vegetable stew are usually available. The only drink served 
here is the house retsina but it is very good. Most of the customers are people 
who either own or work in shops of the market, and later in the afternoon, 
after they have consumed a considerable amount of retsina, you may find them in 
a singing mood.

 Where to eat: The popular ouzeries are usually packed for lunch by about 2 
p.m. and from 10 p.m. for dinner. So if you stick to the American schedule of

 Colin Glover could pass for the general manager of an elegant London hotel 
such as Claridge's. He moves with grace, decisiveness and authority. He is a 
promoter of quality service and an ambassador of fine taste. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of a suit, Glover prefers to wear an old sweater with holes when 
he putters around his floating "hotel," two barges called the Barkis & 
Peggotty, named for characters in the novel "David Copperfield." 
</P>
<P>
 A Royal Navy man for 17 years, Glover jumped ship 10 years ago to run his own 
tour boat business with his first mate and wife of 30 years, Stephanie. Their 
twin barges ply the upper reaches of the Great Ouse River in England's East 
Anglia district near Cambridge, not far from a fascinating landscape of broad, 
flat marshlands known as the Fens. 
</P>
<P>
 The region -- which, outside of Cambridge, is little visited by most Americans 
-- is made up of well-preserved medieval villages and towns that seem to have 
been left untouched by the Industrial Revolution and World War II. The area is 
also rich in English history: Once the ancient Saxon Kingdom of Anglia, this is 
where Oliver Cromwell was raised and came to power, and where one of the 
world's great universities was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Just an hour or so by car from London, the region nevertheless seems a world 
apart from more touristy spots west of England -- one reason why Colin and 
Stephanie Glover feel at peace here. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about the Glovers' barge trips while planning last September's 
vacation with my fiancee, Brooks. Since we were going to visit Cambridge to see 
friends, a short barge trip in the nearby waterways sounded like an offbeat 
excursion to add to our driving side trips through the surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glovers know how to treat guests with first-class hospitality. Stephanie 
hails from a family of professional chefs and prepares all the gourmet meals 
(and sometimes drives one of the barges). Colin is the more gregarious one: 
part Viking, part Falstaff, part Peter Ustinov. In the evening, the salon of 
the Barkis is Colin's stage during cocktail hour when he holds forth with 
humorous comments about the British monarchy, politics, history and just about 
anything else. His provocative banter heats up the room faster than the 
coal-burning, pot-belly stove. Their son Simon, 28, also helps with some of the 
boating chores, but doesn't live on the barge as his parents do. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in spring, the Glover's barges run up and down a 60-mile strip of 
the Great Ouse River between Great Barford and Holywell, taking visitors on 
three-day or weeklong floats past medieval villages with English-sounding 
names: St. Ives, St. Neots, Eaton Socon, Hemingford Grey, each town with its 
own market day. The counties we visited, Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire, 
are a painting come to life: half-timbered houses, graceful swans on the river, 
villagers pedaling bicycles and majestic Norman cathedrals. These country 
landscapes were a favorite of the painter John Constable, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Glovers' barges, of a type which Colin described in river lexicon 
as "broad-beam narrow boats," measures 13 feet wide, 75 feet long and 6 feet, 7 
inches high. The Peggotty functions as the sleeping boat, with five, two-person 
cabins that are tiny but designed well enough so that we didn't feel cramped. 
Each is carpeted, and has a chest of drawers, closet, outside window, private 
shower and toilet. Brooks and I had planned our vacation as a "growing closer" 
holiday, but we didn't mean to get quite this close: We could hear virtually 
every sound in the next cabin.  
</P>
<P>
 The other barge, the Barkis, functions the way the public rooms in a hotel do: 
It's equipped with the salon, a dining room, guest toilet, galley and captain's 
family quarters. It's comfy and airy, and Ben, the Glover's springer spaniel, 
usually lies quietly by Colin's easy chair.  
</P>
<P>
 Joining us for our three-day trip late last September were Ann and Jim Kuhn, 
and Betty and Irene Jost, coincidentally all from from Illinois. The bad news 
was that, unfortunately for us, our cruise was badly timed during the coldest 
days ever recorded for this season. The good news was that we found a hot water 
bottle in our beds each night.  
</P>
<P>
 The two boats travel independently on the river, side by side or following, 
and at night are lashed together and connected at the gunnels by a plank for 
guests to walk across. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The upper reaches of the Great Ouse River, which empties into the North Sea on 
England's mid-eastern coast, is narrow and placid, more like a canal than a 
river. And like a canal, it's dotted with occasional hand-operated locks, which 
take about 30 minutes each to pass through. The barge meanders through lush 
meadows with sheep and cows, and passes fishermen sitting along the banks under 
huge umbrellas and amid elaborate angling paraphernalia, waiting to catch 
something. They sit for hours, seeming to care less what they reel in; it's the 
tranquillity of the river that draws them here.  
</P>
<P>
 Time seems to stand still on the river. Floating at about 3 m.p.h., what takes 
50 minutes by barge between two points might be a five-minute drive by auto. 
But at the same time, the days somehow go quickly. Time was also something of a 
paradox in Holywell the day we visited the Old Ferry Boat Inn, one of England's 
oldest pubs. A white-washed stone building with a thatched roof, the river bank 
pub is said to date from to AD 560. It was bustling with descendants of ancient 
Saxons, who were downing pints of English ale while watching the "telly."  
</P>
<P>
 Just next door to the inn is the home of George Peacock, one of England's few 
remaining practitioner's of the almost-lost craft of roof thatching. His logo 
-- a peacock made of wire and reed -- marks the tops of thatched roof buildings 
in the area although, interestingly, Peacock's own house has a slate roof. He 
recently handed down the business to his son. At one time, perhaps 200 years 
ago, England boasted approximately 13,000 thatchers, Colin Glover told our 
group; today there are only about 500. One reason is economics: a thatch roof 
on a house today can cost as much as $60,000.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the highlights of the Ouse cruise is a day-long "shore excursion" into 
the famed university town of Cambridge, led by a so-called "blue badge" (or 
docent-quality) guide. Cambridge is actually on the River Cam (a tributary of 
the Great Ouse), but only a few miles down highway A604 from where we moored at 
St. Ives.  
</P>
<P>
 Originally a Roman settlement, Cambridge is one of England's two great 
learning centers (the other being Oxford) and also one of its loveliest cities. 
Cambridge University started in 1284, with Peterhouse as the first of 31 
colleges that now include Trinity, Queen's, King's, St. John's and others.  
</P>
<P>
 The architecture -- vaulted arches and vine-covered buildings -- and the 
students in their school colors reminded me of a scene from "Goodbye, Mr. 
Chips." Especially impressive is the King's College Chapel, built by King Henry 
VI, with its spectacular architecture, stained-glass windows and the Reubens' 
painting "Adoration of the Magi." The best view of it is from the walking paths 
behind it, called the "Backs," an area of lawns, formal gardens and open spaces 
on the banks of the River Cam (where visitors can rent flat-bottom boats called 
"punts"). At Trinity College, Isaac Newton wrote his "Principia Mathematica;" 
other students included Charles Darwin, and the poets Wordsworth, Tennyson, 
Byron and Milton. 
</P>
<P>
 (Other side trips offered by the Glovers for guests on weeklong cruises are 
tours of two area mansions. One is Woburn Abbey, home of the Duke of Bedford, 
and William Cecil's Elizabethan-era Burghley House, completed in 1587 and set 
on 10,000 acres with 35 major rooms and 400 paintings.) 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cambridge tour, the Glover's served afternoon tea back on the 
Barkis, moored at St. Ives. St. Ives is a 15th-Century Roman town noted for its 
bridge with a chapel built into it. Just 10 years ago, the town had 3,000 
people; now it's a London bedroom community of 20,000. The hour train commute 
to London, one local told me, is a small price to pay for the joys of living on 
the river and waking up to fresh air and chirping birds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 St. Ives is also notable for its statue of Oliver Cromwell, reportedly one of 
only two in the country (the other is in London, in front of the House of 
Parliament). We are, in fact, in "Cromwell Country." After dinner, Colin lead 
us to his favorite hang-out, a noisy, smoky pub in St. Ives called -- what 
else? -- the Oliver Cromwell.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Huntingdon is the birthplace of the famed English statesman, who led 
Parliamentary forces against the British monarchy during the English civil war 
and became lord protector of the Commonwealth from 1653 to 1658. Besides St. 
Ives, where Cromwell lived briefly, he spent most of his time farther west in 
Ely. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we visited Ely by car from Cambridge, the Glovers also offer shore 
excursions to this charming market town, the site of what some say is the 
finest Norman cathedral in all of England. It was in Ely that Cromwell was 
imbued with his strict Calvinist beliefs and became known as "Lord of the Fens" 
for defending the local swamplands and bogs from attempts by the British 
monarchy to drain them. 
</P>
<P>
 For many centuries before this period, people lived off the nearly 300,000 
acres of fenlands in eastern England, where they harvested peat for fuel, reeds 
for making thatched roofs, fished for marsh eels (the name Ely means "eel 
isle") and hunted game. But to outsiders the Fens were useless tracts, and 
eventually engineers prevailed. The English brought in the Dutch to erect 
hundreds of windmills to pump out the water and turn the area into farmland. 
Some of the windmills still stand, and today the rich soil of the flat expanses 
of East Anglia produce the majority of the country's vegetable crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The only stretch of the Fens to retain its undrained, medieval character is a 
parcel of 605 acres that has been preserved by the National Trust as a nature 
preserve at Wicken Fen. It is England's oldest nature reserve, giving visitors 
a view of a unique topography, with a variety of wildlife and flora.  
</P>
<P>
 Every village in this region is allocated a small plot of communal land to 
garden, and it was in one of those towns that I met two local gardeners 
enjoying their hobby. Horace Taylor, 76, and George Ansell, 65, are plot 
neighbors in Stretham, just outside Ely, who garden every day, religiously. 
It's good therapy they said, and explained that the temperate climate of East 
Anglia produces something of a garden friendly "mizzle" -- somewhere between a 
drizzle and mist. During the growing season, Ansell said, he eats two tomatoes 
from his garden every day. "Nothing tastes as good as a home-grown tomato," he 
said, echoing the pride of gardeners everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brooks and me, the barge trip aboard the Barkis & Peggotty tagged on to 
our driving excursions from Cambridge turned out to be a varied way to see a 
part of England most North Americans never discover. We ate good food, were 
entertained by Colin Glover's British wit, and got an education in history and 
local lore that cannot be duplicated from the inside of a tour bus.

<P>
 Booking a barge: Most travel agents can book journeys on the Glovers' twin 
narrow boats, the Barkis & Peggotty (we used a Seattle company, Fenwick & Lang; 
800-243-6244 or 206-382-1262). Cruises operate from April-October; low season 
rates (April and October) are about $1,800 per week per person, double 
occupancy; in the high season, May-September, the cost rises to about $2,000. 
Half-week cruises are available at about half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices include all meals (sample entrees: Pheasant with Wild Mushrooms, 
Supreme of Duck in Cranberries, Debden Chocolate Pudding) and liquor served on 
board, and transfers to and from London to the barge mooring in Brampton, near 
Huntingdon station. The Glovers can pick up guests at the train station, just 
two minutes from their boats.  
</P>
<P>
 There are also self-driven narrow boats available for hire in the area for 
those who want to pilot their own barge and cook their own meals. Contact 
Blake's Vacations at (800) 628-8118 (this agent can also book the Barkis & 
Peggotty).

HIKING: LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST; SPRING BLOOMS ANEW ON FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service has wasted no time in responding to last September's 
Murre Fire on Figueroa Mountain in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Though thousands of acres of forested slopes and backcountry were scorched by 
the blaze, the Forest Service has been clearing and repairing existing trails 
and building new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest addition is the Pino Alto Trail, a paved path that's great for 
walkers of all abilities. The interpretive path through a pine-and-spruce 
forest is even accessible to those in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes after a fire, there's a spring explosion of wildflowers. Wildflower 
lovers were hoping 1994 would bring spectacular, "Sound of Music"-like 
displays. Alas, I must report it's a so-so wildflower year on Figueroa 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 For hikers who want to do more than stop and smell the flowers (or pines), I 
recommend two longer hikes on Figueroa Mountain: the Davy Brown Trail, which 
climbs the mountain, and the La Jolla Trail, which descends. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail heads: Getting to Figueroa Mountain can be half the fun. 
It's a lovely drive through the Santa Ynez Valley into Los Padres National 
Forest. From U.S. 101, about six miles north of Solvang, exit on California 154 
and head five miles to Figueroa Mountain Road in the town of Los Olivos. Turn 
left and wind 13 miles to the signed turnoff for Pino Alto Picnic Area. Ascend 
1 1/2 miles on a dirt road (suitable for passenger cars) to the just-renovated 
picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 For an even more scenic route, leave U.S. 101 in Santa Barbara by taking the 
California 154 exit and traveling 30 miles to Figueroa Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davy Brown Trail starts at Davy Brown Campground. To reach it from the 
turnoff to the Pino Alto Picnic Area, continue east on Figueroa Mountain Road 
to Sunset Valley Road. Turn left and drive five miles to the campground. The La 
Jolla Trail starts about a mile west (downhill) from the Pino Alto turnoff on 
Figueroa Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikes: The Davy Brown Trail (7 1/2 miles round-trip with a 2,400-foot 
elevation gain) ascends cool, moist Fir Canyon, climbs to the headwaters of 
Davy Brown Creek, then continues to the very top of the mountain with its 
spectacular views. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pleasant springtime jaunt is the four-mile round-trip La Jolla Trail, 
which descends northwest through a mountain meadow seasonally bedecked with 
lupine. The path drops through a pine-oak woodland, then down a slope dotted 
with (nature willing) clarkia, California poppies, Plummer's Mariposa lilies 
and Chinese houses to creekside Ballard Trail Camp, shaded by towering oaks and 
sycamores.  
</P>
<P>
 Pino Alto Trail WHERE: Los Padres National Forest, Figueroa Recreation Area. 
DISTANCE: 1/2 mile round-trip. TERRAIN: Forested slopes, meadows. HIGHLIGHTS: 
One of most botanically intriguing areas in Southern California. Good 
wildflower displays. Grand views of Santa Ynez Valley, from atop Figueroa 
Mountain. DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy. FOR MORE INFORMATION: Los Padres National 
Forest, 6144 Calle Real, Goleta, Calif. 93117; tel, (805) 683-6711. Or Santa 
Lucia Ranger District; tel. (805) 925-9538.

 I thought that gorgeous half-page color beach photo was of Pismo Beach 
("Secret Beaches," April 10) until I read Ken Baron's excellent story on Fraser 
Island, Australia. Although the beaches are similar, the Pismo clam mating, I'm 
sure, would never compare to the "spectacular mating ritual of the island's 
countless turtles."

<P>
 Ken Baron repeats a story about the word kangaroo coming from an aboriginal 
phrase for "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The word originally comes from a word in Guugu Yimidhirr, which is the 
language of the people who first met Capt. Cook, and refers to a "large black 
kangaroo," (according to the book) "More of the Straight Dope," and Smithsonian 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The article on Fraser Island was an excellent description of the island and 
how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I spent three nights at Happy Valley (resort) in November, 1992. 
Happy Valley offers day tours of the island, which we took. The trips through 
the rain forests and to the clear freshwater lakes were wonderful. Since there 
are no maps and four-wheel-drive vehicles were renting for $100 a day, only a 
brave fool would attempt to drive anywhere but on the beach. Most inland roads 
are one lane in deeply rutted soft sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodations were in clean and large cabins with private baths and full 
cooking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recommendation: Instead of flying to Hervey Bay and taking surface transport 
to the resorts, pick up a rental car at the Brisbane Airport, drive to Hervey 
Bay Airport and let Harry (of Harry's Air Charter) fly you to your resort. 
Round-trip air from Brisbane was more than twice what we paid for four days of 
car rental.

SUIT FILED BY WOMAN WOUNDED IN ALLEGED HILBUN CRIME SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Elizabeth Shea, who police say was shot and wounded at an automated teller 
machine by Mark Richard Hilbun as he went on a deadly two-day crime spree, has 
filed a lawsuit against Hilbun and Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that the 
bank failed to provide adequate security.Wells Fargo officials said they had no 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea, 29, was one of five people allegedly shot by Hilbun in May, 1993. Shea's 
companion, Jim Brown, 44, also was wounded in the midnight shooting, which 
occurred at a Wells Fargo branch on Slater Avenue in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun is also charged with stabbing his 63-year-old mother to death in her 
Corona del Mar home and of fatally shooting a letter carrier at the Dana Point 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Hilbun, 40, was fired from the Dana Point post office for 
stalking Kim Springer, another postal employee, with whom authorities say 
Hilbun was infatuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say manic depression has been diagnosed in Hilbun, who is in 
custody awaiting trial on various charges including murder and attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea's lawsuit seeks $1 million from each defendant, including unnamed ones.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CALTRANS; CALTRANS ENGINEERS TO CONTRACTORS 
-- OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY; COURT RULING THAT STATE CAN'T USE PRIVATE-SECTOR 
EMPLOYEES FOR WORK SUCH AS FREEWAY ENGINEERING AND DESIGN IS A DEAD END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIAN BERGESON, State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), a member of 
the Senate Transportation Committee, represents the 35th District.

<P>
 Several weeks ago the courts put up another roadblock to California's economic 
recovery. Right now the setback might seem painless for the average 
Californian. But if you're the employee of a small Orange County engineering 
company that just saw millions in state contracts blocked by a minor-league 
judge, it means cutbacks, layoffs and potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're a commuter concerned about the rapid completion of the state's 
ambitious seismic retrofitting program (I think that covers just about all of 
us), the worrisome time spent in a traffic jam under connectors such as the 
605/405 freeway separation in Seal Beach just got longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The roadblock came from Sacramento Superior Court Judge Eugene T. Gualco, who 
declared that the recently passed state law that allows the state Department of 
Transportation to contract out its design work with private sector engineering 
firms was unconstitutional. This was his third ruling against contracting out 
-- this time Gualco responded favorably to a suit brought by the Professional 
Engineers in California Government (PECG), a Caltrans engineers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Gualco said that Article VII of the state Constitution prohibits the state 
from using private-sector employees for state projects such as freeway 
engineering and design. Many legal experts claim that Gualco's interpretation 
of Article VII is a stretch at best -- the article itself sets up the state's 
civil-service system, protects us against officeholders who've threatened to 
overthrow state government, and establishes the Judges' Retirement System. 
Unless I've missed it, the article contains no mention of whom the state can 
employ to design its freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of contracting out will vigorously appeal the decision. But appeals 
take time. And this particular suit, offensive in both its goal to thwart the 
will of the Legislature and the recovering California economy, means immediate 
delays on more than $60 million in seismic retrofitting projects that were to 
go out to bid this summer to private industry. Retrofitting we had hoped to see 
on the Garden Grove, San Diego and the Santa Ana freeways well before the next 
quake. Like the kind that might have kept the Santa Monica Freeway up on its 
support beams last January. Like the kind that would have created hundreds of 
engineering jobs in an employment sector that can be more competitive than 
Caltrans. But this will not occur; PECG would rather jeopardize important 
projects and screen out its competition than face them on a level playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperbole and personal irritation aside, the judge's efforts to block 
contracting out will seriously affect small Orange County engineering 
businesses, many of which are minority- and women-owned firms. Still more are 
the new employers of many highly qualified Californians displaced by aerospace 
and defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Coast Surveying is just one of 600 companies throughout the state 
that could see its 30-employee payroll change. Coast has been an active 
Caltrans contractor, taking on projects that Caltrans itself was unable to 
complete during demand peaks. To such companies as P&D Technologies of Orange 
and the Irvine Spectrum's Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates, a single 
Caltrans retrofitting contract valued at $1 million would employ at least 10 
new primary positions (and even more support staff). Newport Beach's Boyle 
Engineering may find as many as 21 of its top seismic engineers affected by the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 With larger primary contracts in the $4-million range, Bein suggests that 30% 
to 40% are subcontracted to minority- and women-owned firms such as Coast. 
Forced to bid against each other for the Caltrans contracts, firms such as 
these have been able to stay lean and efficient -- they know how to make the 
most of a taxpayer dollar. For example, thanks to its competitive bids, more 
than three-quarters of Coast's work last year was transportation-related, with 
most of that coming from Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its private sector competition, Caltrans didn't learn much from the 
downsizing and streamlining of the early '90s. Documentation of Caltrans' 
efficiency problems is as recent as three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, SRI International, a renowned Bay Area auditing firm, released 
what some analysts called a "scathing" management audit of Caltrans. SRI put 
forth 14 key recommendations for change, including the enhanced use of private 
sector engineers in Caltrans' design operations. The audit further warned that 
Caltrans was beset with efficiency problems and called for the creation of a 
system of discipline and rewards to improve employee productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw the benefits of contracting out and monetary awards to improve 
efficiency when the Santa Monica Freeway opened weeks ahead of schedule. Using 
its emergency powers, the state used contracting out and speed bonuses to get 
the world's busiest freeway open early. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Judge Gualco dare state that such an action was "improper" or 
"unconstitutional"? No, curiously, he exempted from his decision repair 
projects resulting from the Northridge quake and already underway. So 
contracting out is good enough for us when we really need to get the job done 
-- not the rest of the time when we're just plugging along behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 And plug along we'll continue, waiting for the next quake to break our pace. 
So what if the commuters, Orange County's engineering firms and the taxpayers 
all deserve better.

 An article about Isabella Rossellini last Sunday incorrectly identified her 
twin sister. Ingrid Rossellini, a professor of medieval literature at Princeton 
University, is the actress's twin. Pia Lindstrom, an entertainment critic based 
in New York, is their older half sister.
