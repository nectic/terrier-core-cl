MOVIE REVIEW; A STUDY IN BLACK AND WHITE; 'FREEDOM ON MY MIND' DOCUMENTS CIVIL 
RIGHTS DRIVE IN MISSISSIPPI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 30 years have passed since the epochal Mississippi Voter Registration 
Project of 1961-64, but that's been time enough for the events to almost 
disappear from America's consciousness, for the civil rights movement's 
successes in dislodging blatant segregation to be forced into near oblivion by 
the extent of the problems between the races that still remain. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is an especial tonic to see "Freedom on My Mind," winner of the Sundance 
Film Festival's Grand Jury prize, a spirited evocation of a struggle whose 
enormity we have largely forgotten. Co-directed by Connie Field and Marilyn 
Mulford, this lively documentary underscores how dramatic that battle was, how 
much was accomplished, and how terrifyingly difficult it was to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike public television's "Eyes on the Prize," this is not a general survey 
of the period but a passionate and personal oral history. It intercuts strong 
contemporary footage and the pointed singing of spirituals like "Ain't Gonna 
Let Nobody Turn Me Round" with the still-vivid memories of the people the 
movement transformed, people who unhesitatingly put their lives at risk because 
of the power of what they believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom" is structured around the recollections of 10 civil rights veterans, 
but especially evocative are the memories of Mississippi natives like Curtis 
Hayes of McComb, so infuriated at racism as a child he used to "hit trees, 
pretend they were white folks." Or sharecropper's daughter L.C. Dorsey, now a 
Ph.D. in public health, who remembers that her illiterate father had such faith 
in education he would daily walk her to the school bus stop, shotgun in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stirring of all, however, are the memories of Endesha Ida Mae Holland of 
Greenwood, raped by her white employer on her 11th birthday and afterward a 
teen-age prostitute. When the civil rights organizers came to town, Holland was 
first excited at the possibility of "turning tricks with them." But the 
movement instead became "the beginning of me finding myself," unlocking the 
possibility of a new kind of life, though it was a life that was to come at a 
considerable personal cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mississippi in 1961 was, in one observer's words, a place where "blacks 
were free in name only," where men could be lynched for "eye rape" and 
segregationists outdid each other in boasting of their devotion to racial 
separation. The state, says Bob Moses, was "a little South African enclave 
within the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken, thoughtful and deeply charismatic, Bob Moses was one of the 
leaders of the voter registration project, and the experience, especially the 
loss of life involved, was such a wrenching one for him that he rarely 
discusses it in public. Moses' wise and careful comments here, putting the past 
in perspective, are one of "Freedom's" strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the movement to register a half-million disenfranchised black 
voters was that it was the best way to pull a reluctant federal government into 
the fight for equality. The struggle almost immediately became a brutal one, as 
segregationists fought back with deadly force and the black community responded 
with remarkable acts of ordinary heroism that commanded national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 To further focus the country's attention, the movement's leadership decided on 
the controversial strategy of calling on white college students from out of 
state to help with the work. The idea, as one veteran puts it, was that "if you 
want to bring law to the South, you have to bring the people the law covers," 
and that meant Northern whites. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, "Freedom" does not try to hide the difficulties that strategy 
caused as people who had never mingled before began to try. And the film's 
strongest section is a careful look at the rarely examined and traumatic 
conclusion to the voting rights project, the attempt by the newly formed 
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to unseat that state's segregationist 
Dixiecrat delegation at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing, naively as it turned out, that they had the moral force to "take on 
the system at the highest level," the MFDP ran up against the machinations of 
Lyndon Johnson. Apparently fearing that seating the rebels would jeopardize his 
election chances with the rest of the South, Johnson effectively stymied their 
movement and in the process, insists Bob Moses, did damage that is still being 
played out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic Party lost a group of young black people, disillusioned a 
generation of young white people, and missed the chance to capture the 
attention and the energy of the generation that set the tone for the '60s," 
Moses poignantly points out. The result was "a polarization we're not out of 
yet. It's one of the great tragedies of this country." It is a sobering and 
provocative conclusion to a stirring piece of documentary work.

 'Higgins' Beeched Again: Wednesday's news that Michelle Pfeiffer will team 
with Robert Redford for 20th Century Fox's "Up Close and Personal" means that 
she will not do another big-budget Fox project -- the previously announced 
"Higgins and Beech," in which she was to co-star with Richard Gere. Sources 
said that Pfeiffer pulled out of the on-again, off-again "H&B" because she was 
unhappy with the way the project was shaping up. A Fox spokesman would not 
comment on whether Gere will still make the film, which was to begin filming in 
March, but he did say the whole project may be on hold. LEGAL FILE

Earlier this month, Anderson filed a motion charging that Reynolds had missed 
an alimony payment. She also said he did not return $37,000 worth of her 
possessions, including a 1987 Cadillac. A hearing on Anderson's motion is set 
for Oct. 6 in Florida. A hearing in California next month will make final 
determinations of custody and child support payments for the couple's

Pels suing Voight for embezzlement, followed by Voight suing Pels for breach of 
contract, and Pels suing Voight for libel. The two had been partners in a movie

A NEWLY SEDUCTIVE 'GIOVANNI'; MUSIC CENTER OPERA REVIVES ITS 1991 PRODUCTION OF 
THE MOZART WORK, ACCENTUATING CONTRASTS AND ENHANCING ITS DARK SERIOUSNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In reviving the 1991 production of Mozart's "Don Giovanni," the Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera managed to make the work even darker and more comic than the 
earlier version. It thus heightened the contrast even more strongly between 
those seemingly disparate attributes of "dramma giocoso" (jocular drama) 
librettist Lorenzo da Ponte used to describe the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Thomas Allen, who 
also sang Don Giovanni in 1991, showed some vocal wear, which added aspects of 
world-weariness as well as mature gamesmanship to the role. At the same time, 
Allen maintained the earlier dangerous and complex social stance of his 
character, always singing with intelligence and point. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other principals were newcomers to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The admirable Metropolitan Opera basso Paul Plishka, making his first 
appearance with L.A. Opera, sang and acted Leporello with vivid, detailed 
nuance. Less an alter ego for the Don than a kinsman to Papageno, this 
Leporello seemed thoroughly human and injected lively credibility into 
everything he did. He did much to introduce buffo elements without resorting to 
any caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first role with Music Center Opera, Joanna Kozlowska brought luscious, 
creamy vocalism to Donna Elvira, seemingly effortlessly ascending the heights 
and achieving them without any biting attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Her characterization evoked both sympathy and in the increasingly more 
self-righteous moments exactly the sense of comic exasperation Giovanni 
directed toward her. This Elvira may say she is retiring from life in the final 
scene, but the way she brings Giovanni's wine cup to her lips indicates that 
wherever she goes, his memory will always be with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Making both her U.S. and local company debut, the Odessa-born Elena Prokina 
sang Donna Anna, replacing Anna Tomowa-Sintow, who had withdrawn from the 
production in August because of illness (canceling several months of 
appearances, according to a company spokesman). 
</P>
<P>
 Prokina has a coltish attractiveness and a bright, agile, if edgy and 
sometimes glassy soprano. Again, this Anna nearly swooned in Giovanni's arms 
moments after he apparently had raped her. But this Anna also appeared oddly 
remote and self-preoccupied in the sentiments and well-executed coloratura 
passages of "Non mi dir," as if she didn't mind very much keeping Don Ottavio 
at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Thomas Randle, making his debut with Music Center Opera as Don 
Ottavio, acted with out-sized, impetuous and frustrated ardor. Alas, vocally he 
too often emphasized dramatic urgency over finesse. In neither of the famous 
tenor arias did he set any standards for vocal beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Company regular John Atkins repeated his robust, sympathetic characterization 
of Masetto. A poised, almost aristocratic Paula Rasmussun sang Zerlina for the 
first time, offering cautious and mono-faceted vocalism. Both Rasmussen and 
Randle offered discreet embellishments in their arias. Louis Lebherz again sang 
the Commendatore strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Lawrence Foster, another veteran of 1991, presided knowingly over a 
sympathetic and expanded Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Again, the recitatives 
became unusually fraught with plot significance, an occasional pause only 
heightening the dramatic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 The original production was based on a conception for the Maggio Musicale in 
Florence by Jonathan Miller. Staging duties here again fell to Karen Stone, who 
had worked with Miller on the original. Robert Israel's movable, 
expressionistic sets and, presumably, Karl Friedrich Oberle's 18th-Century 
costumes (Oberle was not credited in the program booklet) again contributed to 
the dark seriousness of the production. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening night cast will be heard on all subsequent dates except Oct. 11 
and 14, when Rodney Gilfry is scheduled to sing the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Music Center Opera will present Mozart's "Don Giovanni" on 
Friday , and on Oct. 2, 5, 11 and 14 at 7:30 p.m., and on Oct. 8 at 1 p.m. at

ART REVIEWS; THADDEUS STRODE: A POST-CONCEPTUALIST WITH SUBSTANCE; HIS WORK 
NOTES THE FRAGMENTARY NATURE OF EXPERIENCE AND ART AND DEALS LESS IN OBJECTS 
THAN PROVOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Certain themes -- the impossibility of knowledge, the inevitability of loss, 
the futile search for meaning -- allow certain artists to get away with murder. 
For those of a Post-Conceptual bent, for whom implication outranks plain 
speaking, coolness can become a commentary on ennui, vagueness a manifesto 
about indeterminacy and the absence of perceptible subject matter a wry 
statement about the emptiness of both art and life. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1301 Gallery, Thaddeus Strode talks the talk and walks the walk, but he 
isn't interested in getting away with anything. His work is unexpected -- 
laconic but generous, sincere but unsentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 Less interested in making objects than in provoking situations, Strode offers 
little to look at. The main room is dark, the windows covered in black 
foam-core. In one corner is a stack of white T-shirts embossed with a typically 
oblique passage from "Alice in Wonderland." In front of the fireplace is an 
amplifier blaring illegible sounds. By the ceiling are two colored lights, 
spilling reflections of red and blue onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere is a large photograph of an overflowing coffee cup, as well as a 
double image of the late Kurt Cobain. Upstairs, according to the checklist, is 
a dry-ice machine, which Strode has entitled "Swamp Bog." 
</P>
<P>
 The machine, however, is missing, having appeared only at the opening of the 
show. Its absence -- like that of Anna in Antonioni's "L'Avventura" -- is 
crucial, throwing into relief all the things and relationships which surround 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the overflowing coffee mug, imprinted with the phrase, "Some Guys 
Have It All," becomes an ironic rejoinder about desire, fulfilled and 
otherwise. Meanwhile, the amplifier's tiny red and green lights become an 
allusion to any number of binary pairs: on and off, stop and go, here and 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the two colored bulbs that provide the room's only illumination, they 
announce a theme of doubling, which always has to do with the splitting of the 
self; and simultaneously, a theme of pairing, which has to do with the need to 
overcome that very trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this sounds like a demonstration of the key tenets of contemporary 
theory and/or psychoanalysis, Strode is careful to frustrate such promises of 
narrative coherence. Like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, from whom his work borrows a 
great deal, Strode accepts with bemused grace the fragmentary nature of both 
experience and art. 
</P>
<P>
 In moments of recognition, rather than in recognizable objects, he makes this 
palpable, though not necessarily visible. 
</P>

 Birk's Best: Coming on the heels of his flamboyant, equal-opportunity history 
paintings, in which gang-bangers appropriate the poses of art history's most 
revered heroes, Sandow Birk's drawings at Koplin Gallery are positively 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these painstakingly rendered images depicts an isolated figure 
leaping, crouching, spinning or flying through space. The ubiquitous costume -- 
low-riding jeans, baggy T-shirt and tennis shoes -- gives it away. These are 
skateboarders, caught as they execute backside nose grinds, fakie ollies, alley 
oop kick flips and other maneuvers as ritualized as their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Birk titles this series "Men in the Cities," making reference to Robert 
Longo's eponymous group of larger-than-life figure drawings. Like Birk's 
skaters, Longo's writhing men and women (garbed in regulation Soho black) are 
pictured in the absence of any narrative context: They look as though they are 
dancing -- or dying. Though Longo referred to them grandiloquently as "fallen 
angels," they quickly became icons of the relentlessly hip ennui of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Birk means to deflate Longo's pretensions, but he is too late, and he's as 
much a romanticist as Longo, shamelessly idealizing his youthful athletes, who 
are pictured as paragons of grace and street chic. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, because this is Birk's best work -- as "Men in the Cities" is 
Longo's. It is indeed romantic, but canny enough to reject baroque theatrics 
for something a bit more understated.

 Just Glancing Blows: In recent paintings at Herbert Palmer Gallery, master 
satirist Peter Saul -- whose work of the 1950s and 1960s was featured in the 
Museum of Contemporary Art's "Hand-Painted Pop" exhibition -- turns his brush 
on art history's sacred cows. Animal metaphors are particularly appropriate for 
Saul, as he has long been fond of beasts, whose absurdity, venality and/or 
dumbness make them perfect surrogates for human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 With his plaid beret, droopy eyes, and multicolored coat, "Rembrandt Dog" -- 
much like his cinematic compatriot, Beethoven -- naughtily domesticates 
artistic greatness. The befuddled duck-artists of "Pop Art II" wield dripping 
brushes and splash thick paint all over a pointillist map of the United States 
-- a triple-headed blow aimed at Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein and Kenny 
Scharf, whose comic-book psychedelia owe a strong debt to the older artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Saul's blows are merely glancing, more affectionate than anything else. A 
Day-Glo version of Picasso's "Girl Before a Mirror" is visually arresting, but 
it falls flat, as it's difficult to render any of Picasso's hyperbolic images 
more so. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tepid art-about-art is especially disappointing in relation to Saul's 
earlier paintings and drawings, several of which are also on view here. These 
are emphatically raw -- abbreviated, cartoon-like shapes; deliberately 
unresolved surfaces, and a total eschewal of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 In formal terms they are flat, especially compared to the sculptural idiom 
Saul adopted in the 1980s. In terms of satire, they are anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude, nasty and highly political, they depict sex deviates being executed by 
fantastic killing machines, complacent businessmen shooting themselves in the 
head and Chinese Communist soldiers as indestructible tag-team wrestlers. They 
have something to say about something, rather than nothing new to say about 
art.

 Wit Via Pencil: At domestic setting, Wendy Furman is showing wonderfully stark 
pencil drawings of pairs of Greek vases: an amphora coupled with a kylix, a 
krater with an oinochoe, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rendered in silhouette -- pure black against unmodulated white -- the images 
possess a somber authority. They are incontrovertible. Push-pinned to the wall 
so that they form a grid, the 30 drawings of 60 vases conjure all manner of 
lexicons, axonomies and tables of elements. However, there is no system in 
play, merely the notion of a system and the seductive promise of total 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Seduction is a tricky concept here since the vessel, with its undulating 
contours and hollow spaces, has long served as a metaphor for the female body, 
thereupon deriving its beauty. Furman begs the comparison by drawing the vases 
as silhouettes, so as to emphasize their contours. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she coyly frustrates any notion of ideal proportions, feminine or 
otherwise. Seen in the context she fabricates, the forms are less beautiful 
than idiosyncratic: truncated, splayed, elongated, foreshortened. 
</P>
<P>
 As pairs, they more closely resemble Lucy and Ethel than Athena and Aphrodite. 
Furman's gift is two-fold: a low key wit, and a wicked way with a black pencil.

BRIT-TV TRIBUTE OPENS AT GUILD

<P>
 Among the many intriguing offerings at the American Cinematheque's "A Tribute 
to Britain's Channel 4 Television" this weekend at the Directors Guild, 7920 
Sunset Blvd., is Beeban Kidron's riveting "Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps and Their 
Johns" (Saturday at 7:30 p.m.), a breathtakingly candid and comprehensive 
survey of prostitution in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
 Kidron talks to everyone from the desperate drug-addicted streetwalkers of 
South Bronx to a male hustler, a plump dominatrix and a pair of beefy, affable 
guys about to open their own brothel. 
</P>
<P>
 Often hilarious, sometimes scary and occasionally heartbreaking, Kidron's 
documentary is refreshingly non-judgmental. 
</P>
<P>
 Other especially promising new films in the tribute are Ken Loach's "Ladybird, 
Ladybird" (Friday at 7:30 p.m.), a story of a woman's love and faith starring

CLUB REVIEW; POWER HOUSE HAS PEOPLE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Power House is one of those Hollywood jukebox joints that long ago created 
the recipe for today's thriving club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 With just enough space for some cozy green booths, a few bar stools and a hint 
of a performance space, the Power House opened its doors 35 years ago.Now, if 
you throw a rock in any direction you'll likely hit one of a dozen trendy 
nightclubs that have adopted this blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power House's main appeal is simply the folks who go there. It seems as if 
all pretensions are left at the door -- no small feat in this neck of the 
woods. Musically, the atmosphere is pretty much bluesy rock 'n' roll. The club, 
which features live music on weekends, offers a blues band on Fridays and 
everything from rock to punk to psychobilly and country bands on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect too much -- it's BYOSS (bring your own sound system), and if 
it's packed, you'll have a tough time angling your way to the bathroom -- the 
"stage" is right in front of the facilities. The Power House's jukebox, 
however, is one of its key music attractions, offering tunes from such artists 
as the Jam, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard and the Sex Pistols. If it's a weekend 
night, go easy on the ample Tom Jones selections. If the bartender hears 
another note of "What's New Pussycat," he'll get downright irritable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Power House, 1714 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood. Over 21. $1 cover on Friday 
and Saturday. (213) 463-9438. HEIDI SIEGMUND

POP MUSIC REVIEW; '60S ICON SPARKS CROWD AT TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A guest appearance by a '60s pop icon and a confrontation between a singer and 
a customer provided the jolts on Tuesday at the Troubadour, where 4AD Records 
opened a six-day showcase of its distinctive acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based record label is stereotyped as a haven for moody, ethereal 
music, and, with a catalogue that includes such groups as the Cocteau Twins and 
His Name Is Alive, it has to plead somewhat guilty. But then you have such 
groups as Tuesday's headliner the Wolfgang Press to mess up the formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The English band is part Roxy Music and part Velvet Underground, transforming 
classic soul music into arch, ironic art-rock with an R&B edge. Singer Michael 
Allen is firmly in the Bryan Ferry mold, but more the smug twit than the 
wounded romantic, and his low, rumbling croon lent the songs an ominous, 
reptilian tone. 
</P>
<P>
 It was catchy and creative, but it wasn't until the encore that the place went 
nuts. That's when Tom Jones came out to do two songs that the group wrote and 
produced for his upcoming album. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would this underground crowd embrace a veteran mainstream sex symbol so 
heartily? Maybe it was the sheer incongruity of the partnership. In any event, 
Jones sounded powerful and spirited on the Al Green-style soul number and the 
gritty rock song that closed the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the new group Air Miami, the second-billed Red House Painters 
crafted relentlessly autumnal pieces that built in intensity to the breaking 
point. The San Francisco group was as doggedly slow and moody as ever, but the 
playing seemed more dynamic than at its last headlining appearance here, and 
leader Mark Kozelek certainly livened things up. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he stomped off the stage in reaction to a technical problem, and 
toward the end he stopped the band in mid-song to berate a listener who had 
shouted something during a soft passage. Lesson of the day: You don't have to 
be a passive introvert to play introverted music. RICHARD CROMELIN

STEMMING THE RED TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN T. BARRETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phrase "the balance of nature" was never meant to cover home-grown 
tomatoes. From the day our tomatoes begin to blush in July to their last green 
gasp in November, we are in a constant state of tomato imbalance. We either 
have a surfeit or a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 This year there were a few complicating factors. For the first time, the local 
fauna discovered our vegetable garden. All July we waited patiently for that 
hot, sunny day when the tomatoes would turn blood-red. The animals weren't as 
patient; they scheduled nocturnal tomato feasts that were precisely timed for 
the night before we would have picked the ripe fruit. We lost the cream of the 
early season before we learned to snatch the tomatoes out of harm's way just 
before they reddened, letting them ripen in safety on the windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-August, in the days just prior to our annual two-week summer vacation 
on the East Coast, all of our "Big Beef" tomatoes ripened simultaneously. 
Frantically, I made tomato chutney and tomato jam (more about that later), 
served tomatoes morning, noon and night, gave friends our keys and pleaded with 
them to take lots of tomatoes. We returned to vines that, by some combination 
of our friends' and the animals' appetites, had been completely stripped of 
anything resembling a ripe tomato. The few remaining green tomatoes are 
continuing to ripen but are so sparse that I have been supplementing them from 
the farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should you be fortunate enough to have a tomato oversupply crisis, home 
canning is a great way to deal with it. Ketchup, chili sauce, tomato chutney, 
even old-fashioned specialties such as tomato marmalade and tomato jam -- I've 
tried them all. (Actually, I can't recommend the latter; I prepared a recipe 
called tomato jam with ginger and cardamom, which sounded intriguing but tasted 
very strange. I let a friend sample a spoonful and she put her finger on the 
elusive sweet-savory flavor: Campbell's tomato soup.) 
</P>
<P>
 For its ability to convert vast quantities of tomatoes into a tiny amount of 
intensely flavored condiment, nothing surpasses ketchup. Given a free 
afternoon, you can reduce a heaping colander of dead-ripe tomatoes to four 
little jars of the best stuff that ever adorned a burger. 
</P>
<P>
 Making ketchup is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it tastes better 
than store-bought and you can fine-tune it to your taste, adding sugar, spices, 
vinegar or even more exotic ingredients. (Plus, dinner guests are so incredibly 
impressed that you made the ketchup they are likely to overlook the fact that 
you are serving them burgers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tomato chutney is a lot less work than ketchup and is an equally welcome 
condiment for burgers, steaks and even grilled cheese sandwiches. It ages 
nicely too; I've kept tomato chutney for well beyond the prescribed year, and 
it only improves.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the tomato season in the fall means a glut of green tomatoes that 
refuse to ripen. The best thing about green tomatoes is that they don't have to 
be peeled (in fact, separating a green tomato from its peel is virtually 
impossible) and they just need a cursory seeding; the seeds are usually small 
and not noticeable in the finished product.  
</P>
<P>
 Green tomatoes go into one of my favorite chutneys, one that complements a 
variety of dishes. I didn't do green tomato chutney last fall and missed it so 
much that I made it in early August with a batch of green tomatoes that showed 
up serendipitously at the farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you are canning using your own tomatoes or commercially grown 
varieties, it is important to select firm fruit without cracks or rotten spots; 
cut away any small bruises or imperfections. Never use tomatoes that are 
overripe or in less than perfect condition.  
</P>
<P>
 A word on playing with recipes: It is always a good idea to taste a little of 
the hot ketchup or chutney from the pot to make sure it has the right balance 
of flavors. It is almost impossible to critically evaluate a boiling-hot 
mixture, however. Instead, spoon out a tablespoonful or so into a chilled bowl, 
then stick it in the freezer while the ketchup or chutney continues to simmer. 
Once the spoonful has cooled, it is much easier to judge its taste. Cooling a 
spoonful is also a good way to make sure the mixture has cooked down to the 
proper consistency.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you adjust canning recipes, remember not to reduce the proportion of 
vinegar to tomatoes; using too little vinegar can cause spoilage. When cooking, 
a chutney mixture may smell and taste overly vinegary, but that is because the 
vinegar flavors are volatile under heat and seem more pronounced. Once a 
chutney has been allowed to age for a month or so, vinegar flavors mellow.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complete canning instructions are available in cases of canning jars and 
should be followed explicitly. Basic canning equipment includes a large canning 
kettle with a wire basket to hold the jars in a boiling water bath; canning 
jars; two-piece vacuum lids and screw bands; a couple of clean dish towels or 
paper towels; an accurate kitchen timer; and a large, non-reactive saucepan. 
(Non-reactive refers to a material that does not react with acids or salts in 
the food. Avoid iron, aluminum, galvanized tin, unlined copper or brass. Use 
enameled, stainless steel or non-stick saucepans.) Other helpful items for home 
canning include a jar lifter, a wide-mouthed jar funnel, and a non-metallic 
spatula for releasing air bubbles from filled jars. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable "Ball Blue Book," put out by the canning jar company, is 
available by mail order from Direct Marketing, Alltrista Corp., P.O. Box 2005, 
Muncie, Ind. 47307; or by phone using a credit card at (317) 281-5227. The cost 
for the softcover book is $4.50, which includes shipping and handling.

 Hops add flavor to beer, and also help clarify and preserve it. So how do you 
suppose beer makers measure the amount of hops in a beer? In International 
Bitterness Units, of course. Most American beers are hopped at 11 to 14 IBUs, 
11 being considered the smallest detectable amount, but English ales are often 
around 25 and Czech Pilsners up to 35. Eating Real High on the Food Chain

 Don't let anybody tell you lion meat isn't tasty. Gourmets say lion steaks are 
good (don't stew the meat, though; it will be tender but insipid) and lion 
makes great jerky, of a delicately pinkish hue. Bag Those Tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a late-season glut of tomatoes, University of California Extension 
reminds you that you can always freeze them. Wash and dry tomatoes thoroughly, 
put them on a plate or baking sheet and freeze whole, then store in a freezer 
bag with all possible air removed; they suggest sucking air out with a straw 
until the bag adheres to the tomatoes, then removing the straw and sealing. Use 
within a couple of months because they can develop a freezer taste. Defrosted 
tomatoes will be good for cooking, but not for salad -- the skin cracks during 
freezing, for one thing (this makes them easy to peel, though). A Hearth Full 
of Loafbook 
</P>
<P>
 "Foodbill," an authorized parody of Playbill, is the official autographed 
cookbook of the company of "Les Miserables." Recipes contributed by the cast 
are written to various tunes in the show -- "A Heart Full of Love," for 
instance, becomes "A Hearth Full of Loaf"; "Soliloquy" becomes both 
"Solilo-Quiche" and "Solilo-Kiev," and the "Finale" is braised fennel and 
endive, or "Fennel-ee." (Yes, they're also broken down into usual recipe 
format, with measurements.) Proceeds from the 56-page book benefit Broadway 
Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. To order, make a check for $15 to "Les Miserables" -- 
BC/EFA and send to "Les Miserables," 1650 Broadway, Suite 501, New York, N.Y.

</P>
<P>
 Strange to think, 10 years ago the Caesar salad was in eclipse. Not only is it 
possibly the most popular salad in restaurants these days, other foods are 
aggressively Caesarizing themselves. Note Clamato's Bloody Caesar Cocktail Mix 
and Jack in the Box's Chicken Caesar Sandwich, more or less a chicken pita 
sandwich (plus mozzarella and provolone) crowned with a Caesar. Ho-Ho-Ho,

 For the fourth year, the Napa Valley Wine Train, which hauls refurbished 1915 
Pullman cars past some of the most famous wineries in California, is offering 
special trips aimed at a mostly non-wine-drinking group: children. The Santa 
Express, an abbreviated run to Yountville and back, features the Rotund One and 
some of his helper elves. Last year, the Santa Express sold out rapidly; this 
year, reservations are not available after mid-October. Trips will be Dec. 10, 
Dec. 17 and daily Dec. 19-24. For reservations ($12 for adults; under 12 free), 
call (800) 427-4124. Introducing: The Iced Tea Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola and Nestle are ending a joint venture to bottle iced tea which

 What happened to your favorite haunt of yesteryear? Odds are, there are cars 
parked on it. Progress is no respecter of fine cuisine. If some of the 
addresses don't jibe with your memories, be aware that many of these 
restaurants changed location even during their heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brown Derby, 1628 Vine St. in Hollywood, was destroyed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Cocoanut Grove, 3400 Wilshire Blvd., was in the Ambassador Hotel, now 
owned by Donald Trump and the subject of a lawsuit: The City of Los Angeles 
wants the site for a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mocambo, 8588 Sunset Blvd., is the parking lot for the Playboy Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sardi's Restaurant, 6315 Hollywood Blvd., is now the Cave Adult Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trocadero, 8610 Sunset Blvd., is a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Romanoff's, 326 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, is now a fancy boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Rue, which was located at 8633 Sunset Blvd. when the Strip was literally 
a "strip" of unincorporated county land, is now Nicole Miller, a very trendy 
women's store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maison Gerard, 4100 Cahuenga Blvd., North Hollywood, is now Ca' del Sole, an 
Italian restaurant from the Locanda Veneta/Ca'Brea folk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scandia, at least the building, can still be seen at 9040 Sunset Blvd. near 
Doheny: The 'I' in the name has disappeared and the building is used for 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perino's, 3927 Wilshire Blvd., near Western, is now a mid-rise office 
building. In the space where stars once dined is a furniture store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Lyman's Grill Downtown, once on the corner of 8th and Hill streets, is 
now somewhere under the parking structure for the First Interstate Bank 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 * The site of Mike Lyman's Grill in Hollywood, on the 1600 block of Vine 
Street, is now a parking lot next to the Doolittle Theater, which in those days 
was the Huntington Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tail O' the Cock, once at 477 S. La Cienega Blvd., is now the Hotel Nikko. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lucey's, 5444 Melrose Ave., is now an office building across from Paramount 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tick Tock Tea Room, 1716 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, is in the process of 
becoming -- who knows what? The building is presently under reconstruction. 
There's no sign indicating what is slated to come. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don the Beachcomber's, 1727 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood, is now a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cock 'n' Bull's space on the 9100 block of Sunset Boulevard was recently 
annexed by a Jaguar and Range Rover dealership. BRUCE HENSTELL

 My editor, who is 30-something, asked me to do a memory-lane piece on 
restaurants that were popular a long time ago . . . 20, 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, wait a minute, kid," I told her. "I may be 60-something, but I'm really 
17 at heart. I go to the Tail of the Pup, I watch MTV and listen to the 
Grateful Dead all the time. I'd really have to stretch my memory to remember 
places I haven't been to for the last 30 years."  
</P>
<P>
 "Try," she said and went off, her short, short skirt flinging as she turned. 
</P>
<P>
 But whom was I kidding? A brief reminiscence turned up more closed restaurants 
than I care to recall. Perino's, Scandia, the Windsor, the Brown Derby whooshed 
up first. The scrambled regression of places slipped further and further back, 
like a time machine gone amok. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then everything stopped. Oh, my God! It's 1960 at Romanoff's. And there is 
Mike Romanoff serving strawberries Romanoff the way they should be, sprinkled 
with brown sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's Au Petit Jean and La Rue. I almost forgot them. They were little 
French gems, precursors of Le Restaurant and Le St. Germain, that helped mold 
the cultural character of the city at a time when food -- French or otherwise 
-- was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knew from French in those days? Escargots defined French cuisine in Los 
Angeles in the '50s. And Robaire's, longer-lived than any other French 
restaurant, served a cassoulet that we then thought was a half a minute from 
Paris. Maison Gerard, another '50s and '60s hangout of the stars, introduced us 
to our first onion soup -- which might have been authentic, but who could be 
sure? 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Coppertone look of Scandia I remember most. Day or night, a 
California squint was necessary to see past the deep, dark, coppery glow from 
all that expensive copper hammered on the bar where they kept the 
all-you-can-eat-but-didn't-dare Swedish meatballs. The glow came from 
everywhere -- the burnished wood-paneled walls covered with copper utensils and 
even the rich burgundy leather chairs with oversized backs and wings as large 
as elephant ears, where romance, serious business and monkey business were safe 
from stray eyes and ears.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I also remember the hostess sending my husband off to the cloak room, like a 
naughty boy used to be sent to the principal's office, to be fitted with an 
oversized blue blazer and a crumpled tie when his '70s Nehru jacket was deemed 
unsuitable for Scandia's respectable rooms. Fashion slights were accepted 
meekly in those days. Who would stand for that stuff today? 
</P>
<P>
 The imperious hostess (Judith Anderson in the movie "Rebecca" flashes to mind) 
would lead us in a funereal procession to our plush, overstuffed banquettes and 
slap huge blue menus with dangling gold tassels on the table as if she were 
issuing court summonses. No hello. No goodby. "Dinner for two this way, 
please." Never did host or hostess utter my name in 20 years of regular dining 
at Scandia. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I loved it. There were the three-ring circus acts by waiters performing 
a service known as "table-side" cooking, an art lost and buried along with the 
great Continental restaurants of America's past. Flames from chafing dishes 
shot up, sending wafts of smoking shish kebab perfumed with Cognac into the 
air. Caesar salads made with real eggs were tossed with the flair of a 
ballerina's Swan Lake arms. Slicing steak Diane was a sleight-of-hand magic 
act. First you see the steak in the pan, then find it ribboned on your plate. 
No beat. 
</P>
<P>
 No restaurant since Scandia has served gravad lax with droplings of curled, 
crisply fried salmon skin and a sweet dill sauce. The chicken Kon-Tiki, a 
curried chicken salad, not only was a lunch favorite (eaten with salt sticks) 
but ended up in the hall of fame of most-requested recipes of The Times' 
Culinary SOS readers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though I was no fan of fish, the pickled herring was so fresh I could almost 
smell the North Sea. We often stopped at Scandia after the theater or movie for 
late supper, which started at 10 p.m. sharp and not a moment sooner. Danish 
open-faced sandwiches were miniature works of art, decorated with spirals of 
lemon peel, sprigs of dill, swirls of sour cream and a sprinkling of caviar. 
</P>
<P>
 The steak saute with potatoes, prepared table-side, inspired me to duplicate 
the dish at home, and it's something I serve to this day. Lingonberry pudding, 
served in huge stemware bowls with lingonberry sauce sinking deep into clouds 
of whipped cream, is now a fragment of a recurring dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Perino's, tucked away on the fringes of Hancock Park, was Los Angeles' first 
and foremost icon of culinary excellence in the '50s and '60s. Where else would 
you get pumpernickel cheese toast served by a waiter wearing white gloves? Or 
where today do you have to beg for the check, as we often had to at Perino's, 
before the captain deigned to present it? 
</P>
<P>
 The Windsor was a far more relaxed Continental copycat. Suave but not 
overbearing; stuffy but friendly. And those crepes Suzette, performed at 
table-side, were divine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I never knew the owners of those famed Continental restaurants, but their 
presence was always felt. My memory of Scandia's Kenneth Hansen is of a 
handsome, square-faced Dane with piercing blue eyes -- and a temper that 
supposedly terrorized the kitchen staff as he scrutinized each and every dish 
for a stray droplet of sauce, an ill-placed chive blade or whatever it was that 
would make him send the plate back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his strong presence, I would guess, that saved Scandia from extinction 
long after it was outclassed by the new wave of Continental restaurants -- Le 
St. Germain, Le Restaurant, L'Ermitage, L'Orangerie, Bernard's, Ma Maison and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was these restaurants that brought to Los Angeles French cooking that we 
thought was better than you would get in France. By the late '70s, Los Angeles 
was finally serious about its food. Thankfully, L'Orangerie is still around, 
for anyone old enough to remember the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But even these wonderful new French restaurants eventually became arbitrary 
victims of fashion in a fickle age when everything, including restaurants, 
became subject to cancellation without notice.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A jumble of dishes of those golden days of Los Angeles' culinary revolution in 
the '70s and '80s flashes before my eyes: Ma Maison's ravioli stuffed with duck 
(when Wolfgang Puck was doing the cooking); Bernard's chilled avocado soup in 
an avocado shell; Roland Gibert's wonderful whole cabbage stuffed with a farcie 
of mushrooms and wrapped in caul fat, also at Bernard's. (I remember Bernard 
Jacoupy, who now operates Lunaria in West Los Angeles, saying to Gibert, who is 
from Central France's cabbage-producing center: "Cabbage, cabbage, cabbage. We 
are turning into cabbages.") 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Michel Blanchet at L'Ermitage masterfully creating a minimalist 
picture-perfect Jardin des Tuileries dead-center on the plate with Dover sole 
and a few cut vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before these new-wave restaurants arrived in Los Angeles, there was a 
group of American restaurants that identified the city's carefree spirit more 
than any other kind of place, living or dead. They were a class of restaurant 
that I would love to see again, but, of course, never will.  
</P>
<P>
 I had just arrived from New York City and was invited to the Brown Derby near 
the Ambassador Hotel. There, occupying a good portion of a city block, was a 
brown derby hat about three stories high and 90 feet wide. I laughed 
hysterically. I was home at last -- Alice's Wonderland.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I ran home and got the kids. They ordered the Shirley Temples and the Cobb 
salad -- now household names in American cuisine, they were both invented by 
owner Bob Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bantam Cock and Tail O' the Cock, a couple of zany architectural twins, 
sporting sweeping overhangs and tall signs of roosters clucking over busy Los 
Angeles boulevards, were great places to unload the week's psychological aches 
and pains with a good gin and tonic, shrimp cocktail and a terrific steak. 
</P>
<P>
 As for steaks, Ollie Hammond's on La Cienega was matchless for its comforting 
choo-choo-train coziness, friendly waiters and steak done to your pleasure, 
with a wood marker indicating "rare," "medium" or "well done." 
</P>
<P>
 Steak sandwiches, like the chewy ones once served at the recently deceased 
Nickodell's on Melrose, had the Los Angeles stamp of approval for how a steak 
should be served -- on a piece of toasted French bread soaked with steak juice, 
over or under a fried onion. You can order the same type of sandwich today at 
Musso and Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard, the place that probably invented 
the sandwich and still is going strong as Los Angeles' oldest family 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Nickodell's the steak was not prime, but who cared, as long as it could be 
eaten in the dim light of the smoky lounge where Dashiell Hammett and Lillian 
Hellman fought and made up? Or was it Carol and Bob, or Desi and Lucy? 
Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the South Seas restaurants that vanished without a trace. What 
happened to Don the Beachcomber? Or the Luau, known for its terrific tropical 
drinks and boula boula , the soup that is part pea soup and part turtle soup? 
Which reminds me: Whatever happened to Frascati? The scampi there was terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, well. Nothing is forever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Luau, which looked like a ship-wrecked sailing ship in the center of 
Beverly Hills, served Boula Boula in small bowls.  
</P>
<P>
 LUAU'S BOULA BOULA 
</P>
<P>

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: HOLLYWOOD SWINGIN'

<P>
 "Since I had forgotten to bring along a bag of pemmican, I would have to eat 
in Los Angeles -- a fairly exact definition of the term 'the kiss of death.' "  
</P>
<P>
 -- S. J. Perelman 
</P>
<P>
 The old Captain's Table may have served the best lobster west of Maine, I've 
heard, and the cream Senegalese at Chasen's could have been the next thing to a 
sundae at Wil Wright's. My brothers and I, though, children of ex-Chicagoans, 
were brought up to believe we lived in a culinary desert, a place without 
decent pizza, without decent hot dogs, without a specific kind of spare rib 
they used to serve at a place on Rush Street. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents -- a teacher and a probation officer -- may have saved their 
nickels for the occasional meal out at Perino's or Frascati, but when the 
family was involved, it was the No. 2 plate at El Coyote seven times out of 10. 
Even before the last great wave of immigration gave the area some of the best 
pupusas and empanadas and pine-leaf dumplings in the world, Los Angeles was a 
junk-food paradise: cinnamon rolls at Dick Webster's, Orange Julius on every 
street corner, Blum's sticky buns and Lum's hot dogs steamed in beer. Poppy's, 
a hippie restaurant in Westwood, had banana splits the size of small canoes. 
</P>
<P>
 My earliest Hollywood food memories center on a hot dog stand called the 
Kosher Puppy, a restaurant that served the kind of Chicago-style franks my 
father always craved, also crinkle-cut fries and Cokes with chipped ice. But I 
remember it chiefly for slot-car racing and teen-age girls with impossibly tall 
hair. As a matter of fact, most of the restaurants I remember from early 
childhood served Chicago dogs. Pop had kind of a one-track mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole categories of L.A. restaurants no longer exist, replaced by papaya 
salsas and the sun-dried tomato: grand tiki restaurants such as Don the 
Beachcomber, the Luau and Kelbo's Fairfax, where you could eat candy-sweet 
spare ribs and illicitly guzzle missionary's revenges from an older friend's 
skull mug; waterfall Chinese restaurants such as Wan-Q and Kowloon (the 
greatest place on earth, because it had waterfalls and paper-wrapped chicken); 
drive-ins such as Tiny Naylor's, the 'Wich Stand and Dolores'. As a 4-year-old 
I pretty much lived on 'Wich Stand milkshakes, as a high-school student on 
Dolores' cherry-lime rickeys and Suzy-Q fries with malt vinegar . . . unless I 
could afford a steak sandwich and onion rings at Ollie Hammond's, which was 
almost never. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior year, I took a girlfriend out to dinner at L'Ermitage, ordered a 
special that turned out to be either liver stuffed with kidney or kidney 
stuffed with liver, and even talked the captain into serving us a bottle of 
Macon, but it wasn't really my kind of place. Maybe it had something to do with 
taking the bus home from a $120 dinner, but even my girlfriend wasn't 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later there were splendid herring suppers at Scandia (a cheaper smorrebrod 
menu took effect at 10 p.m.), roast turkey dinners at Tick Tock, and epic 
Sunday roast-beef hangover buffets at the old Cock 'N' Bull up on the Strip, 
fortified by many Moscow mules -- ginger beer, vodka, copper mug -- a house 
invention that is reputed to have introduced vodka to the United States -- and 
certainly introduced it to my liver. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I think of old Hollywood restaurants, the first thing that comes to 
mind is the Oki Dog on Santa Monica Boulevard after a punk-rock show at the 
Starwood down the street: dozens of newly minted Mohawk guys taking three bites 
from handbag-size burritos and hurling the rest at passing cars, KROQ blasting 
at Social Distortion volumes, a guy behind the counter barking out orders in a 
fractured Japanese accent, the usual freaks and hustlers gawking at the show. A 
pastrami burrito and heavy, greasy bags of steak fries -- quartered potatoes 
fried in cheap grease, essentially -- could feed three people for a day for 
about two bucks, and usually did.

RESTAURANT HISTORY; A LUNCH AT ROBAIRE'S

<P>
 On special occasions, my family ate at Robaire's on La Brea.  
</P>
<P>
 For us, dining out was a luxury, and while we ate dinner once a week at a 
family restaurant in Altadena and often started camping trips with coffee-shop 
eggs, we followed a strict restaurant protocol. No milk for the kids (there was 
plenty of milk at home), no cocktails for the adults (you could buy a whole 
bottle of Scotch for the price of two drinks), no meat with breakfasts (an 
entire pound of bacon cost as much as those three inferior slices), etc. 
</P>
<P>
 At Robaire's, I would always scan the menu and find the one or two priciest 
items and say with great, resolute primness: "I believe I will have the 
Chateaubriand." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ho ho ho," My parents would say. "Very funny, Michelle." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd scan the menu again, and this time I'd find the three least expensive 
items and chose from among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I was 12 or so, I settled on a favorite item, which had two virtues: Not 
only was it inexpensive, it made the waiter stop and look at me with interest. 
Clearly, not many adolescent girls ordered chicken liver omelets. "Excellent 
choice," he'd murmur. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was an excellent choice: a plump envelope of softly cooked yellow egg 
full of wine-dark sauce and earthy, braised livers. I remember several specific 
meals at Robaire's -- I ate rack of lamb there before my high school prom -- 
but one lunch in particular stands out: It was a meal that changed our family. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister did not date much in high school. She played the violin and taught 
the violin and studied in her room. After graduation, she began studying 
Japanese at a junior college so she could go to Japan and study violin and 
pedagogy with Shinichi Suzuki. Although she was gifted in languages, Japanese 
was so difficult that she needed help. She found the handsomest Japanese man in 
the college library and asked him to be her tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new tutor, it turned out, needed a tutor himself. He had been born and 
raised in Japan and had recently spent seven years in France. He spoke Japanese 
and French fluently, but he had been in America for only two months and his 
English was rudimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My sister was still living at home at the time, and I was a senior in high 
school. As the months passed, my parents and I heard more and more about the 
tutor. Finally, my sister announced they were officially dating. My parents 
asked to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements were made. We were to pick him up, go to a Saturday morning 
recital, and then out to lunch -- at Robaire's. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine years old, the famous tutor was indeed handsome and cheerful and 
quite fond of my sister. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, my mother did not come along that day. After the recital, my 
father, my sister, her tutor and I went to Robaire's. Once we sat down, my 
father turned to our guest. "Please," he said. "Have anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
 I checked the menu for the most expensive items, but did not make my usual 
threat: too shy, I think, on the new and odd occasion of meeting the man my 
sister loved. A man who, incidentally, ordered a cocktail first thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the waiter returned to take our order, I went first: chicken liver 
omelet. My sister, frowning at the menu, wanted more time.  
</P>
<P>
 The tutor then spoke to the waiter at length in French. He asked many 
questions. Sitting next to him, I watched as his finger strayed through the 
menu, pausing here in the list of appetizers, there in the salads, and there 
again among the entrees. The waiter scribbled away. My father ordered a chicken 
dish. My sister ordered only a dinner salad. "I'm not hungry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutor offered us tastes of his food. Pate. A thick soup. Red wine. Frog 
legs. I was torn -- at once fascinated and mortified to see items from 
long-forbidden areas of the menu materialize at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the courses never stop coming? 
</P>
<P>
 When the bill arrived, the tutor reached for it, but his was not an aggressive 
gesture. "No, no, no, I insist," my father said -- and while his was not a 
heartfelt protest, that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 My father duly reported these events to my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguing lasted for hours that night. My father and mother were united: The 
tutor was too old. He was inconsiderate. A freeloader, a mooch. At the very 
least, a big spender. Why, his meal alone had cost more than all three of ours 
put together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then, my sister's voice would rise above the fray in a wail: 
"But you told him to order anything he wanted!" and, "He tried to pay. Dad 
wouldn't let him!" 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is to say that my parents gave my sister no choice in the matter 
concerning this man. She didn't do it right away, but eventually, inevitably, 
she married him.

 When you get right down to it, most dishes are essentially fine just the way 
they are. You can heighten flavors by dabbling with the seasonings -- a touch 
of salt here, a pat of butter there -- but those changes are more tune-ups than 
overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes what seems like a minor change can make a major difference in a 
dish. Once I made a very simple soup of Swiss chard. It was OK by itself but 
definitely needed something more, so I ladled some into two bowls, added grated 
cheese to one and a dollop of good olive oil to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The grated cheese tweaked the soup, making it better but not really changing 
its nature. It was still not much more than pleasant. The olive oil, on the 
other hand, worked changes bordering on alchemy, transforming that nice 
workaday bowl of soup into something with elegance and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasting the two side by side, it was difficult to believe they were basically 
the same recipe. Thinking about it now, I can understand how the deep, herbal 
green-ness of the chard was the perfect foil for the same qualities in the 
young olive oil. And I've stuck that away in my "next time" file, in case the 
same situation comes up again. But at the time it was nothing more than a 
stroke of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are people who can plan this kind of magic. I remember 
cooking a special wine-tasting lunch with a great local chef. When it was 
almost time to serve the main course, he sampled a glass of the appropriate 
wine and a bit of the sauce. He grimaced, called a cook over, had him fill a 
fine mesh sieve with raw, whole peeled garlic and poured the sauce through. He 
tasted it again and repeated the operation before giving his OK. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a spoonful of each version of the sauce. After the first pass, the 
change seemed almost microscopic. But after the second pass through the garlic, 
the sauce seemed to bloom in my mouth. It didn't taste like garlic, it tasted 
like . . . something else, something you couldn't put your finger on. 
</P>
<P>
 I could only shake my head. That infinitesimal bit of flavor shading made such 
a striking difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The average home cook, on the other hand, has to be satisfied with painting in 
rather bolder colors. Black and white, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 What brings all this to mind was something I fixed the other day. I had my 
mouth set for a really good, strong coffee ice. What I had in mind was 
something like a straight shot of espresso -- really dark and really potent, 
with just a touch of sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So I brewed up a good, strong pot of coffee (1 cup freshly ground Graffeo 
dark-roast to 4 cups water) and added it to an almost equal amount of 50% sugar 
syrup (2 cups water, 2 cups sugar, boiled until clear and chilled -- I try to 
have some on hand through the summer for making ices and sweetening drinks). 
Then I froze the mixture in an ice cream machine. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour of ripening, I tasted the ice. It was mildly sweet, smooth in 
texture and so powerfully coffee-flavored it tasted almost gritty. In short, it 
was almost exactly what I'd aimed for. And it was almost inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 I had intended to serve it with just a tablespoon or two of whipped cream. 
More cream, I thought, would cover up some of the grittiness. Again, I was not 
prepared for the way this simple change transformed the dish. The sweet, bland 
richness of the whipped cream was the perfect counterpart to the powerful, 
dark, almost dusty flavor of the coffee ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to look to the dish for hints. Sometimes it's flavors that mesh, 
as when that bit of olive oil complemented the chard. In other cases, it's a 
contrast that's necessary -- the way the creaminess offsets the earthy coffee 
flavor in this parfait. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only way to pull off either one is to pay attention to what you're 
cooking -- and maybe get a little lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The texture of this ice is fairly smooth. You could make it more crystalline 
by using less sugar, but then the flavors would be out of balance.  
</P>
<P>
 ESPRESSO PARFAIT 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup finely ground dark-roast coffee beans 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 stick cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Make strong coffee from beans and 4 cups boiling water. Strain and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In medium saucepan bring 2 cups water and 2 cups sugar to boil with cinnamon. 
Boil 3 minutes until syrup is clear. Remove cinnamon stick. Combine sugar syrup 
and coffee and chill in refrigerator until cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Ice should have fairly coarse 
crystals and be light in texture. 
</P>
<P>
 In medium bowl whip cream until stiff peaks form. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 
beat well to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide ice among 8 chilled wine glasses. Top each with 1/4 cup whipped cream. 
Makes 8 servings.

A BOWL OF BRUSCHETTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm always lured to the huge crusty loaves of Italian bread in my local 
bakery, knowing full well that a loaf will go stale before my husband and I 
ever finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian cooks evidently have this problem as well. The first approach is to 
make bruschetta -- a kind of tomatoes on toast. Then they move on to bread 
salad: a mixture of stale bread, tomatoes, herbs, oil and vinegar. So in my 
kitchen I consider bread salad a clever use of leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 A local caterer showed me how to transform bread salad into a dish with 
marvelous complex flavors and an elegant look. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicious difference comes from using fresh Italian bread and grilling it 
for a slightly smoky, toasted taste, then packing the salad with potent, 
aromatic ingredients such as roasted peppers, feta cheese and olives. I add 
hazelnuts for crunch (celery is a fine substitute) and jalapeno chiles for 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This makes a delightful main course any time of the year, especially when 
served with refreshing minted cantaloupe. GRILLED BREAD AND SWEET PEPPER SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 4 slices Italian bread, sliced 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup dried Greek black olives 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons green peppercorns, packed in brine and drained 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup cubed feta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped green onions, white and green parts 
</P>
<P>
 1 jalapeno chile, cored, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped hazelnuts, optional 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons Sherry vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Place sweet red pepper on grate of grill over hot coals and cook, turning to 
blacken all sides, about 12 to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 At same time add bread slices to grill and toast on both sides until lightly 
browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove both from grill. Cut bread into cubes 
to equal 4 cups. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place sweet pepper in plastic food bag and seal. Set aside 1 hour. Remove 
sweet pepper. Place under cold running water and scrape off skin with paring 
knife. Core and seed sweet pepper. Cut into bite-size pieces. Place bread and 
sweet pepper in large serving bowl. Add olives, green peppercorns, feta cheese, 
green onions, jalapeno and nuts. Toss gently but well. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together olive oil, vinegar, 2 tablespoons water and salt and pepper to 
taste. Pour over salad and toss well. If salad is slightly dry, add remaining 1 
tablespoon water. Adjust seasonings to taste. Makes 2 servings. MINTED 
CANTALOUPE 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 2 rounded tablespoons chopped mint 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 ripe cantaloupe 
</P>
<P>
 2 mint sprigs 
</P>
<P>
 Combine sugar, water and mint in small pan and simmer 10 minutes. Set side to 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile seed and peel cantaloupe. Cut cantaloupe meat into bite-size pieces 
and place in bowl. Strain mint mixture and pour syrup over cantaloupe. Stir to 
coat. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. Serve with mint sprig garnish. Makes 2 
servings.

WINE: BRINGING IN THE GRAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early morning light, a lone red-tailed hawk sails low over row upon 
green row of grapevines. Cool, gray fog crests the hill and begins to flow down 
the slope, slowly enveloping the vines. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm south of town, driving east on remote Ramal Road, with not a structure in 
sight, nothing but vines groaning with blue-black grapes. It's time for my 
annual reality check: getting in touch with the Northern California wine grape 
harvest by helping to pick a vineyard of Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Fog is one of the things that makes the Carneros wine-growing district perfect 
for the Burgundian grape varieties Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In late summer, 
the fog remains until 10 most mornings, slowing the maturation of the grapes. 
This keeps acids high, which is beneficial for fine wine, and lengthens the 
growing season, producing vine-ripe fruit. Foggy mornings also allow the grapes 
to be picked cool, which winemakers prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm joining eight others eager to see the harvest up close at a seminar staged 
by a group of Carneros winemakers. Before our group begins harvesting, 
coordinators give us the essential information: how to use the serpette , the 
curved knife used for cutting loose the bunches, and where the bandages are. 
("Cuts are inevitable," says grower Andy Beckstoffer, who then accidentally 
cuts his own finger.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We are also told which fruit to pick. Only ripe fruit; none that is moldy; 
none that is raisined; none that is sunburned. 
</P>
<P>
 As we trudge out into the morning mist, we stumble on cracks in the Diablo 
Series soil, which, if not tilled, crumbles and looks as if a mini-earthquake 
has struck. It makes for uneven footing, for risking a turned ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Most vines I attack with my serpette have such long canes that I have to duck 
down below them, where the grapes hide and little spiders scurry away. I reach 
up to cut the little clusters free. My hamstring and back muscles soon ache. 
</P>
<P>
 One vine, I'm glad to see, doesn't have so much foliage. "This one is easy," I 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That vine has leaf-roll virus," says Charles Thomas, one of our aides and 
winemaker for the Robert Mondavi Winery. Many of the leaves have curled up and 
the grape clusters look sick. Soon the vine will have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour, I have filled two 30-pound lug boxes with clusters -- and 
rediscovered some muscle groups dormant since basic training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard work, isn't it?," asks Thomas, who then tells me a trained fieldworker 
would have gotten a quarter-ton of grapes in the same time. The average 
harvester gets between $75 and $100 per ton of grapes picked, Thomas says, and 
a good picker can harvest two tons in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we began picking, the vineyard was surveyed by samplers, checking to 
see whether the grape sugars were high enough and the flavors strong enough to 
harvest. The samplers arrive at selected vineyard sites in a "selectedly 
random" fashion. Each winery has its own system, but the samples must 
ultimately be representative of the entire vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The berries go into plastic bags and are smashed up until the juice is mixed. 
Then a couple of drops of the juice are placed into the lens of a 
refractometer, which gives a reading of the sugar level. Good winemakers also 
walk through vineyards and taste the fruit to see whether there is flavor worth 
fermenting into wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual picking is supervised by vineyard managers such as Ann Kraemer, who 
oversees Domaine Chandon's 700 acres of Carneros vineyards and their work force 
of 45 men. She is the one who deals with the logistic jigsaw puzzle of 
scheduling multiple pieces of field equipment and the people to operate them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A glitch in one step of this operation can destroy a load of grapes costing 
thousands of dollars -- to say nothing of lost work hours. For example: Pickers 
need bins for the harvested grapes. A bin shortage cuts productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, at each picking site there must be at least one truck to take the 
grapes to the crush pad. On one recent Saturday morning, Kraemer got a call on 
her mobile radio that a vineyard truck had a flat tire. A load of grapes headed 
for a winery 30 miles away was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was that delivery in jeopardy. So was a later one, due for a 1 p.m. 
pickup by the same truck. To make matters worse, a truck scheduled to arrive at 
another picking site at 1 p.m. arrived by mistake at 8:30 a.m., when there was 
nothing to load. In addition, a tractor broke down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, Murphy's Law rears its head when a piece of equipment that had 
been checked out the day before stops working. Neighbors often bail out the 
disaster-struck, but, as Kraemer says, "It can be crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after her mechanical hassles, Kraemer was dealing with a different 
kind of problem: A handful of pickers weren't clean-picking the vines, so sound 
fruit was being left in the vineyard.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce such difficulties, some wineries harvest by machine. This requires 
specialized vine trellising and an expensive harvesting machine with a series 
of beaters that pound at each vine, jarring and shaking the berries free from 
their stems. The berries fall onto a conveyor belt and are carried to a bin. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who machine-harvest swear by it because it can be used before sun-up and 
you don't have to make it lunch. Those who hand-pick contend that, unlike 
machines, their crews are trained to avoid bad clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how the grapes are picked, harvest time is hectic for everyone. 
It's called "the crush" because of how the grapes are processed, but winemakers 
also know the phrase means the amount of work that must be done in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 These weeks in the vineyard, from September through the end of October, are 
intense. Harvesting decisions often are left until the last second and can turn 
on whether a rain cloud suddenly moves in one direction or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Winemakers all look haggard at this season -- they're working seven days a 
week and are not getting much sleep. Meals are almost always eaten on the run, 
and it's not unusual for winemakers to lose 10 or 15 pounds during harvest. 
Larry Brooks of Acacia Winery, like many others at this time of year who simply 
haven't time to shave, sports what is commonly called the "crush beard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The period of calm that follows the harvest is deceptive. The trails may no 
longer be choked with dust from rumbling grape trucks, but winemakers must stay 
close to the vats and barrels to make sure fermentations don't go awry and 
produce vintage-dated vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Prematurely gray Steve MacRostie is one of those who will take no vacations 
until long after the juice is fully fermented. The winemaker for his own 
MacRostie brand as well as Roche Vineyards, MacRostie is now shepherding the 
grapes we picked, now all fermenting juice. 
</P>
<P>
 How will this wine turn out? Well, that depends on a lot of wine making 
decisions -- which yeast to use, whether to do an optional malolactic 
fermentation, the type of barrels to age the wine in, how long it should age. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 By this time, the grapes are almost forgotten. The winemaker, not the grape 
grower, now takes center stage. And another form of art comes into play. Wine 
of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Rabbit Ridge Vineyards "Allure" ($7) -- Blends of the French grape 
varieties that go into Cotes du Rhone have become popular among California 
winemakers, and one reason is that these wines can be flavorful and drinkable 
at an age when a Cabernet Sauvignon is still closed and tannic. A recent 
recommendation of the 1992 Quivira Dry Creek Cuvee ($12) prompted more calls 
than I expected, so I have sought a less expensive alternative. This is it. 
</P>
<P>
 Winemaker Erich Russell, whose Rabbit Ridge Vineyards has doubled total 
production to 30,000 cases in the last four years, says of Allure: "It's my 
pasta wine, that's why I first made it. I eat so much pasta I needed a wine to 
go with it." Allure is a nearly equal blend of Syrah and Grenache, with smaller 
amounts of Mourvedre and Cinsault for complexity. The wine has loads of fruit, 
a trace of spice, not much tannin and excellent balance. It was aged in a 
combination of American and French oak barrels and has a smooth, polished 
texture. The wine may be seen in some places for $6 or less. A great value.

BACK TO BASICS: BLINTZ HINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweetened cheese is the classic filling for blintzes, but variations on this 
traditional treat are filled with blueberries, strawberries and even apples. 
Blintzes are versatile enough to serve for brunch, a light supper or dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrappers are similar to crepes ( blintz comes from the Russian word for 
crepes, blini ), except that they are browned on only one side. After being 
prepared, the batter must be refrigerated at least an hour so the flour 
particles absorb the liquid, swell and soften. This ensures that the cooked 
wrappers will be light and tender. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pans designed specifically for making crepes, but any 5 1/2 to 
7-inch-diameter omelet pan or skillet with sloping sides can be used for 
cooking crepes or blintz wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat the empty skillet until a drop of cold water dances on the surface. After 
brushing lightly with melted butter (Step 1), pour the measured amount of 
batter into the center of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly tilt the pan so the batter spreads evenly over the bottom, forming a 
thin coating that almost immediately begins to bubble (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Set the pan directly on the burner and cook about 30 seconds, or until the 
underside is lightly browned and the top surface is dry to the touch. Run the 
tip of a metal spatula around the edge to loosen the pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn the wrapper out onto a paper towel (Step 3), browned side up. Continue 
making wrappers with the remaining batter, stacking them between paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with one wrapper at a time, add the filling. Place the pancake, 
browned side up, on a work surface and spoon about three tablespoons of filling 
near the center. Spread the mixture into a rectangle about 1x4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold the opposite sides of the wrapper over the filling, then roll up burrito 
fashion (Step 4), completely enclosing the filling. Repeat with the remaining 
wrappers and filling. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage the blintzes can either be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, or 
sauteed in a little butter, three to four at a time. Cook until golden brown on 
the underside, then turn and brown the second side (Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the blintzes warm in a low oven until all are cooked. Sprinkle with 
powdered sugar and serve with sour cream and fruit preserves. CHEESE BLINTZES 
</P>

scraping down sides of container as necessary. Refrigerate, covered, 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl beat together granulated sugar, cream cheese, cottage cheese and 
cinnamon. Cover and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove batter from refrigerator and briefly blend again. Measure approximately 
3 tablespoons batter into 1/4 cup measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat crepe pan or skillet until drop of cold water dances. Brush pan lightly 
with melted butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour batter into center of pan. With other hand, quickly tilt pan so batter 
spreads evenly over bottom, forming thin coating that almost immediately begins 
to bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Set pan directly on burner and cook about 30 seconds, or until underside is 
lightly browned. Run tip of metal spatula around edge to loosen pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn out onto paper towel, browned side up. Repeat procedure with remaining 
batter, stacking wrappers between paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with 1 wrapper at time, place browned side up on work surface. Spoon 3 
tablespoons filling near center of wrapper and spread into 4x1-inch rectangle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold opposite sides over filling, then roll up burrito fashion, completely 
enclosing filling. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 1 to 2 tablespoons melted butter to large skillet over medium heat. Add 3 
to 4 blintzes, not touching, seam side down. Saute until golden brown on 
underside. Turn and saute second side.

GOOD COOKING: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING? MAKE RATATOUILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ratatouille is the quintessential fall harvest vegetable dish -- eggplant, 
tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, zucchini, garlic and herbs, all simmered in 
olive oil and in their own juices. 
</P>
<P>
 While not terribly time-consuming, it's not a dish to rush through. Make 
ratatouille when you can relax and enjoy the whole process . . . a fall 
weekend, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking methods and mix of vegetables varies from cook to cook. Depending on 
preference, vegetables can be either cooked together or cooked separately and 
later combined and cooked -- either briefly or for a prolonged period. 
</P>
<P>
 For the following ratatouille recipe, I've borrowed a little bit from each of 
these options, achieving a result that suits my taste: a colorful, flavorful 
mix -- with chunky but tender vegetables -- that uses less olive oil than is 
called for in most recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to this ratatouille is slow-cooking the onions, something I learned 
from Richard Olney and Lulu Peyraud in the wonderful cookbook, "Lulu's 
Provencal Table," (HarperCollins: 1994). The onions caramelize and sweeten the 
whole mixture. The only other vegetable that I cook separately is the eggplant, 
both to develop its flavor and to be able to add it toward the end of cooking 
so that it doesn't end up as mush. This proportion of vegetables can be varied 
according to taste. Make this a day or two ahead; like any stew-like mixture, 
the flavor improves as it stands.  
</P>
<P>
 RATATOUILLE 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds red onions, halved, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 7 small zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch wide by 1 1/2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper, cut into 1-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet yellow pepper, cut into 1-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 1 green pepper, cut into 1-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, seeded, cut into 1-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 3 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium eggplants, unpeeled, cut into 1-inch-square dice 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 tablespoons tomato paste, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon oil in wide, heavy pot. When very hot, add onions. Cook over 
medium heat, covered, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally. After 10 minutes, 
reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, stirring often until onions 
turn light-brown, about 8 to 10 more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add zucchini, peppers, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook 5 minutes, stirring 
often. Add tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme and pepper. Simmer, covered, until just 
about tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning. Check 
often to avoid overcooking (unless you want a very cooked-down, soft mixture). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet. When hot, add 1/2 
of eggplant, sprinkled with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Brown quickly over medium-high 
heat, about 2 to 3 minutes, shaking pan to brown eggplant evenly. Set aside. 
Repeat with remaining eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 When vegetables are almost as tender as desired, add eggplant. Stir well. 
Cook, covered, until eggplant is tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Vegetables 
will continue to cook after they're removed from stove. Cool. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Refrigerate 1 to 2 days before serving. Stir and adjust seasonings to 
taste again, adding tomato paste if necessary. Remove bay leaves. Gently 
reheat, if serving hot. Makes 8 servings.

 Pecorino Romano cheese is made from Sheep's milk; it's dry and appealingly 
sharp in flavor for this pizza. Parmesan can be used instead , but it will be 
more mild and less pungent.  
</P>
<P>
 RATATOUILLE PIZZA BAGELS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon finely minced fresh garlic  
</P>
<P>
 4 fresh plain bagels, split 
</P>
<P>
 2 2/3 cups Ratatouille, roughly chopped and well seasoned to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound shredded soft melting mild cheese, such as Muenster, Monterey Jack 
or mozzarella  
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Roman cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely julienned fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl combine butter and garlic. Spread butter mixture thinly on cut surface 
of bagels, dividing evenly. Place bagels on baking sheet. Spread 1/3 cup 
ratatouille on each bagel. Spread smooth. Top each with 2 tablespoons shredded 
cheese. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon Pecorino Romano cheese over each. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake in lower third of oven at 375 degrees until lightly browned, about 25 to 
30 minutes. Garnish with julienned basil leaves. Let stand 5 minutes before 
serving hot. Makes 8 bagel-pizzas.

 Thin but substantial, these pancakes are delicious for brunch when topped with 
poached eggs, and/or for lunch or supper when reheated with a sprinkling of 
Parmesan cheese and served with a few spoonfuls of your favorite tomato pasta 
sauce. They also work well as an accompaniment to roast meats. They benefit 
from reheating; somehow they become crisper without drying out.  
</P>
<P>
 RATATOUILLE PANCAKES 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 2 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups Ratatouille, drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Grated Parmesan or shredded Muenster cheese, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, baking powder, eggs, salt, oregano and red pepper in food 
processor with metal blade. Pulse processor until ingredients are mixed. Add 
ratatouille. Again, pulse processor until vegetables are finely chopped in 
batter but still with some texture. Do not puree. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 teaspoon each of butter and olive oil in large nonstick griddle. When 
hot and beginning to sizzle, drop batter on griddle, 2 tablespoons at time. Use 
back of spoon to smooth pancakes to 3-inch diameter. Cook over medium heat 
until brown and well set, about 5 minutes. Use spatula to turn. Continue 
cooking until well browned, about 4 minutes more. Pancakes can be made day 
ahead and refrigerated, or frozen up to 2 months, wrapped airtight. Let cool 
completely. Arrange on wax paper-lined baking sheet and cover with foil. 
</P>
<P>
 To reheat, arrange single layer on lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle 
lightly with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees until warmed through, about 7 minutes, 
or slightly longer if frozen. Serve hot or very warm. Makes 16 pancakes, or 4 
main-course servings.

LOW-FAT COOKING: FAUX FAJITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Cakes (Chapters Publishing: 1993; $9.95).

<P>
 True fajitas are charcoal-grilled and are made with a high-fat cut of beef. 
Here we stir-fried low-fat boneless chicken breast in a hot wok -- and it still 
came out nice and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
 To complement the chicken, pick tomatoes that are fully ripe but firm; they 
will give off enough juice for a good sauce. Ground pasilla chile lends a 
wonderfully earthy flavor and rich color to the sauce. Lime juice added just 
before serving gives a pleasant spark of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fajitas are usually spooned into flour tortillas, but we used corn tortillas 
to save on fat grams. Serve these fajitas with nonfat sour cream or yogurt and 
salsa. CHICKEN FAJITAS 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound skinless boneless chicken breast, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Crushed red chile peppers 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 Corn tortillas

<P>
 Spray large wok with non-stick cooking spray. Heat until very hot. Add chicken 
and quickly saute until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from wok and 
keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, spray wok again with non-stick cooking spray. Add garlic, onion, 
green pepper and serrano chile. Saute until vegetables are tender, 3 to 4 
minutes. Add tomatoes and mushrooms. Cook 2 to 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Return chicken to wok. Stir in chile powder. Season to taste with salt and red 
chile peppers. Simmer just until hot. Stir in lime juice. Spoon onto tortillas 
to serve. Fold up taco style to eat. Makes 4 servings.

 DEAR SOS: I flipped over the crab souffle at Rockenwagner's restaurant in 
Santa Monica. What are the chances of having the recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- HOOK 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR HOOK: Good chance. Chef-owner Hans Rockenwagner admits it is a 
complicated recipe for home cooks, but suggests reducing the stress of 
last-minute work by preparing the crab stock and the souffle base in advance 
and keeping them refrigerated until ready to assemble and bake. ROCKENWAGNER'S 
CRAB SOUFFLE

to 3 minutes, stirring, and add milk all at once. Stir vigorously with wire 
whisk until smooth paste is formed. Stir in egg yolks and eggs. Season to taste 
with salt, white pepper and hot pepper sauce. Add Crab Stock. Mix well to form 
smooth thick souffle base.  
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gently fold into warm souffle base. Pour or 
spoon into 2-quart souffle dish that has been well buttered and floured. Place 
souffle dish in roasting pan and place on middle oven rack. Add 1 to 1 1/2 
inches boiling water. Bake at 375 degrees until top is puffy and browned, 20 to 
30 minutes. Serve with Lobster Butter Sauce and garnish with sliced mangoes, if 
desired. Makes 4 servings.

juice, peppercorns, bay leaf, fish stock or clam juice (being careful to avoid 
adding any milky residue from clams). Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 
to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain stock through fine mesh sieve, discarding crab and onion mixture and 
reserving stock. Place stock in clean saucepan and cook over high heat until 
liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Cool stock. Refrigerate and use as needed,

 DEAR SOS: My son always asks for caramel frosting on cake for his birthday, 
but once the caramel frosting did not turn out and I threw the recipe away. Now 
I want it back.  
</P>
<P>
 -- HARRIET 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR HARRIET: You can make heirloom frosting by adding a boiled syrup in a 
thin stream to beaten egg whites. The frosting keeps in the refrigerator for 
several days and can be reconstituted by being beaten again. It's a tricky 
recipe, so use a candy thermometer to assure proper syrup temperature. HEIRLOOM 
BOILED FROSTING 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 2 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in saucepan. Place over moderate heat and 
stir until sugar is dissolved. Continue to boil to soft ball stage (239 degrees 
on candy thermometer on dry day, or 242 degrees on rainy day). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff. Add syrup in thin stream, 
continuing to beat rapidly. Add vanilla and continue to beat until cold and 
stiff enough to hold shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Frosting can be kept in covered jar in refrigerator several days. When ready 
to use, beat in 1/2 teaspoon or so of boiling water to soften frosting. If 
frosting hardens at any stage, beating in boiling water will aid in keeping 
spreadable. Makes enough to frost 3 layers.

3 CHILDREN FOUND WITH DEAD MOTHER; TRAGEDY: THE YOUNGSTERS SURVIVED ALONE FOR 
NEARLY THREE DAYS IN WESTLAKE APARTMENT. THE WOMAN HAD BEEN UNDER A DOCTOR'S 
CARE FOR A HEART CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frightened, confused and apparently convinced at first that their mother "was 
sleeping and didn't want to wake up," three young children survived alone for 
almost three days in a Westlake district apartment as their mother lay dead on 
the floor, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ages 3 years, 2 years, and 5 months, were discovered about 9:45 
a.m. Tuesday after the 3-year-old knocked on the door of a neighbor, who became 
alarmed and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics burst into the reeking apartment in the 500 block of South Bonnie 
Brae Street to find "a 36-year-old woman in an advanced state of 
decomposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the children had 
apparently lived off scraps scavenged from the refrigerator by the 3-year-old. 
Officials said the entire unit was littered with bits of food. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor reported that the eldest boy had told her his mother "had a heart 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said that although the cause of death has not been 
determined, there were no signs of foul play. The woman recently had been under 
the care of a physician, who said he had been treating her for a serious heart 
condition, according to Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their ordeal, the children were in remarkably good condition, Humphrey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle nothing (worse) happened to the children," said a neighbor, 
Bernice Napoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said the youngest child "was in a somewhat dehydrated condition, but 
otherwise all right. The other two . . . were in good condition. It appeared 
that the 3-year-old had been taking care of the others."

<P>
 The children were examined at California Hospital Medical Center and 
transferred to the care of the Department of Children's Services, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the woman and children were withheld pending notification of 
next of kin. Officials said they believed that the children's father was 
arrested several months ago and may be in jail. They said the dead woman may 
have had a sister in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Gallardo, 19, a friend of the victim, said she last saw the woman 
Saturday night when the two paused to talk outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me she was going to have an operation," Gallardo said. "She was 
supposed to call me about an hour later, but she never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliana Saravia, 12, who frequently ran errands for the ailing woman, said she 
too had been concerned. Juliana said she stopped by the apartment Sunday to see 
if everything was all right, but the 3-year-old "told me that she was sleeping 
and didn't want to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, police said, neighbors had begun to complain about the noise from a 
television set that had been blaring in the apartment since Saturday night. 
They also complained about a disagreeable odor that seemed to grow stronger by 
the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 3-year-old alerted the neighbor, paramedics found the woman's body 
sprawled face-down on the floor beside her bed.

COURTROOM CAMERAS: THE ISSUE IS ACCESS; FEDERAL EXPERIMENT IS IN DANGER OF 
EXTINCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As court watchers focus on Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's pending 
decision on whether to ban cameras from his courtroom during the O. J. Simpson 
trial, the plug has quietly been pulled on a promising experiment in televising 
federal civil trials. This is very unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed session last week, the federal Judicial Conference of the United 
States, the policy-making body of the federal courts, voted not to renew a 
three-year pilot project involving cameras in civil trials and proceedings when 
the project closes at year's end. The 27-judge conference voted roughly 2 to 1 
against cameras in their courts. This despite what the Judicial Center, the 
research arm for the federal courts, called favorable results in the 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, 47 states now permit court proceedings to be televised or 
photographed. For a decade now, California has permitted cameras at civil and 
criminal trials if the judge consents. The California Judicial Council's rule 
bars cameras during jury selection and prohibits showing jurors or potential 
jurors, to protect their privacy. (That's why Judge Ito excluded cameras 
Tuesday from the courthouse hallway where jurors from other trials congregate 
during recesses. He did so after pictures of jurors outside his courtroom were 
broadcast.) California's rule also gives judges the authority to ensure that 
television cameras do not interfere with courtroom decorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Are federal trials inherently so different that television would, despite the 
recent experimental evidence to the contrary, undermine the judicial process? 
Or is it more likely that federal judges, who have life tenure, are simply more 
resistant to change in their routines? The federal Judicial Conference should 
reconsider its total ban on cameras. If it doesn't, Congress ought to think 
about making its own rules in this area, something it can do by amending the 
Rules Enabling Act, the law that permits Congress, in some circumstances, to 
reject or modify rules made by the courts.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue obviously has resonance in the case of Simpson, the former football 
star being tried in state court on charges that he murdered his ex-wife and a 
friend of hers. After a disputed KNBC-TV report last week, Ito threatened to 
use the discretion the state Judicial Council grants him to pull the plug on 
television coverage. Ito says he will hold a hearing, still unscheduled, to 
receive arguments on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ire at erroneous media reports regarding this case is 
understandable, but barring cameras would do little to curb excesses. Indeed, 
the reports that have angered Ito, as well as defense and prosecution lawyers, 
involve out-of-court behavior, not courtroom proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who dislike the notion of cameras in court are concerned that 
television's presence would distort the proceedings or perhaps demean the 
solemn task at hand. Some lawyers may indeed play to the camera -- to an 
audience beyond the courtroom -- in ways they wouldn't otherwise. But 
responsible camera coverage is arguably an extension of Americans' right to an 
open trial. And the federal courts, no less than the state courts, belong to 
the people who come before them seeking justice, more than to the judges behind 
the bench.

POLITICAL THIRD PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Survey of Political Leanings Sees Third Party Idea Gaining" (Sept. 21) not 
only shows that the theoretical base of the two major parties is weakening. It 
shows that the current "left-right" spectrum of the political map is hopelessly 
inaccurate. How else could it speculate that there exists potential for a new 
"third" political party consisting of "seculars" (from the left), "new 
independents" and "embittered" (from the center), and "Libertarians" (from the 
right)? Would that third party be "leftist" or "rightist"? 
</P>
<P>
 To be more accurate, political attitudes must also be measured by their slant 
toward more government control versus less government control. For example, 
most so-called "rightists" prefer less government control over economic matters 
and social issues but more government control over matters of personal 
morality. Most leftists tend to be the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 I must therefore object to your characterization of Libertarians as part of 
the "divided right." Libertarians are neither "left" nor "right" because we 
prefer less government control not only in economic and social issues but in 
matters of personal morality as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Libertarian Party is already the third largest political party in the 
United States, and growing, because it attracts increasing numbers of voters 
from all segments of the "left-right" spectrum. Instead of a new party being 
formed, a probable trend is that more Libertarian candidates will be elected.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple. More than any other political party, we stand for the 
basic principles of individual freedom and strictly limited government, 
eloquently defined by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence 
and the Constitution. These principles are neither "left" nor "right." They are 
just basic.

cover the candidates of alternative parties -- Green, American Independent, 
Peace and Freedom and Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The news media and the League of Women Voters do a great disservice in 
presenting to voters only one-third of their choices on the ballot. The voters' 
media-induced misperception that Republicans and Democrats are the only game in 
town has caused the two major parties to become arrogant, unproductive and 
unresponsive to the concerns of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual excuse for this non-coverage and exclusion from debates is that the 
alternative party candidates get so few votes that they do not deserve to be 
seen or heard, but this lack of exposure is the main reason for their inability 
to get votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaffected Republicans and Democrats already have alternatives that have been 
hidden from them for years. The Times should begin taking seriously its 
responsibility to inform the public about all candidates running for public 
office.

</P>
<P>
 The scoop of the decade and you almost missed it. A relatively unknown man 
leads the polls for President after entering the race by popular mandate in 
only a 12-week period of time. That demonstrates a state of dissatisfaction by 
the electorate that is unprecedented. However you still hold to your conviction 
that most of us out here are incapable of dealing with our own destiny by 
posing the question "Will Americans' fundamental common sense keep it in 
check?" Who better to keep our political systems in check than us? 
</P>
<P>
 Please give us credit for at least a modicum of intelligence and 
responsibility. We, the people, are perfectly capable of directing our own 
destiny. However, I do commend you on finally seeing how large numbers of 
citizens have had it and, in the words of Perot, are going to take back our 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not mindlessly going to kick out only incumbents but rather we are 
going to replace the arrogant politicians who do not serve us and see us as 
only sheep to be manipulated at their will. Watch out, boys, democracy is 
coming!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Homeowners Groups a Love-Hate Affair" (Sept. 19): I read your informative 
article with great interest. Members of the board run for election often 
unopposed. Most residents are apathetic and do not attend meetings unless they 
have a personal agenda. More often than not, the directors are untalented. In 
our case, our reserves are too low (28%) and maintenance is less than minimum. 
We have unchecked termite infestation and many of our roofs leak. 
</P>
<P>
 When I questioned our reserves, insurance and code violations, I was booed and 
denounced as a troublemaker. Suggestions to the directors are often defended by 
them with all the tenacity of brittle egos. Keeping assessments low is a badge 
of honor no matter what the cost in delayed maintenance. We have no term 
limitations, and some directors have held office more than eight years. Key 
directors cater to a clique of supporters who receive special favors. 
Investigation revealed secret parties and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenters are punished with citations and have their cars towed away for 
minor infractions. I received $1,500 of citations in one week (while I was out 
of town). 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms, representing the association, are retained by the board. The 
attorneys respond to the directors who hired them. This gives directors 
enormous power to sue, and often the suits, as your article pointed out, are 
ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you going to suggest I move? Some of us have elected not to run but to 
fight.

 * The article presents such a one-sided view that the writer should apologize 
to the thousands of unpaid, hard-working condo dwellers who spend their time 
maintaining property for their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does a homeowner choose to buy into one property instead of another? Could 
it be that the chosen property is well-maintained and has great curb appeal? 
Yes, it's a nuisance not being able to toss that wet towel over the patio 
railing, but what happens to property values when balconies are draped with 
drying laundry or are full of dead plants? 
</P>
<P>
 In listing "petty" rules, how about explaining why the rules might be 
necessary. I know of an association that has a rule requiring approval for 
resurfacing floors on private balconies. One homeowner installed a tiled floor 
without approval or inspection. Unfortunately, water leaked between the tiles 
and rotted not only the homeowner's patio, but also the living room wall of the 
couple downstairs. Of course, the homeowner who flouted the "petty rule" 
expected the association to pay for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer implies that life as a condo owner should be a "care-free" 
existence. In actuality, being a condo owner carries the same responsibilities 
and requires almost as much time as being a single-family homeowner. Yes, there 
are too many rules, but I propose one more: 
</P>
<P>
 "No one shall be allowed to complain unless that person has attended at least 
two board meetings during the year and has spent time each month helping 
maintain the property."

 As confirmed by three separate LAUSD teachers, if a child is 6, 7, 8 or 9 
years old (up to 15) he/she is automatically placed in a class with other 
students of the same age. Whether IQ is 0 or 200.Whether their English is zero 
or better than the teacher's. Never mind if the teacher must then spend a good 
deal of extra time teaching the student how to speak English or understand the 
lessons being taught the other students. Never mind if the other students are 
left reading, writing a lesson or doodling.

 Never mind the increasingly competitive world market. Never mind if a student

UNZ SUPPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the three months since my primary election loss to Gov. Pete Wilson, I 
have learned that a number of my supporters plan to mount a write-in campaign 
on my behalf in November, as an act of protest. Although I am very grateful for 
their continued enthusiasm, I urge them not to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a write-in candidate in November, and any votes for me would be 
absolutely wasted and would not even be counted by election officials. I based 
my campaign on principles and policies, not personalities, and I urge the 
700,000 Californians who voted for me in the primary to go to the polls in 
November and cast their ballots for all those candidates up and down the ticket 
who are true to the core values of the Republican Party -- smaller government, 
lower taxes, and fewer regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 I also hope that my supporters -- including the many Independents, Democrats 
and Libertarians who re-registered Republican in order to vote for me -- will 
remain active in the Republican Party, and help return it to the Reaganite 
principles which once led me and so many young people to join the party in the 
early 1980s.

ONE OF THE DUMBER IDEAS AROUND; LET RUSSIA SELL CHEAP HANDGUNS IN THE UNITED 
STATES? PLEASE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looming just over the horizon as a potential threat to regional peace and 
security is Iran, which has been spending a lot of money buying military 
weapons and technology, including the stuff that could one day help produce 
nuclear arms. As it happens, Russia has been one of Iran's major suppliers, 
selling Tehran's theocratic regime warplanes, tanks, submarines and missile 
technology. These sales are worth about $1 billion a year, no mean amount to a 
country whose export earnings have fallen precipitately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, alert to the possible dangers posed by a still 
aggressively radical Iran, has been urging Moscow to end or severely reduce 
these sales. President Boris N. Yeltsin said in Washington Wednesday that 
Russia would. The United States, in compensation, is thinking about letting 
Russia export to the United States a number, perhaps a large number, of one of 
the few products its factories make besides vodka that seem sure to find eager 
customers in the American market: semiautomatic pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, surely, is one of the dumber ideas in recent memory. That it is even 
being seriously considered is a disheartening comment on the quality of 
creative thinking within the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. importer has applied to sell as many as 7 million Russian firearms. 
The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is less than 
enthusiastic. The State Department, however, thinks that allowing some measure 
of arms imports is a reasonable way to offset Russian hard currency losses if 
arms sales to Iran are in fact cut back. As one official rationalized it to The 
Times, "if we want them to listen to us on issues like Iran, we have to let 
them compete on the world market with products they can sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. But with handguns, in our market? No, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 212 million firearms now extant in the United States -- 
one-third of them handguns -- and with violent crime at the apex of public 
concerns, surely it's evident that the U.S. arms market is saturated and that 
opening the gates to yet more cheaply priced weapons is emphatically not in the 
national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the Clinton Administration who are sympathetic to this bizarre idea 
because they are eager to do Moscow a favor have looked at Russian trade 
figures and asked, "Why not?" What they really ought to be doing is taking 
another look at American homicide figures and asking, "Why?"

 Judicial activism, whether liberal or conservative, is troublesome not so much 
because it is arrogant but because it appears so rational to the activists. But 
one man's reasoning may be another man's Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 A tendency toward conservative activism has been brewing for nearly a decade 
in the California courts; in May, it boiled over in a landmark landlord-rights 
decision from the Court of Appeal, which the state Supreme Court has agreed to 
review.  
</P>
<P>
 The case is one of several being brought by strict Christian landlords across 
the country, challenging laws that protect against housing discrimination based 
on marital status. In holding for the landlord, the appellate court accepted 
religious conviction as a trump over valid laws. 
</P>
<P>
 If the decision is upheld, it could fundamentally alter the balance between 
law and religion, for it would serve as precedent for holding personal 
religious belief higher than obedience to the law. The court's opinion also 
will be a test of whether politically conservative judges mean it when they say 
that their function is to give effect to the Legislature's will. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves the owner of rental property in Chico who says that because 
she believes that sex outside marriage is a sin, she should not have to rent to 
unmarried couples, thus, in the court's words, "facilitating the sin of 
fornication."  
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, this seems to make sense. Religious liberty is one of our most 
cherished rights. But the Court of Appeal failed to address a threshold 
question: Since when is renting apartments the exercise of religion? By failing 
to take up such an obvious and obviously important question, the court 
demonstrates that it is interested in result, not reasoning -- the definition 
of judicial activism. 
</P>
<P>
 No court has ever explained what, if any, limits can be placed on the exercise 
of religion, but the U.S. and California Supreme Courts have always been clear 
that while religious belief is constitutionally protected, as are common 
religious practices such as going to church, religion-based conduct that moves 
into the secular world is not. By uncritically accepting the premise that 
apartment renting constitutes an exercise of religion, the court mocks the 
notion that there is a secular world anywhere and turns civil law into little 
more than an option for religious believers.  
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has clearly noted the way such a rule 
could be abused: Letting the civil law give way too easily to the beliefs of 
religious adherents would effectively grant believers "a private right to 
ignore generally applicable laws," one that has no discernible limiting 
principle. The problem is the subjective nature of belief. There are no 
objective criteria to determine what an individual believes, so as a practical 
matter, courts must accept virtually any assertion of belief without further 
inquiry.  
</P>
<P>
 Viewed superficially, the California appellate decision is a tit-for-tat 
response to liberal activism, allowing religious conservatives to thumb their 
nose at the law the way liberals supposedly have on such issues as the death 
penalty. But the great irony of the free-exercise exemption is that it opens 
the door for claims based on liberal as well as conservative religious beliefs. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Any observer of human behavior can see the attraction in a rule permitting 
people to exempt themselves from the law based on their subjective beliefs. 
People generally do not like having to obey the obligations that law imposes; 
that's why we have laws in the first place. The public good is much easier to 
stomach if only other people have to give something up to make it happen. But 
there will be few "other people" if personal belief entitles anyone to claim an 
exemption from disagreeable laws.  
</P>
<P>
 When religiously motivated conduct moves outside the confines of religious 
ritual, ceremony or practice, and specifically when it moves into the 
commercial marketplace, the rules of secular order must be taken into account. 
As the U.S. Supreme Court has long explained, this does not minimize the 
importance of religious belief in our pluralistic society, it just strikes a 
necessary balance between religious belief and the obligations of citizenship. 
By allowing the term "free exercise of religion" to mean any action by a 
believer, no matter how far removed from religious practice, the Court of 
Appeal took a large step toward making the obligations of citizenship illusory 
and reduced the Legislature to little more than a debating society. That was 
the fear of those who decried liberal judicial activists. It has no less force 
now.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: THE DIRTY SECRET BEHIND PROPOSITION 187; IF WILSON 
WAS SERIOUS ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, HE'D PUT MUSCLE BEHIND THE LABOR LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where are the people who know better? 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be that the governor of this state and other respectable people favor a 
plan of segregation far more onerous than that which existed under George 
Wallace in Alabama? How can they support Proposition 187, which would leave in 
our midst an untouchable subclass of deeply exploited workers who labor as hard 
as any of us, yet who are to be denied the barest means to better their 
condition? What a grotesque standard now championed by the highest officeholder 
of this once progressive and generous state, built on the backs of immigrant 
labor.  
</P>
<P>
 How dare we deny education to the children of women who clean our homes and 
raise our children? 
</P>
<P>
 How dare we deny medical care to those who harvest our crops, clip our lawns 
and golf courses, bus our dishes, wash our cars and every night leave spotless 
the very office towers whose top executives support the governor behind this 
mean proposal? 
</P>
<P>
 What have we come to when a majority of our citizens want to take children and 
their dreams hostage in a crude scheme to uproot their parents? If the goal of 
Proposition 187 is to force deportation, then it would be far more honest to 
simply round up these people and dump them over the borders of Mexico, 
Guatemala, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Canada and the many other countries 
they come from. 
</P>
<P>
 But deportation is not really the goal. The dirty secret in all this is that 
most Californians benefit from the exploitation of immigrant labor. Only two 
days ago, The Times quoted Harry Kubo, a Republican who heads the Nisei Farmers 
League in the San Joaquin Valley, warning that "50%, if not more, of the 
agricultural work force in this valley is illegal. We'd sink economically 
without them."  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the professional couples who can hold down top jobs only 
because an underpaid nanny is holding down the household. Do they care about 
what happens to the nanny's own children if Proposition 187 passes? 
</P>
<P>
 We all know that virtually every restaurant, most construction sites and much 
of the manufacturing sector is staffed by undocumented workers. Victoria 
Bradshaw, the state labor commissioner, estimates that more than 80% of the 
workers in Los Angeles' thriving garment industry are illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is not one word in Proposition 187 about employment of undocumented 
workers or increased fines or jail time for employers who violate existing laws 
on minimum wage, overtime pay, workers' compensation and safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Level the playing field between undocumented and legal workers and, if jobs 
still exist for those here illegally, they should have their status revised 
because they are needed. Ironically, the one program that attempts this was 
started by the Wilson Administration, but it has been starved for funds. The 
Targeted Industrial Program Partnership is a brilliantly executed plan dreamed 
up by Bradshaw and one of her deputies, Jose Millan.  
</P>
<P>
 TIPP teams up inspectors from state Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, 
Cal OSHA and the federal Labor Department who attempt to enforce state and 
federal labor, health and safety laws in the garment industry and agriculture. 
They conducted raids this week in Los Angeles, levying hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fines and carting off goods from cited firms. But TIPP's cases will 
hold up in court only if the workers testify about their pay and work 
conditions. That is why the TIPP inspectors pointedly announce upon entering a 
workplace that they are not from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
lest potential witnesses flee. Passage of Proposition 187 would subvert this 
program by forcing state labor officials to report undocumented witnesses to 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor can't be serious about stopping illegal immigration. If he were, 
he would see to it that TIPP had enough money to field more than the 30 
inspectors who are expected to enforce labor law throughout the entire state. 
And he would stop casting immigrant workers, rather than employers, as the 
villain of the piece.  
</P>
<P>
 I refuse to debate the fine points of Proposition 187 because it is demeaning. 
When I went on freedom rides to the South in the '60s, I did not care to dwell 
on the fine points of Mississippi's system of segregation as compared with 
Alabama's. I just knew in every fiber of my being that segregation was wrong, 
that it rots our souls to have a class of people live among us who are denied 
their essential humanity. Surely the courts will once again determine that 
segregation is unconstitutional. But isn't it sad that some of the people we 
put in high office don't already know that?

PLATFORM; FLUNKING CLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Educational consultant HUGH W. GLENN of Irvine comments on Gov. Wilson's 
rejection of the controversial statewide test, CLAS (California Learning 
Assessment System): 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public school classrooms in California, becoming more culturally and 
ethnically diverse every day, require vastly different instructional programs 
to meet the learning needs of all students. CLAS sought to establish a 
statewide curriculum, a poor substitution.And because the importance of the 
CLAS test superseded any other instructional concern, teachers tried to teach 
students how to score well on CLAS, a misdirected focus. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never necessary to test millions of students every year. If pollsters 
can predict the outcome of a presidential election within a few percentage 
points by quizzing 1,000 voters, it isn't necessary to test several million 
students to see how well they are doing in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, while vetoing CLAS, Wilson also charged the Legislature with adopting a 
new state testing system by spring. Instead, he could breathe life into school 
curriculum and return a bit of local control by permitting schools to adopt 
instructional goals and measures of student achievement that they deem 
appropriate.

COLUMN RIGHT/ ELTON GALLEGLY: A NEW EXERCISE IN FUTILITY FROM THE INS; INSTEAD 
OF REPLACING 1.5 MILLION 'GREEN CARDS,' WE SHOULD BE ISSUING TAMPER-PROOF ID TO 
STEM ILLEGAL HIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELTON GALLEGLY, Rep. Elton Gallegly, a Republican, represents Ventura 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to the U.S. government to once again create a situation that leads 
reasonable, rational people to scratch their heads and marvel at a level of 
lunacy to which precious few can aspire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightly concerned by unacceptable levels of document fraud among immigrants 
working in this country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is in the 
process of summoning 1.5 million resident aliens into INS offices across the 
country and charging them $75 each for new identification cards, commonly known 
as green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to combat fraud is well-intended and appropriate, but there's a 
catch. At a time when the ease of obtaining affordable counterfeit green cards 
for as little as $25 has been clearly established, the INS is going through 
considerable effort and imposing considerable cost to reissue virtually the 
same flawed document. 
</P>
<P>
 Through this process, the INS hopes to recall all of the antiquated, paper 
green cards issued before 1977 and replace them with the "modern" plastic 
counterparts the agency has been issuing for nearly 20 years. The plastic cards 
require a photo, fingerprint and signature -- all of which have yet to baffle 
forgers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is like Ford or GM deciding to recall millions of cars because of some 
evident glitch in their design and then sending inconvenienced and irritated 
customers home with the same faulty vehicle. Corporate executives find 
themselves banished for these kind of decisions; bureaucrats build careers on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 What's particularly galling is that the INS is staging a massive operation to 
reissue Edsels at a time when there is a growing chorus of voices crying out 
for Lincolns and offering the blueprints that could build them. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few sessions of Congress, I have repeatedly introduced bills to 
replace the current INS cards with a counterfeit-resistant version.  
</P>
<P>
 But whenever anyone tries to voice the obvious need to protect the integrity 
of a document now easily forged all over Los Angeles, the sincerity of that 
concern is undermined by the creepy notion of a "national ID card" and 
unsettling references to Nazi Germany, "thought police" and storm troopers 
rousing law-abiding citizens out of bed and demanding to see their papers. 
</P>
<P>
 These images can and should be terrifying. But these images also have nothing 
whatever to do with improving the quality of documents issued to immigrants who 
want to live and work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never supported the creation of a new, national identification card for 
issuance to American citizens. The truth is we already have national ID cards 
-- they are our Social Security cards and they function more than adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 What I have proposed is simply improving the integrity of a document we 
currently issue in one specific situation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no coincidence that the landmark immigration legislation of modern 
times, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, has failed largely 
because we have not given American employers the means to determine with any 
degree of certainty whether the immigrant workers they hire have any legal 
right to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we tell employers it is OK to hire one group of people, illegal to 
hire another and then balk at giving them the tools necessary to know the 
difference? 
</P>
<P>
 As the flood of illegal immigration becomes of increasing concern to both 
Democrats and Republicans, it would seem that we could take one positive and 
relatively simple step to ensure that when employers hire immigrant workers, 
they are able to know precisely with whom they are dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at a time when the American government is unable to decide whether 
a better form of immigrant identification is possible, the nation that provides 
a good deal of our immigrant population has already used the technology we 
continue to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about possible voter fraud in its recent elections, the Mexican 
government issued all citizens a voting card that employs several 
tamper-resistant features, including a photo, a hologram, an invisible bar code 
and a fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who has obtained a counterfeit green card -- the same kind 
available on street corners in Los Angeles and across America -- I anxiously 
await the day when the INS will see the wisdom in rendering that document 
obsolete by issuing a replacement not so easily obtainable.

 Bobby Hurley testified in Sacramento County Superior Court that he remembers 
only "bits and pieces" of the collision that almost killed him last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley, the first-round draft choice of the Sacramento Kings last year, blamed 
the other motorist for the crash. Hurley said he saw no traffic when he pulled 
onto a dark road near Arco Arena after a basketball game last Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was through the midst of the intersection, in a split second, I noticed 
maybe a taillight, but definitely not headlights, and I knew I was going to be 
struck then," Hurley told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Wieland's station wagon was traveling at about 55 m.p.h. when Hurley's 
four-wheel drive vehicle turned into Wieland's path, attorneys said. Hurley, 
23, was not wearing a seat belt. He was thrown into a drainage ditch and 
suffered multiple injuries. International Sports

 Nearly a year after it was proposed by Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne, 
Gov. Zell Miller approved plans for a downtown park as a festive gathering spot 
during the 1996 Games. Promising that the park will be privately funded, Gov. 
Miller said he authorized state officials to begin acquiring land and 
developing the $50-million, 60-acre Centennial Olympic Park. 
</P>

 Located in what is now a rundown section of downtown Atlanta between Georgia 
Tech and the Georgia World Congress Center, the park will be an international 
showpiece where thousands of visitors can mingle, watch the Games on huge video 
screens, buy souvenirs and eat.

<P>
 Mexican stocks plunged Wednesday after the secretary general of Mexico's 
ruling party, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting -- coming after the March assassination of the ruling party's 
initial presidential candidate and a rebel uprising in the southern state of 
Chiapas in January -- rattled investors hoping that last month's elections 
would put an end to the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa stock market index dropped as much as 3.1% before recovering. The 
index closed down 53.61 points, or 1.9%, at 2,764.82, its lowest level in two 
weeks. In the United States, American depositary receipts of Telefonos de 
Mexico were the second-most active issue, falling 1 1/8 to 63 1/4. The Mexican 
peso also fell, weakening to 3.398 pesos to the dollar in late trading, from 
3.387 yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. stocks rallied Wednesday amid continued relief that the Federal 
Reserve Board did not raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were also boosted by so-called window dressing prior to the end of the 
third quarter. At the end of fiscal quarters, fund managers often buy stocks 
that have been strong performers to improve the looks of their portfolios.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.14 points to 3,878.18, posting its 
third consecutive increase. Unlike the market rallies posted Monday and 
Tuesday, which were led by blue-chip issues, Wednesday's increases were 
broad-based.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Dow fell more than 100 points on expectations that the Fed 
would raise rates for the sixth time this year at its Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting Tuesday, but the panel took no action.  
</P>
<P>
 While many economists expect an increase, they said it now appears unlikely 
before the November elections unless a sharp drop in unemployment is announced 
Oct. 7 or the Fed sees other fresh signs of inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury market dismissed a potentially inflationary report on durable 
goods, thanks mostly to a strong dollar and a successful auction of five-year 
notes.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond yield fell to 7.81%. The Commerce Department said orders to 
U.S. factories for big-ticket durable goods soared 6% in August -- the biggest 
rise in nearly two years -- after a sharp drop the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said the United States won't impose broad-based 
trade sanctions against Japan even if talks this week don't achieve all the 
desired goals for opening Japanese markets. In New York, the dollar rose to 
98.85 from 98.12 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Among the Dow 30 components, Caterpillar rose 1 5/8 to 54 5/8, AlliedSignal 
advanced 1 1/8 to 35 1/4 and DuPont climbed 7/8 to 58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cincinnati Milacron rose 2 1/2 to 26 after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock 
and raised its estimates of 1994 earnings, saying the company's restructuring 
efforts should improve margins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antec, a maker of equipment for the cable television industry, sank 5 3/4 to 
26 1/4 on the Nasdaq after it said its third-quarter results will be below 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aside from the Mexican market, overseas stock markets were higher. London 
equities finished sharply higher. The FTSE-100 index, which rose 8.7 points 
Tuesday, closed 30.2 points higher at 3,038.7. The Frankfurt DAX index closed 
up 9.38 points at 2,068.11. After post-bourse trading, it stood at 2,070.36, up 
13.47. Tokyo stocks ended slightly firmer after a quiet session. Buying by 
public pension and insurance funds coupled with a technical rebound after 
Tuesday's steep declines pushed up prices. The 225-share Nikkei average 
finished up 38.71 points, or 0.20%, at 19,507.60.

LOUISIANA GAMBLING INDUSTRY MIRED IN CONTROVERSY; CASINOS: POLITICS, UNEVEN 
REGULATION AND THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF RIVERBOAT AND LAND ESTABLISHMENTS 
PUT STATE TAX REVENUE AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who would have thought that there would be a casino boom in staunchly 
conservative Mississippi rather than in Louisiana, where games of chance are as 
much a part of the state's lore as Mardi Gras and Cajun cuisine? 
</P>
<P>
 The South's gambling bonanza is now the almost exclusive province of 
Mississippi, as 32 casinos take in floods of tourists along the Gulf Coast and 
the Mississippi River. A new casino opens in Mississippi about every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across the border, Louisiana has eight riverboat casinos. Four are 
pulling in Texans in droves, but four in the New Orleans area are at the center 
of a controversy over dockside gambling that could cost the state millions of 
dollars in tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 And the crown jewel of Louisiana gambling -- the world's largest land casino, 
planned for downtown New Orleans -- has been delayed by fighting among the 
state and the city and competing groups of investors with political ties to 
Gov. Edwin W. Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bickering goes on, Mississippi casino parking lots are full of 
license plates from the Bayou State. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? Analysts provide a variety of reasons: politics, uneven 
regulation and a concept -- building just one big land casino in New Orleans -- 
that was outdated as soon as Mississippi put up its first dockside casino. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nancy Todd, a consultant specializing in pro-gambling campaigns, put it 
recently, Louisiana's gambling industry should be studied carefully by other 
states considering casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a shining example of how to do it," Todd told a national gambling 
industry conference in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Louisiana legalized 15 riverboat casinos in 1991, during the 
Administration of then-Gov. Buddy Roemer, the state's gambling business has 
been in a start-and-stop mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards put the riverboats on hold immediately after taking office in 1992 
when he refused to appoint a regulatory commission. He then pushed the New 
Orleans land casino through the Legislature before allowing the riverboats to 
sail. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Edwards was impatient to get the land casino going, delays have 
stalled the project. The city gave the lease for the permanent casino site to a 
group headed by developer Christopher Hemmeter, while the state casino 
commission chose a group of 10 Louisiana investors and the Harrah's casino 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the two groups formed Harrah's Jazz Co. and promised to have a 
temporary casino open by Christmas, 1993. The latest opening date: sometime 
between March and May, 1995, provided the partnership can sell enough bonds to 
finance the $730-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury in Baton Rouge has spent nearly a year investigating the 
riverboat industry, although state prosecutors have refused to say specifically 
what is being studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has appeared before the jury, along with his son, attorney 
Stephen Edwards, who has drawn sharp criticism for representing riverboat 
companies, and various friends of the governor who have riverboat interests. So 
far, no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the question of dockside gambling, on boats that are tethered to 
docks, allowing gamblers to come and go as they please, much as they do at a 
land casino and as they do at Mississippi casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana law only specifically allows dockside gambling in Shreveport-Bossier 
City, near the Texas border. Under the riverboat law, other boats -- including 
the New Orleans-area boats -- are supposed to sail. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrah's Jazz Co. has a 30-year pact with the state that includes a guarantee 
that it will have an absolute monopoly on land-based gambling. State law says 
that if that monopoly is breached, the casino operator can refuse the state its 
share of the proceeds -- a minimum of $100 million a year that is being counted 
on to balance future state budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Riverboat Gaming Commission -- a separate regulatory panel from the 
one that governs the land casino -- agreed in June to allow all riverboats 
unlimited dockside gambling when the boats are grounded by bad weather or 
unsafe sailing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, one New Orleans-area riverboat has stayed at port, saying its 
channel has been declared unsafe for sailing. Another is docked at night, 
citing heavy traffic on the Mississippi River. A third has never sailed, saying 
heavy barge traffic on its canal makes travel unsafe. The fourth is staying at 
the dock until nearby power lines coming off the water can be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the now-stationary riverboats are better able to compete with 
their counterparts across the border in Mississippi -- and, one day, with the 
New Orleans land casino, which could end up withholding tax revenue from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverboat operators are beaming at their 10% to 12% additional monthly haul. 
The July handle was $58.7 million, of which $10.8 million went to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrah's, seeing its potential business siphoned away, is glowering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be watchful of boats that are not sailing," Harrah's 
spokesman Bob Dowd promised. "We'll take appropriate action if it's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-gambling activist C.B. Forgotston says that without quick action, the 
state is headed for trouble. "There's little doubt that Harrah's will be taking 
the state to court in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Emile Bruneau, who represents New Orleans, agrees that the state is 
in trouble. He said that the single land casino concept -- which Edwards first 
pushed during the 1980s, when Mississippi competition was not considered even 
remotely possible -- is outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the specific reasons I voted against the (land) casino law," he 
said. "I felt then and I feel today we would be better off with several smaller 
casinos. You can see that today in Mississippi. . . . I think we're going to 
have trouble with the big casino. It's just too overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts support the Louisiana strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Nelson Rose, a professor of law at Whittier College School of Law in Los 
Angeles and an analyst of state gambling regulatory systems, said that 
Louisiana was right in refusing to allow the marketplace to decide how many 
casinos should be built, as in Mississippi. In that state, there will be an 
inevitable casino bust cycle as the industry overexpands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But solving the current conflicts in Louisiana will not be easy or painless, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you certainly cannot start with a clean slate," Rose said. 
"There's probably nothing that can be done without hurting some operators and 
probably the state."

BODY SHOP FLAP REVEALS CHALLENGES OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING; STOCKS: 
ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT THERE MAY BE NO SUCH THING AS A TOTALLY ETHICAL 
COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If ever there were a politically correct company, the Body Shop should have 
fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based company made a name for itself scouring the Earth for 
non-polluting, environmentally sound cosmetics. It shuns animal testing and 
tries as much as possible to patronize vendors from economically needy nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Body Shop, virtually synonymous with socially conscious investment, 
has found itself in the middle of a tempest over claims that it fudged its 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal points out some of the pitfalls of "pure" investing, say experts 
in the field. Indeed, some say, there may be no such thing as a totally ethical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 For those investors who choose stocks on the basis of the company's 
environmental record, promotion of women and minorities or involvement in the 
underdeveloped world, selecting is a very subjective activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the Body Shop stems from an article in the 
September/October issue of a small Minneapolis-based magazine, Business Ethics, 
that alleged the company falls short of its stated goals as a socially 
responsible business. 
</P>
<P>
 The article questioned the quality of the Body Shop's products, its relations 
with its franchisees and its role as a corporate philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop, with numerous stores dotting the United States, has launched an 
offensive, threatening to sue the article's author for libel and questioning 
the veracity of just about every judgment the article makes. 
</P>
<P>
 For investment advisers who specialize in socially conscious investment, the 
claims have created a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the perennial problem that any social investor has to face," said 
John Shultz of Ethical Investments in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some social situation changes. . . . Some good and green (company) throws 
stuff in the river or locks out the work force," he said, leading to 
re-evaluations of a stock's worth to politically correct investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid value judgments that are too subjective, the experts rate the 
companies versus each other. That's one approach. Another is to look for honest 
efforts at improvement -- an overall responsiveness to a given problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regarding the Body Shop, any recommendation wouldn't be positive or negative. 
But we would say that relative to other companies, they score well," said Steve 
Doyott of the Council on Economic Priorities. To his group, which provides 
research services to politically motivated investors, a socially responsible 
company is rated for investment purposes only relative to other companies in 
the same industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While some worry that the Body Shop may have slipped up, it remains a favorite 
of some fund managers. Within the networks of "socially responsible 
entrepreneurs," there were no dark rumors about the company, said Amy Domini, 
founder of the Domini Social Equity Fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as though any problems were more a result of sloppiness and 
highhandedness" than a concerted attempt to mislead the public, the investment 
community and consumers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Body Shop's aggressive response to the article's claims also raised 
some eyebrows in the ethical investment community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read the article," said Carla Mortonson of the Social Investment Fund. "I'm 
really sorry (the Body Shop) felt they couldn't act with a kind of openness. . 
. . Maybe it's more appropriate in the U.K. than in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, companies -- even unpopular ones -- that have responded well to 
mishaps get high marks from fund advisers. Union Carbide Corp. hit a low mark 
for corporate America with its Bhopal, India, disaster in the 1980s, but it has 
shown concern in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Union Carbide is a (expletive deleted) company, but Union Carbide is making 
efforts, great pains with its P.R. people, maybe because it wants to right past 
wrongs," said Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a former bad guy becomes a good person," the company finds a place on 
ethical investors' lists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While small in comparison to the vast world of stock investing, so-called 
socially responsible investing accounted for more than $600 million in 1992, 
according to the trade organization Social Investment Forum. The backer of 
socially responsible investing hopes cases like the Body Shop highlight the 
need for a review process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socially responsible investing" is not an oxymoron, said the trade group's 
executive director, Carla Mortonson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is a just and sustainable society -- to do this through the use of 
capital," she said from the group's Boston office. "We don't look at socially 
responsible investing as black and white. Everyone is on a continuum." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Body Shop, which is traded in Britain, questions 
surrounding the company could lead some investors away but be irrelevant to 
others. The London Times reported that the ethical investment group Eiris 
supported the Body Shop despite the flap over the Business Ethics article. 
</P>
<P>
 "Body Shop has been compared with perfection, rather than with other 
companies," Eiris said. "The practical question for both ethical investors and 
consumers remains 'If not Body Shop, then who?' "

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS': BOUQUET OF EMPATHY AND HONESTY; DIRECTOR MICHAEL ROSS 
DELIVERS THE PLAY'S SINCERITY AND REALISM WITH WELL-DEFINED TEMPOS AND SOLID 
BALANCE AMONG A STRONG CAST.

 It's very hard not to like the women in "Steel Magnolias." Sharply drawn, they 
share a sense of humor and have a lot of fun even when they are bickering. 
Their touching, eventually heartbreaking story takes place in Truvy's Beauty 
Spot, a garage salon in Chinquapin, La., where old friends and neighbors chew 
over the sometimes oddball events of their daily lives. This isn't Tennessee 
Williams country, or Faulkner's or Willa Cather's, but it's just as real. 
</P>
<P>
 The keys to Robert Harling's play are its sincerity and its realism, and at 
the Garden Grove Community Theatre, director Michael Ross understands that. His 
tempos are well-defined, and he has maintained a solid balance among the 
kaleidoscope of personalities. He realizes that the play belongs to young bride 
Shelby, and he builds it around Jacqueline Burnett's strong performance. 
Burnett is bright and witty as the diabetic who has been told about the dangers 
of childbirth but who refuses to let them interfere with her happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea La Vela is very strong as Shelby's sharp-edged but adoring mother, 
M'Lynn. In the final scene, her emotional control is remarkable: Even at her 
most wrenching, she remains gentle and affirming. 
</P>
<P>
 As Annelle, a confused new salon employee, Rae Ruff is very effective too; her 
use of detail and delicate shading beautifully form a characterization that is 
real and truthful. Annelle's bubbling enthusiasm for her newfound religion is 
not ridiculed in Ruff's performance, as it has been by some actresses. When the 
other women kid Annelle about it, her own soft amusement strikes just the right 
emotional tone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Carole Hennessy gets close to overplaying raucous salon owner Truvy, she 
never steps over the line, and winds up with a solid portrait of an 
ever-cheerful wife of a genuine couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary McLean holds in the reins on the outrageous Ouiser, the town character 
who asserts that she isn't crazy, she has "just been in a bad mood for 40 
years." Carol Louise, as the widow of the town's ex-mayor who forges ahead with 
her life by buying the local radio station and doing sports color, shows 
similar restraint and puts a nice edge on her character's will to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Written like a piece of music, "Magnolias" has to be performed that way. Ross 
has conducted his sextet accordingly, and each member plays with empathy and 
honesty. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; EARHART MUSICAL IN LONG BEACH SIMPLY SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There would seem to be at least one stumbling block to writing a musical about 
Amelia Earhart's last flight: Wouldn't a good chunk of the action have to take 
place in a small plane, high over the Pacific Ocean? 
</P>
<P>
 In the world premiere production of "Bird of Quintain" at California Repertory 
Theatre, that block has been removed neatly via a simple expedient: The piece 
has been shaped as a sort of staged oratorio. But don't let that mislead you. 
The simplicity of the staging only adds to the tension and gives the play a 
sense of space and dimension that greater size probably could not. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the play's central concept is intriguing. It pairs the fated 
aviatrix with a humanized version of a medieval jousting device -- the Bird of 
Quintain, which eventually unseated even the most stalwart knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quintain" is the brainchild of book writer and lyricist Howard Burman and 
director Joanne Gordon, with music by Rob Woyshner. For dramatic purposes, they 
have done away with Earhart's co-pilot and navigator, Fred Noonan, and have 
blamed her disappearance partly on a fabrication, her decision with her 
husband, publisher George Putnam, to remove a piece of radio equipment from the 
plane. That's fine (even though Earhart was in radio contact at each stopover, 
the last being Lae, New Guinea). Burman and Gordon's telling is tight, 
theatrical and impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical accuracy is not as important as the production's flaws, few 
though they may be. There are some unintentionally and unfortunately amusing 
lyrics that might be reconsidered ("She's Amelia, and you can feel-ya got a 
tiger by the tail"), and the last scene definitely should be rethought. It 
defies logic, in spite of its fantasy form, and weakens what could be a 
powerful finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The storytelling recitative (there is no spoken dialogue) sometimes sounds 
Sondheimesque but nevertheless pales whenever Woyshner's more original ideas 
blossom. The haunting title song, the lovely and powerful ballad "My Songs" 
(sung by Sheri Nichols as Earhart in a bronze-patinaed soprano), the stirring 
"The Shadow's Growing Longer" and "You Are My Only Love," sung richly by Robert 
Barker as Putnam, are especially outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Paul is strong as the aeronautical liaison between the soaring Amelia and 
her earthbound, anxious but optimistic husband, and the sharp, well-tempered 
edge of Danny Bolero's tenor lends individuality to his performance as the 
tuxedoed Quintain. One of the show's best moments is his "The Final Dance," as 
he caresses and seduces Earhart to her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bird of Quintain" is a compact and attractive piece of work, compelling in 
its ideas. And director Gordon has provided it with energy and insight that 
artfully manage Earhart's eerie solitude throughout as counterpoint to the 
media-goaded frenzy below.

THE WELL-DRESSED BEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have recently become more aware of the enormous health benefits of eating 
beans. Beans are an excellent low-fat, low-cholesterol source of protein, are 
rich in fiber and contain many other nutrients. In the Food Guide Pyramid, the 
United States Department of Agriculture's guidelines for healthful eating, 
beans are recommended as a substitute for meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we would like to include beans more often in menus, for many of us 
with busy schedules there is no time to soak and cook beans since this process 
requires several hours. The solution is to use canned beans. With a little 
dressing up, they can make tasty, satisfying dishes. Basically all they need is 
a few fresh vegetables, a sprinkling of fresh herbs and perhaps a touch of 
spice. A savory, colorful enhancement for beans is a mixture of sauteed onions, 
sweet red and green peppers and fresh tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite ways to season beans is to use the Middle Eastern flavor 
combination of cumin, garlic and cilantro, which also happens to be popular in 
Spanish Caribbean cooking. Actually the connection is not so surprising. These 
flavorings were probably brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish, who had 
learned about them from the Moors, who earlier had ruled Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lebanese specialty calls for beans cooked with sauteed onions, ground 
coriander and tomato paste. Just make the flavoring mixture, add the beans and 
heat briefly together, as in the following recipe for Lebanese white beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I like to start with the most basic form of canned beans, packed in water with 
salt. When a low-salt version is available, I use it; I'd rather add salt at 
the end if it's needed than start with beans that might be too salty. I avoid 
canned beans that are already spiced because they sometimes have overpowering 
amounts of sugar or vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following recipes you can use black beans, pinto beans, red beans, 
Great Northern beans or garbanzo beans. Using different beans will change the 
character and color of the finished dish but they will all taste good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This colorful dish is very versatile. Serve it as a main course or side dish 
or, with a dash of lime or lemon juice or herb vinegar, as a satisfying salad.  
</P>
<P>
 CUBAN BLACK BEANS WITH PEPPERS AND RICE 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 2 green or sweet red peppers, or 1 of each, cut into strips 
</P>
<P>
 4 garlic cloves, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 1 large ripe tomato or 2 canned plum tomatoes, diced 
</P>
<P>
 1 (15- or 16-ounce) can black beans, drained 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups cooked white rice 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, green onions or parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Hot pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large saute pan over medium heat. Add onion and green peppers. 
Saute 7 minutes. Add garlic and cumin and cook, stirring, over low heat 1 
minute. Add tomato, beans, 1/4 cup water and season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Stir and bring to boil. Cover and simmer until sweet peppers are 
tender, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle rice into pan. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring as little as 
possible, until heated through. Add as much of remaining 1/4 cup water as 
needed if mixture is dry. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons cilantro. Mix in gently with 
fork. Cover and let stand 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with hot pepper 
sauce. Serve sprinkled with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. 
Adjust seasonings to taste. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This easy bean dish is flavorful but not hot, warming and hearty but not 
heavy. I sometimes add 1/4 pound "light" Kielbasa sausage in slices and heat 
them with the beans.  
</P>
<P>
 LEBANESE WHITE BEANS 
</P>
<P>
 2 (15- or 16-ounce) cans Great Northern or other white beans, drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Place drained beans in medium saucepan. Mix tomato paste with 1/4 cup water. 
Add to beans. Add coriander, cumin and season to taste with salt, pepper and 
cayenne. Bring to simmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile heat oil in heavy skillet. Add onions and saute over medium heat, 
stirring often, until deeply browned, about 8 minutes. Add to pan of beans. 
Cover and heat gently 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste . Serve hot. Makes 
3 to 4 servings.

WESTSIDE WATCH: IN SANTA MONICA, NO SUCH THING AS A STRANGE BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a decade, a pair of emus, distant relatives of the ostrich, have 
resided in a run-of-the-mill Santa Monica neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 We found that strange because emus are native to Australia. But the owner, a 
resident of Santa Monica for 75 years who declined to give her name, finds it 
bizarre if not annoying that people would gawk at her collection of birds, 
which also includes geese and canaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to gather information was like a trip through the looking glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you have an emu?" we asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did it come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 "An egg," she replied, deadpan. Suddenly, the male attacked the female. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't the male and female get along?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about it," she retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, when do they get along?" we rephrased. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mating season?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must think this is strange, right? We walked down the block and found 
some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, do you find it strange that two emus live up the street?" we asked a 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Why? Strange is something you haven't seen before. Those emus have lived 
here longer than I have," the neighbor said, looking at us quizzically. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor said the emus "are great." 
</P>
<P>
 "My baby loves to go watch them and he says, 'Hello, emus!' " 
</P>
<P>
 More evidence that just about anything goes in Santa Monica.

 POLL PUNDITRY: Attorney David Barrett Cohen's campaign was crowing this week 
about a new poll that shows he's within 8 percentage points of state Sen. Ralph 
C. Dills (D-El Segundo), whose 28th Senate District includes Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 But politics is a game of expectations, and Dills' campaign says their man is 
thrilled as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, commissioned by the Cohen campaign, showed 29% of the voters would 
select Dills, 21% would pick Cohen and 42% were undecided. The survey of 350 
registered voters in the district has a 4% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that whatever support Dills does have is very soft," said Cohen, who 
lives in Redondo Beach. "He is tremendously vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Of those voters considered most likely to make it to the polls, the survey 
showed Cohen within 2 points of Dills. Dills got 28%, Cohen 26%; 42% were 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even sent out my first piece of mail yet," Cohen said. "People are 
giving me the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' campaign coordinator, Tim Mock, didn't comment on the survey of the 
most likely voters. But he was encouraged by the 29% to 21% overall spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good news for us," he said. "We're 8 points ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 He expects the gap to widen once Dills steps up his campaign. Reapportionment 
carved up the old Gardena-area district of the 84-year-old incumbent, who has a 
legal and judicial career dating to 1938. His district now covers new territory 
of Torrance, the South Bay beach cities and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to win by substantially higher margins," Mock said.

THE SIP THAT'S HIP; TRENDS: WITH HIGH-QUALITY COFFEE IN DEMAND, MICRO-ROASTING 
OUTLETS ARE PROLIFERATING. THEY EMPHASIZE PREMIUM BLENDS AND MAXIMUM FRESHNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUISE YARNALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As customers stroll in to buy their morning coffee at Caffe Latte in the 
mid-Wilshire district, they are surrounded by images of Third World coffee 
plantations and European cafe society. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlap sacks of raw, pale-green beans are piled by the door. A few steps from 
the cash register, coffee roaster James Marcotte dumps some beans into the 
funnel of a gleaming, steaming European-style roaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcotte is micro-roasting, the practice of roasting small quantities of 
coffee beans for maximum freshness -- and the hottest trend in the 
coffee-drinking world. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way coffee should be done, say micro-roasters, who believe that 
the flavor of coffee beans dramatically declines -- as much as 60% -- within 
two weeks after roasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Consumers) think that fresh ground is fresh coffee," said Orange County 
micro-roaster Martin Diedrich. "That's like saying the shelf life of bread 
begins when you slice it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently coffee lovers have been waking up to the difference. Coffeehouses 
that specialize in micro-roasted brew have become one of the decade's hottest 
niche businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although coffee drinking has been on the decline for more than 30 years 
throughout the United States, the market for specialty, or gourmet coffees, has 
taken off, particularly on the Westside. Since the late 1970s, such sales have 
grown from a near 0% share of the national market to nearly a third.  
</P>
<P>
 By 2000, forecasters expect half of the estimated 125 million American coffee 
drinkers will be drinking specialty coffees -- decaf, flavored and gourmet, 
said David Dallis, president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America. The 
number of micro-roasters is expected to nearly quadruple in the 1990s, to about 
1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the industry of the '90s," said Diedrich, whose family manufactures 
coffee roasting machines. Sales have gone from a trickle to a flood in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's kind of like a Gold Rush," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers say the micro-roasted coffees taste better, are relatively 
affordable -- between $8.50 to $12 a pound -- and drinking them at coffeehouses 
offers a "bar experience" without the alcohol, Dallis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storefronts with on-site roasters valued between $12,000 and $25,000 have 
sprung up throughout the Westside -- there are several in mid-Wilshire, Beverly 
Hills, Santa Monica and Marina del Rey -- as well as in the west San Fernando 
Valley and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation has been both welcomed and scorned by veteran roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of pretenders and impostors in the business," said Diedrich, 
who has been roasting for about a decade. "You have to know coffee. This is a 
tough business. You're making your money a (cup) at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 When Alan Chemtob opened the Coffee Emporium in Marina del Rey in 1979, he was 
one of the only roaster-retailers in the city. In the past three years, as 
several competitors opened on the Westside, he has begun to worry about the 
quality of the coffee and the motives of those who have jumped into the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of romance that goes with coffee," Chemtob said. "A lot of 
places don't have that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Micro-roasters take pride in their craft. They precisely label the origins of 
their coffee beans, right down to the names of the estates on which they were 
grown. To refine their art, they practice "cupping," an elaborate method of 
testing the brew akin to wine tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Roasting is a subtle craft, where seconds make the difference between a 
moderate "city" roast and a dark espresso.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a world of so much anguish and pain, these are really inexpensive 
pleasures," said Diane Pomerance, a documentary filmmaker and micro-roaster 
devotee who was buying a couple of bags at the Coffee Roaster in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcotte, who co-owns City Bean Coffee in Westwood Village, says the expansion 
of Starbucks Coffee, the Seattle-based chain, educated customers and primed the 
market for micro-roasters: Many customers who didn't know much more about 
coffee than Juan Valdez and Sanka a few years ago can today tell the difference 
between a coffee from Ethiopia and one from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 After Starbucks, many coffee patrons move on to the tiny shops of the 
micro-roasters, said Richard M. Healy of the Coffee Roaster. Healy, a former 
corporate banker, opened his shop eight years ago. In those days, he was a 
pioneer -- the city inspectors didn't know what to make of his Diedrich 
roaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first two years, virtually no one but a few Europeans came. Then, 
after a regional magazine did an article on Healy's business, sales took off. 
Today, his clientele runs the gamut -- from plumbers and bus drivers to movie 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Caffe Latte, Marcotte watches the beans spinning in the roaster turn 
from green to beige to deep brown through a tiny circular window. Marcotte 
roasts the beans twice a week, pound after pound for up to five hours each day. 
It can be tedious work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like doing the laundry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first crackling sound, Marcotte pulls a slender trowel out of the drum 
and inspects a few of the beans. He waits another couple of minutes, and then, 
at the second crackling sound, releases the finished roast in a fragrant, 
steaming waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other micro-roasters, Marcotte gladly shares expert tidbits about a 
coffee's origins. A Kenyan grind, for example, might have picked up its tangy 
flavor from the lemon trees ringing the coffee estate. A Costa Rican grind 
might come from an estate that pays its workers well, provides health care and 
helps to preserve rain forest wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, such discussions can be laid on a bit thick. Diedrich recalls 
the competitor who told a customer that he charged $5 more for his Jamaican 
Blue Mountain roast because it grew "higher on the mountain" than Diedrich's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With micro-roasting increasing in popularity, can home roasters be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 It's too soon to tell. But Marcotte says that City Bean is getting more 
requests for raw coffee beans, especially since one customer relayed a tip 
about their availability to his friends on the computerized Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 But, judging from the recent lunchtime crowd at Caffe Latte, the finer points 
of roasting still remain way above the taste buds of most coffee drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Baxter sipped a cup while reading a newspaper. He had no idea what 
country, much less which estate, it came from. Nor did he care. He drank the 
coffee because, he explained in his best Maxwell House voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just taking a sip of it and I thought, 'Wow, that's great! That's what 
it's supposed to taste like!' "

BLOOMINGDALE'S NARROWS SITES TO BEVERLY HILLS, CENTURY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of shopping for a Westside location for its West Coast flagship 
store, upscale retailer Bloomingdale's has narrowed its decision to sites in 
Beverly Hills and Los Angeles -- and for the moment, at least, Beverly Hills 
appears to have the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities have been battling to win over the department store and the jobs -- 
Los Angeles officials estimate 600 to 1,000 -- and other economic perks it 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's Chairman Michael Gould said in an interview this week that the 
retailer was "leaning towards" Beverly Hills, but stressed that a decision was 
still weeks away and talks were continuing with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Beverly Hills) has to come out. . . . It has to be a good deal," said Gould, 
who once headed the Robinsons department store chain and Giorgio of Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is an estimated $1 million-plus in sales tax revenue, not to mention 
the cachet of having what the ritzy New York retailer says will be its grandest 
store outside of Manhattan. Bloomingdale's is looking at sites on Beverly Drive 
in Beverly Hills and either in or near the Century City Market Place mall in 
Los Angeles. It plans to open the store in March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 250,000-square-foot store is the first of three Bloomingdale's 
planned for Los Angeles and Orange counties. Owned by Cincinnati-based 
Federated Department Stores, it will be Bloomingdale's first foray on the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles and Beverly Hills said Bloomingdale's initiated informal 
discussions about potential sites in the early part of the year. But since 
then, Beverly Hills has apparently grabbed the lead in the race to secure the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, the city had held two formal negotiating sessions with 
Bloomingdale's, while Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's office has 
characterized that city's meetings with the retailer only as discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Further buoying Beverly Hills' hopes is the fact that Federated is in escrow 
for the privately-owned parcels adjacent to the city property Bloomingdale's 
wants. The city-owned site is a parking lot in the 200 block between North 
Beverly and North Canon drives. It is a few blocks north of the row of upscale 
department stores lining Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould said, however, that the property in escrow could be sold or used for 
another purpose if Bloomingdale's can't reach agreement with city officials for 
the city-owned parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Century City, Bloomingdale's is said to be interested in a large vacant 
piece of property south of the Century City Market Place mall and across 
Constellation Boulevard from another Federated-owned store, Bullock's. Gould 
said Bloomingdale's would also consider buying space within the mall, although 
Los Angeles' officials discussing the Constellation site with Gould told The 
Times they had not been aware of that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between officials from both cities and Bloomingdale's have been 
strictly confidential, with each side leery of giving leverage to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But participants confirm that in closed-door sessions, a Bloomingdale's 
architect presented Beverly Hills' officials with a proposed building plan, 
later amending it at the city's suggestion. Last week, a scale model was 
unveiled at a similar meeting, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Beverly Hills has recently hired legal counsel to advise them on 
possible lease and purchase agreements for the land. The city has also retained 
a traffic consultant to measure the impact of a department store on Beverly 
Drive and will be employing an urban design firm to study the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Mayor Vicki Reynolds said she has been encouraged by the status 
of the negotiations: "Bloomingdale's and Beverly Hills -- it's a great fit. 
Both have a cachet that will enhance the other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, however, said he remains to be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving last week's negotiating session with Beverly Hills, he went 
directly to meet with Riordan to discuss the Century City site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been chatting with Los Angeles as long (as Beverly Hills), but 
after talking to Mayor Riordan last week I have no doubt that they'll be 
willing to do whatever it takes to get Bloomingdale's in Los Angeles," Gould 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould would not elaborate on his specific requests, other than to say that the 
project be "fast-tracked" -- meaning it should receive speedy approvals from 
the various city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Hirsh, who been spearheading Los Angeles' efforts to woo 
Bloomingdale's, said the retailer would be making a mistake if it chose Beverly 
Hills over Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although public officials in Beverly Hills' may be eager to welcome 
Bloomingdale's, he said, the residents may not be so pleased with a large-scale 
retail project. He pointed out other commercial projects that had been delayed 
or stymied after residents protested. Saks Fifth Avenue's proposed expansion 
last year was killed due to residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole city is a homeowners' group," he said, alluding to the 
associations' usual role in opposing nearby construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh promised Los Angeles would be much more welcoming and could offer tax 
incentives, a promise of fast-track consideration and other aid. Hirsh is 
chairman of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, but said he was 
involved only as a private citizen. He is longtime friend of Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, development in Century City is limited under a planning guide that, in 
part, regulates growth by the traffic a project would generate. According to 
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who opposes the project, a 
250,000-square-foot department store would certainly exceed the traffic 
generation limits now applicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners measure traffic through "vehicle trips," the number of cars that 
would arrive or leave a building per day. Yaroslavsky said there are fewer than 
1,500 vehicle trips allowable under the current phase of Century City 
development, and he estimated Bloomingdale's could trigger approximately 10,000 
vehicle trips per day. Yaroslavsky said he has not been part of the discussions 
with Bloomingdale's, Hirsh and Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Yaroslavsky: "The Westside has enough shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 But whichever city Bloomingdale's ultimately moves into, Gould is convinced 
the legendary retailer can do marvelous things for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gould: "We bring an awful lot to an area. If Bloomingdale's comes to 
either city, the values of adjacent stores skyrocket -- that's whether it's in 
Beverly Hills or Century City."

BRIEFLY; CANCER: WEEKEND EVENT TO INCLUDE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 plaster molds of women's torsos will be on display in Westwood 
this weekend at an exhibit and candlelight vigil aimed at drawing attention to 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The torso exhibit, organized by the Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance, will 
be held on the lawn outside the Federal Building, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., 
Saturday morning through Sunday evening. The candlelight vigil is Saturday from 
8 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaster torsos were made at "casting" parties attended both by women with 
breast cancer and women free of the disease. Organizers say that in the past 
year, more than 1,350 women died of breast cancer in the Los Angeles area.

TOPICS / THEATER; WORKING HARD TO MAKE A STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Martha Velez what she thinks about Proposition 187 and she doesn't mince 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's anti-immigration, anti-child, anti-education and anti-health," the 
singer-actress said of the ballot measure that would bar illegal immigrants 
from public schools, non-emergency health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Velez, a Beverly Hills resident, is putting those opinions on stage as the 
writer and director of "Power of the Powerless." The play, Velez's first to be 
produced, is scheduled to premiere Oct. 6 at the Coast Playhouse in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of press (criticizing) immigration, but not much from the 
other side," said the New York native, who is also acting in the play. 
"Immigrants have been an enormous resource in our work force. They're cheap 
labor; they do the jobs (others) don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Velez says the impetus for her play came from a Los Angeles Times' article, 
written a couple of years ago, about blue-collar American workers who, because 
of the recession, had to stand on street corners soliciting work alongside the 
Mexican day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another story that caught her eye was a news item, reported from San Diego, 
about a group of local men who entered a laborers' camp and beat up some of the 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Velez's seven-character story -- played by three actors -- revolves around a 
white construction worker, Jarvis Standish, whose life has bottomed out. He has 
ended up on a street corner with the day laborers he used to hire. The other 
main character, illegal immigrant Marco Santiago, has been going back and forth 
across the border, working day jobs in San Diego. Del Zamora and Nathan LeGrand 
play the male characters, while Velez assumes three roles -- including a 
Mexican wife and an American trailer park divorcee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to wear all the hats," she admitted of her 
writing-directing-acting duties. "But in the end, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The production marks a big leap from Velez's last theatrical venture, the 
Rexford Recession Theatre, conveniently housed in her Beverly Hills 
garage-turned-30-seat-studio. "We began doing two-character plays for our own 
enjoyment," she explained, referring to cohorts John Sparano and his wife 
Jeanne Benedict. "We did 'A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking,' 
'Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune' -- what you'd call salon 
performances, for our friends -- with wine, munchies. It was a social thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Velez has had an eclectic career. Raised in New York, she attended the 
prestigious High School of Performing Arts as a drama major and Long Island 
University as a speech and theater major. On Broadway, she appeared in "Mata 
Hari," "I'm Solomon" and the landmark '60s musical "Hair."  
</P>
<P>
 Velez has also had a successful parallel career as a singer. She has recorded 
nine albums -- six for Warner-Sire -- including "Escape from Babylon," produced 
by Bob Marley, and "Fiends and Angels," which included contributions by Eric 
Clapton and Christine McVie. On the home front, Velez is mother to 23-year-old 
actor Taj Johnson, who is now attending Loyola Marymount Film School, and wife 
to sociologist Hyman Frankel, who runs a consulting firm out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Velez friend and collaborator Benedict is producing "Powerless" for 
her company, Ice Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the piece, and I loved that it had a political bent," says Benedict. 
"But it really doesn't take a political stand. It shows how you can look at the 
situation in a number of ways, and it humanizes the issues. It's also very 
timely. I'm glad we have a forum where people can listen. Things like this send 
a message to society: 'Wake up. These are issues that are facing you -- 
especially in Los Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Power of the Powerless" opens Oct. 6 and plays Thursdays through Sundays at 8 
p.m. at the Coast Playhouse, 8325 Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood, through 
Oct. 30. The first six performances will benefit Americans for Democratic 
Action. Tickets and information: (213) 660-8587.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; SHOPPING CENTER TO RISE FROM THE ASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two-and-a-half years ago, touring the smoking ruins of the Crenshaw Center 
shopping plaza in the aftermath of the civil unrest, Richard Heller said the 
road to recovery seemed too bumpy to consider traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was indeed a long journey -- one that took a year longer than expected to 
complete -- but Heller, vice president of Watt Commercial Development Corp., 
went the distance and is on the verge of reopening 30 stores that were burned 
or extensively damaged.  
</P>
<P>
 "We waded through a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of red tape," said Heller, 
surveying the bright new storefronts at Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue 
last week. "When I first saw stores burning on TV, I thought, 'Oh no.' But we 
did it. We came back." 
</P>
<P>
 The 137,000-square-foot center was the largest shopping plaza to be hit in the 
riots and one of the most extensively damaged. Toured by then-President George 
Bush and many others in 1992, it became emblematic of the rage that sparked the 
unrest and the ensuing destruction that leveled commercial property throughout 
Los Angeles. Of the 40 spaces housed in the Crenshaw Center, only five -- The 
Boys supermarket, Burger King, Super Trak auto parts, Thrifty Drugs and 
National Dollar Store -- have been operating since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 That will change on Nov. 5 when the center will hold a reopening with all the 
hoopla that Heller says the $6-million effort deserves. About half the original 
tenants are returning, and new ones include Union Federal Bank, Subway sandwich 
shop, Crown Diamonds and a First Interstate Bank home loan office. All tenants 
got structural face-lifts -- new storefronts and improvements such as 
individual sprinkler and security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller said the development corporation's leasing department also reduced 
rents to attract tenants and ensure that nearly all the stores would be leased 
by November. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some hesitancy among some people about locating here, but not a 
lot," he said. "People did good business here before. That business is still 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Optometrist Craig Carter, whose office on Manchester and Vermont was gutted by 
fire during the riots, moved his Universal Eye Care Center into the plaza two 
months ago because he said it was the just community location he had been 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in L.A. my whole life. I grew up in the neighborhood," Carter 
said. "They've done a lot of good improvements here . . . people have been glad 
to see me move here." 
</P>
<P>
 Watt Commercial Development Corp. was the managing general partner in the 
joint venture with the Slauson/Crenshaw Associates Partnership, a group of 
local limited partners. With community rehabilitation in mind as well as 
building refurbishment, Watt hired Curtom Construction, a black female-owned 
general contractor, and used contractors that were wholly or partially 
minority-owned.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; LANDMARK GETS RENT CONTROL EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ripples of the January earthquake have again hit residents of Santa 
Monica's Sea Castle apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Rent Control Board last week exempted the severely damaged landmark 
structure from rent control. That could mean market-level rents if the building 
at 1725 The Promenade is ever repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The board adhered to a city rent control law that frees a damaged building 
from rent limits if the sum of rents at the market rate is lower than the 
repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our staff experts run the numbers and it was just not economically 
feasible to enforce rent control on a building this damaged," said Lisa Monk 
Borrino, vice chairwoman of the rent board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's commissioners say renovating the 178-unit building, which once 
housed a close-knit, diverse community of artists, the elderly and local 
celebrities, will cost an estimated $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And some housing experts doubt that increasing rents on the building's many 
one-bedroom units -- $350 to $650 before the quake -- will ever be enough to 
cover the rebuilding expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owner, Robert Braun, intends to push ahead with renewal plans 
despite the cost and foreclosure proceedings by the building's bank, First 
Federal Bank of California, over a defaulted mortgage loan. Years of litigation 
between Braun and the bank could lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to continue to make efforts to preserve the building," said 
Sherman Stacey, Braun's attorney. "He has applied for every possible state and 
federal grant for restoration. Preservation is the best alternative to 
demolition." 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants, who in recent years have argued with Braun over rent increases, 
the installation of a sprinkler system and the building's general state of 
disrepair, remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Braun has any intent of rebuilding until he is completely free 
of any (restrictions) -- he will just drag it out as long as possible," said 
Emily Aleyner, a 20-year resident of the oceanfront apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, Santa Monica, though armed with an order from its nuisance 
abatement board, was unable to get Braun to shore up the structure. The city 
advanced $180,000 to strengthen the building, and is seeking reimbursement 
through a lien on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning last week, tenants were allowed into their apartments to retrieve 
their belongings, a process that will continue until Oct. 1, after which the 
building will be boarded up. Many were shocked at the damage done since the 
quake by birds, rodents and vandals.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; CHAIN REACTION; WESTWOOD BOOKSELLERS WARILY AWAIT 
OPENING OF HUGE STORE BY NATIONAL RIVAL AND WONDER, CAN THE INDEPENDENTS LAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent bookstores these days face crushing competition from large retail 
chains -- and nowhere is the trend more evident than at Westwood Boulevard and 
Rochester Avenue in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, a large national book chain, is opening a mammoth outlet there next 
month -- directly across the street from Sisterhood, Los Angeles' first 
feminist bookstore. Though the location is the same, the contrast couldn't be 
more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisterhood makes do with 1,200 square feet of space in what was once a 
three-room house, built in the 1920s. The place is crammed full of books 
(because the store isn't computerized, no one can say how many) and also offers 
magazines, pottery, jewelry, T-shirts and handbags that for the most part are 
made by women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Borders Books and Music outlet across the street will be the 62nd and 
largest of the chain's outlets, featuring 170,000 book titles, 65,000 music 
titles and 8,500 video titles. Its 43,000-square-foot space will also house 
music listening areas and an espresso bar above a three-level parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder that Sisterhood's owners, former sisters-in-law Simone and Adele 
Wallace, see the new arrival as a threat to their store's existence. At a time 
when independent bookstores across the country are struggling to survive while 
chain stores thrive, the Wallaces are not sanguine about their prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of feel like we're the family farm, and look what happened to the 
family farm. Look what happened to the horse and buggy," Simone Wallace said. 
"It's not that I want to be pessimistic about it, but who knows? Looking into 
the future, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Borders and Sisterhood both began small, in the early 1970s. Borders was 
started in 1971 as a used bookstore in Ann Arbor, Mich., by two brothers who 
loved books, Tom and Louis Borders. The next year the Wallaces began Sisterhood 
in a storefront off an alleyway near Olympic and Westwood boulevards, moving it 
to its current site six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisterhood has remained small-scale. Its books, in many cases from feminist 
presses, are divided by genre and category into small groups covering general 
literature, women of color, spirituality, mythology, feminist theory, recovery, 
violence against women, women and creativity, humor, and children's literature, 
among other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A closet-sized room in the back contains free literature about programs for 
women, as well as a bulletin board spackled with feminists' business cards, 
housing information and miscellaneous announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisterhood has hosted many readings and book signings over the years. It has 
stepped up such activities in the past year in response not only to news of 
Borders' arrival but also to the region's tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 A monthly salon series that features talks by prominent women and group 
discussions kicked off last Saturday with performance artist Rachel Rosenthal. 
On Oct. 15 -- the day Borders is scheduled to open -- UCLA women's studies 
professor Sondra Hale will talk about her field research on women's social 
movements in Eritrea. A women's book group, led by store manager Julie 
Mitchell, began in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Sunday afternoon there are appearances by local writers. Recently the 
store hosted a publication party for the editors of a new quarterly 
publication, "The Lesbian Review of Books." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding is we need to do much more promotion, much more events, to 
get people to come to the store," Simone Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Sisterhood stayed small, Borders became a behemoth -- though not 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 After developing and marketing an advanced computer inventory tracking system, 
the Borders brothers sold what had become a 22-store chain to the Kmart Corp. 
in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers are no longer involved in bookselling, but their chain lives on. 
Having firmly established itself in the Midwest and East, Borders Inc. has been 
expanding steadily in the West. It plans to have 70 to 75 stores in place by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders' first Southern California store opened in Mission Viejo on Labor Day 
Weekend. The Westwood store's opening will be followed by an early November 
unveiling of a Torrance store, and construction will begin soon on a Santa 
Monica outlet, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Borders, shoppers will be able to find much of what they find at Sisterhood 
-- frequently at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain offers 30% discounts on bestsellers, and it sells most other 
hardcover books at 10% off. The Westwood Borders will feature about 1,500 
women's studies titles and 1,000 men's studies titles, with many of these books 
broken out into lesbian and gay fiction and lesbian and gay studies sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Borders stores, the store will be "fairly nicely appointed without 
being luxurious," said Dan Conetta, Borders Inc.'s vice president.  
</P>
<P>
 Chairs and benches will be scattered throughout to make browsing easier, the 
Cafe Espresso will have 50 seats and wallpapered walls with wood trim are 
intended to create a cozy feeling in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Conetta said Borders chose the Westwood site in August, 1993, because "the 
demographics around there are terrific, as far as income and education. We pick 
our sites based on the mass of book and music lovers in an area." 
</P>
<P>
 Conetta said Sisterhood's presence had no influence on Borders' choice of the 
site, which was previously occupied by a mini-mall. Elizabeth Sims, western 
regional manager for Borders Inc., said she had initially been unaware that 
Sisterhood was across the street. "I was dismayed, frankly, that we were going 
to be such a close neighbor of such a respected bookshop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added, "I really think they're going to do a better business 
because of spillover from us. Our employees will be instructed to refer people 
to Sisterhood" when Borders doesn't have a particular title. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will be sitting up in our espresso bar, and I'm sure their curiosity 
will be piqued," she said, by the view of Sisterhood's storefront. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, when rumors began circulating that Borders was coming to Westwood, 
Simone Wallace found the news "just unbelievably shocking. It's every 
bookseller's worst nightmare -- to have someone about 40 times bigger open 
right across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a Borders executive paid a visit to Sisterhood in late May, Wallace had 
hoped the super-store's arrival was just a bad dream. Now, Wallace said, "I 
have more of a philosophical feeling about it, how it can be of value to us, 
and how we can emphasize that we're special." 
</P>
<P>
 Border's imminent arrival spurred the Wallaces to call a midsummer survival 
strategy meeting with local writers and activists who have been long-term 
supporters. The women offered practical advice on promotional ideas and ways to 
make the store "more '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those suggestions, including acquiring an 800 number to handle mail 
orders and starting a Frequent Buyers Club, have been implemented. The Wallaces 
are also passing out literature to customers, asking for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some customers are likely to respond. Santa Monica writer Savina 
Teubal, author of "Sarah the Priestess: The First Matriarch of Genesis" and 
other books, said she has favored Sisterhood since it first opened, doing much 
of her book buying there. Sisterhood is "a landmark," Teubal said. "For 
Sisterhood to fold is like feminism folding, almost." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Gray, a Santa Monica poet and aspiring screenwriter, visits Sisterhood 
two or three times a month to buy literary journals, books and to scan the 
bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the only place on the Westside to find out what's going on in the 
(feminist) community," she said. Even if Borders carries the same titles as 
Sisterhood at lower prices, Gray added, she will still shop at Sisterhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there'll be a core that will stick around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims resists any suggestion that Borders and other chain stores represent an 
unfair threat to independent booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply would say that when you go into business, it is a risk, and to 
expect that the business climate will never change is unrealistic," Sims said. 
"Small businesses of all kinds go down, just as small businesses of all kinds 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, chain stores should be given credit for increasing 
Americans' literacy by making them more comfortable in bookish environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the average person it's sometimes intimidating to walk into a bookstore," 
Sims said. "But when you go into a store where the romance section is accorded 
the same respect as the philosophy section, and you get courteous attention and 
are not condescended to, you're more likely to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Loralee MacPike, an English professor at Cal State San Bernadino and a 
Sisterhood regular who publishes a lesbian literary review, says she has heard 
good things about Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Borders is a good bookstore," MacPike said. "I just don't want to see 
it across the street from Sisterhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1970s spirit of feminist activism seems to have diminished, 
feminist bookstores have not outlived their usefulness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much of a revolution going on, except for the feeling you get in 
feminist bookstores," she said. "We have to have a place to go that feels like 
our own, and Sisterhood feels like that place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wallaces say they are determined to keep Sisterhood alive. "If we're 
driven out, if we have no choice, we'll become a volunteer co-op or something," 
Simone Wallace said. "We've been here 22 years. I think we'll stay." Volume,

BOARDWALK: PLANS FOR REFURBISHING THE VENICE BEACH AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your desire to provide "balanced" coverage of the Venice Boardwalk debate has 
led to a magnification of a tiny but vocal minority, many of whom do not live 
in our community. Let me give a few examples. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on we were confronted by an odd character from Santa Monica. This 
classic news hound copied the Historical Boardwalk refurbishment plan prepared 
by the leading Venice civic organizations, made a few changes and tried to pass 
off his version as "the community's plan." This led the public to erroneously 
think there are two current, legitimate plans in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose we should be flattered that our master plan was so compelling that 
he wanted to use it as the base for his bogus version. Unfortunately his 
changes shortchanged the boardwalk of needed improvements, diverting millions 
of dollars to the white elephant of Venice -- the pavilion. This 30-year-old 
dysfunctional structure could be built anew for less than the $2 million 
estimated by the Coastal Conservancy to bring it up to current building, 
parking, disabled and seismic codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we were entertained by a Hawthorne resident posing as a Venice historian. 
Ironically, his complaint was that we proposed to replicate the historic 1930s 
lighting and use brick on the boardwalk -- a popular building material of the 
1905 Venice-of-America era. He favored asphalt, a petroleum-based substance 
that erodes and leaches into Santa Monica Bay, killing the grass in the 
adjoining park on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes a Mr. McLoskey, who hails from Cupertino in the Silicon Valley in 
Northern California, and Mr. Wallach, a Playa del Rey resident (Letters, Sept. 
22, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, neither gentleman participated in the two-year-long Coastal 
Conservancy workshop process in 1989-90 that led to the community's Venice 
Waterfront Restoration Plan. Two years ago, this plan was adopted by voter 
approval of Proposition A and stands as the blueprint for boardwalk 
refurbishment. For example, it reflects the desire of most of the community to 
demolish the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. McLoskey recommends that we leave the dangerous curves on the bike path, 
not restrict performers to specific areas, and not re-create the Third Street 
Promenade. While I welcome his input, his lack of familiarity with the venue 
has led him astray. I am a frequent user of the bike path and my scrapes and 
scars attest to the need to straighten the path. No one has ever suggested 
restricting performers. And we have proposed restoring the boardwalk to its 
1905 Venice-of-America ambience, not a 1992 Promenade style. 
</P>
<P>
 From south of Ballona Creek, Mr. Wallach questions who speaks for Venice. I'd 
say the voters of Venice -- they approved Proposition A, tying expenditure of 
$10 million to the conservancy plan. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd also say the nonprofit Venice civic improvement groups like the 
200-plus-member Venice Action Committee and the longstanding Venice Town 
Council speak for Venice. They wear a well-earned mantle of leadership. Over 
the last five years, their members paid their dues to develop both the Coastal 
Conservancy plan and its complement, the historical refurbishment plan. And 
unlike those who live in Cupertino, Santa Monica, Hawthorne and Playa del Rey, 
we make our home in Venice and deserve to be heard on a project taking place in 
our back yard.

REGIONAL REPORT; SOUTH PASADENA; SOLAR PANELS TO SERVE SCHOOL AND HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TALLY GOLDSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a groundbreaking project, Monterey Hills Elementary School and Southern 
California Edison have teamed up to bring solar energy to the school and 300 
homes in South Pasadena that were on the brink of an energy burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in the whole world that solar energy is being used to 
this extent," said Edan Prabhu, Edison's project manager. In the past, Prabhu 
said, solar energy has been used to power individual homes. For the first time, 
solar energy will give a power boost to an entire neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials chose the 300-house neighborhood, which they call Hill Grid, 
because of increasing demands that new or remodeled homes have been putting on 
30-year-old power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of rewiring insufficient underground service, Edison placed 180 solar 
panels on the school's roof two weeks ago. When the sun is at its hottest, the 
metallic blue panels can harness 15 kilowatts -- or 150 100-watt bulbs -- worth 
of energy, which is then routed into the school's main power lines. Another set 
of panels, 125 kilowatts worth, will be assembled on the school's roof in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the $5-million project sponsored by the federal Department of 
Energy and Edison, will place solar panels on houses and possibly parking lots 
in the South Pasadena neighborhood and in areas of San Marino and La Canada 
Flintridge that face similar problems with inadequate power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials said they hope that government-sponsored projects such as 
this will help lower the cost of solar energy by generating increased 
industrial and residential demand. Robert Vanderwall, school director of 
maintenance and operations, said he approached Edison last year with the idea 
of using the school after he heard that the utility wanted to bring solar 
energy into the neighborhood. The school's large, flat roofs have unobstructed 
exposure to the sun and therefore make an ideal project site. The school will 
save about 25% in annual electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials are also meeting with residents to see if they are interested 
in having the solar panels on their roofs. The school did not have to pay for 
its panels, but officials are not sure whether residents will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, one kilowatt of solar power costs $7, as opposed to less than $1 
per kilowatt for natural gas, but officials expect the price to go down as 
solar energy becomes more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Joe Johnson said he also liked the idea of using the panels 
as learning tools. "It actually dovetails with our science instruction," he 
said. "The kids will find more applications of how solar energy works."

REGIONAL REPORT; SOUTH BAY; JAZZ PIANIST DAVID BENOIT ACCENTUATES THE POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A critic once remarked of David Benoit after hearing a Greek Theatre concert 
by the best-selling jazz pianist: "Doesn't this guy have any Angst in his 
life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit, a favorite on radio's KTWV ("The Wave"), makes no apologies for 
creating upbeat music. His music, he says, "is a reflection of my own life. 
Which is pretty positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit is best known for playing jazz fusion, but he also has had one of the 
largest-selling traditional jazz albums on the charts, "Waiting for Spring." He 
also has made his mark in big band, has written the music for the Charlie Brown 
specials since 1985 and has even dabbled in rock 'n' roll.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Benoit ventures into new territory when he debuts with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic at the Palos Verdes Peninsula Music Fair. He will conduct 
a symphonic jazz rendition of his composition "Carmel." He wrote the piece for 
a documentary of the same name, a collaborative project with Clint Eastwood 
about the seaside city.  
</P>
<P>
 "By and large," Benoit said, "I've lived a charmed life."  
</P>
<P>
 But Benoit's acclaim did not come overnight. From the mid-'70s to the 
mid-'80s, he plunked out cocktail tunes on his portable piano at bar mitzvahs, 
weddings and private parties, even while enjoying star status in the 
Philippines, playing there with full orchestras in 3,000-seat halls.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in the United States, though, he was just another lounge lizard doing 
private parties to pay the bills. He says the first private party he played 
after returning from the Philippines was really difficult. When he arrived at a 
Brentwood home to play, the owner was horrified at the prospect of him carting 
his piano through the front door. She showed Benoit the back door and told him 
to stay in the kitchen "with the cook and the help" until it was time to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Benoit chuckles at the memory. "I was playing in a house that was probably no 
bigger than the house I live in now in Palos Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit is a longtime South Bay resident. He moved to Hermosa Beach with his 
family when he was 6 so his father could study psychology at USC. His two 
younger brothers became star athletes and surfers. Benoit, who described 
himself then as "quiet, shy, really thin, not athletic," had a difficult time 
before he discovered music. While the rest of the family talked about sports, 
Benoit played piano.  
</P>
<P>
 "Music rescued me," he said. For the first three years of high school, "no one 
paid attention to me. Music was perfect for me. It solved my problems." In his 
senior year, Benoit wrote the score for his school's production of "Tom Jones." 
The show's success put him in with the in-crowd, he said. After that, "people 
had a feeling I was going to make it."  
</P>
<P>
 And he did. With two Grammy nominations to his credit (for his jazz album 
"Every Step of the Way" and his work on the GRP jazz label's all-star album) 
and international acclaim, the only thing left to conquer, it seems, is a few 
critics. "I've had a love-hate relationship with some of them," he said. 
"Either they get it or they don't.' 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Benoit plans to continue moving forward. He recently agreed to 
score the music for the upcoming Clint Eastwood film "The Stars Fell on 
Henrietta," starring Robert Duvall. And he plans to continue working more with 
symphony orchestras and maybe move into conducting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to grow into other areas, continue to experiment, try different 
things. That's what I aspire to do: Do all kinds of music. Keep exploring."

OUT AND ABOUT / JAZZ PIANO: A LIFELONG ADDICTION TO MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Harnell's musical career began on a high note. 
</P>
<P>
 Six decades later, the Sherman Oaks pianist and composer is still performing. 
Friday night he brings his music to Santa Monica for a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnell will perform a program that includes some of his own compositions as 
well as those of great American composers such as Cole Porter and Ira Gershwin. 
Singer Janna Brown will join him for several numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get such a kick out of performing and playing the piano," said Harnell, who 
recently celebrated his 70th birthday. "I have a feeling that (my music) has 
some value and is not dulling the brain and putting people to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Harnell began taking piano lessons at age 6. By age 14, the New York native 
was playing at parties with his father's jazz group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had music in the house since the time I could remember," he said. "I 
really got hooked (on music) as a teen-ager. It was my first major addiction in 
life and I couldn't get enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He continued his musical studies in high school and earned a bachelor's degree 
in music at the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnell was in the Army Air Corps during World War II and toured with Glenn 
Miller's military band, playing gigs in both the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Resuming his professional career after the war, he worked as a musical 
director for many celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Lena 
Horne and Peggy Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 His work, however, was not just behind the scenes. He went on to arrange and 
record 18 albums, including the hit song "Fly Me to the Moon," which won four 
Grammy awards in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, Harnell began composing a series of 
film and television scores. Some of his more than 400 hours of original work 
has been heard on such television shows as "Santa Barbara," "The Bionic Woman" 
and "Alien Nation," as well as numerous TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought of myself as a composer," Harnell said. "As it turns out in 
my bag of music tricks, I became a songwriter and a pianist." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harnell has scaled back his work schedule, he continues to compose 
music, give occasional concerts and teach film scoring at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a good living, but the pace was very stressful," he said. "I am doing 
things I like to do. I want to enjoy my remaining years." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Harnell will perform at 8 p.m. Friday at a private residence in a concert 
sponsored by Parlor Performances, 601 17th St., Santa Monica. Tickets are $20 
and include the show and dessert reception. Reservations are required. 
Information: (310) 471-3979.

POP MUSIC; ROOTSY AND REFINED; OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE BLUES SPECTRUM WILL COLOR 
DOHENY BEACH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, Buddy Seigal is a free-lancer who writes about pop music for 
the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To headline the second annual Orange County Blues Festival this weekend, 
organizers went for opposites to attract crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the refined and polished Brian Setzer Orchestra performs, while 
Sunday brings the gritty, rootsy sound of John Mayall to Doheny State Beach in 
Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Setzer, the former Stray Cats front-man, has been touring extensively 
throughout the year as leader of a nostalgia-tinged, 18-piece big band that 
performs new material as well as classic and obscure covers from the '40s and 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's self-titled debut album, released earlier this year, showcases 
Setzer's affinity for writing and singing Bobby Darin-cum-Frank Sinatra-styled 
pop numbers with a distinctly New York City feeling and sophistication. 
Setzer's accomplished, newly jazz-inflected guitar playing fits smoothly into 
the rich bed of brass that the band provides, a lavish and rewarding texture 
that few modern ears have had the pleasure to experience. 
</P>
<P>
 If the singer sometimes isn't up to the task of effectively tackling the more 
muscular shouters -- such as the 1949 Wynonie Harris classic, "Sittin' on It 
All the Time," -- swinging originals with Nelson Riddle-esque arrangements such 
as "Lady Luck" should make the set worth a listen. The Brian Setzer Orchestra 
is scheduled for 8 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Preceding Setzer at 7 p.m. will be James Cotton, the legendary Chicago blues 
harpist who made his reputation as a member of Muddy Waters' band in the '50s 
and '60s and went on to become a top-notch bandleader in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
 In Waters' band, Cotton had the unenviable task of replacing all-time great 
Little Walter, but his aggressive honking and flair for showmanship were 
well-received by Waters' fans. He was able to parlay these talents into 
becoming one of the most energetic and popular touring blues attractions in the 
'70s, while developing a strong rock 'n' roll following as well. 
</P>
<P>
 By the '80s however, the years started to take their toll, and Cotton slowed 
his pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But his musicianship remains formidable. He is one of the true giants of 
Chicago blues, a much-copied and beloved harp player with roots deep in the 
city's musical heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's lineup is rounded out by Maria Muldaur, one-time folkie best known 
for her 1972 hit "Midnight at the Oasis," plus the Rhythm Lords, Mississippi 
Millie and Max Bangwell, the King Brothers, Barrelhouse, the Lifters, Robert 
Lucas and Tyrone Anthony, who starts the day off at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If James Cotton's appearance fails to satisfy lovers of blues harp, Sunday's 
lineup should more than sate the palate. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmonicats John Mayall, Kim Wilson and Charlie Musselwhite appear at 8, 7 and 
6 p.m. respectively, in a battle of the blues harps that should shake, quake 
and bake the beach.  
</P>
<P>
 At age 63, Mayall is the godfather of the British blues scene, having 
introduced and/or worked with such eminent English blues musicians as Eric 
Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the '60s, 
as well as American studio hounds such as Sugarcane Harris, Blue Mitchell and 
Harvey Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a traditionalist, Mayall's finest work was done in the late '60s 
and early '70s, when his experiments with jazz voicing and percussionless 
lineups took the blues into uncharted realms. Never a truly exceptional harp 
player (Mayall will doubtless be best remembered as a singer and bandleader), 
his workout on the instrument with 1969's "Room to Move" was nonetheless a 
staple of FM radio during the era. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent years, Mayall has returned to his prosaic roots in 
London-by-way-of-Chicago blues, but his unique, eerie, almost feminine vocal 
tone always proves an interesting diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, formerly of the Fabulous Thunderbirds, has gained a deserved 
reputation as the man to beat on the instrument in the past decade or so.  
</P>
<P>
 A Little Walter disciple whose swooping, sax-like runs can raise gooseflesh, 
Wilson has dedicated himself to playing undiluted blues since the demise of the 
rock-oriented Thunderbirds a few years ago. Equally at home in an acoustic, 
Sonny Boy Williamson-inspired vein, Wilson can boast of versatility to match 
his virtuosity on the blues harp, even if his singing is less convincing and 
authentic. (A review of his latest album appears on Page 5.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran of the '60s blues scene, Musselwhite blew more than a few 
minds with his eerie, minor-key classic "Christo Redemptor" in 1967. He's had 
an up-and-down career but is in the midst of a comeback due to last year's 
critically acclaimed "Signature" album, which also showcased Musselwhite's 
fine, down-home singing and guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even more for harp fans Sunday afternoon, as Southern California 
staple James Harman appears around 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise of the festival, though, could turn out to be Lee Rocker's Big 
Blue, which appears at 2 p.m. Sunday. Rocker, who slapped the upright bass with 
Stray Cats, hasn't gotten the ink or attention of Setzer, but his current 
lineup puts out more innovative music, raw energy and pure fun than his 
better-known former band mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing rockabilly, blues, jazz, R & B and attitude into a loud and compelling 
mix, this is a band to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Also appearing Sunday will be Randell Young, Doyle Bramhall, the Starlights, 
the Jive Kings, Delta Ramblers and the Chantays. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Second annual Orange County Blues Festival.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Life (If You Call It Living)" 
</P>
<P>
 Antone's Records  
</P>
<P>
 No sooner does singer/harpist Kim Wilson get off the road with the 
hard-touring Fabulous Thunderbirds than he turns around and heads out with his 
own band, Kim Wilson and the Tigermen (who appear this Sunday at the Orange 
County Blues Festival in Dana Point. Story Page 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and the Thunderbirds were about the only contemporary blues outfit that 
got the seal of approval from Muddy Waters and other blues progenitors. And 
they were one of the first groups to get roots-derived music onto mainstream 
radio. In trying to hold that broader audience, the T-birds have moved further 
from their blues origins. "That's Life," the second album by Wilson and his 
outside band, on the other hand, is a sizable delight. Wilson has expanded on 
the straight blues, but soul and swing influences only add to the soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The band still features Southern California blues mainstays Larry Taylor on 
bass, Gene Taylor on keyboards and Richard Innes on drums, though wacko genius 
guitarist Junior Watson is no longer in the fold. Guitarist Rusty Zinn does a 
capable and occasionally inspired job, especially on the rollicking "Pretty 
Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is a powerhouse on both vocals and harmonica, with a lung-power all the 
more impressive for his reserve. There's no grandstanding, just honest emotion 
with the chops to give it full voice. Irma Thomas and the Rolling Stones have 
laid claim to "Time Is on My Side," but Wilson pretty well elopes with it. 
"She's My Baby" is a pleasure of a musical back-scratcher, while "Blues Leave 
Me Alone" is such a strong piece of Chicago blues you expect it to have 
stockyards. JIM WASHBURN

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Dolls 
</P>
<P>
 "New York Dolls" (1973) 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury  
</P>
<P>
 This album's cover photo of five tawdry looking men in outrageous drag was 
designed to stir controversy and curiosity. But only a few of the most 
adventurous rock fans were willing to give this pioneering group a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of rock's great injustices that more people haven't heard this 
historic album -- or even know of the Dolls' brief existence. Brimming with a 
sloppy insouciance, their debut album often is cited as one of the building 
blocks of the late '70s punk movement. The irreverent "Bad Girl" and the sassy 
"Vietnamese Baby" careen along with the sort of unpolished vigor that was 
becoming increasingly rare when "New York Dolls" appeared more than 20 years 
ago. And there's no denying David Johansen's bratty vocalizing on the punky 
pop-rock anthem "Trash." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the MC5 -- fellow revolutionaries who more directly presaged the 
hard-core aspects of the coming punk rebellion -- the Dolls had clearer roots 
in the rock mainstream. With its boogie-woogie piano textures and raunchy twin 
guitars, the hooky "Personality Crisis" is more apt to recall a mid-period 
Rolling Stones track than anything by the Dead Boys or the Ramones. Ditto with 
the blues-rock rumblings of "Looking For a Kiss." There's even an attractive 
acoustic ballad on the album, "Lonely Planet Boy," that could pass for an early 
David Bowie number. 
</P>
<P>
 After "New York Dolls," the band released one more studio album, "Too Much Too 
Soon," which was given favorable reviews in 1974. But sales figures remained 
dismal, and the group (managed late in its career by Sex Pistols' Svengali 
Malcolm McLaren) broke up in 1977. JON MATSUMOTO

KID STUFF: HAVING A CHANGE OF ART; LONG BEACH'S MONTHLONG CELEBRATION STARTS 
WITH CULTURAL EXCHANGE AND EAST VILLAGE FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I once worked for a lady with a knack for turning problems into potential 
miracles just by using her wits. 
</P>
<P>
 When lousy situations would befall us, she would switch into optimism 
overdrive, rhapsodizing about "wonn-derful opportunities" and launching a 
take-no-prisoners schmooze until the adversaries were practically eating out of 
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, her strategic sunniness would catch on and warring 
parties would find themselves working together toward a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know where she is now, but this woman's spirit lives on in Long Beach, 
where a Cambodian community activist (Sandy Arun San-Blankenship) and a Latino 
event planner (Florinda Mintz) are working hand in hand with minority leaders 
and arts groups on an event they hope will ease interracial tensions by 
highlighting this downtown area's diverse cultures. The second annual Anaheim 
Street International Festival and Expo -- being held Saturday in MacArthur Park 
on Anaheim Street -- kicks off "October Is Arts Month '94" in Long Beach, which 
includes about 70 exhibits, performances and special events at sites citywide. 
(See page 17 for a list of family-oriented "October Is Arts Month" programs.) 
Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 San-Blankenship and Mintz describe their task in surprisingly direct terms. 
They readily discuss the Anaheim Street corridor's history of racial tensions; 
even in their press releases they describe it as "an area frequently touched by 
poverty, crime, racial tension and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 But that situation can change with the help of community events like this, 
said San-Blankenship, who headed a festival planning committee with members of 
the local Cambodian, Latino, black and white communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there have been problems here, but we feel that we can bring people 
together by promoting our cultures and a respect for our diversity," she said. 
"We can learn to respect the differences and the similarities between us." 
Public events such as this also help visi tors appreciate the richness of such 
a diverse community, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress will be slow, but it is being made, San-Blankenship said, adding that 
the atmosphere at last year's inaugural festival was peaceful. She assures 
visitors that this year's will be safe and enjoyable for families as well. 
Guests are welcome to join festival participants and community leaders in a 
Unity Walk into the park at 10 a.m.; ethnic dress is encouraged. Expected to 
take part in the walk are Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by funding from the city's nonprofit Public Corp. for the Arts and 
private sponsors, this year's International Festival is larger and more 
ambitious, the women said. Headline entertainment has been brought in from 
surrounding areas, including several noted Orange County groups such as 
Mariachi Sol de Mexico led by Jose L. Hernandez (Hernandez is the musical 
director of the Mariachi USA Festival at the Hollywood Bowl), Alvin Hayes Jr. & 
his Jazz Band and the Yuko Maruyama jazz quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dance groups include the Cambodian Buddhist Society of Los Angeles Dance 
Ensemble, the Antonia Rojas Dance Theater, the Afrikan Study Group (drums and 
dancing) and Ballet Folclorico do Brasil, a group that Mintz says is best known 
for its blending of traditional African Brazilian dance with contemporary 
music.  
</P>
<P>
 The performances begin at 11 a.m. and continue nonstop until 7 p.m. There will 
also be a children's area with hands-on activities and a small stage with 
continuous international performances from 12:30 to 4:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another Long Beach community festival takes place through Sunday in 
the East Village section of downtown. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. near 1st Street 
and Linden Avenue, the Celebration of the Arts: A Sunday in the East Village 
will feature arts and crafts booths showcasing the works of local artists and 
international foods. Local bands will perform swing, gospel, rock and other 
music.  
</P>
<P>
 Children can take part in art projects including painting a mural that will 
remain on view for a year, according to event spokesman Phil Appleby. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's event has no agenda other than to showcase the range of artistic 
talent in the East Village, a downtown district that residents, business owners 
and city leaders hope to develop as Long Beach's cultural hub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our real goal is to create an environment that is friendly to artists and to 
visitors," Appleby said.

SURFING: BUD TOUR WINNER COMES FROM SCHOOL OF HARD KNOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, man! We've the Trestles contest, Vietnam and women all in one column. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig was just back from the U.S. Bud Tour at Trestles, south of the 
Orange County line, and had plenty to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, who was hot? 
</P>
<P>
 We had the No. 2 man in the world there, Shane Beschen of San Clemente. He was 
looking good in the early heats but got bumped in the semis. Taylor Knox of 
Carlsbad was on fire, though, and won the contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Where's he been, Fig? 
</P>
<P>
 It's been quite a while since Taylor has made the finals of a Bud Surf 
contest. His surfing has been a little off. In fact, when he picked up his 
check he admitted he was in a slump. Hopefully the victory will give him more 
confidence and allow him to power out for the rest of the season.  
</P>
<P>
 Who gave him competition? 
</P>
<P>
 John Shimooka of Hawaii, a dark horse. Shimooka only got four waves in the 
final, barely the minimum, but he got two set waves and placed second.  
</P>
<P>
 Current world champion Derek Ho of Hawaii took third. Actually, Derek scored 
big-time with the five judges, scoring three 10s on a wave in the semis. He 
just blasted the lip like five times on that one wave!  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was wondering how Ho, at age 29, was gonna do against the younger, 
quicker guys but he looked pretty solid down at Trestles.  
</P>
<P>
 I hear Jeff Deffenbaugh took fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup. He's on a roll. Deffenbaugh won at Virginia Beach (Aug. 25) and made the 
finals at Trestles. That makes him rated No. 1 on the Bud Surf Tour.  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't he a local from Huntington Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. We haven't had someone from Huntington Beach holding the No. 1 spot on 
the Bud Tour for about 10 years. I remember that in 1988 we had John Parmenter 
and Noah Budroe who were in the Top 5 in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 How did Kelly Slater, Mister No. 1 rated surfer in the world do? 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was a no-show. He was listed on the contest sheets but never showed up. 
He might have surfed in Portugal instead.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canceled: News from the offices of the Huntington Beach-based Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals is that the China Beach contest in Vietnam, a popular event last 
year, was canceled because of a lack of financial support. It was scheduled to 
start Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, how does this affect things? 
</P>
<P>
 This is gonna create a big scramble on the World Qualifying Series circuit and 
will attract a bunch of surfers for the Bud Surf Tour's San Francisco contest. 
Oct. 5 through 9.

<P>
 Let's see, there are two divisions, right? The World Championship Tour (WCT), 
the WQS, which includes Bud Surf Tour. Help me explain this to the folks, Fig. 
</P>
<P>
 The guys who are in the Top 28 from the Championship Tour will be coming back 
next year. But the tour also adds the Top 16 surfers from the Qualifying 
Series. So with Vietnam out, the guys are trying to get into that Top 16 and 
the only WQS event that weekend is the Bud contest in San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the world tour is headed for Brazil for the Alternativa contest 
Oct. 19 through 23. Slater is still rated No. 1 on the WCT, but the Fig said 
there's a California contingent burning it up. 
</P>
<P>
 We got a lot of California guys, probably the best group ever in the WCT's Top 
16, and include, Beschen in second place, Rob Machado of Cardiff, 12th; Jeff 
Booth of Laguna Beach, 13th, and Knox, 14th.  
</P>

 Women's Exhibit: On Oct. 15, the Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum 
will open a women's surfing exhibit. Ann Beasley, museum director, said it will 
feature photos, memorabilia, and trophies from Joyce Hoffman, Jericho 
Poppler-Bartlow, Linda Benson, Linda Merrill, Rell Sunn, and Mary Ann Hawkins.  
</P>
<P>
 Photographs and a small biography on other female surfers are being accepted 
and are needed for a collage. Those interested should mail the information by 
Oct. 10, to the museum, P.O. Box 782, Huntington Beach, CA 92648. The museum's 
chili cook-off, also is Oct. 15 and will be held across the street from the 
museum, 411 Olive St.

 Who Paid?: No one yet has been able to get a figure on paid attendance at the 
Op Pro and U.S. Open of Surfing at Huntington Beach put on by Prime Ticket. Don 
Meek, Prime Ticket's vice president for marketing, is oddly silent.

BRAMHALL'S LONG ROAD TO RECORDING DEBUT FINALLY REACHES DESTINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, John Roos is a free-lance writer who occasionally contributes to 
the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Texas musician Doyle Bramhall, the long road was filled with detours and 
battles with self-doubt. But finally, after nearly 14 years, he has reaped the 
rewards of his perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun basically as just a single 45-r.p.m. recording session in 1980 and 
eventually utilizing 27 different players, his long-awaited recording debut, 
"Bird Nest on the Ground," was finally released in February on Antone's 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking so long was not something I did consciously," the 45-year-old Dallas 
native explained Tuesday from El Paso, Texas. "There were personal things I 
needed to deal with, money delays, frustration in not getting the sound I 
wanted, and . . . I was still working with other bands over the years. 
Unfortunately, (the delay) turned into somewhat of a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 But something kept bringing Bramhall back to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm 50, I'd look back with regret if I didn't get the thing done," said 
Bramhall, who appears in concert Sunday about 3 p.m. at the Orange County Blues 
Festival in Dana Point. "Putting it out allowed me to move on with the rest of 
my life. I didn't want to cheat myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Blues fans didn't get cheated, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bird Nest" unleashes 11 strong cuts, including Bramhall's own "Change It" and 
"Other Side of Love" to songs by Muddy Waters, Hound Dog Taylor and Johnny 
Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 Long recognized as a natural musical resource in Texas, Bramhall has played 
drums on the Vaughan Brothers' "Family Style" and ZuZu Bollin's "Texas 
Bluesman" releases. But Bramhall is better known for his contributions to the 
late Stevie Ray Vaughan's songbook, having written or co-written songs on six 
of his albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stevie and I had a lot in common," Bramhall said. "We grew up in the same 
area and moved to Austin in the '70s. Every time we'd sit down to write songs, 
it was amazing -- we were both thinking the same ideas and were on the same 
wavelength. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it was very personal. We would talk about addictions and recoveries. 
But we weren't always real serious. We wrote fun songs, like 'The House Is 
Rockin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of Vaughan in a 1990 helicopter crash, blues fans lost an 
innovative and respected guitarist. And while the sadness still lingers for 
Bramhall, he has fond memories of both his friendship and professional peer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing a dear friend is like . . . well, you never really get over it. I have 
great admiration for Stevie as a man and musician. Whatever he did, he did it 
200%. He was totally focused, whether buying a pair of boots or jammin' on a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use to say to each other, 'Today is all we have.' He consistently lived 
like each day was his last -- and that's something I take with me from Stevie. 
To be around him really touched me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bramhall has moved out from the shadows of others in forging his own 
creative path. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I was very comfortable being in the background," he said. "Leading 
a band takes a little getting used to, but now I'm doing more of what I've 
always wanted to do . . . It's very challenging, but at the same time, it's so 
exciting."

KIDS ON FILM: 'RIVER WILD' AUDIENCE GETS SWEPT UP BY FORCES OF NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The River Wild," a troubled Boston couple and their son take a 
river-rafting trip in Montana, only to be hijacked by a pair of armed robbers 
who force the mom (Meryl Streep), an experienced river guide, to navigate their 
raft through forbidden waters. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Meryl Streep was totally buff, independent, smart and caring, a role 
model for girls of the '90s. But the real star of this movie, according to 
kids, was the river.  
</P>
<P>
 Way beyond wild, this river was life-threatening -- turbulent, glacial, 
precipitous. If the hidden rocks and eddies didn't get you, the temperature 
would. Naturally, the kids were ready to pack their bags for Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like roller-coasters. It looks like something I'd like to do," said Joanna 
Arhon, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched with my daughter Amanda, 13, I couldn't help but remember our own 
rafting trip on Oregon's Rogue River, which was fine until her raft became 
hooked on a rock in a waterfall for a heart-stopping 10 minutes, an incident 
that made the trip . . . for her. In the movie, she shushed me as I 
inadvertently gasped in unison with the rest of the audience, imagining the 
worst was about to happen but grateful that at least we weren't watching it in 
IMAX.  
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, I had bitten off two nails. She was inspired to sign up 
for another raft trip.  
</P>
<P>
 And she wasn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Rafting veterans Julia Montgomery, 16, and Dahlia Alony, 15, said they were 
inspired to try a more challenging fork of the American River. Their friend 
Joyce Schneiderman, 17, said she now wanted to give rafting a try, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia said she was impressed with the cinematography that conveyed the power 
of the sheer drops and huge waves the rafters confronted. The girls admitted 
they clung to one another throughout the thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really good movie, but there were parts that were really scary," 
Julia said. "So it's not like a movie I would bring little kids to. It's one of 
those where you sit through like this -- shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls said they appreciated seeing a female action hero.  
</P>
<P>
 "Omigosh, it was so rad. I wish I was her," Dahlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia explained: "In most action movies, like hero movies, the woman always 
just stands there in back and watches the guy. It was a real good change to see 
the woman doing most of the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Streep's character's husband, a workaholic architect who hustled 
along from the sidelines as Streep controlled the raft through the Class 5 
rapids, was demoted to a "Lassie sort of a man." But others thought the movie 
portrayed them as equal, just different types of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each played a major role in saving their lives," Dahlia said. "It was really 
good."  
</P>
<P>
 Experienced rafters, however, were skeptical over the scenes in which the 
robbers gain enough expertise in a five-minute lesson to help navigate the raft 
through rapids considered too dangerous for the public.  
</P>
<P>
 "That couldn't happen with just one person steering the raft," said Michael 
Leonard, 11. Some viewers were also surprised at the level of violence, which 
included four murders, two on-screen, two off.  
</P>
<P>
 "They could have done without the killing part," Joanna said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the good guys became violent, Julia said, it was clearly justified by 
self-defense. Plus, she said, the violence was less bloody than in other 
movies.  
</P>
<P>
 "In most movies where there's death and blood and stuff, you get totally 
turned off. . . . The death wasn't that disgusting," she said. "People got 
killed, but it wasn't like they were dripping blood everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The river just washed all the mess away.

SPECIAL SCREENING: AT THE HEART OF 'ANGEL' IS SUPERNATURAL APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
writes about film for The Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Angel Heart," which opens UC Irvine's "Cinema Potpourri" fall movie series 
Friday night, has become something of a mini-cult film. The reasons are as 
clear as the picture's plot is murky -- "Angel Heart" is weird, atmospheric and 
blatant, a noir spook show that grows on you like fungus in a dark basement. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to say that I didn't much like Alan Parker's flick when it came out in 
1987, thinking "Angel Heart" was an often pretentious and haphazard attempt to 
graft supernatural horror onto the mystery genre. Since then, though, it's 
worked on me. I've seen it a few times, now enjoying the grim humor and 
outrageous plot shifts embedded in the bizarre story line. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the picture's look is vivid, almost arty at times, as Parker's 
low-rent gumshoe (played by Mickey Rourke at his most guttural and shambling) 
stumbles down a nasty path of dirty blues clubs, frenetic voodoo, mega-murder 
and the strangest self-revelation of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is one of those films that requires the discarding of rational 
thought. At the center of the tale is a devilish pact involving 
soul-transmutation; it's silly, provoking sighs of "you gotta be kidding me!" 
as everything is revealed by the movie's end. But getting there can be a kick, 
especially if you realize that Parker and his cast are winking at us all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything centers on Harry Angel, a '50s detective from Brooklyn. Angel, who 
couldn't find a shaving razor to save his life and obviously doesn't believe in 
having his suits pressed, has been handling petty jobs like divorces and 
insurance scams until the nefarious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyphre wants Angel to locate Johnny Favorite, a crooner who owes Cyphre 
something big. Angel doesn't have a clue what's going on, but the money is good 
and there's nothing else to do, so what the hell. What the hell is right, for 
soon after he descends into a corrupt nether world in Louisiana where the 
bodies start to pile up and he crawls closer to finding out how he fits in. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he meets up with a fetching voodoo priestess played by Lisa 
Bonet of "The Cosby Show" fame. Bonet isn't particularly good, but she did make 
headlines at the time for her sweaty, X-rated bedroom scene with Rourke that 
was eventually cut. The passage is still pretty raw; daddy Huxtable would not 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke is amusing as he dimwittedly plods along. The actor knows how to make 
stupid seem sexy, and he accomplishes it here. But the most slyly funny 
performance comes from De Niro. His Cyphre is so evil, it's as if toxic waste 
is leaking through his pores. 
</P>
<P>
 De Niro goes beyond the fringe (watch him as he insists that eggs -- yes, 
eggs! -- are symbols of the soul and then chomps down on one like a hungry wolf 
as Angel watches in shock), but it's a very funny stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire movie is like that. Parker splashes blood everywhere, then shifts 
to a moody interior or exterior shot to calm everything down. The tempo moves 
from the gruesome to the comical in an instant. "Angel Heart" is full of 
passionate disorder, but it's an entertaining mess all the same.

LOST IN O.C.: SHOOTING FROM THE HIP? I TREND TO DISAGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was complaining to a friend recently about just how out of touch I'm feeling 
with the cutting edge of our culture. "Jeez," I asked, "just how hip am I when 
TV reporters are talking about designer drugs I haven't heard of yet?  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't worry," he advised. "TV reporters are probably the people those 
drugs were designed for." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, and, anyway, I have to admit I'm getting tired of trying to keep up 
with the latest trends.  
</P>
<P>
 It used to be a damning thing to be out of touch. Remember the caustic Bob 
Dylan lyric, "You know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do 
you, Mr. Jones?" Do you also remember the Dylan lyric where he goes, "Wiggle, 
wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup?" 
</P>
<P>
 That strays rather from the point, but I think it's always healthy to remember 
that the poet laureate of my generation is, shall we say, a versatile talent. 
The rumor was that the Mr. Jones of the song was based on Dylan's meeting a 
particularly un-hip reporter from Time magazine. And now Time magazine is such 
an arbiter of hip that it recently ran a cover story declaring "Everybody's Hip 
(And That's Not Cool)." 
</P>
<P>
 I was too hip to read the story, but I gathered from the pictures and captions 
that they were concerned that hipness, once the domain of a sullen few, is now 
being cast willy-nilly into the American mass consciousness, and everybody's 
trying to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as I hate to admit it, Time might actually be right for a change. It 
seems that no sooner do kids and whatever passes for a counterculture these 
days come up with some new music or fashion meant to disgust their elders and 
corporate masters, than that latter group has co-opted the trend, put a price 
tag on it and stuck it in Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 If some kids in Nome, Alaska, decide to honk off folks by dying igloos with 
snow-cone syrup, you can be pretty sure that in no time fashion designers will 
be sending gooey igloo-wearing super-models down the runways of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you've been to the Lab in Costa Mesa, the self-dubbed Anti-Mall (right 
next to the Pep Boys, where they only have antifreeze). I sort of like the 
place. There's a vaguely post-apocalyptic garage-Gothic coffeehouse vibe and an 
interesting mix of businesses: fashion outlets, a bead shop, comic books, an 
alternative-skewed Tower Records, as well as an art gallery with the obligatory 
artist's statement posted beginning, "My paintings are intensely personal 
internal dialogues. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The doorways to the shops are ragged holes in the walls, as if some robot was 
so anxious to buy a $60 grunge shirt he tore his way through the concrete. 
Actually I'm sure they're not grunge shirts anymore, but some variant 
representing a new movement I'm not yet hip to.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm hip to $60, though. One thing I've noticed is that the Anti-Mall doesn't 
take anti-money. They could at least take barter, so a kid walking in holding a 
brace of rabbits could walk out with that new Rancid CD. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the goods in the Lab shops may look trendy but are spiritually no 
different than those at the non-anti-malls. Namely, they're expensive duds made 
in Third World sweatshops by workers who only see pennies of the sale price, 
which is not an especially new way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The most encouraging thing to me at the Lab are the magazine and book racks at 
the Tower store. At the same time people are bemoaning the decline of literacy, 
there has been an explosion of magazines and journals on every subject 
imaginable, including several with new pointers for kids on how to rebel. 
</P>
<P>
 We had it made in the '60s. All we had to do to peeve our parents was let our 
hair grow over our ears and occasionally burn down a Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays kids have to go to wild extremes to get noticed, and it doesn't help 
that their jaded, Woodstock-raised parents have pot-dimmed memories. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the kid comes home from school with a scythe, saying, "Dad, I 
disemboweled the principal," the parent just says, "Yeah, yeah. We already did 
that in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ate his liver." 
</P>
<P>
 "Son! Don't you know dangerous nitrates accumulate in the organ meats?"  
</P>
<P>
 Short of actual mayhem, the young folk do finally seem to have staked out a 
domain of their own, one the rest of us may write about knowingly but don't 
enter. I'm talking about the Modern Primitives scene, which along with 
entailing getting complex, colorful tattoos that are actually larger than your 
body, also involves getting pierced.  
</P>
<P>
 Folks are piercing their noses, tongues, navels, nipples, eyebrows and some 
other very tender parts of the body -- parts I do my conscious best to keep at 
least six nautical miles away from any sharp objects, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't really see a good side to this: You set off metal detectors in 
airports; you attract lightning; and if kissing couples in the past thought it 
was tough when they got their braces locked, they ain't seen nothin' yet. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be misery, but at least it's their misery. Barbara Walters probably 
isn't going to get a nipple ring, and I'm right with her on that. Let the kids 
have it. If we adopt the look, they'll just have to take it one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I'd have to follow suit, and next thing I know I'd be impaled on a 
four-foot cargo hook, having a huge crane hoist me from one trendy coffeehouse 
to the next, as the kids look up with a dismissive glance and say, "Ugh, how 
retro!"

3-HOUR TOUR: FISH, FIREFIGHTING, OLYMPIANS: A WATERY VIEW OF LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos can be a shell of a place to visit: The World War II bombardier 
mannequin at Los Alamitos Museum is more than slightly shellshocked, there are 
oysters on the half shell at the Fish Co., and the turtles at nearby El Dorado 
Nature Center in Long Beach wear their shells proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 p.m.: Keep an eye out for specials at the Fish Co. 
</P>
<P>
 One assumes everything at the restaurant is fresh, so when items are listed as 
specials, perhaps they're extra fresh. And while oysters and swordfish are 
always on the menu, for instance, specials recently included Malpeque oysters 
from Prince Edward Island ($6.95) and local harpooned swordfish ($9.95), 
offered with a choice of two side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even "special" side dishes that are usually available: Fresh roasted 
garlic mashed potatoes came mixed with chopped green onions and topped with 
onion ringlets delicately fried. 
</P>
<P>
 A cup of Manhattan clam chowder ($2.95) proved pungent and picante , and the 
cup really has a handle so you can enjoy every last drop; also on the menu is a 
Blue Plate Special ($5.95) including chowder and a scoop of halibut salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Alaskan halibut is always available, but the restaurant had printed 
flyers announcing the arrival of halibut from Alaska that day. Who could resist 
a fish that wears both eyes on one side of its head? I passed on Dungeness crab 
cakes with whole-grain mustard sauce ($9.95) and swordfish with pine nuts and 
capers ($10.95); the halibut ($8.95) was mesquite-broiled with just a dash of 
butter and paprika. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:45: The Los Alamitos Museum usually focuses on local history. It has a 
permanent display about the Puvu Indians, for instance, who lived here 
thousands of years ago in tule-thatched huts called wickiups. More recently, in 
1947, the adobe brick building that now houses the museum opened as the local 
volunteer firehouse, and the old fire cart provides the museum's centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But right now the museum is taking on the world. This month director Margaret 
Kendrick launched a World War II exhibit and activities culminating next 
September with the 50th anniversary of Japan's surrender aboard the battleship 
Missouri. "The (war) didn't really end until the Berlin Wall fell," noted 
Kendrick. "But the generation involved with World War II won't be here much 
longer. I'm gathering written accounts, and I hope to leave a file folder for 
young people." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also gathering memorabilia. On display is a handkerchief bearing 
signatures, in Japanese and dated March 13, 1942, of Japanese American 
community leaders before they were sent to detention camps. The cloth was 
loaned by Yosh Fujimura of Los Alamitos, not a signer but also Japanese 
American. "His whole family was put into the camps," Kendrick said. "First he 
was in detention, then he fought in Italy with the Red Bull Division." A 
mannequin wears the leather and silk-lined uniform of a German bombardier 
loaned to the museum by one of its members. "She'd received it from a friend 
who fought over there and actually took it off a dead body," Kendrick said. 
"The suit has an electrical system. You can plug in batteries, and that kept 
them warm." The mannequin came from a local store. "He's a community effort," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also has a Los Alamitos Hall of Fame. Olympians include gymnast 
Cathy Rigby, divers Larry Andreasen and Patricia McCormick, and Wilbur 
Thompson, who won a gold medal for shotput at the 1948 games in London. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a bevy of swimmers: Lynne Cox, who swam the Bering Strait, the English 
Channel in record time and the 26 miles from Los Angeles to Catalina Island, 
and whose goggles from her crossing of New Zealand's Cook Strait in 1975 hang 
on the wall; Greta Anderson, the first woman to swim the English Channel, and 
freestyle silver medalist Ralph Flannegin, the youngest member of the U.S. 
Olympic swim team in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 "Must be something in the water," said Kendrick.  
</P>
<P>
 2:45 to 4: Turtles bask on wood planks floating in the lake, and swim beneath 
the bridge leading to the El Dorado Nature Center bookstore and gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside are books such as "The Yucky Reptile Alphabet Book" and a puzzle called 
"Pollution Patrol." In the adjoining museum are Madagascan hissing cockroaches, 
more than two inches in length but not found locally; an award-winning school 
science project about owls by a 10-year-old featuring literally hundreds of 
bleached mice, rat and gopher skulls, and displays including skunk scat and a 
snake skeleton.  
</P>
<P>
 The intimate trail system is dotted with benches. A shady one-mile trail 
starts out with gentle switchbacks leading to a platform eye level with the 
treetops. Those may not be flying squirrels sailing from branch to branch, but 
they sure look like it. There are power lines along one stretch, but soon you 
come to a cluster of fabulously gnarled trees, each looking like it could 
illustrate a Gothic novel, and each telling its own story. If you're lucky, 
you'll spot a gray fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-mile walk is perfectly lovely, the two-mile walk probably doubly so.

 ACT II: Maybe the thieves were opera buffs. Whatever the case, the truckload 
of scenery for Verdi's "Aida" stolen in Ontario last weekend was found 
Wednesday -- with everything safe. . . . The truck was carrying sets for use 
this weekend by Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Rob 
Foreman, an Opera Pacific carpenter, spotted the rig's trailer -- minus the cab 
-- on a rural road near Corona. He'll collect a $2,500 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 RULE OF THUMB: An Anaheim company has been refining fingerprint evidence. And 
it's got the attention this week of New Scotland Yard and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police among others worldwide at a conference at the Doubletree Hotel 
in Orange. . . . Printrak International Inc. manufactures computer equipment to 
identify people through fingerprints stored on centralized databases. The 
technique isn't just for detectives: The company says it's also aimed at 
regulation of immigration, gun purchases and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 DE-CLARKED: The county's old Transit District headquarters in Garden Grove, 
the Ralph B. Clark Building, has officially been turned over to the city of 
Garden Grove for its new city hall. So who was invited to make remarks at the 
ceremony Tuesday? Former County Supervisor Ralph B. Clark. . . . He quipped: 
"I've received some dubious honors in my time. Today I believe I become the 
first person in Orange County to decommission a building named in his honor." 
</P>
<P>
 DISCOVERING HELP: Homeowners may soon be able to pay their property taxes with 
a credit card. The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday is expected approve an 
agreement with Discovery Card Services that allows homeowners -- for a small 
fee -- to pay their taxes with the card. . . . Discovery is the only credit 
card company that allows the county to tack on a service fee to the bill so it 
is reimbursed for the transaction fee charged by credit companies. On an $800 
bill, for example, the county will charge an additional $5.

FILMMAKER HARRY SALTZMAN, 78; CO-PRODUCED JAMES BOND SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Saltzman, a Canadian who entered the film industry in the 1940s but did 
not become wealthy until 20 years later when he struck it rich in Britain as 
co-producer of the first James Bond classic, "Dr. No," died Wednesday at the 
American Hospital of Paris. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltzman had lived in the Paris area for several years after maintaining 
residences in England. A hospital spokesman confirmed his death for the 
Associated Press but would not release further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in St. John, New Brunswick, Saltzman was brought to the United States as 
an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered the movie business in the early 1940s and made his name as producer 
or co-producer of such thrillers as "Enemy Agent" in 1942 and the social dramas 
"Look Back in Anger" in 1959 and "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning" in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Britain, Saltzman launched the Bond series in the 1960s with 
co-producer Albert R. Broccoli. Their hits, mostly with Sean Connery as Agent 
007, included "Dr. No," "Goldfinger" "From Russia With Love," "Thunderball," 
"Diamonds Are Forever," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and "The Man With the 
Golden Gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership dissolved in the mid-1970s and Broccoli retained the rights to 
the lucrative series. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Saltzman productions included "The Entertainer," "The Ipcress File," 
"Funeral in Berlin," "Battle of Britain" and "Nijinsky" in 1979.

ARCHER GORDON; RENOWNED AS FATHER OF CPR TECHNIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Archer Gordon, the heart specialist considered the father of CPR whose family 
of life-sized mannequins helped thousands of people save tens of thousands of 
lives, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said Monday that Dr. Gordon, a onetime researcher at UCLA 
who came up with the idea of his "Resusci Family" while studying artificial 
respiration techniques under a Red Cross grant, was 73 when he died Sept. 18. 
He died of the complications of diabetes at a Thousand Oaks hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Pansy, raised three children during their 43 years in the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon was studying physiology at the University of Illinois as a young doctor 
in the late 1950s at a time when it was first being learned that mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation was far more effective than the then-prominent resuscitation 
method of back pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1960 he and others were expounding the merits of mouth-to-mouth combined 
with external compression. 
</P>
<P>
 To further his belief that "it is better to teach a lot of people a little CPR 
than to teach a lot to a few," he came up with the idea of the Resuscis: Anne, 
Andy and Baby, each physically correct for their sex and size. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the mannequins for mouth-to-mouth while also applying steady, rhythmic 
pressure on their breastbones, office workers, teachers and parents -- not just 
medical and rescue personnel -- were taught how to save the lives of heart 
attack, drowning, choking, electric shock and drug overdose victims. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Asmund Laerdal, a Norwegian doll maker, devised the lifelike dolls and 
Gordon produced dozens of training films and hundreds of articles on their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its early years -- the 1960s and '70s -- cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
was credited with saving 25% to 30% of victims if used in the first few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although known worldwide as the father of CPR, Gordon said that the 
resuscitation theories were worked out by a Johns Hopkins research team and he 
became identified with it through his work with mouth-to-mouth techniques and 
his mannequins -- saving lives by "playing with dolls," as wrote People 
magazine wrote in 1978.

REP. LEVY BEATEN IN N.Y. PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. David A. Levy lost the Republican congressional primary by 54 votes to 
maverick candidate Dan Frisa in the country's first upset of a GOP incumbent 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the official count was announced Wednesday, the first-term 
congressman asked the state Supreme Court to invalidate the election and order 
a new one, based on reports of voter irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 County Elections Commissioner Richard Blum said Frisa captured 12,487 votes to 
Levy's 12,433. Unofficial results from the Sept. 13 primary had showed Levy 
trailing Frisa by 276 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy is the first Republican and fourth incumbent to lose in a primary this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frisa, a former Republican assemblyman, ran independent of the GOP machine. He 
had been denied the nomination in 1992 and lost to Levy in that year's primary.

 It survived the Battle of Bladensburg and the Civil War, but a wind and rain 
storm toppled the venerable Lincoln Oak from its hillside perch. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree, believed to have sprouted around 1510, stood more than a hundred 
feet tall in Ft. Lincoln Cemetery in Maryland, bordering Washington. It 
received its name after Abraham Lincoln reviewed his troops during the Civil 
War from the shade of its spreading branches.

NEW LAW BANS AREA OFFSHORE DRILLING; ENVIRONMENT: IT EXTENDS STATE PROTECTIONS 
AGAINST THE PRACTICE TO WATERS OFF THE COUNTY THAT WERE LEFT UNPROTECTED BY 
PREVIOUS STATUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday signed into law a bill that for the first time 
extends state protections against offshore oil drilling to waters off Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, called the California Coastal Sanctuary Act of 1994, permanently 
bans offshore drilling along California's 1,100-mile coastline and replaces a 
hodgepodge of prohibitions already in effect for most of the state's shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's author, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), said he and 
others had fought for eight years for legislation to permanently protect the 
state's fragile shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that the uniform ban will protect the entire coastline, O'Connell 
singled out Ventura County as a main beneficiary because it was the only one 
left unprotected by the patchwork of previously adopted coastal sanctuary laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have a positive impact on Ventura County's tourism and fishing 
industries, and will further enhance the quality of life -- with less air 
pollution, fewer spills and less blight on the coastline," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that Gov. Wilson signed this legislation. It sends a signal that 
our coastline is not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State waters stretch out to sea for three miles until federal jurisdiction 
takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, O'Connell said, most oil drilling takes place on dry land. 
The drilling that does take place is in federal waters more than three miles 
from the coastline, he said, where other prohibitions against new drilling are 
in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell put the blame for Ventura County's exclusion from previous bans on 
former Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a conservative who routinely battles 
government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom McClintock had always managed to craft an exemption for Ventura County," 
he said. "He was protecting the oil companies -- to the detriment of tourism 
and commercial fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Stutzman, a spokesman for McClintock in his campaign for state controller, 
confirmed that his boss blocked inclusion of Ventura County in previous coastal 
sanctuary measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its impact on Ventura County, the new law is particularly 
timely in three other Southern California coastal counties -- Los Angeles, 
Orange and Santa Barbara -- where current drilling bans were set to expire Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 other counties ranging from Del Norte at the Oregon border to San Mateo, 
drilling could have resumed when existing pacts ran out in less than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson trumpeted the measure's benefits to the tourism and recreation 
industries, which depend upon unspoiled beaches to draw millions of visitors 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's coast is a treasure that attracts people from around the globe," 
Wilson said in a statement. "Its beauty . . . deserves protection from possible 
damage associated with future offshore oil and gas activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, existing oil and gas drilling may continue. But new 
ventures are banned permanently -- barring future changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's announcement came as a coalition of environmental groups blasted the 
governor for a record it said favored oil companies, campaign contributors and 
developers over the interests of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is trying to do some damage control here," said Michael Paparian, state 
director of the Sierra Club. "His environmental record for the past four years 
has been horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the coalition -- called Californians for Environmental Common 
Sense -- cited the Wilson Administration's response in cleaning up the massive 
Guadalupe oil spill by Unocal in San Luis Obispo County. Local officials 
complain the cleanup is inadequate and in itself harmful to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing the offshore drilling ban was the Western States Petroleum Assn., 
whose spokesman, Bill Duke, warned that the new law will have a chilling effect 
on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're unhappy to see the bill get signed," Duke said. "We think it's bad 
legislation to lock up any natural resource in perpetuity. Because nobody can 
say whether there will be a future shortage."

LAWYERS' SURVEY GIVES JURISTS HIGH RANKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Twenty-eight of Ventura County's 29 jurists have received ratings of "very 
good" or "outstanding" for their work in the past two years, concluded a survey 
of local lawyers released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura County Bar Assn.'s biennial judiciary poll, the lawyers ranked 
six county judges as outstanding, 22 as very good and one as satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusion of the survey is that the legal knowledge and the behavior of 
the Ventura County bench is very good, and it can easily compete with benches 
throughout the state in terms of reputation," said Steven Henderson, the 
association's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, based on the responses from 451 of the county's 1,300 lawyers, 
offered other insights into the county's judiciary: 
</P>
<P>
 * Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch, disqualified in April from hearing 
criminal cases by Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, received strong praise from 
prosecutors in Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal Judge John E. Dobroth, the only jurist elected to the county's 
lower court without first being appointed by the governor, was the lone judge 
not to receive a rating above satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 * No judge appointed or elected to the Municipal Court received an outstanding 
rating. But the association gave the highest rating to Dave W. Long, a court 
commissioner who sits on the Municipal Court, primarily handling small-claims 
matters and traffic and misdemeanor cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some imperfections, the poll is considered by most judges and lawyers 
interviewed Wednesday as a useful tool for gauging how attorneys view the 
county's judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to know how attorneys perceive judges, it's a good indicator," 
said Presiding Municipal Judge John R. Smiley, who was rated as very good. "It 
certainly is not how small-claims litigants view judges, or how traffic 
(defendants) view judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Other jurists saw the survey as having less value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the helpfulness is very, very minimal," said Superior Court Presiding 
Judge Melinda A. Johnson, despite her rating as an outstanding judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice to hear," Johnson said of her top ranking. "It gives you a 
good feeling if you get good marks." But she said she doubts that it has any 
other good use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous Ventura County Bar Assn. polls, this year's survey did not 
rate the judges on a scale of one to 10. Instead, the group tried to depict 
more accurately how local lawyers view the judges by rating them in five 
categories, ranging from unsatisfactory to outstanding. No judge in the county 
received an overall rating of unsatisfactory or below average, the two lowest 
benchmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll tends to confirm the notion that deputy prosecuting attorneys in the 
county disagree with Bradbury's decision to implement a rare legal challenge in 
April that blocked Judge Storch from presiding over criminal cases. Bradbury 
has called Storch, the county's longest-serving Superior Court judge, biased 
against his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised that the district attorneys, when honestly responding to 
their opinions of Judge Storch, believe his performance is outstanding," 
Assistant Public Defender Jean L. Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the deputy prosecutors rated Storch's performance as very good. 
Shortly after Bradbury issued his edict for his deputies to sign affidavits 
removing Storch from criminal cases, several of the prosecutors balked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johnson said the prosecutors were correct in not signing the affidavits. 
"And I think that they are still correct," she added. Storch, now supervising 
the civil court, refused to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defenders and prosecutors singled out Dobroth as the only judge without 
overall high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defenders rated Dobroth as being satisfactory in all seven criteria -- 
demeanor, settlement skills, efficiency, knowledge, impartiality, reputation 
and integrity and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also rated him as satisfactory for demeanor, settlement skills, 
impartiality and reputation. And private attorneys called him satisfactory in 
the area of impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobroth, who did not return a phone call, was defended by several colleagues. 
"I think he's a first-rate judge," said Long, a commissioner only 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Long said he was pleased the local group rated him 
outstanding. But he attributed his good score to his short tenure. "I haven't 
been there long enough to make the tough, unpopular decisions," he said by 
phone from Oklahoma, where he is vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long, 53, is one of two court commissioners who work under contract for the 
county. "I try not to preconceive ideas. I try to listen. I try to make 
decisions based on the evidence," the ex-Marine said. "I try to explain things 
so that if somebody wants to take me up on appeal, there will be a good 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 Others rated as outstanding all came from the Superior Court. They are: 
Richard D. Aldrich, since promoted to the state appeals court; Edwin M. 
Osborne, since retired; Judge Ken W. Riley, and Judge Steve Z. Perren. 
</P>
<P>
 On the performances of several judges, the lawyers disagreed widely. Take the 
case of Superior Court Judge William Peck's rating. 
</P>
<P>
 To public defenders he performs below average. To prosecutors, his performance 
is satisfactory. To private litigators, it is very good. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, Peck is considered to be very good by the group's rating system. 
Judicial Ratings The Ventura County Bar Assn. has rated the 29 county judges 
and court commissioners, ranking their performance from outstanding to 
satisfactory in several categories. Here are the overall ratings: SUPERIOR

TEST FLIGHT PLAN ANGERS RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to begin Navy flight testing a mile off Silver Strand beach has 
received the blessing of the Pentagon, infuriating residents who say jet noise 
and the fear of plane crashes would destroy their peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, unveiled by the service early last year, calls for Navy fighters 
and other aircraft to fly at high speed to the Port Hueneme Navy Base in 
simulated aerial missile attacks against a warship. 
</P>
<P>
 The flights are meant to test $90 million worth of radar equipment in an 
engineering laboratory -- itself built to resemble the hull of a large Navy 
vessel -- located on the base about 100 yards south of houses on Ocean Drive, 
the main thoroughfare of the Silver Strand neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy documents indicate that both the Navy-owned Lear jets and the F-14 Tomcat 
and F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets, which will be traveling at low altitudes and at 
speeds ranging between 400 and 600 m.p.h., would fly no more than 3,300 feet 
from the closest Silver Strand residence. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of the seaside neighborhood, whose origins date back to the 
1920s, say the test represents an unappealing and possibly dangerous prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Flying that low and that close to the houses represents a real danger in my 
mind," said Kevin Dickman, a 14-year resident. "If he hits one house, he'll 
likely take out a whole block, because our houses are so close together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's approval of the plan indicates that the project represents no 
significant impact to the environment, Navy officials said. It was approved 
Friday by Thomas J. Peeling, a special assistant to the deputy chief of naval 
operations. The finding is the Navy's final decision in the matter, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this decision says is that we have certified that we have met 
all local, state and federal environmental requirements," said Peter Becker, 
the project's engineer at the Naval Surface Warfare Engineering Facility at 
Port Hueneme. "I think local residents understand that we will not be flying 
planes over their houses." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy now must seek permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to 
conduct the tests, Becker said. FAA officials could not be reached for comment 
on when their decision might be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials Wednesday defended the tests, saying the chances of a crash 
were slight and that noise levels created by the tests were within state and 
federal legal limits. They added that about 80% of the flying would be done in 
the far quieter civilian Lear jet -- an aircraft normally used to carry 
business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme base officials also pointed to an approximate savings of $13 
million annually by conducting the tests onshore and not at sea using real 
warships and warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents insisted that the neighborhood would suffer if the tests were 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Walling said that when he and his wife moved into the neighborhood in 
1978, they found the occasional ship's horn romantic. But the idea of living 
with low-flying jets is something they didn't bargain for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's both a noise and a safety problem," Walling said. "Every once in a while 
a jet is lost, and they know it. It's not worth the risk to our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Kapuscik, general manager of the Channel Islands Community Services 
District -- a public agency that provides utility and other community services 
to the unincorporated county neighborhood -- said most residents and members of 
the agency's board of directors have expressed concern about the safety of the 
proposed flight testing and the increase in noise in the area by the jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some residents that are completely supportive of the Navy and we have 
others that are vehemently opposed to the plan," Kapuscik said. "Our board of 
directors has formally asked the Navy about the potential safety and 
environmental impacts -- we hope they've taken our concerns to heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say that if the FAA allows the flights, the jets will travel 
from the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station to the ocean off Silver Strand to 
simulate incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 At one mile offshore, the jets will make a sharp U-turn and head back out to 
sea. The Navy plan calls for 12 to 30 hours of aerial testing per month, and 
both local aviators and mariners will be given 24 hours notice before testing.

SANDBAR BREACHED AT WETLANDS; WILDLIFE: HEAVY RAINS DISRUPT HABITAT OF 
ENDANGERED SPECIES AT ORMOND BEACH. SOME BLAME DEVELOPMENT FOR TAMPERING WITH 
THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Left to its own devices, nature was more disruptive to the endangered species 
of Ormond Beach than a developer who pumped water from the area's pristine 
lagoons: storm runoff has now ruptured a sandbar and drained the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden breach surprised representatives of the Baldwin Co., who had spent 
about $40,000 siphoning water from their Ormond property, and 
environmentalists, who had argued that the sensitive habitat be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, officials from the Ventura County Flood Control District were 
laying a pipe to drain water from the area last Friday when they noticed it was 
already escaping into the sea. The breach was caused, they said, by last week's 
heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rainwater caused the lagoon to fill up . . .," said John Correa, an engineer 
for the flood control district. "High tide and the water level in the lagoon 
caused the sandbar to break. The lagoon drained down in a big hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Without human intervention, the sandbar would break every two or three years, 
according to state officials. The sandbar will take about six months to rebuild 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the district had bulldozed the sandbar each spring to cut an 
outlet for the lagoon, which captures water from Oxnard storm drains and Port 
Hueneme's Bubbling Springs Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district stopped the practice this year after environmentalists noted 
the presence of the endangered least tern, tidewater goby fish and other 
fragile wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Those species were undoubtedly harmed by the breach, environmentalists said, 
although they could not quantify the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also said that last week's break would not have occurred if Baldwin had 
not tampered with the wetlands in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Baldwin had not pumped all that water . . . it would not have breached," 
said Jean Harris of the Ormond Beach Observers. "It wasn't just nature that did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sanders of the Sierra Club said that nothing that happens at Ormond Beach 
can be considered natural anymore because there has been so much human contact 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much tampering with the ecological system down there," 
Sanders said. "A lot of the activity lately, like the Baldwin Co. pumping the 
wetlands, is related to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Malone, president of the Baldwin Co.'s Ventura and Los Angeles County 
division, angrily dismissed those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's totally preposterous," he said. "That's a cheap shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Phillips, a coastal biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
said the rupture is part of the normal ebb and flow of a wetlands area. There 
seemed to be no reason to suspect it was caused by human contact, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we know, the pressure got too high and blew (the sandbar) out," 
Phillips said. "It was a very productive area that was being used by a lot of 
sensitive species." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the California Coastal Commission ordered the Irvine-based 
Baldwin Co. to stop pumping the wetlands without a permit or face fines of up 
to $6,000 a day. The company eventually did, but not before workers had pumped 
enough water to dry out the 40 acres of flooded Baldwin land. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin has proposed building about 5,000 dwellings, a shopping center and a 
hotel on 1,200 acres in the Ormond Beach area.

FIREFIGHTERS ARE CLEARLY SOPHIE'S CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophie is a social cat. 
</P>
<P>
 She loves to greet the construction workers hammering at Vonise and Newton 
Friedman's Ventura home. She's usually unfazed by the mammoth remodeling 
project her owners launched seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Sunday, the 10-pound, coal-black kitty was startled by a platoon of 
noisy plumbers and accidentally fell down the chimney of an old fireplace that 
had been sealed with plywood and drywall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight Monday, eight Ventura firefighters sledgehammered a 
cat-sized hole through the brick chimney in the back of the Friedman's house 
and rescued the frightened feline. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way for the cat to get out," Fire Capt. Rodney Smith said. "It 
would have died in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friedmans had searched their house on Brodiea Avenue all day looking for 
Sophie, who they adopted from the Camarillo animal shelter only a few months 
ago. The 2-year-old cat's cries initially led them to believe she was hiding 
underneath the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard this very faint meowing in the corner of the living room and I 
thought, 'Oh my God, Sophie is trapped under the house,' " Vonise Friedman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she heard the meek meow coming from behind the recently plastered 
wall, she started to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting this Edgar Allan Poe feeling," she said. "I knew this cat was 
in the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure how to extricate the pet, the Friedmans called the Fire Department, 
which in turn called in a special rescue squad with heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had two choices," Vonise Friedman said. "Cut the drywall or sledgehammer 
from the outside. They made a decision to sledgehammer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the rescue was accomplished in about 10 minutes. But there were tense 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the actual hole was there, there was a moment of suspense," she said. 
"Then one of the guys yelled, 'I can see her eyes!' and she just kind of 
crawled out." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the rescue workers also were afraid the scared cat would not come 
out after all of the pounding. "But the owner got down on her hands and knees 
and started calling and the cat came," he said. "She was in real good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the curious cat must have fallen about 20 feet down the chimney, 
and could have been trapped in the small dark space for up to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Vonise Friedman said she worried that the firefighters could not -- or would 
not -- rescue her cat, knowing that fire departments no longer pull cats from 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 While cats can usually find their way down from a tree, Smith said, Sophie's 
dilemma was not unusual. The Fire Department has responded to similar pet 
rescues in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not something that happens everyday," he said. "But we do go out on a 
few every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just very service-oriented," Smith said. "We try to do anything we can 
to help somebody who is in any need -- including cats."

 A jury pool . . . or a jury ocean?When a questionnaire for jury duty in 
Compton was mailed to Lawanda Bennekin, her father-in-law, Anthony Jones, wrote 
back that Bennekin now lives in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "A week later the form was returned with a handwritten explanation that the 
form hadn't been completed," Jones said. So, he completed the form and sent 
another letter of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 A jury summons for Bennekin arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what Jones wants to know: "Can you find out if they still pay 5 cents a 
mile? After all, it's only 5,081 miles each way." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 On the other hand: Maybe, in the case of the O.J. Simpson trial, it wouldn't 
be such a bad idea to import jurors from other countries.

</P>
<P>
 Weary of Robert Shapiro and the rest of them?Maybe you should mute the sound 
of the trial on your TV set and listen to "Guilty or Not Guilty," a tape just 
released by Albert & Davis Production Co. 
</P>
<P>
 It's described as "instrumental music which lets one hear the hurried 
heartbeat of Los Angeles, and visualize how the media and the public have been 
enthralled by the city's perilous pace. . . . Hear the beating of the drum 
match the pulse of our hearts as the tragic drama unfolds."

<P>
 Being 5,081 miles from L.A. does have its advantages.

 At least it's not checkbook journalism: When a pilot crashed on the White 
House lawn earlier this month, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune was obviously 
determined to run an official shot of the area. So a staffer pulled one out of 
his wallet. We wonder if any readers momentarily thought they had received 
something more valuable than a coupon with their newspaper.

 Or maybe we were just seeing things: Not long ago, we mentioned a 
news-oriented billboard that proclaimed: "You Can't Do This With Just Any 
Camcorder" -- and showed an image of a black-and-white police car in the

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OFFICIALS MAKE PITCH FOR CRIME BILL AID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to jump-start their applications for federal crime bill funds, Ventura 
County law enforcement officials flew to Washington on Wednesday to explain 
their needs to Justice Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice officials met for about 90 minutes with representatives from the 
Ventura County district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department, the police 
departments of Oxnard, Santa Paula and Ventura and the city of Simi Valley in 
the office of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a Gallegly spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Fois, assistant to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, and Reggie Robinson, a deputy 
assistant attorney general, explained to Ventura County officials the grants 
available under the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill offers money to pay for extra police officers, community policing 
plans and programs meant to divert youths from drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a positive meeting . . . to allow some direct give and take 
with the Department of Justice regarding the various grant programs that are 
involved in the crime bill, and for Ventura County to make its case," Simi 
Valley Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said the meeting should help plant Ventura County's needs firmly in 
the minds of the Justice Department officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that there's any other county in the country that's got a head start 
on working with Justice quicker than Ventura County has," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said the meeting also should guarantee a fair shake in the grant 
review process for Oxnard, Santa Paula and Ventura, which applied last year for 
crime-fighting aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department officials told the group that they expect to award 
grants in the first round of applications within the next four to six weeks, 
and to award money on new applications several months later, Sedell said. MACK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUIT SETTLED OVER MISLEADING MAILERS 
</P>

<P>
 A Los Angeles company agreed Wednesday to pay an $8,000 fine to settle a civil 
complaint alleging that its employees sent phony invoices for office equipment 
repair to Ventura County churches and businesses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson signed the judgment against Integrated 
Design Products, which does business as I.D.P., after an investigation by the 
Ventura County district attorney's office and the filing of a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the judgment, the company did not admit to wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil suit alleged that I.D.P. mailed solicitations disguised as invoices 
to the accounting departments of churches and businesses, most of them real 
estate agencies, in Ventura, Port Hueneme, Moorpark and other cities throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Schwartz said the solicitations appeared to be 
bills for renewals of maintenance contracts for office equipment such as 
laminators and binding machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "A business could think this is a bill for a service that they had in the past 
and now this is the renewal," he said. "That's why it's illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 such letters were mailed, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the businesses that received the solicitations in Ventura County, only 
the Ventura Regional Sanitation District is known to have paid money to I.D.P., 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district paid $410 on two occasions, he said, but the money was later 
refunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Harris, who identified himself as the president of I.D.P., denied that the 
company did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm agreed to pay the $8,000, he said, to avoid a costly legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's either pay $8,000 or pay $25,000 to defend myself," he said. "Under the 
advisement of my attorney, it wasn't worth me questioning." JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TEEN-AGER STABBED IN PARKING LOT

<P>
 A teen-ager who escaped serious injury in possible gang gunfire last Easter 
was stabbed when several suspected gang members attacked him in his 
girlfriend's parked convertible, sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Laviada, 18, of Thousand Oaks, suffered several minor stab wounds in the 
confrontation about 10 p.m. Tuesday in the Taco Bell parking lot on East 
Avenida De Los Arboles, Sheriff's Detective Ernie Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laviada, who was treated and released from Los Robles Regional Medical Center, 
was in the passenger seat of the car when a group of eight to 10 males 
assaulted him with broken bottles and a screwdriver, Montagna said. He said the 
most serious wound was to the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, a 16-year-old Thousand Oaks girl, was not injured in 
the incident, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 3, Laviada was a passenger in a car on Lynn Road when a gunman in 
another vehicle fired a pistol at him about 4 a.m., Montagna said. He said 
Laviada suffered a minor wound when the bullet ricocheted off the headrest and 
grazed the back of his head. No suspect was identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in Tuesday's attack had arrived at the Taco Bell in three 
pickups and a sedan, Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects were in custody, nor had detectives established a motive, he said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY OKS $1,000 GRANT TO SUBSIDIZE 
DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members this week aired their oratorical skills in grand 
fashion: They spent half an hour debating about a debate. 
</P>
<P>
 They were supposed to be discussing whether to grant $1,000 to subsidize a 
televised election forum featuring all 16 council candidates.And in the end, 
they unanimously approved the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, they argued sharply about whether the debate -- sponsored by the 
Chamber of Commerce and the League of Women Voters -- would be truly 
nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming that the questions would be "pro-business" and therefore slanted, 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said she wanted the council to consider subsidizing 
other debates that might focus on issues such as sports facilities, crime or 
neighborhood preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone would accuse (Chamber President Steve) Rubenstein of 
being nonpartisan," said Zeanah, adding that she considers herself a target of 
chamber electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who is also running for reelection, scoffed at 
the idea that the League of Women Voters and Chamber of Commerce would hold a 
biased forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "If for some reason they have chosen to focus on business questions, well, 
it's necessary for all of us to be able to respond to those," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will be held Oct. 13 in the Forum Theater, from 7 to 9 p.m. Each 
candidate will make a two-minute opening and one-minute closing statement and 
field questions from the audience. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Amber Boyman of Simi Valley might have lost sleep when she got up about 3 a.m. 
Wednesday to feed her baby. But she also saved about $2,500, the value of her 
stolen Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of auto theft after the pre-dawn incident was Pedro I. 
Chavez, 19, of Los Angeles, Simi Valley Police Sgt. Mike King said. Boyman's 
1984 Chevrolet Z28 was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyman, while feeding her infant, heard someone pulling her car away from her 
house on the 1500 block of Los Amigos Avenue. She quickly called police, King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Officer Matt Hopkins stopped the vehicle on the eastbound Simi Valley 
Freeway and took the suspect into custody without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bruce Macedo said Chavez was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$5,000 bail. He is to be arraigned Friday. GREG RIPPEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Harbor area will get a new storefront police station, according to 
an agreement between the City Council and the Ventura Port District. 
</P>
<P>
 Police presence at the harbor began this summer as a three-month experiment, 
Port District General Manager Richard W. Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt it worked," Parsons said. "They were just able to head off an 
awful lot of problems before they even developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Richard D. Thomas of the Ventura Police Department said the summer 
experiment was successful, resulting in 18 arrests in one month and greater 
safety in the harbor and surrounding residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the agreement unanimously Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port District will pay the city $67,992 per year for the officer, in 
addition to providing free office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront police station will occupy a site that had been used for 
storage. It is still unfinished and will probably open in a month or two, 
Parsons said. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 WOMEN AVOID TRIAL UNDER '3 STRIKES' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding the punishment would not fit the crime, prosecutors on Wednesday said 
that two Ventura County women accused of low-level felony drug offenses will 
not be prosecuted under the state's tough new "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's defense attorney, Timothy Quinn, quickly commended prosecutors for 
using proper discretion in reaching the decisions.But Quinn also said district 
attorney officials never should have considered prosecuting the women under the 
three strikes law, which requires a prison sentence of 25 years to life upon 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed that this is even considered in these cases," he said. "To me, 
it's clearly not appropriate to incarcerate someone for life for possessing a 
small amount of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors can charge felony defendants -- even those accused of nonviolent 
crimes -- under the new law if the accused people have two prior serious or 
violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Monday that Angela Alfaro, 35, of Port Hueneme, and Patricia 
Martinez, 30, of Ventura, would not be charged under three strikes because they 
are not accused of committing violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro is charged with possessing a quarter gram of cocaine after the drugs 
were found on a man riding in her car Aug. 3, Port Hueneme police said. In 
1980, she was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of 13 felonies 
in connection with a brutal gang rape. She helped some men lure the victim to a 
small party for the attack, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Alfaro, Martinez faces a charge of drug possession. She has prior 
convictions for burglary and robbery stemming from a house break-in about 10 
years ago, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, each woman would face a maximum of six years in prison. DWAYNE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNTY INVESTS IN AQUARIUM STUDY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors agreed Tuesday to put $6,000 toward studying a plan 
to build an aquarium at Channel Islands Harbor, but cautioned that they could 
not afford to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very expensive to construct, they are very expensive to maintain," 
Supervisor Vicky Howard said."And if they're not maintained properly, they're 
not an attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard merchants hope an aquarium would draw new customers to the quaint shops 
around the harbor. Ventura is considering a similar project at its harbor 
complex a few miles up Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will join the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme in funding an 
intensive, $16,000 study of a possible Channel Islands aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Two consultants, working with a local committee, will recommend the size of 
the facility, the type of exhibits and the potential attendance it could 
generate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is simply putting together a concept, seeing generally what will work -- 
and what won't work -- at Channel Islands Harbor," Supervisor John K. Flynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the concept is approved, consultants would then assess the costs and means 
of financing the project, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be an opportunity; it may not be a good opportunity. You have to 
explore," Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg told the board. 
"We're certainly not looking at subsidizing this. That would be the last thing 
we need." PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

<P>
 Determined to rebuild Piru from the devastating Jan. 17 earthquake, Ventura 
County leaders are considering a special redevelopment agency that would grant 
loans and launch projects in the blighted area. 
</P>
<P>
 California law allows communities to create such agencies after a disaster and 
when they can demonstrate a need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can definitely say Piru is blighted at this point," said Marty 
Robinson, the county's deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to pay $15,000 for a study of the 
plan's feasibility. The study will be conducted by the Rosenow Spevacek Group 
Inc. of Santa Ana with money from the county's federal disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "California redevelopment law allows a window of opportunity to create a 
redevelopment agency after a disaster," Supervisor Maggie Kildee wrote in a 
letter to her colleagues. "This agency could serve as a tool to assist in the 
economic recovery of Piru." PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

VOLUNTEERS READY FOR BUSINESS AT NEW POLICE STOREFRONT STATION; MOORPARK: ONE 
OF THE GROUP'S TASKS IS TO HELP IMPROVE THE DEPARTMENT'S IMAGE WITH THE LARGELY 
LATINO COMMUNITY DOWNTOWN.

 With the mugs of Moorpark's most wanted staring down at them from a wall, 
about 20 volunteers for the city's new downtown police storefront fumbled with 
fingerprinting kits in one of their last training sessions before the station 
opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers gathered in the basement of the East Valley Sheriff's Station 
for their training, which was conducted by Senior Deputy Ed Tumbleson. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which included retirees, students, an insurance agent, janitor, 
businessman and school bus driver, shared the common desire to keep Moorpark -- 
which has the lowest crime rate in the county -- safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and I think the crime problem blossomed 
there because people didn't get involved," said Catherine Lousen, 38, a real 
estate appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Lousen said she became involved because she wanted to do volunteer work and 
because she had an interest in helping local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm usually one of the first ones to call the police when something is going 
on," she said. "I usually know when something's wrong. I have a sixth sense 
about crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will do very little, if any, crime-stopping. In their new 
uniforms -- a white polo shirt with the city seal embroidered on, highlighted 
with "Moorpark Police Department, Resource Center Volunteer" -- the volunteers 
will mostly be answering questions from residents and passing out information 
on crime prevention. They will also provide such services as child 
fingerprinting and engraving identification on bicycles and other personal 
items to prevent theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers' most important task, said Lt. Martin Rouse, who heads the 
Sheriff's Department's Moorpark Enforcement Division, is to make contact with 
the community downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Being downtown, you with your white shirts are going to do more to make our 
presence known than any pamphlets or flyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will help improve the department's image with the largely 
Latino community in the downtown area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a positive influence in the community," said Jonas Casas, a burly 
volunteer who works nights as a custodian for the Moorpark Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas said he was interested in law enforcement and excited about 
volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent all my 26 years in Moorpark and I figured it was time to give 
something back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas is also taking classes in the administration of justice at Moorpark 
College and considering a career in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The small station where Casas and the other volunteers will work consists of a 
desk, a few chairs, a computer and telephone in the front portion of a formerly 
abandoned bank building that the city owns on the corner of Moorpark Avenue and 
High Street. The rest of the building will be used by Charles Abbott & 
Associates, an engineering firm under contract to the city to conduct building 
and safety inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will be open from noon until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; 
volunteers will rotate four-hour shifts through the week. Deputies on patrol 
will use the office to type up and file crime reports and occasionally 
interview suspects and witnesses, Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped that the hours could be increased as more people come forward 
to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening ceremonies at the new station will be at 11:30 a.m. Saturday after the 
Moorpark Country Days parade.

CITY COUNCIL RIVALRY FLARES OVER REGULATING PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS; THOUSAND 
OAKS: FIORE GETS RILED DURING DEBATE ON ZUKOWSKI'S PROPOSAL FOR A NEW APPRAISAL 
SYSTEM IN MUNICIPAL REAL ESTATE DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A running fight between Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore and two council 
colleagues has flared again -- this time over whether taxpayers get ripped off 
when the city sells its surplus real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the city real estate transactions as both profitable and honorable, 
Fiore lashed out at Councilwomen Jaime Zukowski and Elois Zeanah during a 
debate Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not understand why we continue to try to fix something that's not 
broke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore's angry remarks sounded a familiar theme. For the past year, he has 
accused Zeanah and Zukowski of trying to undermine city government by hinting 
that the political Establishment has engaged in shady dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 The two councilwomen say they are only trying to open up an insular political 
system and insist they are not accusing anyone of wrongdoing. By proposing 
reforms, they say, they hope to renew public trust in government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want not to even give the appearance of impropriety," Zukowski said during 
the heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But such explanations rile Fiore. And his anger crested Tuesday, when he 
blasted Zukowski's proposal to shake up the way the city buys, sells and 
evaluates land. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are insinuations week after week, month after month, that someone is 
doing something untoward in this city and we better double- and triple-check 
our policies," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone could point to an example, and could say, 'You blew $15 million on 
this,' or 'You stole that,' or 'You gave a sweetheart deal here,' that would be 
one thing," Fiore added. "But this is nothing but innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski had argued that the city should seek at least two appraisals -- at a 
cost of $5,000 to $25,000 apiece -- before buying or selling any major parcel. 
And she called again Tuesday for a citizens panel to select a group of 
qualified appraisers who would take turns calculating land values for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority shot down Zukowski's proposal. Instead, Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar suggested putting the city's current, informal procedures in writing. 
That compromise won unanimous support. 
</P>
<P>
 The city owns 550 pieces of land, but most are just slivers acquired to widen 
streets or build sidewalks. Major land holdings include the former city hall at 
401 W. Hillcrest Drive, which is up for sale; the 11-acre parcel next to the 
Civic Arts Plaza, which has been set aside for private development; and the old 
Goebel Center on Conejo School Road, which temporarily houses Alliance for the 
Arts fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 In calling for changes to the city's land-sale procedures, Zeanah and Zukowski 
focused on the controversial appraisal of the old city hall on Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are counting on selling that building for at least $13 million 
to pay construction bills at the Civic Arts Plaza. The appraiser who valued the 
parcel that high assumed that the land would be rezoned to allow moderate 
commercial or residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zeanah and Zukowski criticized that appraisal as misleading, because it 
relies on hypothetical zoning not yet approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiore countered that no one would buy the parcel with its present zoning 
as public land -- a designation reserved for city-owned facilities. So the 
appraiser was right to estimate its value as a commercial or residential site, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you think about property values doesn't make a hill of beans," he told 
Zeanah, "because you're not in real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski's proposed reform earned support from two local real estate brokers, 
including council candidate Chuck Morsa. Candidate Ekbal Quidwai also voiced 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. Mark Sellers warned that some of Zukowski's suggestions -- such 
as publicizing every appraisal the city conducts -- could end up costing 
taxpayers.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you create a lot of fanfare about wanting to acquire a property, another 
buyer can come in . . . and run up the price," Sellers said. "That's certainly 
a risk of so much openness."

BOARD'S PLAN TO HIRE TEACHER AIDES CRITICIZED; SIMI VALLEY: DISTRICT CONSIDERS 
ADDING 10 PEOPLE TO HELP INSTRUCTORS IN CROWDED CLASSES. BUT SOME SAY THAT 
WOULD ONLY AGGRAVATE THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After eliminating 24 teaching jobs last spring to balance the budget, the Simi 
Valley school board is considering hiring 10 teachers' aides to help overworked 
instructors in the district's most crowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has angered teachers and students in the Simi Valley Unified 
School District. They argue that it fails to address the problem of too many 
students in 78 of the district's junior high and high school classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 At a board meeting Tuesday night, some teachers said placing inexperienced 
aides in crowded classes would only add to the problem because teachers would 
have to spend time giving them instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aides come to us untrained," junior high school math teacher Susan Mussack 
told the board. "It is a Band-Aid and it is going to make things worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, 10 junior high and high school classes with more than 38 
students would receive one hour of instructional aid per day, at a total daily 
cost of about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified's contract with the teachers' union states that the 
district will make "every reasonable effort" to keep class size below 36 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 While no elementary school classrooms are above the limit, district officials 
said 36 junior high and 42 high school classes have more than 36 students. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have also recommended that classes for U.S. history, 
algebra and 12th-grade English be added at Royal High School. Under the 
proposal, the three classes would be taught by teachers who would earn extra 
money for working during their preparation periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to vote on the recommendations at its Oct. 18 meeting. 
In the meantime, district officials are seeking responses from the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators at Tuesday night's meeting voiced frustration with the proposals. 
"We are not interested in aides in the classroom," said Ron Myren, president of 
the Simi Educators Assn. "We want lower class size." 
</P>
<P>
 But some board members said it is difficult to come up with money for more 
teachers in the face of dwindling state education funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no easy solution," board member Judy Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Debbie Sandland said the district should make cuts elsewhere to 
come with money for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should be hiring teachers -- that is the simplest solution," 
Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a deficit of about $3 million looming next school year, hiring more 
teachers would be too costly, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we add more teachers, we would be right back where we were when we made 
these tough decisions," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. "This deficit has us in a 
dangerous position." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the crowding is due in part to the reduction of 
teaching positions last spring to balance the district's $77-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must acknowledge that classes are going to be larger if we have less 
teachers," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. "That was clearly pointed out when we 
made that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peggy Noisette, a French teacher at Valley View Junior High School, said 
the decision was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't need to cut 24 people last year," she said. "If they would have 
kept them, they would not have this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students told board members the burgeoning class sizes create problems -- 
such as a shortage of chairs in some classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one of my classes, if you are late, you sit on the floor," said student 
board representative Alecia Burlie, a senior at Royal High School enrolled in 
several crowed classes. 
</P>
<P>
 While required classes such as algebra and history are packed, some 
specialized upper-level courses have relatively few students enrolled this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven junior high and high school classes have fewer than 22 students, 
officials said. Since many of those courses, such as advanced placement French 
and physics, are needed for college entrance requirements, the district does 
not intend to change those class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 One course at Royal High School -- world history -- would be dissolved under 
the district's plan. Six students who need the class to graduate would have to 
complete the course through independent study or take it during summer school, 
officials said.

 Designer Isaac Mizrahi flew into Restaurant 44 in New York's Royalton Hotel 
the other day, wearing his trademark bandanna headband and dark glasses. While 
lunching with an attractive Conde Nast editor, Mizrahi threw himself around, 
reports our New York observer, complaining of "collection block." Hmmm. Is that 
sort of like a writer's block, only you can't think of any colors?  
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, the curly haired, bridge-playing designer seemed reassured by the 
editor's doubtlessly kind words. Frankly, with the unveiling of his spring 
collection only a month away, we would have told Isaac to stop kvetching and 
start sewing.

 Critical Thinking: We often have a chance to glimpse the world through the

"He looks like Billy Ballerina," she muttered.

 Fashion Vortex: Stuck in a nasty traffic jam in Beverly Hills on Friday, we 
slathered on our ruby-red lipstick, took several deep cleansing breaths and 
proceeded to watch the world go by -- 90210-style. The source of this glittery 
bottleneck? A great white whale of a Bentley temporarily beached at Rodeo Drive 
and Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic cops were turning away Bentleys, Jaguars, even battered Volvos from 
the southbound entrance to the Regent Beverly Wilshire's motor court -- much to 
the horror of fashion-hungry women heading for I. Magnin's "France La 
Magnifique" show. Accustomed to being impossibly late, we applied perfume and 
practiced saying Juh voo dray oon van rouge, see voo play.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the show (co-hosted by Harper's Bazaar and the Costume Council) went 
on, framed by a trompe l'oeil Arc de Triomphe. The audience especially seemed 
to like France's more provocative designers, Thierry Mugler and Karl Lagerfeld. 
But we preferred the solid chocolate Eiffel Tower that sat saucily atop our

 Twin Pinkies: Although the fiberglass showgirls were stunning, two live

of Design and Merchandising. Making their entrance like a Doublemint Gum 
commercial gone awry were L.A.'s own magenta-haired art maven Joan Quinn and 
her dear friend, London's pink-haired Zandra Rhodes. "We go way back, we used 
tohave desks next to each other," said Joan, as if that was supposed to explain

 High-Rent District: Speaking of show biz, James Cameron's "Strange Days," 
filming in L.A., recently called for the wardrobing of about 100 extras. They 
were cast as international diplomats attending a New Year's Eve party, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's costumer found a trove of glamorous gowns at Starlit Soiree, the 
Westside rental boutique visited by plenty of practical Hollywood types before 
their own high-profile soirees. "The costumer didn't want anything with padded 
shoulders -- which she thought would be out by 1999," said owner Sherry Morgan. 
"And no royal blue." Do we detect a fashion prediction in there? "No," Morgan 
said. "I think some of it's just personal preference."

 What About Reagan Red?: Speaking of color, it's been said that Washington 
women are slowly abandoning their drab and dowdy wardrobes. Well, here's proof: 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her supporters are on the campaign trail in bright 
colors. Really bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein showed up Sunday at her Beverly Hilton fund-raiser in a vivid 
emerald-green suit and brightly colored scarf. Fellow Sen. Patty Murray turned 
out in purple. Supporters Joy Picus and Abigail Van Buren each wore vivid coral 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that bright colors boost one's power quotient? With the exception 
of Feinstein, we noticed that many of the women politicos are short. At just 5 
feet tall, Murray had to stand on a box to reach the microphone. But who could 
miss her in that suit?

 Stage Fright: The supermodels have returned to Europe, showing up in the 
oddest places and the oddest styles before the spring/summer '95 collections 
begin next month. Our Parisian friend reported seeing two of the biggest stars 
of the catwalk this week on a techno-dance television show. A "way blond, way 
tanned" Linda Evangelista introduced model-author-singer Naomi Campbell, who 
lip-synced her new record before a throng of screaming French teens. 
Evangelista spent the rest of the show playing deejay. "Very Eurotrashy," 
declared our friend.

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; RIB-TICKLING TALES OF LOOPY CHARACTERS; BARREL

 Fortunately, not every page of "Barrel Fever" will leave you laughing so hard 
that it's impossible to breathe -- thank goodness for the droll but manageable 
Table of Contents -- but still, this is one of those "Open at your own risk" 
books. Composed of 12 stories and four essays, "Barrel Fever" is wacky writing 
par excellence: original, acid and wild. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time author David Sedaris is familiar to listeners of National Public 
Radio's "Morning Edition" as the occasional apartment-cleaning, Santa-assisting 
commentator whose monologues have been known to stop rush hour traffic. The 
good news is, his flat, uninflected voice translates perfectly into print; he's 
just as funny to read as he is to listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and theorists are always going on about "the nature of comedy" or "the 
concept of humor." Usually the words surprise and rigidity come up to explain 
why a character or situation tickles an audience into guffaws and knee-slaps. 
We laugh at the unexpected or when a man or woman, oblivious to the dynamism of 
life, tries unsuccessfully to remain static in a fluid context. 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of both classical elements in "Barrel Fever." In the opening 
story, "Parade," for instance, the unnamed narrator is telling his side of a 
long saga after an appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show": the teary breakup of 
his affair with Charlton Heston; the joys of the new relationship with Mike 
Tyson, complicated by Tyson's insistence that their new Persian/Himalayan 
kitten be named Pitty Ting. To say that Sedaris plays this material straight is 
to do it a disservice; deadpan is probably the more appropriate term. 
</P>
<P>
 The same technique of inserting bizarre twists into an otherwise cliched 
melodrama works beautifully in "My Manuscript," a coming-of-age saga Genet 
would appreciate, and in "Season's Greetings," a Christmas letter from hell. In 
the latter story a woman relates a past year that includes, among many other 
events, the sudden appearance of her husband's illegitimate and very grown-up 
Vietnamese daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recall mistaking her for a Trick-or-Treater! She wore, I remember, a skirt 
the size of a beer cozy, a short, furry jacket, and, on her face, enough rouge, 
eye shadow, and lipstick to paint our entire house, inside and out. She's a 
very small person and I mistook her for a child, a child masquerading as a 
prostitute." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Jamboree," a boy idolizes his older sister Vicki, a girl with far-fetched 
ambitions to be a singing sensation. "I can recall listening to her practice 
all alone in her room, holding a stick of deodorant in place of a microphone. 
Her voice was nothing special but she never allowed that fact to dampen her 
spirits. . . . I watched as she stood before the mirror, brushing out her hair 
and challenging her reflection. 'You are a singer, at the top of your game. You 
call the shots, nobody but you.' She would then change her clothes three of 
four times while discussing her future and all the records she would release. I 
would observe her, lying on the bed with a stuffed animal and see that as a 
record cover: Vicki: The Early Years or Playfully Yours, Vicki! I had it all 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is more than Vicki did. In fact, she wound up married to a loser, with a 
baby she didn't want. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath their zany discontinuities, Sedaris' characters are often painfully 
vulnerable, substituting a stubborn belief in the inevitability of a happy 
ending for clear sight. No one is more susceptible to this penchant than the 
author himself, as he switches from fiction to confessional essays at the end 
of "Barrel Fever." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice is distinctive -- kind of Dave Barry meets Woody Allen -- as it 
confides his adventures as a New York apartment cleaner, a would-be contributor 
to Giantess (don't ask) magazine, and especially as a sardonic elf at Macy's 
before Christmas. "I prefer being frank with children. I'm more likely to say, 
'You must be exhausted,' or 'I know a lot of people who would kill for that 
little waistline of yours.' I am afraid I won't be able to provide the grinding 
enthusiasm Santa is asking for. I think I'll be a low-key sort of elf." 
</P>
<P>
 "The SantaLand Diaries" is an appropriate finale to "Barrel Fever" for it is 
both the funniest section of a very funny book and an example of what lifts 
Sedaris' humor to a sweet and intellectual plane. No matter what their quirks 
or excuses, we can't help but side with these loopy, self-deluding men and 
women as they bear down and examine their lives. I mean, hey, if we had been 
dealt their cards . . . there but for fortune might well go you and I.

 The Scene: The West Coast benefit premiere of Gramercy's "Jason's Lyric" at 
the Mann National in Westwood. A party followed at the Sunset Strip's House of 
Blues for the film director Doug McHenry called "the first black Generation X 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Hollywood's African American community turned out for McHenry 
and the film. Co-star Eddie Griffin said: "It looks like a mix of the Oscars 
and the MTV Music Awards if they were held in Ethiopia." On hand were stars 
Allen Payne, Jada Pinkett and Treach Criss; director McHenry, and producer 
George Jackson. Among the 1,500 guests were Magic Johnson, Denzel Washington, 
Will Smith, Jasmine Guy, Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur, Polygram's Alain Levy and 
Michael Kuhn, and Gramercy's Russell Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statement: Pepa, of the singing group Salt 'n' Pepa, turned heads in a 
rubber, fuchsia-and-pink halter mini-dress. The outfit fits ultra skin-tight, 
which means powder is required to slide it on. It also needs a special spray to 
gloss the rubber. "It's a package deal," Pepa said. "You get the dress, the 
powder and the spray -- then you are ready !" 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: The VIP party was in the House of Blues' upstairs Foundation 
rooms -- a comfy layout decorated with relics from a South Indian maharajah's 
palace, velvet couches, burning incense and Hindu icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $150 each. More than $50,000 went to the Magic 
Johnson Foundation and the United Negro College Fund. Johnson said what he 
learned from running his charity (which has distributed more than $3.5 million 
to various causes) "is a lot of great organizations I thought were running 
smoothly need money." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Passed trays of chicken on skewers, catfish bites, ribs and, more 
exotically, blackened ahi tuna on cucumber rounds with wasabi and red ginger. 
The ahi shows, said sous chef Rob Peters, "there's more to Southern blues 
cooking than back-yard barbecue." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "If I put Jason in Cosbyland, the brothers would be saying 'He's got 
no problems,' " director McHenry said. "So I put him in a blue-collar 
environment. He's not a gangster. He doesn't become a rap singer. He deals with 
crime and other problems while trying to get from here to somewhere. And that's 
what people can relate to."

CITY HALL NEWS: ALHAMBRA; TRASH HAULERS GET REPRIEVE ON LIABILITY ISSUE; IN 
LIEU OF REQUIRING GARBAGE COLLECTORS TO BUY INSURANCE POLICIES, OFFICIALS ASK 
THE COMPANIES FOR IDEAS ON HOW TO PROTECT THE CITY FROM LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After hearing complaints from local trash haulers, the City Council on Monday 
backed down temporarily from requiring commercial garbage collectors to insure 
the city against liability claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council, acting as the city's redevelopment agency, voted 5 to 0 
to approve a trash-hauling ordinance that sidestepped the insurance requirement 
and asked the city's 15 trash hauling companies to come up with their own plans 
to help the city stave off potential lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial trash haulers have 30 days to work out an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This additional time will allow us to come up with a pretty creative plan of 
action," said City Manager Julio Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that the haulers understand that we are still very interested 
in the indemnity issue," added Mayor Boyd Condie. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for city trash haulers claimed a cautious victory following 
the two-hour hearing at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the main item that we didn't want to see in there was taken out," 
Larry Salazar, executive director of the Greater Los Angeles Solid Waste 
Management Assn., said of the ordinance's indemnity requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar and many of the 20 people who spoke against the proposed ordinance 
argued that smaller trash haulers would be forced out of business if they had 
to pay insurance that would indemnify the city against potential lawsuits. They 
charged that under the proposed ordinance, only larger companies could compete, 
which would drive up trash hauling rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to eliminate competition, is the way I see it," said John 
Agamalian, president of A-Trojan Disposal and Recycling Services of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials said they could not absorb any more financial liability for 
trash dumping. The city already faces an $8.2-million settlement in a federal 
lawsuit filed against Alhambra and 25 other cities that used a Monterey Park 
landfill that has been declared an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund 
cleanup site. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra must also comply with Assembly Bill 939, enacted in 1989, which 
requires all cities to reduce landfill waste by 25% by next year and by 50% by 
the next century, or face fines of $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's new ordinance requires commercial trash haulers to reduce the waste 
they dump at landfills by 25%, but trash haulers voiced no complaints about 
that requirement.

IT'S COOL TO BE HOT; SOUTH PASADENA: SOLAR ENERGY IS BEING TAPPED TO HELP 
SUPPLY POWER TO A SCHOOL AND 300 NEARBY HOMES. THE PROJECT IS THE MOST 
EXTENSIVE OF ITS TYPE IN THE WORLD, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a scorching summer afternoon, most people turn on their air conditioners to 
escape the sun's heat. Imagine that those air conditioners are powered by the 
sun and you have discovered two things: 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect irony and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 In a groundbreaking project, Monterey Hills Elementary School and Southern 
California Edison have teamed up to bring solar energy to the school and 300 
homes in South Pasadena that were on the brink of an energy burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in the whole world that solar energy is being used to 
this extent," said Edan Prabhu, Edison's project manager. In the past, Prabhu 
said, solar energy has been used to power individual homes. For the first time, 
solar energy will give a power boost to an entire neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials chose the 300-house neighborhood, which they call Hill Grid, 
because of increasing demands that new or remodeled homes have been putting on 
30-year-old power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of tearing up the streets to rewire insufficient underground service, 
Edison placed 180 solar panels on the school's roof two weeks ago. When the sun 
is at its hottest, the metallic blue panels can harness 15 kilowatts -- or 150 
100-watt bulbs -- worth of energy, which is then routed into the school's main 
power lines. Another set of panels, 125 kilowatts worth, will be assembled on 
the school roof in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the $5-million project sponsored by the federal Department of 
Energy and Edison, will place solar panels on houses and possibly parking lots 
in the South Pasadena neighborhood and in areas of San Marino and La Canada 
Flintridge that face similar problems with inadequate power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials said they hope that government-sponsored projects such as 
this one will help lower the cost of solar energy by generating increased 
interest in the industry, leading to widespread use of the technology in urban 
and suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, most if not all of the power created by the first sets 
of solar panels will be used by the elementary school, Edison officials said. 
Still, that will reduce the load on local lines, freeing up more power for 
residences. In addition, they said, at times when the school is not using much 
power, some of the solar power will flow to the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Vanderwall, school director of maintenance and operations, said he 
approached Edison last year with the idea of using the school after he heard 
that the utility wanted to bring solar energy into the neighborhood. The 
school's large, flat roofs have unobstructed exposure to the sun and therefore 
made an ideal project site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for ways to economize our operations," Vanderwall said. "So, 
we looked toward utilities." The school will save about 25% in annual electric 
bills thanks to the sun's free rays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the school uses 180 kilowatts of energy; homes use from 6 to 10 
kilowatts. Edison research engineer James Swanson said that Hill Grid has used 
up to 90% of its energy capacity at peak times and that demand is expected to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to wait until it's at 99% capacity until you do something," he 
said. "We'll be real happy with a 5% decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials are also meeting with residents to see if they are interested 
in having the solar panels on their roofs. The school did not have to pay for 
its panels, but officials are not sure whether residents who participate in the 
project will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who has been asked about it has been really impressed and totally 
supportive," said David Briery, an Edison spokesman. The project has also been 
endorsed by the AQMD and Union of Concerned Scientists, Prabhu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels, which are a little over four feet tall and rest at a 45-degree 
angle, have no moving parts and emit no chemicals. They are covered with thick 
glass to protect the wires within from such things as stray rocks and storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the panels are ineffective on rainy days or after sundown, people use 
fewer high-energy appliances, such as air conditioners, during those times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's summer afternoons we're most concerned with," Prabhu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, one kilowatt of solar power costs $7, as opposed to less than $1 
per kilowatt for natural gas, but officials expect the price to go down as 
solar energy becomes more popular. It already powers everyday devices such as 
pocket calculators and highway emergency telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Joe Johnson said he also liked the idea of using the panels 
as learning tools. "It actually dovetails with our science instruction," he 
said. "The kids will find more applications of how solar energy works."

CONTENTIOUS PLAN FOR UTILITY TAX REVIVED; DUARTE: PROPOSAL FOR A 3% LEVY HAD 
LED OPPONENTS TO START A RECALL DRIVE AGAINST MAYOR. COUNCIL NOW WANTS TO VOTE 
ON ISSUE AFTER A PUBLIC HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a flip-flop that has some taxpayers steaming, the Duarte City Council has 
resurrected a proposal for a 3% utility tax that it removed from the November 
ballot earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of putting the issue before city voters, the council now says it 
plans to decide the issue itself after holding a public hearing next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council says it has no other way to make up an annual budget shortfall of 
about $500,000 without resorting to widespread layoffs or elimination of city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents aren't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been double-crossed," said David Covert, a leader of the Duarte 
Taxpayers Group. "They deprived the citizens of a democratic say about this 
tax. It's like they believe that citizens don't know what's good for the city 
and they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-2 vote, taken Sept. 13, was opposed by Councilwomen Ginny Joyce and 
Margaret E. Finlay, who said they felt voters should decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a clear-cut consensus. . . . We need to put it out to a vote," 
Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, which would run for five years, is expected to cost the average 
household $7 a month by raising water, electricity, telephone and cable 
television bills, said Michael Yelton, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not in favor of the tax, but I am not in favor of cutting services," 
said Councilman James D. Kirchner. "Rather than face the financial destruction 
of this city, we will have to impose the tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte has already made $880,000 in program cuts this year and laid off two 
employees. The city has also increased fees for business permits and 
assessments for lighting and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not naive. I know we will have to face the music for this . . . but I am 
comfortable it's the best decision to preserve this community," said Councilman 
John R. Fasana, who supports the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax controversy began earlier this year, when the council 
announced it would raise taxes via a council vote. That angered the taxpayers 
group, which initiated a recall drive against Mayor Finlay. 
</P>
<P>
 To avert the recall action, the council agreed to put the measure on the Nov. 
8 ballot. But one day before the ballot was finalized, a council majority of 
Kirchner, Fasana and Councilman Phillip R. Reyes voted to remove the initiative 
and instead began using reserves to make up the revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five months, all the council members except Fasana have changed 
their position on the tax.  
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayers group says it plans to fight back. Member Lino Paras said the 
group may launch another recall drive against council members.

TOPICS/ PETS; DOG CATCHER SUPREME; SOARIN' SAM WINS HIS SECOND CANINE FRISBEE 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soarin' Sam is a mottled brown Australian sheep dog with a blue fleck in one 
of his eyes and a graying muzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think he's old and blind, until I break out the Frisbee," said 
Sam's owner, Gary Suzuki.  
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki, a 31-year-old Covina resident, and his dog Sam took the 1994 Canine 
Frisbee World Champion title for the second year in a row, vying against 13 of 
the top canine Frisbee competitors from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam is a great leaper; he has a gift," said Jeff Perry, chief judge for the 
championship. "But there is also a lot of strategy involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging in the competition was based on a host of skills similar to those 
prized in figure-skating: showmanship, leaping agility, degree of difficulty 
and execution. In addition to catching Frisbees, the dogs also perform a 
variety of tricks -- from flipping in midair to landing in their owners' arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition culminated in a two-minute choreographed routine to music with 
five disks being thrown in rapid succession and a series of leaps and flips by 
the owners and their dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki found his 7-year-old championship pet through an ad for free puppies. 
He spent four years training Sam with a manual provided by the Friskies pet 
food company before winning the world title. He said one of the best things 
about the sport is that it doesn't matter if the dogs are mutts or pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam is a natural," Suzuki said. "He always showed an interest in retrieving 
and he's very consistent -- he has to get every throw." 
</P>
<P>
 Canine Frisbee Championships were started 20 years ago by Alex Stine and his 
legendary dog Ashley Whippet, who won the first three competitions in 
1975-1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport is gaining momentum and each year the competitions attract more 
people, said Perry, who predicts it will soon catch on internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki received the top prize of a $1,000 savings bond. When not competing in 
Frisbee competitions, he and Sam perform exhibitions for charity events and NFL 
games across the country.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday approved an agreement with developer and community 
activist Danny Bakewell to build the first major supermarket shopping center in 
predominantly black and Latino Northwest Pasadena with the help of Pasadena's 
redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakewell's Pasadena Commercial Development Co. plans to build the 
69,000-square-foot shopping center, which is to feature a Vons supermarket, on 
the southwest corner of the intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Orange Grove 
Boulevard.The supermarket will anchor the center, which is expected to also 
have several smaller stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is now home to a grocery, a check-cashing store and other small 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency is expected to spend an estimated $8.5 million to buy 
land for the shopping center, relocate existing businesses and demolish 
buildings on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency will sell the property to Pasadena Commercial for 
about $1.5 million, which the firm would repay over 20 years from shopping 
center profits.

 The quaint blue house with the well-kept garden on Pomona's Farringdon Avenue 
belies what once went on inside its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the residence was a hub of gang and drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, authorities plan to seal all the windows and doors in the home for 
four months in an attempt to rid the neighborhood of a public nuisance. Since 
1989 -- when the Pomona City Council passed an ordinance allowing the Police 
Department to evict tenants and board up homes plagued by illegal activity, 
police have shut down between 20 and 30 homes, businesses and hotels deemed to 
be public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the ordinance is broadly worded, it allows police to target any 
residence or facility where illegal activity occurs or where controlled 
substances such as alcohol are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been extremely successful, said Pomona Police Chief Charles M. 
Heilman, primarily because of input from residents. Where drug dealers and 
prostitutes once roamed the street, children now ride bicycles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been one of the best crime-fighting tools," Heilman said. "The whole 
temperament of the community is getting safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona police say they receive several calls each day from residents afraid to 
leave their homes because neighboring houses or businesses are being used for 
illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical case takes three to seven months to investigate. Police work with 
residents and owners of the house, warning them to stop the illegal activity or 
they will be evicted. Officers may keep homes under surveillance, sending 
undercover detectives to the house to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once arrests are made, paperwork may be filed to have a property declared a 
public nuisance. The city then holds a public hearing, which allows police and 
the occupants of the house and their attorneys to agree to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators of the ordinance can have their properties boarded for up to one 
year and can be prevented from living on their properties for an indefinite 
time thereafter. They can also be placed on probation for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the city can revoke the licenses of businesses targeted under 
the public nuisance ordinance. For instance, Pomona police are working to 
revoke the license of a motel that has generated 62 complaint calls about 
prostitution in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Farringdon Avenue case, the house will be boarded up for four months 
and the owner will be prohibited from living there for one year after the 
boards are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosalio Batres, who lives a block and a half away from the Farringdon house 
and is active in his Neighborhood Watch group, said he supports boarding up 
houses where illegal activity occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "By doing that we got rid of a lot of problems," Batres said. "It's something 
that we should celebrate."

MEMORIAL TO HONOR TWO BLACK ATHLETES; PASADENA: BACKERS SAY THE TRIBUTE TO 
JACKIE ROBINSON AND HIS BROTHER, MACK, IS OVERDUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena is moving forward with its plan to honor native sons Jackie Robinson 
and his brother, Mack Robinson, with an art memorial in the Civic Center, a 
move that black leaders say is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has budgeted at least $100,000 for the project, which will grace the 
grounds of a new Department of Water and Power building to be built in the 
Civic Center and opened in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Arts Division and Pasadena Robinson Memorial Inc., a group that has 
pressed for the memorial, will begin accepting proposals for the project in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, a sculpture or some other form of art, is intended to address the 
theme of Jackie Robinson's key accomplishment: breaking major league baseball's 
color barrier in 1947 when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack Robinson, who is 80 and still lives in Pasadena, was a world-class 
sprinter. He won a silver medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the 200-meter 
run, finishing behind the late Jesse Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Several public facilities in Northwest Pasadena, the predominantly black and 
Latino area where the Robinsons grew up, have been named after the athletes. 
But the memorial will be what many see as the first citywide tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pasadena as a city has not done enough to acknowledge their contributions," 
said Councilman Chris Holden. "It's very appropriate to have that kind of 
monument in a prominent place for everyone to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Robinson, who died in 1972, might not have attended the dedication had 
it been held in his lifetime. He bristled at the prejudicial environment he 
experienced in Pasadena as a child and an adult, a time when blacks couldn't 
buy homes in some neighborhoods and were barred from many restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Charles Johnson, who served as president of the local chapter of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1960s, said Jackie 
Robinson once turned down his request to make an appearance in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he's 'never coming back to that racist community,' " Johnson 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack Robinson is disabled and unable to comment. But his wife, Delano 
Robinson, said, "I'm delighted that the brothers are going to be honored."

COMMUNITY NEWS: DUARTE; COMMUNITIES TO UNITE FOR ANTI-DRUG MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A candlelight march against drugs will be held at 5 p.m. Saturday in an 
unincorporated county area bordering Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 The march is sponsored by the Monrovia/Arcadia/Duarte Town Council, a group 
overseeing unincorporated county neighborhoods. It begins at Maxwell Elementary 
School, 733 E. Euclid Ave., proceeds south along Goodall Avenue and ends at 
Pamela Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have helped reduce crime in the area, said Temple Station Capt. 
Robert Mirabella. He credited community activism, strict enforcement of county 
health and building codes and increased community policing by sheriff's 
deputies from the Temple Station for the drop in serious crimes.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIERRA MADRE; COUNCIL DROPS BID TO REDUCE PLANNING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After intense pressure from opponents, the City Council has tentatively 
reversed its decision earlier this year to cut the city's Planning Commission 
from seven members to five. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided the commission should have seven members until an advisory 
measure on the 1996 municipal ballot resolves the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the reduction had vowed to appeal a judge's decision that upheld 
the city clerk's refusal to count signatures on a petition for an election to 
restore the panel to seven members. The opponents collected about 1,200 
signatures and said they would do it again.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COVINA; PARK CLEARED OF SOIL CONTAMINATION TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edna Park will be open to sneakers, cleats and bare toes this Saturday, after 
having nothing but construction boots on its soil for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.3-acre park was closed in December, 1993, after Southern California Gas 
Co. discovered cancer-causing residue left behind from a gas plant that 
occupied the site 81 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The residue, called "lampblack" and created when oil and coal are turned into 
gas, was found in 6,000 tons of the park's soil. The contaminated soil was 
removed and burned, while Edna Park was replenished with clean soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lampblack was found buried throughout the park beneath grass and a clean layer 
of soil. Richard Varenchik, an EPA spokesman, said there have been no reports 
of illness caused by the dangerous soot. "We removed it to be on the safe 
side," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By March, Edna Park had new soil and a team of residents planting grass and 
flowers on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 After speeches at 11:20 a.m., there will be a free picnic.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: City officials have complained to neighboring West Hollywood 
that its proposed zoning plan, which could add 1.1 million square feet of 
development to the Sunset Strip, does not take into account the effect on 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 15-page letter to West Hollywood, Beverly Hills officials cited such 
worries as increased traffic and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter is expected to be just part of a long-term debate among West 
Hollywood, its residents and neighboring cities regarding the proposal that 
would address development along 1.2 miles of Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 CULVER CITY: The City Council met in a closed session on Monday to discuss 
communication issues with Culver City Police Chief Ted Cooke. The meeting was 
billed on the council's agenda as Cooke's performance evaluation, although it 
was scheduled two weeks ago after a group of angry Culver City residents 
protested the hiring of Timothy Wind as a community service officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind, a former Los Angeles police officer, was acquitted of state and federal 
charges stemming from the beating of Rodney G. King. Residents complained that 
hiring Wind made the city appear insensitive to the issues surrounding King's 
beating and the 1992 riots after the acquittal in state court of Wind and three 
other officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has not released information about the closed session, but the 
city is expected to make public a memo prepared by the city's Chief 
Administrative Office explaining Cooke's rationale for hiring Wind. 
</P>

SOUTH PASADENA: FAIRNESS AT ISSUE IN RENOVATION, EXPANSION OF HISTORIC HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am personally devastated by the most recent verdict in the case of Lee 
Prentiss versus the city of South Pasadena (July 30). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when I served as mayor, Prentiss was hastily issued a building permit 
that did not receive environmental review or comply with the state Historic 
Building Code standards. Upon this notice, the permit was revoked at the behest 
of the majority of the council. Prentiss' politics were not the issue. The 
issue was an addition of 2,661 square feet to the front of a historic 
3,600-plus-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
 At all times the council acted in the best interest of the city. We sought the 
advice of an expert in environmental and historic law after the city attorney 
admitted he was not versed in this area of law. The council was advised that 
this area of the law was unsettled, but it was felt the city's position was 
sound. At one point in this lengthy court saga, two state agencies including 
the attorney general sided with the city's case by presenting an amicus curiae 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Prentiss was offered a second permit within seven months of 
the original revocation for virtually the same size addition. A few months 
later he applied for this second permit and did in fact commence construction 
and eventually complete two-thirds of his project. His oversized project was 
even exempted from a mansionization ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has continually attempted to settle this ongoing legal matter. Offers 
were always turned down. The council at all times assessed the matter in a fair 
manner, as it did any number of lawsuits that came before it. The primary 
factor of consideration was always fairness and the effect on the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 It is devastating to consider the ramifications of this case. My integrity has 
been impugned. As a council member and mayor, I continually embraced the high 
ideals of making government responsive and accountable. I chose to serve my 
community primarily on a volunteer basis. 
</P>
<P>
 I am shocked and dismayed to think that any council member, anywhere at any 
time, might be accused of abusing power when he or she strives to further the 
principles by which they were elected. Someone willing to lie in court can 
crush a reputation. I would consider legal action but I do not have the 
financial means to fight this battle alone. 
</P>
<P>
 EVELYN FIERRO 
</P>
<P>
 Former mayor, South Pasadena currently in Alexandria, Va.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We have lived in this town for 13 years. Our children have attended our fine 
schools and we have enjoyed living in a wonderful neighborhood where neighbors 
know and respect each other, get together for holidays and summer barbecues, 
and even vacation together. 
</P>
<P>
 We are deeply hurt to see two women for whom we have tremendous respect be 
maligned. We know them well, and know their intentions have always been for the 
good of the city of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 We are talking about former Mayor Evelyn Fierro and former Transportation 
Commissioner Joanne Nuckols. They fought for years to keep the 710 Freeway out 
of our city. They have also spent their volunteer hours continually helping and 
protecting this city when the rest of us couldn't find the time and relied on 
them. We need these kind of leaders; people willing to put their necks on the 
line to help us preserve our community. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn has temporarily moved to Washington, D.C., but we recall how she fought 
for our community to bring about design standards and stood up to those who 
wanted to overdevelop our small town. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne gets things done. She has masterminded the freeway fight for years. She 
has motivated national preservation groups to help save our city. 
</P>
<P>
 We moved our family to South Pasadena 13 years ago because of its small-town 
atmosphere and community closeness. We want it preserved for future generations 
of children to play in the front yards and walk to school together. 
</P>
<P>
 To say these women have deprived Lee Prentiss of his civil rights is absurd. 
This is definitely taking political antics too far. They acted in good faith 
for the city, with nothing personal to gain.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; A BABY, A SHOOTING AND A PUZZLING QUESTION; A 
TODDLER WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. AND NOW SOUTH EL MONTE 
RESIDENTS AND OFFICIALS ARE ASKING WHY THERE WAS LITTLE RESPONSE TO THE KILLING 
OF MAUREEN RAMIREZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South El Monte's first homicide of the year was an especially horrifying one. 
</P>
<P>
 A round-faced, 16-month-old toddler had been shot to death in gang gunfire. 
She just happened to be in the wrong place for a few very wrong moments; her 
mother had paused during a stroll 
</P>
<P>
 to chat with the people at the house where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the most remarkable aspects of Maureen Ramirez's death was that it 
seemed to pass silently by in the city. No outraged residents gathered. No 
special City Council meeting was called. No reward was offered for the killers, 
who were arrested last week. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned about the lack of outrage and action, city officials and 
residents seemed genuinely puzzled by their own lack of response. It's not as 
though the city is murder-weary; it generally logs three or four homicides a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Pasadena residents rallied after the gang-related shooting deaths 
of three boys on Halloween night last year to create a citywide coalition that 
is still working to improve conditions in the city. The Coalition for a 
Non-Violent City is sponsoring a daylong seminar Oct. 1 at the Pasadena Center 
Conference Building. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino city officials, outraged at the June 5 slaying of two boys at a 
high school graduation party, offered a reward for the arrest and conviction of 
the assailants and called a special hearing to answer questions from concerned 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you explore the city, the non-reaction is pretty anomalous because we've 
rallied around others in the past," said Father Joseph Greeley of Epiphany 
Catholic Church, 
</P>
<P>
 where the child's funeral was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interviewed seemed to agree that the lack of reaction seemed to say 
something about their city, but just what it said depended on who was doing the 
talking. Was it an aberration in a city that usually cares, as Greeley 
suggests? Or did it illustrate a lack of community spirit caused by a 
neighborhood physically splintered by industry and burdened by the loss of 
well-paying blue-collar jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents blame the fractured City Council, wracked by political 
dissension for months, for the seeming failure to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is so divided that even when a tragedy occurs, they can't come 
together," said community activist Helen Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials pointed the finger at residents, none of whom demanded 
action at a council meeting Sept. 8, a few days after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one spoke," said Assistant City Manager Steve Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said that community activists who might have galvanized the city were 
already exhausted by their recent successful ballot battle against a proposed 
card club. And others suggested that no reaction was necessary because South El 
Monte is already engaged in well-known anti-gang efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in the 2200 block of Sastre Avenue, an industrially 
zoned road outside the city's three main neighborhoods, Henley pointed out. 
Sastre is off Klingerman Street, which itself is lined with manufacturers' 
buildings and heavily traversed by 14-wheel trucks. Many of the neglected 
buildings on Sastre Avenue house renters and transients who seldom come forward 
to make their needs known, Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an incident occurs in a residential area, we know about it," he said. "If 
it occurs in a residential area in an industrial zone, the public has nothing 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Mayor Albert G. Perez said he walked Sastre Avenue four years ago urging 
residents to attend council meetings. But few responded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a historical kind of situation," he said of the area. "It's on the 
borderline of El Monte, and El Monte overshadows that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez added that the toddler's mother actually lived in El Monte and was not a 
South El Monte resident. He also said that residents of his city may not have 
been prompted to demand more anti-gang programs because they already know of 
the many efforts under way in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Project U-Turn, a nonprofit agency that tries to direct youths away from 
gangs, has been working in South El Monte for years, he said. In addition, two 
years ago, city officials teamed up with residents to create South El Monte 
Amateur Athletics, which helps fund youth sports and compensate for city budget 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, two years ago, city officials created a teen program and brought back 
the city's boxing program, both to counter an upsurge in youth gang graffiti, 
Perez said. As a result, graffiti is not appearing as frequently on buildings 
and streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But South El Monte officials also insisted that factors involved in the Sastre 
Avenue shooting are not characteristic of their city of nearly 21,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that local gang members targeted the house after they 
were cheated in a drug deal by alleged gang members from outside the San 
Gabriel Valley who had been staying at the residence, said Sheriff's Lt. 
Anthony Torres, who is the Temple Station liaison to South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before Maureen Ramirez was killed, one young man was shot five times in 
the back on the same block. A day after the 16-month-old was slain, another 
young man on the block was stabbed 35 times, Torres said. Both victims 
survived. Investigators believe the violence is related to the Aug. 29 shooting 
of Maureen Ramirez and arose from gang rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies and El Monte police on Sept. 
21 arrested Cesar Uribe, 18, Omar Colin, 21, both of El Monte, and a 
16-year-old boy in the fatal shooting. A fourth suspect, another juvenile whose 
age was unavailable, was already in custody on other charges.

 Sheriff's deputies agree with city officials that South El Monte does not 
usually suffer high levels of crime. Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Falls, who 
prosecutes gang cases in Pomona Superior Court, said he could not recall a 
single case he has handled against South El Monte gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of reported serious felonies, such as rape, assault, robbery and 
auto theft, are lower in South El Monte than in surrounding cities, Torres 
said. Of 30 San Gabriel Valley cities, South El Monte ranks near the middle in 
the number of major crimes -- 1,300 to 1,400 -- reported annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang violence is usually kept to a minimum by El Monte gang members who call 
South El Monte home and quickly retaliate for crimes committed in their home 
neighborhoods, Torres said. Fights and knifings, not gang shootings, are the 
typical gang-related violence in the city, he said. And deputies are not 
usually called out to handle gang-related crimes; the most commonly reported 
crimes are burglaries of the many small industrial companies located in the 
city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some residents said the council's failure to respond to the fatal 
shooting betrays not the city's low-crime profile, but the council's constant 
bickering that has stalled action on many fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Council votes often stack up 3 to 2, with the mayor and two other council 
members outvoting two newcomers: Jerry Salas and Joseph Gonzales. The council 
argues about even the smallest issues, such as the recent impasse over spending 
$12,000 to pave a parking lot leased from the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salas of the bickering: "It's strictly personal and beyond comprehension 
at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it," added activist Lujan. "I'm so tired of going to 
council meetings (where) they're not unified (and) things are not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 When the council does take action, such as a proposed $16-million card club 
supported by Mayor Vera Valdiviez, residents have to organize mightily to have 
their ideas heard, some said. On the card club issue, opponents formed a 
coalition to defeat the proposal in a vote Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Lujan said residents may have been so exhausted by the card club issue and 
other battles with the council that they lacked the energy to summon outrage on 
yet another issue and lobby for action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to do that on more issues, but we don't know how to do it," 
she said. "I think it's a question of, 'Is our leadership strong enough to pull 
us together?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Valdiviez says city leaders are, in fact, busy addressing many pressing 
city issues, including economic development and improvement of the city's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has a very negative reputation," Valdiviez said. "But people who do 
live here, they like it. It's not that bad of a city." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the city's sensitivity to its image was demonstrated earlier this year 
when some officials proposed changing South El Monte's name to Potrero Grande 
or Santa Anita. They sought to end what they considered a negative 
identification with larger El Monte, north of them. The idea went no further 
than talk. 
</P>
<P>
 South El Monte's image problem may stem from its beginnings as an 
unincorporated county territory where chrome platers, machine shops and metal 
fabricators operated. The city never was a master-planned community, said Greg 
Lantz, the city's economic development coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 . As a result, the city lacks a retail downtown, designates 70% of its land 
for industrial use and has a mainly blue-collar resident population, 85% of it 
Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 This mix suited civic leaders until recently, Lantz said. Five years ago, the 
recession brought city budget cutbacks, state officials held on to state funds 
previously allocated to cities, and South El Monte's small manufacturing plants 
began moving out or their retired owners closed up shop. Garment manufacturers 
have since moved in, replacing many of the $12-an-hour manufacturing employees 
with minimum-wage workers, Lantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's unemployment rate shot up. In June, the last month for which 
figures were available, the city's unemployment rate was 15.5%, compared with 
10% for Los Angeles County overall and 7% for the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council approved an economic development program that calls 
for retail development, aggressive marketing and the possible opening of a 
mercado for local manufacturers to sell their goods at discount, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also teamed up with the cities of El Monte, Rosemead and Irwindale to 
apply for a joint $3-million grant from the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development that would create enterprise zones to encourage business 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing as much as we can," Valdiviez said. "But the residents also need 
to get out and help." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Ramirez's mother, Elaine Mendoza, buried her daughter at Resurrection 
Cemetery earlier this month in a ceremony attended by nearly 200 mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations from family members and a car wash organized by the toddler's 
father, who lives apart from the family, helped cover the cost of a burial 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so beautiful," the 30-year-old mother of three said, weeping. "We had 
all the kids circle around the casket and they let go pink and white balloons. 
It was like the balloons were going up to heaven to my baby." South El Monte at

reaction -- to the death of 16-month-old Maureen Ramirez, who was killed by

 "The (City) Council is so divided that even when a tragedy occurs, they can't

 ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 After two consecutive victories, Westchester has reasserted itself as the team 
to beat when Coastal Conference play begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets displayed their talent and athleticism Friday in a 20-14 victory 
over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Brennan Crooks and receiver Tony Griffin connected on 
touchdown passes of 57 and six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets (2-1) open conference play against Hamilton (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, they have the best athletes in the conference," said co-coach Tony 
Chretin, whose Venice team shared the best record in conference with the Comets 
last season. "In the past, the Comets have started off slowly and by the second 
or third game, they jelled." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice (2-1) played its best game of the season despite suffering a 30-0 loss 
to San Pedro. Gerardo Gomez had 15 unassisted tackles and was "in the Pirates' 
backfield all night long," according to Chretin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt better about this loss than our win against Hollywood," Chretin said. 
"I think our chances are a lot better than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Chretin, however, was upset with San Pedro demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking San Pedro off our schedule," said Chretin, who in the past has 
complained about San Pedro's trash talking. "The players were OK, but I'm not 
too happy with their fans. They were spitting on our sign and making vulgar 
comments toward our players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gondoliers open conference play against Fairfax (1-2). PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fairfax Coach Terrel Ray, the City Section will go through with 
its plan to wait until the end of the season to determine seedings for the 4-A 
and 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, only the conference champion is guaranteed a 4-A berth and 
there are five conferences in the City. The remaining 11 playoff berths will be 
selected by a committee. Sixteen at-large teams will be selected for the 3-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester and Manual Arts are the early favorites from the Coastal 
Conference to make the playoffs. Two weeks ago, the Comets scored a 28-9 
victory over San Fernando, a traditional San Fernando Valley power, and Manual 
Arts beat 4-A finalist Dorsey, 14-13. Either team could make a good argument to 
receive an at-large bid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-A, the situation is more complicated. Consider Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Mohicans beat Palisades, 13-0, and two weeks ago defeated 
Hamilton, 19-0. If a playoff berth came down between Gardena and one of those 
two Westside schools, the Mohicans would deserve a playoff spot. However, 
Gardena competes in the Southern Pacific Conference and could finish with a 
losing record. Would the selection committee pick a team with a 2-8 record over 
a .500 team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing to Gardena could hurt us," said Coach Russ Howard, whose Palisades 
team went 0-2 in nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Venice and Fairfax (1-2) to make the 3-A playoffs. University (1-2), 
Hamilton and Palisades are longshots until proven otherwise. BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 After opening with two consecutive losses, Beverly Hills went to the ground to 
beat West Torrance, 38-14, for its first win. Norman running back Davis Kim 
rushed for 122 yards and three touchdowns, Aaron Kogan had 108 yards and Miguel 
Marco had two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest task was to keep our kids' heads up," Beverly Hills Coach Carter 
Paysinger said. "We still believe our team is as good as we thought we were at 
the beginning of the season." GOOD HOST 
</P>
<P>
 It is tough to win on someone else's home court and even tougher to beat the 
tournament host, but there stood Michael Harrington of Van Nuys playing host 
Chris Schoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington defeated Schoop, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, during the Pacific Palisades Fall 
Tennis Championships Sunday at Pacific Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoop, who organized the tournament, is the head tennis professional and runs 
Schoop's tennis shop at the park. RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 James Gray, a former Santa Monica College and Westchester High standout, never 
made it to Georgia to play basketball because of academic reasons, but that 
hasn't stop the Bulldogs from recruiting another Comet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs are pursuing Comet guard Ben Sanders, but they're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the hunt for Sanders are Arizona State, Nevada Las Vegas, Washington 
State, Tennessee and Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said he believes Sanders will commit during the 
early signing period in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax point guard Duane Davis is being recruited by Arizona State, Oregon 
State, Long Beach State, University of San Francisco, Santa Clara and UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In other basketball news, Westchester's 5-foot-10 point guard, Jan Thomas, 
transferred to Inglewood because, as Azzam puts it, he could start there. 
Thomas was a backup guard to junior Danny Walker. NET GAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Kling of Palisades, the most successful tennis coach in City Section 
history, has an impressive lineup of returning girls' players. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strength of the team may be found in newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Shana Miller, senior Carolyn Lee and Brenna Moore are the top 
returning singles' players. Seniors Alison Fischer and Jennie Wilson, and 
Christin Cho and Diana Varat formed two of the Dolphins' top doubles teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Lindsay Alpert appears to be the team's top singles player and freshmen 
Lucy Zatloukal, Rebecca Ebin, Elisa Miller, Emily Zehr and Stephanie Krauss 
also may break the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to enforce discipline and good work habits in practice," Kling 
said. "If they don't concentrate and put in 100%, someone will take their 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins have won eight consecutive City titles in the first eight seasons 
under Kling. In 10 seasons, they have compiled a 128-2 record against City 
opponents, suffering their only loss to Taft during the last two City 
championship finals. SENIOR SPIKER 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tropin of Mar Vista helped lead Lonesome Pine of Southern California to 
the gold medal in men's volleyball during the California State Senior Games 
Championships in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 senior men and women participated in 27 sporting events throughout 
California.

 STIRRED, NOT SHAKEN: One more note on the famous White House shake-up that 
wasn't. White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta last Friday announced his 
plan for reorganizing White House staff, emphasizing that it would limit the 
unimpeded access to the Oval Office of such aides as all-purpose presidential 
adviser George Stephanopoulos. Henceforth, Panetta declared, Stephanopoulos 
would be "executive assistant to the chief of staff," reporting directly to 
Panetta. . . . Yet after that pronouncement was duly reported in The Times and 
elsewhere, Stephanopoulos called the newspaper with one small correction. He 
was retaining his old title of "senior adviser to the President," with direct 
access to President Clinton.

 STRIKING OUT: If the summer of '94 was bad for baseball fans, it was worse for 
Sen. Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). After announcing in March that 
he would retire, Mitchell passed up a Supreme Court appointment so that he 
could stay in office this year to help win approval of Clinton's health care 
reform plan. Today, the plan is in the morgue. Stephen G. Breyer is easing onto 
the high court bench. And, just for good measure, a Republican is leading the 
race to replace Mitchell in the Senate. "It was lose, lose, lose," one insider 
noted. . . . But it could have been worse. Mitchell could have been appointed 
to one other job for which he was a leading candidate last spring: baseball 
commissioner.

 PALS AGAIN: Presidential Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers and State Department 
spokesman Michael McCurry, recent rivals for the best mouthpiece job in 
Washington -- hers -- went to lengths to show goodwill in their first public 
appearance together since the troubles. During a press briefing the night 
before Clinton's speech at the United Nations, McCurry and Myers were smiles 
and giggles in a tete-a-tete; they ended up leaning back-to-back against each 
other. . . . The show wasn't lost on their audience, or on U.S. Ambassador to 
the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who interrupted her briefing to shoot a 
quizzical glance toward stage right, where they stood.

 SWIFT JUSTICE: The Supreme Court these days is proving to be very decisive, 
but not so deliberate. The justices met Monday morning to review 1,788 appeals 
that arrived over the summer. This used to be a weeklong endeavor as the 
justices, divided among liberals and conservatives, debated which cases 
deserved review. But no more. With conservative Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist in charge, the meeting broke up that afternoon, and only eight cases 
were granted full review. Most of them strike a distinctly conservative chord: 
Should federal affirmative action be ended? Can California cut back its welfare 
benefits? Can the state retroactively limit parole hearings for inmates?

 IN STITCHES: Vice President Al Gore, who has a repertoire of humor about the 
lowly status of his office, has found new material in his recent leg injury. At 
a State Department luncheon Tuesday for Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
Gore told guests that while his Achilles tendon was being repaired by surgeons, 
his official duties were handed over to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.), who is next in the line of succession. After regaining 
consciousness, Gore resumed his duties -- which he said elevated Foley back to 
his customary position of authority. . . . While the joke drew gales of 
laughter from Americans, something was lost in translation. Most Russians 
responded with blank stares.

 The war on drugs moved underwater after Colombian security forces said 
Wednesday that they had seized a radar-guided, mini-submarine capable of 
smuggling three tons of narcotics out to sea.

 Gen. Rodolfo Torrado Quintero, commander of the army's 1st Division, said the 
sea-blue submarine was the second to be found in less than a year and appeared 
to be part of a new flotilla of drug vessels.

POLICE WON'T BE CHARGED IN 1993 SHOOTING; INVESTIGATION: WOMAN WAS SHOT SEVEN 
TIMES IN THE BACK AFTER REPORTEDLY LUNGING AT OFFICERS WITH A KNIFE ON A 
HOSPITAL ROOFTOP. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CASE REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The controversial death of an incoherent, knife-wielding young mother shot on 
a hospital rooftop was tragic but not criminal, and no charges will be filed 
against the Los Angeles police officers who killed her, prosecutors said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 45-page report that, among other things, raises "the possibility . . . 
that the officers are not being truthful about their actions that evening," the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office detailed the Dec. 16, 1993, 
shooting of Sonji Danese Taylor, who died in a fusillade of bullets after 
officers discovered her on the roof of St. Vincent Medical Center in Westlake 
holding her 3-year-old son at knifepoint and shouting, "For the blood of 
Jesus!" 
</P>
<P>
 The seven officers who responded to the call managed to free the sobbing 
toddler by shooting pepper spray into Taylor's face. But as they pulled the 
child to safety, police said, the woman lunged at one of the officers with the 
knife and they were forced to shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the incident, Taylor's family sharply criticized the 
police, saying that excessive force was used. Later, the case sparked intense 
publicity when autopsy reports revealed that Taylor -- whom the officers 
contended attacked them head-on -- had 10 bullet wounds in her body, seven of 
them in her back. 
</P>
<P>
 The report acknowledged the controversy over the case and the speculation 
among critics of a police cover-up. Indeed, prosecutors Christopher Darden and 
Richard Goul wrote, the evidence does not square with the police account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major question remains: How could Taylor lunge forward at the officers 
and yet be shot in the back?" Darden and Goul wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they noted, the fusillade of bullets also may have twisted Taylor's 
body around as she fell -- a possibility that would undermine criminal 
prosecution of the officers because under the law relating to circumstantial 
evidence, if a jury is presented with two rational conclusions and one points 
to innocence, that is the conclusion it must adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the prosecutors wrote, the officers' version largely is buttressed 
by the accounts of other witnesses, who were too far away to clearly see the 
shooting but close enough to see and hear what led up to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that the officers were motivated to fire their weapons 
by anything other than their genuine belief that they were in imminent danger 
of great bodily injury or death," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorneys for Taylor's family, who have filed a $20-million claim 
against the city, labeled that conclusion unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this woman posed such a danger, why wasn't she shot in the chest?" lawyer 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. asked. "For the district attorney's office to find that 
this was a justifiable shooting is outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Taylor -- a 27-year-old single mother and former homecoming queen 
who was training to become a state corrections officer -- have said it is 
unclear what she was doing at the hospital that day. In their report, 
prosecutors expressed similar bafflement. Hospital records showed that she was 
not a patient at St. Vincent and had never been treated there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was there much additional light shed on her mental state. Autopsy reports 
included in the report indicate that she was not under the influence of drugs 
at the time of her death or suffering from any brain injury. The only sign of 
the violence to come was a sales receipt from a Best Store in West Covina, 
where Taylor spent $121.20 shortly before her death on three kitchen knives, a 
knife sharpener and a troll doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital staff members said the first knowledge they had that she was in the 
building came about 8 p.m., when a janitor heard a child crying in a stairwell, 
and turned a corner to find Taylor with her son in a headlock and a 12 1/2-inch 
kitchen knife in her free hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The janitor, who spoke only Spanish, asked what she was doing but could not 
understand her response, the report said. By the time he returned with his 
supervisor, the woman had run for the rooftop helipad. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital security guards found Taylor with her child clutched under one arm, 
slashing the air and threatening to stab anyone who came near. About 8:25 p.m., 
a hospital dispatcher called 911 and seven police officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers interviewed in the report said they begged Taylor to drop the knife 
and release the child. But the woman, they said, continued chanting, "the blood 
of Jesus," and thrusting the knife within inches of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, it appeared she was missing the child's face by two or three 
inches, just barely missing him," said Sgt. Phillip Smith. Sgt. John 
Pasquariello said: "She was close enough to the roof ledge to walk over the 
side and drop him off." 
</P>
<P>
 When Officer Arturo Koenig shined a flashlight into her face, he said, "she 
didn't even blink." When officers approached, they said, she would thrust her 
knife at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nothing we could do to talk her out of what she was doing, 'cause she 
was what I would call possessed," Pasquariello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Sgt. Michael Long was instructed to shoot pepper spray into Taylor's 
face, with Officer Craig Liedahl posted as a "designated shooter" should the 
woman attack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long sprayed the woman twice, and as she dropped the child, Pasquariello 
grabbed him and ran. Security guards and other witnesses on the roof gave 
varying accounts of the split-second actions that prompted the police to open 
fire. Some said they could not see Taylor clearly, others merely saw her step 
toward Long as her child was taken away, still others said she made a "stabbing 
motion" toward Long. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers all contend that within moments of the child's release, the woman 
charged at Long, knife in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was "almost like she snapped and she . . . went into almost an attack 
mode," Officer Mark Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers began shooting from about 10 feet away; it was unclear who fired 
first. Long, the report said, fired twice and Liedahl seven times, each from a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. Medical examiners reported that although 
there were nine shots fired, they created 10 bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-police witnesses disputed conjecture that the officers may have continued 
shooting Taylor after she was on the ground, but none recalled seeing her body 
spin under the force of the bullets -- possibly, the report notes, because the 
LAPD investigators probing the shooting never asked them about it.

HOLLYWOOD'S DOUBLE 'EXPOSURE'; COURTS: A WRITER IS AWARDED $7.3 MILLION BY A 
JURY THAT FINDS THAT HIS SCRIPT CONTAINED THE BASIC IDEA FOR TV'S POPULAR 
'NORTHERN EXPOSURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a cynical credo of the screenwriting world that there are only so many 
basic stories (seven is the number, according to some). Certainly, in the world 
of television, everything starts to sound the same. This is, after all, the 
season with two drama shows about doctors, both set in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes things seem a little too similar for a writer's comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what veteran television sitcom writer Sandy Veith thought in 1990 after 
the summer debut of the quirky and now much-acclaimed "Northern Exposure" 
television drama. Eight years before the premiere of "Northern Exposure," a 
television show about a young Jewish doctor from New York who is forced to 
repay his medical school bills with service in a remote Alaskan town, Veith had 
written a show called "Coletta" about a young Italian-American doctor from New 
York who was forced to repay his medical bills with service in a small Southern 
town. "Coletta" was never produced, but the script made the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When 'Northern Exposure' came on the air, he started getting calls from 
people saying, 'God, I can't believe what I saw on TV -- it's just like your 
show,' " said Veith's attorney, Glen Kulik. A Superior Court jury agreed on 
Monday. It ordered Universal City Studios, which produces "Northern Exposure", 
and its parent company, MCA, to pay Veith $7.3 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fierce fights over credit are legion among Hollywood television and film 
writers, but most get decided by Writers Guild arbiters. A few make it to 
court. In one of the more famous cases of the last few years, humorist Art 
Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim were awarded $900,000 for a 2 1/2-page 
story treatment that they argued was the basis for Paramount's "Coming to 
America," starring Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 But rarely does someone go to court and win as much as Veith over an issue 
that involves a fight over whose idea was the basis for a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Veith, 45, developed his script while under contract to Universal from 1981 to 
1986. His contract called for him to be paid for any shows Universal produced 
based on work he had written. Veith's attorneys argued that Universal, which 
produces "Northern Exposure," breached its contract with Veith and owed him 
compensation for lost credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident, but we know it's not over," said Kulik, anticipating an 
appeal by the studio. "We don't want to celebrate too heartily." 
</P>
<P>
 And Veith himself, a man who once worked steadily in sitcoms such as "The 
Jeffersons" and "Diff'rent Strokes," but found writing offers scarce as he 
waged war against Universal, is being scrupulously cautious. He won't talk at 
all. Even his answering machine on Tuesday left the desultory greeting: "You 
heard right, leave a message." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Petrich, the attorney representing Universal, said he will file motions 
asking the court to either reduce the award or throw the judgment out. "They 
wouldn't have taken this to court," Petrich said of his clients, "if they 
didn't believe this was a pure case of independent creation." 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity of premises alone did not win Veith that lottery-jackpot-size 
judgment. The popular fish-out-of-water theme annually spawns numerous 
television and movie variations. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other factors. Some of the same Universal executives who worked 
with Veith also worked with Joshua Brand and John Falsey, the highly respected 
creators of "Northern Exposure," "St. Elsewhere" and other shows. No one has 
accused Brand or Falsey of stealing Veith's idea. Petrich said jurors appeared 
to believe that Universal executives conveyed the idea somehow to Brand and 
Falsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, according to attorneys for both sides who talked to jurors after the 
decision, jurors were suspicious of Universal executives who said they could 
not remember what was talked about in meetings about "Northern Exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was stuff (from jurors) like 'How come an executive who makes so much 
money can't remember what happened in a meeting five years ago?' " Petrich 
said. "I think in all these cases if you have an individual against a large 
company, if the jury is going to err, they're going to make a mistake for the 
little guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Veith's attorney sees it differently. "If you read these two scripts and put 
together access and timing . . . and knowing how the studio system works, it 
was inconceivable to us that this thing could have been independently created," 
Kulik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas are slippery things. In this case, one attorney's dramatic similarities 
are another attorney's laughable coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulik argued that both lead characters in the two shows made long journeys to 
the small towns in which they would work. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? Petrich countered. "They both start with the characters going to the 
place where they worked," he said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulik argues that the lead of "Coletta" has a love interest in a woman named 
Megan who is from an upper-crust Midwestern town. In "Northern Exposure," the 
love interest is a woman named Maggie, who hails from an upper-crust Midwestern 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Both characters have "unconventional jobs" for women, Kulik points out. 
Petrich says that's no big deal: "In ('Northern Exposure') she's a pilot, and 
in the other show she's a veterinarian -- they think that's similar." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Brand and Falsey maintain that they didn't get any ideas from 
Veith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither one of us to this day has ever read the script or met Mr. Veith or 
been told by Universal about the existence of the script prior to 'Northern 
Exposure' being televised on CBS," said Brand in a phone interview Wednesday. 
"We think it's an unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the other credo of Hollywood: It's not an idea that makes a 
successful show, it's the execution 23 times a season. One of the reasons Veith 
got such a large award was because "Northern Exposure" has been such a 
successful show -- and the jury concluded that Veith would have been capable of 
guiding it to that success. 
</P>
<P>
 During much of the trial, Veith had to sit there and hear otherwise. "These 
people who hired you and worked with you are saying, 'Oh, he's basically no 
good,' " recalled Kulik, who said the trial was "emotionally and financially 
draining" for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Kulik argued, "Had he been given the credits . . . he would have gotten 
to write and produce other things." Or he might simply have gotten rich: "There 
are pretty much people in this business who have lived off one series." 
</P>
<P>
 If Veith's award survives counterattacks by Universal, the screenwriter may 
have found his way into their ranks.

NOSTALGIA BEAT; A RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE LEADS AN EFFORT TO TURN AN OLD STATION 
INTO A MUSEUM OF LOS ANGELES POLICE HISTORY AND MEMORABILIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man in the yellowing newspaper photo doesn't look happy, and who can blame 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kalk, who unearthed the photograph in his search through Los Angeles 
Police Department archives, says the man probably ran a red light, for which he 
was imprisoned in what Kalk calls "our first air-conditioned jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The jail was a small cell attached to the side of a police motor scooter. In 
the photo the prisoner is being written up by a grim-faced LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo is one of thousands of bits of memorabilia which Kalk, founder of 
the Los Angeles Police Historical Society, plans to display in an LAPD museum. 
For five years, the historical society has been working on converting the old 
Highland Park stationinto a community and educational center that will showcase 
the LAPD's sometimes glamorous, sometimes inglorious history.  
</P>
<P>
 With a major fund-raiser scheduled for next week and a group of volunteers 
from the Walt Disney Corp. on board, the museum is on the verge of becoming a 
reality, one Kalk hopes can help reconnect the public with the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rebuilding of Los Angeles doesn't start with the buildings and parks," 
says Kalk, a 55-year-old retired homicide detective and winner of the 
department's medal of valor. "The rebuilding of Los Angeles begins with 
rebuilding the relationship of the police agency with the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalk hopes the museum will join places such as the Southwest Museum and the 
Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum as a destination for Southland tourists. But 
he also wants it to draw students from area schools, and he is working with the 
Los Angeles Unified School District to add the museum to the district's civics 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go into a kids' classroom and teach them -- that's nice," Kalk said. 
"But you drag them out of that school environment and to a place like this, and 
teach them the same lesson, you get 20 times the response." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalk was winding up his 30 years with the LAPD when he hit upon the idea of 
starting a museum. "You start thinking about it when you get to be my age," he 
said. "You start thinking 'You know, when we walk out that door, there's 
nothing to show we've ever been through.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Kalk and some friends and colleagues formed the historical society in 1989. 
The first task was to find a site, and the group settled on the LAPD's former 
Northeast Division headquarters in Highland Park, which was built in 1923 and 
has been vacant since 1983. They persuaded the City Council to lease it to them 
for $1 a year for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some troubles along the way: The Rodney G. King beating, which 
greatly tarnished the department's image, occurred just as the historical 
society was getting ready to go public with the project. And the building that 
will house the museum is scarred from a fire set by vandals earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kalk said he hopes retrofitting can start on the old station in January 
with funds from an old city bond issue to finance seismic work on historic 
buildings. If Tuesday's black-tie dinner, which will honor the memory of actor 
Jack Webb, along with subsequent events, can raise the needed $3.3 million, the 
museum could be finished by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalk said the museum will have displays on the King beating and the ensuing 
riots, as well as on the rampant corruption in the early years of the 
department. "You've got to show the bumps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other exhibits, the museum will contain displays honoring recipients of 
the medal of valor and officers killed in the line of duty, exhibits of LAPD 
uniforms through the years and, Kalk hopes, an interactive area with a 
simulated crime scene where visitors can pretend they are eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for a one-officer substation at the front of the museum, and the 
basement will be a community meeting area for organizations such as 
Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has been able to get a sneak preview of the museum through the 
historical society's mobile museum, a converted Frito-Lay truck that travels to 
civic events and showcases some of the society's more popular memorabilia. The 
jail sidecar drew rounds of laughter when the mobile museum stopped at the 
Newton Division on a recent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should bring those back!" declared Sindey Ginyard, an Inglewood video 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine what the civil libertarians would say," Kalk said as he and Ginyard 
brainstormed on possible uses for the sidecar cell today. One idea was to use a 
similar vehicle at civic parades to "imprison" public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Orquiz struggled to pry her daughter Stacie, 6, away from a display of 
glistening LAPD badges from the first half of the century. "I want the gold 
one, 'cause it's nice," Stacie insisted. One badge she pointed to was a police 
reporter's badge -- a reminder of those cozier days in the 1920s, when the 
department gave out badges even to journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Orquiz, a South Gate resident who is planning to enter the Police Academy this 
fall, said she was glad her three children had a chance to learn about police 
history. "They can get more familiar with what I'm getting into, and learn to 
respect police," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the displays of LAPD history reconfirmed 12-year-old Frederico Reyes' 
career plans. "I want to become an officer," he said as he stepped out of the 
trailer. "So I can protect people."

AROUND THE VALLEY: LESS COMMUTE, MORE COMPUTE AT CSUN IN CYBERSPACE; "WHAT IS 
THE USE OF A BOOK," THOUGHT ALICE, "WITHOUT PICTURES OR CONVERSATION?" -- LEWIS 
CARROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer Guy Ron Heeb had heard by electronic mail that I was going to call. 
His Mac later reminded him of our appointment, probably by beeping a couple of 
bars of "Scotland the Brave." 
</P>
<P>
 We could have met on the Internet but just to be contrary, I insisted we 
conduct the interview the old-fashioned way: in person. After all, to witness, 
to Be There, is the most satisfying part of a reporter's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk up another one to progress. 
</P>
<P>
 It took only a few minutes for Heeb -- or "rheebcsun.edu" as he is known on 
the Net -- to demonstrate how Being There has a much different meaning in the 
computer age. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeb, 34, is the architect of a campus computer service making its debut this 
semester at Cal State Northridge -- the first step toward what may someday be a 
completely computerized school, where students could attend class, flirt with 
the opposite sex, take finals and order pizza, all from their home PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeb is of the generation that discovered computers early enough in life to 
have missed their novelty. Instead, he can describe his machine as "more 
friendly" than its Big Blue equivalent, even though it appears no more friendly 
than say, my television (which on reflection is probably more temperamental 
than my fridge). 
</P>
<P>
 Heeb earned his computer science degree at CSUN and has worked full time there 
ever since. He occupies a cubicle in one of dozens of portable buildings 
scattered throughout the Northridge campus to replace buildings devastated by 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were once familiar with the campus, almost nothing is where it used to 
be. Even now, many students appear to wander the grounds in a daze, looking 
like peasants at a carnival shell game. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators say it will take years and a fortune in repair money to 
piece the campus back together. A tour of Heeb's school of the future may have 
you asking, "Why bother?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime soon, students who can scrape together $1,500 or so for a decent 
computer -- about the cost of the usual commuter jalopy -- will almost never 
have to actually visit the school. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN may trade its reputation as a commuter campus for that of a computer 
campus, where students will evaporate into long strings of 1s and 0s, ghosts in 
an algorithm. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeb showed me around school, not the broken, boarded-up and scaffold-wrapped 
version in the cruelly real world, but the unscathed school that stands tall 
and proud on his 16-inch color monitor. There stands a pristine administration 
building; the busted science complex is reborn, with all its test tubes 
unbroken and back in little wooden racks; the stately columns of the Oviatt 
Library are on their feet and again holding up the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 When his digital school is finished, students with home computers will be able 
to use these glamorous images as guides to information that today they must 
visit those buildings to get, such as class schedules or assignments or 
discussions with a prof. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeb's official job -- underwritten by an initial $10,000 grant from the 
chancellor's office -- is to develop a system of electronic kiosks, computer 
stations to be set up around the campus someday that will allow students and 
everyone else to find their way around school with fancy maps, as well as check 
on class schedules, campus activities and social events. It's called Project 
Looking-Glass, after author and mathematician Lewis Carroll's book "Through the 
Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice in Cybernetic Wonderland, in other words.  
</P>
<P>
 Even computer illiterates can join in, simply by pushing buttons marked 
"Parking," "Food" or "Restrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bells and whistles being planned are messages from CSUN President 
Blenda J. Wilson, whose computer-generated image and voice will greet students 
and visitors, lending a Disneyesque guidance to the lost, the hungry and the 
incontinent. 
</P>
<P>
 While the actual kiosks -- think of a shopping mall's You Are Here display -- 
are probably years away, a lot of the information is already available by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 And long after the kiosks are built -- and then laid waste by vandals, 
nihilists and the Valley sun -- they will probably be remembered as signposts 
to CSUN's future. Because when Heeb is finally done at some indeterminate point 
in the future, students at computers anywhere will be able to schedule classes, 
message their professors, get assignments, check their grades from last 
semester, even vote for student body president. 
</P>
<P>
 From rooms knee-deep in beer cans and dirty clothes, students will conduct 
library research -- the CSUN card catalogue is already on line -- and print 
out, say, a reading assignment for freshman English. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late-night fury of finals week, students can already order from 
Pizza Hut, says Heeb, with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bored? Lonely? Listen to new music on the Internet. Message your friends or 
make new ones over computer lines. That's how her son conducts his love life 
these days, says Marsha Henry, database coordinator for the CSUN library. 
</P>
<P>
 "You almost don't have to leave your desk ever, except to go to the bathroom 
every once in a while," says Heeb. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Minfang Li, professor of management at CSUN, was the first of his 
colleagues to dive into this campus revolution. For his courses in 
international management, Li has begun posting class rosters, references, 
discussion questions, even assignments, on the CSUN system -- which can be 
reached at www.csun.edu, the Internet version of street, number, town and ZIP. 
</P>
<P>
 Li -- apparently an unfettered optimist -- thinks students will be glad to get 
wired up to work all night. "The library may close at night but the Internet 
resources are available 24 hours a day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, an almost unlimited number of students will be able to take 
courses at the school without having to fight for a parking space or mess up 
the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to create what we call distance learning," says Li. "Students 
in some cases won't have to come to school." 
</P>
<P>
 For Kevin Davenport, manager of the campus bar, known as The Pub, the future 
is bearing down on him like a hammer on a bug. Even though his joint is the 
only place at school where students can throw down a few cold ones, Davenport 
says he already has trouble attracting much of a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once classes are over, the students want to go home," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wait, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they may just stay there.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; U.S. 
WITHDRAWS APPROVAL FOR HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of public opposition to plans for a large homeless shelter in San 
Pedro, federal officials have overturned their decision to let the project 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday rejected a plan by 
Turner's Technical Institute, a homeless organization based in South-Central 
Los Angeles, to open a shelter for up to 880 people on surplus Navy property.  
</P>
<P>
 The department approved the project in January under the Stewart B. McKinney 
Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. The law gives homeless advocacy groups first 
option on federal properties no longer being used. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's turnabout follows another by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials there had determined that the 144 housing units on Taper Avenue, 
being vacated as the Long Beach Naval Station closes this month, were suitable 
for homeless use. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, under pressure from local politicians and the harbor community, the 
officials agreed that under McKinney provisions, 60% of the 144 units were too 
close to potentially hazardous aviation fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro Area Community Reuse Committee was elated about the latest 
decision. The committee was established by Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. to come up with alternatives for surplus federal land.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a minor miracle to get one agency to admit they made a mistake and 
just incredible to get a second to do the same," said Doane Liu, the 
committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, protests were attended by thousands of residents who were 
angry that they had not been informed about Turner's plan until after it was 
approved. Residents also maintained that the institute was inexperienced at 
running homeless shelters and that the project was too big. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents now hope that amendments will be made to the McKinney Act that allow 
them a voice in decisions about the use of surplus federal lands, especially 
closed military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation by Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-Neb.) that will change how surplus 
military property is allocated was passed by the House in July. Similar 
legislation introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is pending in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) introduced her own bill last week to add 
requirements for community input and to improve federal monitoring of homeless 
groups applying for federal land.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The bill) would add a lot of notice requirements to the McKinney process so 
we never again have the same process where the community is unaware of a plan 
to put a shelter in the middle of a residential area," Harman said  
</P>
<P>
 The situation in San Pedro has been experienced by other communities 
throughout the country, she said. SUSAN WOODWARD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; TALE OF 
QUAKE SURVIVOR: A FISH FOUND AFTER 8 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be a fish story, but they found a survivor from the Jan. 17 earthquake 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charcoal-colored, white-dotted domino damselfish stayed alive alone in a 
quake-damaged apartment with an evaporating supply of water among the 
decomposed remains of his tank mates: a handful of other fish and a hermit 
crab. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was incredible," said Theresa Madok, who has adopted the fish from her 
brother, Robert. "He'd had no food, no filtration, no nothing for eight 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, along with other residents of the Sea Castle apartments, had been 
barred from his home because of severe damage. He went back Friday with his 
sister to collect his things. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa, a tropical fish enthusiast, went to work emptying her brother's 
prized 60-gallon aquarium. When she got to the gravel, Robert pointed out what 
looked like a dead fish. Theresa thought it odd that the body was still intact 
and looked closer. "You could see the little gills going back and forth," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly refilled the tank, hoping that they had not killed the little 
survivor. After a worrisome hour, it started swimming around. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we found him, he was maybe the size of a dime. Now he is the size of a 
quarter," Theresa Madok said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is now eating flake food with much relish and much enthusiasm. His stomach 
all pooches out now. It's not so flat like it was before."

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; TEACHER STARS BY 
INSTRUCTING KIDS ON FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Gleason was not sold yet on Doug Lopez, so he wanted some reasons to 
accept his pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a filmmaker," Doug told Gleason almost daily. "I'm going to make 
you proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleason, who teaches film, TV and video production as part of the Performing 
Arts Magnet at Pacoima Middle School, finally accepted the pitch and let Doug 
into the class. Students audition -- and sometimes beg to take Gleason's class, 
where they discuss incidental lighting, camera angle and storytelling through 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to learn," said Doug, 14, of Van Nuys, one of several of Gleason's 
eighth-graders clearly looking ahead to careers as filmmakers, editors or 
camera operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure he didn't slack off," Gleason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleason's students watch television with a different eye than most. They bring 
in videotapes of good storytelling or visual effects through images, as well as 
mistakes they spot in films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's great," said Ed Becerra, 12, of North Hollywood, one of 
Gleason's students who is interested in animated films. "In fact, I think he's 
one of the best teachers I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleason, 45, who uses props and toys during class as part of his relaxed 
teaching style, encourages the students to look at their environment with a 
filmmaker's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in Pacoima, there's a lot of interesting things to film around 
here," Gleason told the class, pointing to examples like railroad tracks, White 
man Airpark and other features in the community that he said "gives you that 
feeling of stark loneliness." 
</P>
<P>
 Always a movie fan, Gleason never had formal training. An English teacher with 
a fondness for Charles Dickens, Gleason was teaching at a junior high in 
Highland Park 10 years ago when he first picked up a camcorder and realized he 
might reach remedial reading students -- including gang members -- by first 
getting them interested in storytelling through a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his first projects was titled, "How to Do a Term Paper." But he naively 
picked a rival gang territory for a location, which made some in the class 
wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more oblivious than nervous, until I realized I was in a rough area," 
Gleason said. And although Gleason does not know if he reached any of the gang 
members, one of his more troublesome students from those days is now studying 
to be a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Gleason has slowly been learning the movie business, alongside his 
students. He came to Pacoima six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of Gleason's film lab are covered with movie posters and pictures of 
stars such as Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. He encourages his 
students to watch films starring Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to mess around as much as we do," said Gwen Grande, 13, of Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be as silly as they are at the right time," explained Gleason. 
"Sometimes, I let them go. They're creating." 
</P>
<P>
 Their creative energy has led Gleason's students into projects ranging from 
documentaries on eating disorders, homelessness and poverty to a film festival 
coming up next year spoofing "Schlocky Films." His students have also finished 
the first draft of a script for a feature-length film to be shot next summer 
tentatively titled, "Doing 10 to 20," about a teen-ager assigned to do 
community service in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Students line up professionals to help them as mentors in the film projects. 
They also are required to do their own research, writing and planning for 
shoots. One student last year talked his way into using a limousine for an hour 
and a half for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleason and his students hope to show their film at the Sundance Film Festival 
in Park City, Utah, a festival of low-budget films. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't treat us like students," said Rosa Couch, 13, of Reseda. "He 
treats us like equals."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO BE FOCUS OF TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it verbal abuse or sexual harassment? 
</P>
<P>
 How to identify the difference will be the subject of a free talk at Mission 
College from noon to 1:30 p.m. Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion, to be held in Room 1 of the Campus Center, 13356 Eldridge 
Ave., will be led by Muriel Robinson, a Simi Valley human relations specialist 
and member of the Ventura County district attorney's Task Force Against 
Domestic Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people don't understand that sexual harassment is not the only form of 
abuse, which comes in all sizes and shapes and can be gender to gender," 
Robinson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar is being sponsored by the college's New Horizons program for men 
and women. For more details, call (818) 364-7674. JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STATE 
EDUCATION BOARD SUED FOR LACK OF SEX EQUITY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Board of Education has been sued over its lack of regulations 
against sexual harassment and sex discrimination in public school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit announced Wednesday, the Los Angeles-based California Women's Law 
Center alleges that the state board has ignored a mandate from the Legislature 
to develop regulations to protect students and their families. 
</P>

 The center bases its case on the 1982 Sex Equity in Education Act prohibiting 
sex discrimination in academic and athletic programs, extracurricular 
activities and occupational training. It called for the state boards that 
oversee public education to "issue rules, regulations or orders" to implement 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the Department of Education, said his 
office has not had a chance to thoroughly review the lawsuit. "While we 
understand the concerns, we have to consider carefully whether the law required 
us to do what they claim or whether there was some discretion left for the 
board" in whether to come up with regulations, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL OKS SPENDING PLAN TO ATTRACT BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to keep employers from leaving the area, the Los Angeles City 
Council on Wednesday approved Mayor Richard Riordan's proposal to spend more 
than $1.9 million this fiscal year to retain and attract businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan -- passed by a 11-0 council vote -- the city will hire 
19 people and a marketing firm to launch a public relations effort to stop 
other areas from luring Southern California firms. Los Angeles would also offer 
incentives to employers, including tax breaks and loans.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; DRIVE SEEKS 
REPARATIONS FOR SLAVES' DESCENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fledgling effort to force reparations for the descendants of black slaves 
brought hundreds of people to a church, even though there is no government 
support for the undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 A line of people began forming on Monday and on Tuesday moved to the church 
after organizers ran out of sign-up forms at the home of the Rev. Eugene 
Jeter.Some were not clear on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were giving away a bunch of money," said Elisha Jeffers, 22, 
who was visiting a friend in the neighborhood and stopped because he was 
curious. He did not think much of the reparations idea. "It was so long ago. 
They should have done it at the turn of the century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came down to find out if it was true, because we do want our 40 acres and 
a mule, too," said Shirron Gayles. "It might be a dry run, but even if it is, 
we want to be in on it because I'm a taxpayer citizen and so is my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter said he hopes to organize a national campaign to have a reparations bill 
passed, even though Congress never has taken up the issue. He said the 
paperwork could provide documentation for any future applications. The National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People has supported the idea.

4 ON COUNCIL SEEK TO KEEP PARKS IN LAPD AT FULL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Determined to keep Assistant Chief Bernard C. Parks at the Los Angeles Police 
Department, four City Council members have drafted a plan to allow Parks to 
receive his current salary and benefits even after he is demoted. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members, led by Zev Yaroslavsky, argue that Parks is entitled to 
the $128,388 he earned annually as the LAPD's No. 2 officer, despite Chief 
Willie L. Williams' plan to move him to a lower position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the chief has a right to pick his own top management team, he 
doesn't have the right to muscle a guy out of the department who has 
contributed 29 years of his life to the citizens of the city," Yaroslavsky 
said. "The way Parks was treated left everyone's jaw hanging. It was not only 
unprofessional, it was unwarranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Williams, as well as Mayor 
Richard Riordan, declined to discuss the issue, saying Parks' employment status 
is a confidential personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Williams announced his plans to demote Parks to a deputy 
chief position and promote Chief of Staff Ronald Banks to second in command. A 
deputy chief earns $6,500 less than the assistant chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he needed to make the changes if he is to forge ahead with an 
ambitious expansion of the force and implement reforms. However, it has been an 
open secret that Williams and Parks -- the man he edged out two years ago for 
the chief's position -- did not get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members, angered by the chief's decision, brokered a deal two 
weeks ago that would allow Parks to retain his rank until early next year and 
then retire with a full pension of $89,868 annually, about $4,500 a year more 
than his retirement would have been after the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said Wednesday they wanted to come up with an alternative 
plan that would make it palatable for Parks to stay. In addition to 
Yaroslavsky, those supporting the proposal to maintain Park's salary were 
Councilmen Richard Alatorre, John Ferraro and Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a top cop in everyone's eye," Holden said. "He has the respect of the 
men and women in the department. It would be hard to lose Parks and not miss 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Parks, who asked not to be identified, said the assistant 
chief is reviewing all his options and will decide soon which one to pursue. He 
has until mid-October to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he and his colleagues have asked if the city attorney's 
office can find a way to keep Parks' salary intact. Such a move would probably 
require the support of the full council, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have taken the temperature of the council, and I think we have the 
support," Yaroslavsky said.

IN DISPUTED REPORT, REED FINDS NO COUNTY SURPLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County either has millions of dollars in surplus funds, or not. 
That much is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 35 pages of memos, tables and appendixes delivered to the Board of 
Supervisors Wednesday, Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed offers a 
roller-coaster ride through the complex debits and credits of the $14-billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the ride ends, Reed maintains, it leaves weary travelers right where 
they started, at ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Many county officials have been anticipating tens of millions of dollars in 
excess funds; Reed says there aren't any. The county's books are balanced and 
every penny is spoken for. 
</P>
<P>
 As accountants reconciled the books on last year and finalized the spending 
plan for this year, they discovered both windfalls and unexpected cracks in the 
financial landscape that swallowed up those windfalls. The swing was more than 
$200 million in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't give the board any money to spend," Reed said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearing surplus could mean there will be no relief for the sheriff 
and district attorney, who are facing huge costs of enforcing the "three 
strikes and you're out" law. It also could mean that the Board of Supervisors 
will be stuck with a new and unpopular library tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the saying goes, accounting is an art and not a science. And county 
officials are expected to begin using Reed's numbers to paint varied pictures 
of the county's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 Under some interpretations, the county could have $50 million or more to play 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Supervisor Gloria Molina said her aides figure at least $52 
million is available and the supervisor is mapping plans to spend it first on 
the sheriff's and district attorney's offices and then libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he's identified $16 million in surplus funds 
and said he will recommend the money be given to the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Reed acknowledged that as much as $70 million could be considered surplus 
funds and available for a new round of spending, though she is recommending 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants who were closing the books on the 1993-94 budget found that county 
departments spent $11.8 million less than expected. Then, the financial 
analysts found that $111 million more in taxes -- primarily property taxes -- 
were pouring in. An additional $32.6 million in new and unanticipated revenue 
sources were discovered and $70 million in new savings will be realized from a 
new pension financing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 That all left the county ahead by about $225.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But $51.9 million in expected revenues from a variety of arcane programs 
failed to materialize, leaving the county ahead by $173.5 million. The problem 
is, the 1994-95 budget hammered out in July started with a deficit of about 
$175 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in a few last-minute adjustments along the way, and by Reed's accounting 
the ledgers come into balance.

BUILDING DREAMS; CHURCH AND SYNAGOGUE JOIN TO DEVELOP A HOUSING PROJECT FOR 
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea of living in a three-bedroom apartment without rats or roaches is 
almost enough to make Franklin and Veronica Perez view Casa Carondelet as the 
Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a lot of room right now," Franklin Perez said, rubbing his pregnant 
wife's shoulder as their two daughters sipped orange juice. "This is a boon to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Carondelet is no ordinary low-income housing project. For one thing, it's 
in a safe neighborhood and will be rat-free, its Westside developers pledge. 
And they are not the usual corporate real estate investors -- the people behind 
this project are the members of the University Synagogue in Brentwood and the 
Parish of St. Matthews in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 They have joined forces with city and a nonprofit agency to develop the 
18-unit complex near MacArthur Park. It is expected to open this spring, and 
the congregation members say they will stay in touch with the residents of the 
building after it opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some abstraction about do-gooders and some brick and mortar," 
said Toni Reinis, a member of Church and Synagogue Associates, the organization 
started by the two congregations. "It's about breaking down barriers, human to 
human. We want to get to know the people who live (at the complex). We want one 
community in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Perez family has applied for an apartment, and is grateful for the chance 
to move out of their one-bedroom, Mid-Wilshire apartment into a larger place at 
a lower rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad they're around," Franklin Perez said of the CASA members. "They 
make it possible for people like us to get a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 The dream of building Casa Carondolet had its genesis at a UCLA ecumenical 
meeting five years ago, where Episcopalian and Reform Jewish leaders urged 
congregations to come together and help provide quality housing for low-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two people took up the challenge. Joe Steinberg, 73, a retired 
businessman, and John Riley, 48, UCLA economics department chairman, agreed to 
unite their congregations in CASA, and were made co-chairs of the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals were made, and donations started coming in -- $30,000 from the 
congregations and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of free hours from 
lawyers, planners and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was daunted at first as they faced developers, city bureaucracy, 
neighborhood sensitivity, scam artists and the Internal Revenue Service. And 
then they found Tanya Tull, executive director of the nonprofit group Beyond 
Shelter, which helped guide CASA through a maze of bureaucratic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Shelter develops affordable housing and advises residents on such 
matters as how to manage money and find child care. The organization has 300 
units in development across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Shelter and CASA managed to make Casa Carondelet a reality with loans 
from the Community Redevelopment Agency and Bank of America for $1.2 million 
and $2.7 million, respectively. Monthly rents are to range from $378 for a 
one-bedroom apartment to $574 for a three-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he took up a shovel to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony 
Wednesday, Steinberg recalled that his father, an immigrant who did not speak 
English, got his start in the United States digging ditches. Steinberg credited 
his father's ability to get ahead to his work ethic and to an "accepting 
employer." He said he hopes CASA can play a similar role in the lives of Casa 
Carondelet tenants to the one that employer played in his father's life. 
</P>
<P>
 CASA is committed to developing more affordable housing. Construction will 
start soon at another site in South-Central Los Angeles.

HE SAID / SHE SAID: AVOID WAY-OUT WESTERN WEAR TO PREVENT A DUDS DUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T here are two ways to dress in unmistakably American fashion: You can wear 
traditional, Native American dress or you can put on cowboy duds.  
</P>
<P>
 Both looks are striking; only one takes to laundering very well.  
</P>
<P>
 So let's assume you've decided that you can't go another week without filling 
that gap in your closet with stuff that'll make you look taller in the saddle 
(or at least less out of place at your weekly line dancing lessons). How do you 
know when you've achieved the proper balance of urbanity and trail dust?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: You've gotta start at the bottom. Boots. They're the absolute essential. 
Without a good pair of boots -- not necessarily flashy, but good -- you might 
as well try to strut in penny loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule One: Don't be intimidated by cowboy boots. Sure, they look pretty radical 
with the high heel and the pointy toe, but well-made ones will be among the 
most comfortable items of footwear you'll ever own. The toe doesn't pinch and 
the heel doesn't throw off your balance. Those two features originally were 
designed to help the boot slip into stirrups easily and, once in, to help them 
stay there securely. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule Two: Try on several pair, from different makers, in the style you like. 
They're different -- different fit, arch, width and so on. One pair will be 
just about right. Another will be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule Three: You don't need to go crazy with exotic materials. Yes, you can buy 
elephant skin boots for about the price of a Hyundai. But why? Keep it fairly 
simple and you'll wear them forever. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: A woman needs to start her urban cowgirl look at the top -- with the 
perfect hat. Sure, her boots had better be made for walking -- and dancin' -- 
but it's the tilt of her perfectly fitted hat that will quicken her cowboy's 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a Western hat is a commitment, cowgirls say. And they're right. To 
wear a Panama (my favorite) properly, you have to push your hair back, pull the 
brim down to your eyebrows and kiss your 'do goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: The best advice I ever heard on wearing a cowboy hat came from James 
Garner in the movie "Murphy's Romance." Paraphrased, it's something like this: 
Push it to the back of your head and it means your digestion works, you're 
happy with the world and everything in it, and it's OK to approach. The hat 
squared on the head means that you're purposeful, actively lookin' around for 
whatever the day will bring. Pushed forward, it's a warning to clear a path, 
because you're cocked and loaded for bear. 
</P>
<P>
 These rules probably mean a lot more in a Texas wildcatters' dive than they do 
in your local designer tequila fern bar. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: My favorite look on a tall-in-the-saddle city dude: old, old black jeans, 
clean white shirt, fawn-colored Stetson, bolo tie and a belt with a silver 
buckle big enough to sink a Brahma bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Western looks I hate: checkered square dance shirts that make men look like 
sissies, can't-breathe-in-my-skintight-Levi's and those dang garters some guys 
snap onto their upper arms. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Since guys like Garth Brooks showed up, a lot of that weenie, "Oklahoma" 
wardrobe cast-off junk has disappeared, let us hope forever. One of the best of 
the newer innovations are the men's shirts. Instead of fake mother-of-pearl 
snaps and cheap cloth that looks like a TV test pattern, the shirts on the 
racks today are often heavy cotton with a nice rough hand; the buttons are 
substantial and real, and the colors are bright, striking and not a bit fussy. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Another Western silhouette that makes a woman look like a million: the 
ankle-length gingham or calico dress like the ones worn by Grace Kelly in "High 
Noon." You'll catch her ultra-feminine head-to-toe Western silhouette: 
puff-sleeve dress brushing the ground, a little bustle in back. Not all Western 
gals have to wear pants, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Here's a simple rule of thumb for guys if they want to look authentic: 
Don't wear anything the Duke wouldn't have worn. This means no boots in several 
primary colors, no belt buckles that obscure the knees (sorry, Ann) and nothing 
with a designer label or a product endorsement printed on it. And don't wear 
anything that jingles. If it's spurs, it'll scare your date, and if it isn't, 
you might be mistaken for a Dolly Parton roadie. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: And here's a few rules for gals: Go easy on the rhinestones. Too many and 
you'll be looking like you missed the bus to Vegas. A chunky, low heel on a 
boot is more stylish than a stiletto type. Go easy on the turquoise. A 
squash-blossom necklace is lovely, but combine it with a turquoise belt, 
earrings, rings and bracelets and you'll look like a walking trading post. And 
about that leather purse. Don't carry the one you take to work. Do bring along 
the little tooled number that you found in Santa Fe. Perfect.

 "Costume jewelry is more easily damaged than fine jewelry,"says Christie 
Romero of Anaheim, an antique and vintage jewelry historian, lecturer, dealer 
and collector. "You really must take good care of it for it to last." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, lectures on costume jewelry and is the host, co-writer and co-producer 
of "Hidden Treasures," a videocassette on antique and vintage jewelry of the 
19th and 20th centuries, has seen jewelry ruined through neglect. Jewelry 
thrown together gets scratched and absorbs moisture. Plastic bags trap moisture 
that eats away at jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Verdigris is caused by moisture on brass or copper-based metals, which is 
what most costume jewelry is made of. The verdigris attacks the metal and eats 
it away, leaving a green patina behind. This verdigris corrosion can spread to 
the entire piece of jewelry and destroy it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The green areas can be gently cleaned with a mixture of one tablespoon of salt 
and one tablespoon of vinegar in very hot water, using an old, soft toothbrush. 
"But that formula doesn't turn the metal shiny again," she says. "It would have 
to be replated to get that." 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture not only harms rhinestones and metals, it also destroys faux pearls 
because the moisture lifts the pearling off, exposing the dull stone 
underneath.  
</P>
<P>
 Another mistake people make is to don their jewelry before dousing on perfume 
or hair spray. The moisture from these products destroys the jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 You can sometimes do more harm than good trying to clean or restore costume 
jewelry. "The worst thing is dunking costume jewelry in cleaner, since any 
moisture that gets behind rhinestones will cause the foil backing to tarnish 
and turn black. After that happens, the only thing you can do is replace the 
stones. You cannot revive them," Romero says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Replacing one or two rhinestones is no problem. You can do it yourself as 
long as you make sure to get all the foil backing out of the cup before you 
glue in the new stone," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enameling is difficult to repair and sometimes it doesn't look right when 
it's restored. The best thing is to take care of it in the first place," said 
Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero recommends: 
</P>
<P>
 * Line drawers or containers with foam found at upholstery stores. Not only 
will the foam absorb moisture, it offers resistance so the jewelry doesn't slip 
and slide around. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you live near the beach, put packets of silicone gel -- found in vitamin 
bottles and shoe boxes -- inside your jewelry box. Silicone absorbs moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero offers classes on simple repairs, such as replacing rhinestones, 
straightening clasps and stickpins and cleaning jewelry.  
</P>
<P>
 "Styles and Periods of Jewelry" is scheduled for Oct. 4, 11, 25 and Nov. 1, 8 
and 15 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the Sleepy Hollow Antique Mall, 12965 Main St., 
Garden Grove. The fee is $120 for six three-hour sessions. "Material 
Identification and Restoration," also at the antique mall, will be Nov. 22 and 
29 and Dec. 6 and 13, 6:30 to 9:30. The fee is $80 for the four three-hour 
sessions. Call (714) 539-9187.

BEHIND THE SCENES: SURFRIDER GETS FORECAST FIRSTHAND

 The opening of another pizza joint is usually not cause for celebration, let 
alone the attention of the fashion-focused. But combine the Surfrider 
Foundation's 10th anniversary with the opening of the 10th BJ's Chicago 
Pizzeria, add in a beachwear fashion show and music from the Surftones -- and 
all the pizza you could eat -- and that warrants attention.

 What surf gear locals will be slipping into in the coming months swept ashore 
at the downtown Huntington Beach restaurant last week. The keyword from the 
collection, shown courtesy of Huntington Surf & Sport: basics. Flannel, brush 
denim, cotton and thermal fabrics colored in olive, tan, navy, heather gray and 
black. Only red shot through as a seasonal bright in the drab fall palette.  
</P>
<P>
 But in these parts, where the weather never really gets that ugly and shorts 
are always in, the dark shades may serve as our only indication that summer is, 
at least officially, over. ROSE APODACA JONES

HOT PROPS: FULLY FASHIONABLE

 Finding quality, style and the latest looks for the sartorial-conscious, 
full-figured woman has not always been as easy as a stop at the neighborhood 
department store. "It's really frustrating finding beautiful things once you 
get to Size 14. But it is out there," assures Betsy Hatfield. In the mid-'80s, 
Hatfield had a boutique but closed it when the economy soured. Now she's back 
with two partners, former customers Sharon Meyers and Anne Welch, who had long 
pestered her to return to retail. More Than Enough opened last month in the 
Tustin French Quarter, fully embracing the trio's attitude toward clothes. "For 
too long, full-figured women have been told to wear dark colors and tents," 
Hatfield says. "But we aren't shapeless. We have figures." Indeed, they 
recognize that there are petite and tall full-figured women, too. The inviting 
shop stocks Carol Anderson Collection II, GJG Originals, W, Lida Caputo, Chez 
and many others, in addition to accessories that are gaining fans among those 
under Size 14. Private modeling, trunk shows and image workshops are among the 
services offered. There's even an area for men to relax and read while they 
wait for their mates. The store is open daily, except Sundays when it's by 
appointment only. Fuzzy Head

 While fall clothes come in cashmere, mohair, wool felt, chenille and imitation 
fur, hats are following suit in like fabrics. Whether it's a mohair cloche or a 
felt brim trimmed with faux leopard, Casey Bush of the Millinery Information 
Bureau says, "it's all about texture." The trend reflects the growing 
importance of hats as more than accessories. "The new hats have lots of curves, 
wrinkles and bumps," Bush says. The up-side, she adds, is that many of the fall 
fabrics are more malleable and in softer shapes, making them travel better. Pin 
Up (and On) Art

 The trouble with art sometimes is the cost. Auctions are usually out of range 
for most adults; most children are not learning about art because of shrinking 
school budgets. Enter events such as the one Saturday at the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center. Miniature works of art that double as pins (above) will be 
auctioned for bids starting at $15. Proceeds will benefit the Fullerton School 
District's Foundation for the Arts, an independent, volunteer-run organization 
dedicated to ensuring that art is an intrinsic part of every student's 
education. The foundation's "All the Arts for All the Kids" provides trained 
experts to teach lessons in art, dance, music and drama to the 9,000 district 
students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Eighty local and national artists 
donated more than 100 pins for the fund-raiser. "Their goodness is 
overwhelming," says foundation president Lauralyn Eschner. "The volunteers and 
artists are people who believe strongly in the arts and exposing them to our 
children." ROSE APODACA JONES

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; DRIFTING BACK TO SOME MAGIC MOMENTS; 
OLDIES PROVIDE AN 'EVENING TO REMEMBER' FOR THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING GANGS, DRUGS

 It was Golden Oldie heaven at Saturday's "An Evening to Remember" gala at the 
Hyatt Regency Irvine on behalf of the organization Drug Use Is Life 
Abuse/Project: No Gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drifters crooned "Stand by Me," "This Magic Moment" and "Under the 
Boardwalk." The Platters sang "Only You," "My Prayer" and (with apologies to 
the American Cancer Society) "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coasters belted out "Poison Ivy" and "Charlie Brown," and emcee Donnie 
Brooks sang his one and only hit, "Mission Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness for the chance to dance to these super oldies," one guest said 
as she headed for the parquet. "Those gang numbers were a downer." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. During a dinner of filet mignon and chicken, Orange County Sheriff 
Brad Gates stood before the crowd and rattled off statistics about gang 
activity in Orange County. "With 18,000 gang members and 309 gangs identified 
in Orange County, their presence is felt everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang violence has accounted for 42 homicides in Orange County since the 
beginning of the year. Fifty-eight percent of 515 Orange County residents who 
were killed, injured or adversely affected by gang activity were innocent 
victims. They had no association with gangs or their criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Use Is Life Abuse continues to be recognized as a leader in the area of 
local drug education and awareness. "We continue to make headway in the war on 
drugs," Gates said. "Our drug education booklets have reached nearly 75,000 
children in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fall, students in the fourth through sixth grades in every school in 
Orange County, both public and private, will have access to our new booklet, 
Positively kNOw Violence (a comic book)." 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests were Michael Hayde (who founded Drug Use Is Life Abuse with 
Gates); Marilyn MacDougall, executive director, and Maurice Gallarda, board 
member.

 CHOC backs out of culinary event: Children's Hospital of Orange County has 
backed out of the Culinary Event of the Century on Oct. 18 at the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Newport Beach, citing conflict with another benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our CHOC Walk event only two days before," explained Helen Wardner, 
director of support group services at CHOC. "Our guilds groups are awfully busy 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The gala five-course dinner is being sponsored by the Four Seasons Hotel and 
the House of Mumm Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Barragon, food and beverage director for the Four Seasons Hotel, says he 
was told that CHOC dropped out of the event because alcohol was being promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't think it is appropriate for a CHOC event," he said. "I wanted CHOC 
to benefit because I have children and I know how wonderful the hospital is," 
he said. "But we understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wardner: "We don't want to sound hypocritical about this because we have 
events where alcohol is served," she said. "Our primary concern was 
scheduling." 
</P>
<P>
 The show will go on. Because it is no longer a charity benefit, the ticket 
price for the dinner has been reduced from $250 per person to $150, Barragon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that, there will be proceeds. "We're not sure yet where the proceeds 
will go," Barragon said. "We'll think of something."

IT'S PURR-TY TIME AT PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The roar of a lion reverberating through a canyon in Acton is not an unusual 
thing. Rock music is. But this weekend, both will be heard as the Crash Test 
Dummies, Tesla (making its first concert appearance in a year), the Jeff Healey 
Band and Shadowfax perform at the Shambala wild animal preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Shambala is the 80-acre sanctuary for big cats that actress Tippi Hedren 
founded in 1972. In 1983, Hedren created the Roar Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization to feed and care for the African lions, Siberian and Bengal 
tigers, cougars, leopards and even a couple of elephants that live there. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time such a fund-raiser has been held at Shambala. But even 
with money from Hedren's acting jobs and the occasional tour groups she leads 
through the preserve, it's getting tougher to provide the $250,000 the animals 
gobble up each year. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with the help of her daughter -- actress Melanie Griffith, who will emcee 
the event -- Hedren is preparing the animals for the biggest gathering ever to 
grace their secluded home. She doesn't expect a stampede at the first sound of 
a guitar whine, because the music will carry down the canyon, she says, away 
from the animals. "The animals are getting used to the sound," Hedren adds. 
"We're playing soft rock every day, and building the decibel level so it won't 
be a shock to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other bands scheduled to play include the Tubes, Marshall Coleman, Madaio and 
Craig Chaquico of Jefferson Starship. Concert-goers will also get to walk 
through the preserve. For "Artists for Shambala" tickets, $35, call 
Ticketmaster: (213) 480-3232. For directions, call (213) 650-4715. LAURIE K.

R S V P; ECLECTIC TRIBUTE TO AN ACTIVE GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Children's Bureau of Southern California celebrated its 90th anniversary 
at the Regent Beverly Wilshire on Tuesday evening with a crowd of close to 700 
who gathered at the $300-a-plate benefit to pay tribute to Lodwrick Cook, 
chairman of Arco and community leader extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I say a word about the Lord, please allow a word about the Lod," said 
the Reverend Cecil Murray, pastor of First A.M.E. Church, as he stood to 
deliver the invocation. 
</P>
<P>
 With his lengthy list of volunteer chairmanships, including Junior 
Achievement, Rebuild L.A. and the Library Foundation of Los Angeles, Cook is 
widely admired as a kind of miracle worker. He's a cool guy, that much is 
obvious, even without the testimonials from every living U.S. President. Cook 
would probably be an excellent President himself, except that he's too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was definitely eclectic. It's hard not to admire the inspired 
audacity of an entertainment double bill featuring Phyllis Diller and Dame Kiri 
Te Kanawa. Add to that First A.M.E.'s Freedom Choir. Oh, and then there was 
dancing to the big band sounds of Conrad Janis and the Beverly Hills Unlisted 
Jazz Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Even spicier than the entertainment was the food. Cajun-style chicken breasts 
with fiery corn relish disproved the theory that benefit fare need imitate 
airline cuisine. There wasn't a dry eye in the place, but in the end every 
plate was cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech, the honoree delivered some helpful hints for aspiring 
paragons:  
</P>
<P>
 "One, never slap a man who chews tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two, never buy anything from someone out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three, if you had everything you ever wanted, where would you put it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Four, if you think the problem is bad now, wait until Congress tries to fix 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five, the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its 
limits." 
</P>
<P>
 On hand were Cook's wife Carole, gala co-chairs Constance Towers Gavin and 
Sheldon I. Ausman, dinner chairwoman Mary Jones Marshall, and guests including 
former Mayor Tom Bradley, Tom Selleck, Charlton Heston, Anne and Kirk Douglas, 
Rhonda Fleming and Ted Mann, and Aaron and Candy Spelling. Members of the 
dinner committee included Joan and John Hotchkis, Joanne and Roger Kozberg, 
Frank and Anne Johnson, and Lew and Edie Wasserman.

ANYTHING BUT BASIC, BROWN IS THE NEW BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's fall's hottest hue, so don't just call it brown. If it's warm, call it 
toast; earthy, deem it mushroom; luxurious, label it sable. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Klein's run of brown includes luscious color names such as coffee bean, 
chocolate and walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Many a recent season has begun on the premise that brown will chase black on 
the popularity chart. This year, it's full of promise because brown, in its 
deepest, richest tones, is perfectly suited to the plushness of fall's 
textures, including suede, leather, mohair and shearling. 
</P>
<P>
 Just be sure your makeup palette will match. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you wear brown near your face, you need to bring up more reds and corals 
in your makeup so you don't look washed out," says Nancy Husted, fashion 
director for Neiman Marcus in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Vittadini has created luxurious knit dressing in shades of nutmeg, 
chocolate and mocha. Yarns are lambswool and Angora blends, mohair and wool. 
Cabled tunics are to mix and match with woven trousers and jersey knit pants, 
around $200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw brown on the runways, it was so rich," recalls David Nutterfield, 
fashion director for I. Magnin in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why the specialty store featured brown on the cover of its fall 
catalogue in the form of a classic Giorgio Armani wool pants suit and silk 
blouse with matching suede gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing it in a lot of different shades, but every single shade is 
rich," Nutterfield says. "They're true browns, not muted, not washed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Husted agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coffee; it's chocolate. The colors and tones in the brown family are 
running the gamut," she says. "Every season you see a small smattering of it, 
but this season the focus is on the different shades of brown." 
</P>
<P>
 On different moods, too. Brown ranges from velveteen for evening to tweeds for 
a country weekend. A brown leather jacket offers an updated alternative to 
black. Look for funky brown mini kilts and long, slinky charmeuse slips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animal prints, fake furs and menswear styles made a hit on runways for fall, 
and brown mixes well with all of those messages," says Phillip Monaghan, 
executive vice president of marketing for Express stores in Columbus, Ohio.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: ONE PERSON'S FORUM IS ANOTHER'S INTRUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk. Talk. Talk. Personally, I hear enough of it. My kids talk a lot, my 
colleagues talk a lot, my friends carry on, and I can pretty much talk a person 
into a stupor. Once I climb into my car, I look forward to either total silence 
or a numbing wall of music to accompany me on my drive home. The idea of 
punching in yet another nattering voice is about as appealing as mohair in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, I'm not the only one who feels this way. Even staff writer Jeff 
Meyers, who wrote this week's Centerpiece on the local talk radio scene, finds 
all that conversation daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I never listen to talk radio," he said. "If it isn't accompanied 
by music, no human voice is allowed on my car radio. I consider commercials an 
invasion of my privacy. I have the quickest station-changing finger in the 
West. Even deejays get the ax if they talk for longer than five seconds. I 
never understood why stations let deejays blab on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the on-air personalities on the music stations. The people on 
talk radio never shut up. So what's the appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 "Local issue-oriented talk radio like 'The Carl Haeberle Show' serves an 
important function in the community, providing listeners with a forum for 
topics they really care about," Meyers said. "It's very democratic, almost like 
an old-fashioned town hall meeting with differences of opinion and 
give-and-take. So many people feel alienated from society, but talk radio gives 
them a chance to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 But in this area, much of that participation is more silly than civic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other talk radio, as practiced by Dave and Bob and Dick Whittington, is 
basically nonsensical background noise," Meyers said. "But it serves a useful 
purpose, keeping people company as they prepare for work or drive the lonely 
freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 One radio personality who makes a lot of noise even when he's off the air is 
K-HAY's drive-time deejay Ray Taylor, who is also a national free-standing 
black powder muzzle-loader champion. He'll be participating in the target 
competition at this year's Sespe Rendezvous from Oct. 12 to 16, an annual 
family-oriented event that features camping, historical costumes, barbecue and 
a country-western dance with live music. For more details on that event and 
some local dance workshops and competitions, check out Robyn Loewenthal's 
Country Roundup column.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LA MIRADA; CITY TO CONSIDER PLAN TO TAKE OVER LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to consider withdrawing La Mirada Library from 
the financially troubled county library district. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the council directed its staff to study the 
legal, financial and practical implications of taking over the county-run 
facility at 13800 S. La Mirada Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the council could vote to pull the library out of the 89-branch system, 
it probably would not take any action without approval from the city's voters, 
said Gary Sloan, city manager. City voters would be asked if they were willing 
to adopt a special property tax to fund the library, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors would also have to approve any effort to remove the library 
from the county system, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Mirada Library reduced its schedule to three days a week in the wake of 
cuts in county funding for libraries in the past two years. The library may 
have to cut back further to two days a week in mid-October if the county or 
city does not provide additional financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors recently adopted a plan to fund the libraries in 
cities where a property tax was approved to assist county branches. La Mirada 
did not join the plan, but it may consider providing some emergency funding to 
prevent the library from curtailing its hours. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff also will study the possibility of forming a regional library 
district with nearby cities, Sloan said. A small, regional district may have 
lower overhead and greater efficiency, he said. JOHN CANALIS

<P>
 In response to a fire that ripped through a rental guest house, killing four 
people and injuring four others, the City Council unanimously passed an 
emergency ordinance requiring smoke detectors in all residential rental units. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires smoke detectors in all multifamily dwelling units, but the 
new city ordinance requires that detectors approved by the county fire marshal 
be installed and maintained in all rental units except those that are 
owner-occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have known smoke detectors were required, they would have been 
there," Felipe Soto, 18, a co-owner of the fire-gutted rental unit, told the 
council. The single-family unit was not covered by state law. "This ordinance 
would be a reassurance that something like this wouldn't happen to anyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 13 fire started after 6-year-old Eddie Hernandez, who was playing 
with a lighter, ignited the guest home's lace curtains, said Juana Hernandez, 
39, who survived the blaze that engulfed the $500-a-month unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie was pronounced dead at the scene by county fire officials. In the days 
after the blaze, Maria Castillo, 35, her daughter Erica, 8, and Hernandez's 
daughter Jessica, 2, also died of their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire inspectors said they were unsure last week whether smoke detectors 
would have made a difference in such a quick-spreading fire. SIMON ROMERO

<P>
 The City Council extended a ban on fortunetellers for 10 months to give 
officials more time to study how seers should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had approved a 45-day ban in August after Whittier resident 
Barbara Adams sought to open a fortunetelling business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Springs has no fortunetellers and they are not covered in city zoning 
laws. City officials said they were caught off guard and want to study how 
fortunetellers can affect an area. JOHN D. WAGNER

<P>
 The City Council has voted unanimously to begin a curbside recycling program 
in January that will help the city comply with state environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-gallon bin for aluminum, newsprint, glass and plastic will be delivered 
to single-family homes, condominiums and apartment buildings with less than 
four units. Residents will not be asked to sort the materials before placing 
them in bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly rates will increase $1.50 beginning in January, from $9.96 to $11.46. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada and other cities are required by state law to recycle 25% of their 
trash in 1995. About 20% of the city's trash is currently recycled. JOHN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; SEA MAMMAL EXHIBITS AT AQUARIUM REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed aquarium in Long Beach will not have whale and dolphin exhibits, 
city officials recently announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was prompted, they said, by growing public concern about the 
health and welfare of marine mammals held in enclosed spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a prevailing municipal philosophy that intelligent mammals should 
not be maintained in captivity," said City Manager James C. Hankla. "There are 
other ways to (teach) a complete water story, using motion pictures, virtual 
reality or life-sized models." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific, as the proposed 
$100-million facility is known, is scheduled to begin next spring. Specific 
exhibits will be selected in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium would be the centerpiece of a proposed $557-million tourist 
harbor and pier at the foot of Pine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig A. Humphrey, who heads a Long Beach animal advocacy group called Teach 
Animal Objectivity, praised the city's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These animals are unique in the fact that their intelligence levels are 
matched only by their social capabilities," he said. "It's slavery to keep them 
in pens." JOHN POPE

THEATER REVIEWS; REASSURING 'THE FANTASTICKS' FAN; THE SHOW'S SHORTCOMINGS FAIL 
TO THWART SOME OF THE PERFORMERS IN THE BUENAVENTURA THEATER GROUP PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the longest-running off-Broadway shows, "The Fantasticks" is also a 
popular selection with community theaters. The newly formed Buenaventura 
Theater Group has chosen it as its opening production, and the show bodes well 
for the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The show itself sharply divides audiences. Those who are enchanted by its 
fanciful presentation of the growing love between a young boy and girl walk out 
of the theater humming "Try to Remember." But detractors find Tom Jones and 
Harvey Schmidt's show a muddled mess and the show's songs so thin that there's 
no impetus to recall them, even if it were possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Gary Poirot has assembled an adequate cast, with some members rising 
above the show's shortcomings to make "The Fantasticks" worthwhile for those 
who really enjoy it; those in the second camp aren't likely to change their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathleen McCarthy and Clint Crowell star as The Girl and The Boy, who grow up 
in adjacent houses and gradually grow close romantically. Faith George and 
Roger Begley portray her mother and his father, and Robin Murphy is the dashing 
El Gallo, who narrates the story and plays a vital part in getting The Boy and 
The Girl (Matt and Lisa, actually) together. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the principals, Justin Blackburn and Jayme Housh are seen as 
The Handyman and The Mute, respectively -- stagehands in practice, moving 
things around during the action -- and Jimm Giles and someone who calls himself 
"Jarrod" play two actors brought in by El Gallo to affect the action. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an attractive cast, and McCarthy is a fine singer. But voices don't carry 
particularly well in the Elks Lodge in Ventura, so some of the characters sound 
a bit dim by contrast -- the prerecorded instrumental backings may be a bit too 
forceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffoons in the old tradition, the two clownish "actors" are always worth 
watching, which makes it a shame that "Jarrod" hides behind a pseudonym.

THEATER REVIEWS; LITTLE IS LOST IN THIS UPDATING OF SHAKESPEARE; ROARING '20S 
SETTING BOOSTS MODERN AUDIENCE'S UNDERSTANDING OF CLASSIC SOCIAL SATIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Shakespeare's earlier comedies, "Love's Labours Lost" is, on its 
simplest level, one of the easiest for modern audiences to comprehend: Seeking 
self-improvement, a king swears himself and male members of his court to three 
years of abstinence from partying and women. How long until all fail to live up 
to their vows? It's almost immediate. But then there are the inadvertently 
switched love letters, the pretentious Spanish ambassador, and the flirtatious 
members of the French court. Even with much of Shakespeare's dated social 
satire whizzing by modern audiences, it's quite amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Louis Fantasia has taken accessibility one step further in the 
current California Shakespeare Company production: His cast is in modern dress. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "modern" relative to Shakespeare's time, at least, with the upper-class 
principals costumed as dandies and flappers from the Roaring '20s -- think of 
Jay Gatsby, Bertie Wooster or Lord Peter Wimsey and you'll understand the 
milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 It works, sort of, in what's quite a departure for the company. "Love's 
Labours Lost" is the first of the company's productions to be directed by 
someone other than Artistic Director William Fisher, and Fisher's conventions 
are largely disregarded. In addition to the updated setting, this show features 
something of a set (those two cardboard trees are as much a contrast to 
Fisher's usual minimalist trappings as a production of "Phantom of the Opera" 
would be from "The Odd Couple"). All of which is a way of saying to fans of 
Fisher's shows: Expect something different here, even if you recognize some 
familiar faces among the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Vincent stars as Ferdinand, King of Navarre (an independent country on 
the Spanish peninsula), with Anthony Liveri, Mark Tortorici and Stephen A. 
Carver as the members of his court. Shannon Fill is the princess of France, 
attended by Megan Dolan, Jeanmarie Flynn and Melissa Piro. The prominent comic 
roles are Dull, a policeman (Monish Bakshi); Custard, a rustic here portrayed 
as a sailor (the very funny Mitchell Castro); and Don Adriano, the Spanish 
ambassador (Joe Barra). Catherine Smith plays Moth, the Spaniard's irreverent 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting is acceptable throughout, with no standout performances in a play 
that really has no standout roles, and the costumes are nifty. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's next production will be "Henry V." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Love's Labours Lost." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: California Shakespeare Company Theater, 6685 Princeton Ave., 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8; Sunday afternoons at 3 through Oct. 
23.

3 FIRMS MAY STOP FLOW OF OIL ROYALTIES; LONG BEACH: AN ESTIMATED 13,000 OWNERS 
OF MINERAL RIGHTS WILL BE OFFERED INVESTMENT OPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three oil companies operating in Long Beach have announced that they will no 
longer pay royalties to some 13,000 owners of mineral interests in properties 
on an oil field beneath most of the city's shoreline areas, including Downtown. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The mineral rights owners, most of them heirs and small investors, will be 
offered the choice of becoming full investors in the 47,000-barrel-a-day 
enterprise and assuming many of the risks of the oil market, or of abandoning 
their claims altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Other oil companies could take over the 13,000 leases, but that appears 
unlikely in the current oil market, investors said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 29 years, property owners and those who own the mineral rights to the 
properties have received regular payments for allowing a group of 
"working-interest owners," including Chevron, Phillips Petroleum and ARCO oil 
companies, to extract oil and gas from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But decreasing reserves in the oil field and fluctuations in the price of oil 
have made the operation less profitable for the three oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron will pull out of the oil field altogether, said R. K. Spackman, the 
company's public affairs manager. ARCO, owner of THUMS Long Beach Co., which 
manages the oil field, will continue to be involved in oil production there. 
Phillips, which has small mineral rights stake of its own, will continue as an 
investor.  
</P>
<P>
 The royalty payments could stop by the end of the year, after mineral rights 
owners have been formally notified, Spackman said. Formal agreements signed by 
property owners in the mid-1960s included terms for suspending royalty 
payments.  
</P>
<P>
 Royalties paid to the 13,000 mineral-rights owners represent only a small 
portion of the profits from the field, which extends into Long Beach Harbor. 
The state receives the largest share of the profits. Last year, the state 
collected $18 million, or 87% of the profits. The city received $161,000, less 
than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The field is the so-called Long Beach unit of the East Wilmington Field, where 
oil was discovered in 1936. In 1965, the oil companies began pumping from a 
series of four oil islands in Long Beach Harbor. The Long Beach unit yielded as 
much as 150,000 barrels a day by the late 1960s. About 790 million barrels have 
been pumped from the field since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the mineral rights owners in the field's so-called Townlot area -- the 
portion on dry land -- are small individual investors. They receive an average 
of about $350 a year, oil company representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all became working-interest owners, they would have to absorb collectively 
about 8% of the $150 million a year required to operate the field, the 
representatives said. That represents an average annual payment of $92. 
</P>
<P>
 But that does not take into account the possibility of a downturn in the 
market, said Mel Wright, an oil industry consultant who is also a 
royalty-interest owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright and his wife, Jonine, receive royalty checks of about $50 a month 
because they own a share of the mineral rights to a property at 5th Place and 
Ocean Boulevard, which they inherited from Jonine Wright's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as THUMS keeps the costs down and the oil price stays up, you'll make 
money," Wright said. "But if oil goes back down and there are more drilling 
expenses, you lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil from Long Beach was selling this week for $13.44 a barrel, oil company 
spokesmen said. Last December, one of the few months when the Long Beach 
operation went into the red, the price fell below $9, they said.

CITIES JOIN FORCES TO TACKLE COMMON PROBLEMS WHILE CUTTING COSTS; GOVERNMENT: 
COALITION SEEKS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE CLOUT AND ACCESS TO FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The borders marking city limits in Southeast Los Angeles County symbolize 
municipal pride, independence and a sense of friendly competition to residents. 
But some of those boundaries are beginning to blur as leaders of eight cities 
in the region increasingly cooperate to attack nagging social and economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of regional collaboration -- combining the resources of individual 
cities to address common concerns, cut costs and improve service to residents 
-- has been proposed in the region for years, but little has come of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, inspired partly by the sluggish economy and years of budget cuts, the 
eight cities are seeking new joint methods to bring jobs, education, 
transportation and safety to the area's estimated 370,000 residents. Their 
efforts follow a national trend, experts say, and may be more comprehensive 
than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Regionalization) is the thing of the future," Huntington Park Councilman 
Raul Perez said. "It has to be. We have to pool our resources if we're going to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 That cooperative spirit has evolved out of the admission that although the 
cities may promote their individualism, their problems -- and their futures -- 
are inextricably linked. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 jobs have been lost in the last year as industry continues to 
trickle out of the region, analysts say. Most of the cities have adopted a 
utility-users tax to stabilize budgets rocked by the loss of state funding 
during recent budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problems are population density, below-average education 
levels -- up to 70% of the adults in the area do not have high school diplomas 
-- and high unemployment, which hovers around 10%, according to a report 
compiled by the office of Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 Under Escutia's leadership, the cities formed the Southeast Community 
Development Corp. last spring. The coalition unites Bell, Bell Gardens, 
Commerce, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon under a 
nonprofit umbrella, which leaders hope will give the area more clout with 
government agencies and funding sources that would not ordinarily fund city 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the corporation's first proposals is to create a trolley system using 
alternative-fuel vehicles to feed into the Blue Line and Metrolink systems. 
Under the $500,000 plan, individual cities would pool unused funds from the Air 
Quality Management District and apply to the AQMD for matching funds to pay for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD collects money from motor vehicle registration fees and distributes a 
percentage to cities to be used for local transportation projects. Because each 
city's share is based on population, an individual municipality may not have 
enough money to fund its own project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commerce (with about 12,000 residents) only gets $13,000 a year based on 
population," said Ira Gwin, the city's director of community development. 
"That's nothing. But if we can pool that together with other cities, that makes 
sense. That's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation is also waiting to hear whether it will be designated a 
federal enterprise zone and has submitted an application to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development for up to $1 million in tax credits for 
employers, said Dolores Sanchez, Escutia's spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 The type of cooperation seen in Southeast Los Angeles County is part of a 
growing trend, said Jeff Fletcher, spokesman for the National League of Cities, 
an organization representing 1,450 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the forward-looking communities realize that their future economic 
and social stability depends on the region as a whole," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cooperative effort among seven Southeast cities began in October with 
an agreement to fund a satellite campus for East Los Angeles College in 
Huntington Park. The cities allocated $24,000 each to help set up the program. 
Had Huntington Park been asked to foot the $150,000 bill on its own, the 
project would have failed, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate venture also launched last year, Bell, Maywood, South Gate and 
Huntington Park formed the Metro Gang Task Force to track the dozens of gangs 
in the area, where 45% of all crime is believed to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Perez, of Huntington Park, is proposing that five of the cities, which 
are served by 12 separate water districts, re-evaluate their programs with an 
eye toward combining water services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cities' many similarities have helped persuade leaders to 
collaborate, officials say that cooperation has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Maywood City Manager Ron Lindsey recalled how Maywood voters soundly rejected 
a 1976 ballot measure to merge their city with Bell and said residents are 
still skeptical when talk turns to regionalization. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are real protective of their small town and worry about (the town) 
losing (its) identity," Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Others worry that combining efforts could erode the personal service that 
smaller cities provide, Bell City Manager Robert Rizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting seven or eight political entities to agree on larger issues may 
require the same diplomacy it took to form the European Economic Community, 
quipped one city official. 
</P>
<P>
 But Escutia remains optimistic. "It requires a different mind-set," Escutia 
said of the regional approach. "You can't be parochial."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; LANDLORD FINED $11,000 FOR CODE VIOLATIONS 
</P>

<P>
 A Long Beach man and a company owned by his family have been fined more than 
$11,000 for criminal slum violations.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Frontiera, 34, pleaded no contest to five fire, health, and building 
and safety code violations at the Frontier Hotel, a 430-room building for 
low-income people and welfare recipients on West 5th Street in Los Angeles.Zuma 
Corp., the company that owns the hotel, was charged with 10 violations.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Thomas L. Willhite also placed Frontiera on two 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were filed in March after several inspections of the hotel by the 
city's Slum Housing Task Force between September and December, 1993. Violations 
included lack of heat, broken and missing smoke detectors, broken fire doors, 
exposed live electrical wiring, defective electrical and plumbing fixtures, and 
accumulations of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiera said he has spent $200,000 on repairs and expects to spend another 
$100,000 before the city's demands are met. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants have already demolished some of the repairs, he added. "Two months 
ago, we put in new showers. On the 12th floor alone, three (shower heads) are 
already broken off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Janet Jackson, who handled the case, said the Frontier Hotel 
owners are not slumlords. She said the city understands that some violations 
are caused by tenants. But owners of low-income housing must be prepared to 
invest money to keep the housing up to code. SUSAN WOODWARD

SIGHTS; SHOW BLENDS KITSCH WITH SERIOUS WORKS; FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX, ROUGH TO 
GENTLE, THE BUENAVENTURA COMPETITION PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF LOCAL ART, IN ALL 
ITS BEAUTY AND VARIETY.

<P>
 As a reliable field report on the state of regional art, the Buenaventura Art 
Assn.'s annual juried competition may take the prize -- at least in terms of 
democracy in action. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, filling the Buenaventura Gallery with all manner of 
aesthetics, attitudes and aptitudes, is nothing if not every which way. Pretty 
pictures and pleasant artistic visions -- often a specialty of this space -- 
are peaceful cohabitants with sterner stuff, art of a more probing, 
rougher-hewed nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Culled through the discriminating eye of juror Ron Robertson, an assemblage 
artist based at Santa Barbara City College, what we get is a solid, nonpartisan 
overview of what makes up art in Ventura County. Needless to say, the depths 
vary, but the findings are encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College instructor Gerd Koch, one of the best artists in the area, 
displays his poetic command of the fertile ground between -- and overlapping -- 
abstract and landscape traditions. "Spring Is Searching for Someone" is, in the 
best sense, a painting searching for resolution. Visual beauty and 
compositional balance are offset by dripping rivulets of paint, creating an 
intriguing tension. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar tension, though achieved with different means and having different 
intentions, marks Chloe Murdock's "Nude With Wolf," one of the strongest works 
in the show. A narrative residue wafts in the red-suffused interior of this 
large painting, in which the smudged, "incomplete" painterly process and the 
presence of the subjects contribute to an aura of sinister sensuousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolution and simplicity are at the heart of the first-place winner in the 
two-dimensional division of the competition, Sherry Loehr's "Blue Fortune." 
This neatly crafted portrait of a box of fortune cookies doubles as a study in 
light and color. In the same room, Donald Fay's "Running With Old Blue" is 
another impressive watercolor, in which the tapestry-like field is as visually 
striking as the dog and woman who traverse it. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant life and landscapes get their day in the sun in this exhibition, with 
diverse results. Robert Wassell depicts Santa Cruz Island with a good feel for 
both the idyllic and also the mythical qualities of the island, via his crisp, 
stylized definitions of forms within the composition. Linda R. Wigen explores 
the human-like personae of drooping sunflowers with the aptly entitled "Bowed 
Heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Robbins' essentially abstract piece, "The River Is a Strong Brown," 
asserts its naturalistic metaphor with undulating layers of bark-like paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In what can seem, inevitably, like a helter-skelter collision of artworks in a 
group show such as this, sometimes the more memorable pieces are those that 
tread lightly and speak softly. 
</P>
<P>
 A gentle, peculiar charmer in this group, for instance, is Sally Miller's "Pit 
Stop," whose subject is a rowboat amid a thicket of murky blue-green brush and 
water. Nostalgia and desolation are the twin emotions here. It is a humble, 
even homely, little painting that sits in a corner crowded out by its more 
extroverted peers, basking in its own muted, considerable charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 And, quiet though it is, Jane McKinney's still-life "Two Lemons" exerts a 
poetic, vital appreciation of objects in space. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare case of sociopolitical awareness in the show, Roxie Ray shows "The 
Harvester," one of her affectionate portraits of farm laborers -- that 
significant and often ignored demographic in Ventura County. Here we see a 
large, close-up view of a faceless picker trying to ward off the heat with a 
bandanna and cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Photography is represented, although scantly. Jurgen Kuschnik shows a wry 
craftiness in his work, especially in the Polaroid "Peppermania," manipulated 
to look like a still-life painting, and "Ode to Ruth Bernhard (Life Savers)," 
with hole-y candies casting ominous shadows. "Datura Mandala," Michael 
Apuliese's photograph, transforms rolled-up textile into an animalistic 
presence through clever use of tight focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-D category, the first-place ribbon went to Shirley Ransom's 
assemblage "Afterglow," in which a fire vignette is conveyed through found 
objects. Matches, scorched metal and fabric, and a ghostly image of resilient 
cockroaches tell the story in a roundabout way. Christine Hanson's wily "The 
Occupant" plays up contrasting forms and textures with a leathery serpent 
slithering through a solid block of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, this show's theme -- if there is one to be gleaned -- is 
about innocent pursuits of beauty and the good life. That sentimental strain is 
epitomized in Patricia Robinson's oil painting, "Feeling Fall," a pumpkin-patch 
scene with a harmless allure. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's wrong with a show in which kitsch is liberally stirred in with 
stronger cultural ingredients? All in all, it's a big, happy, messy family of 
art from our midst, worth looking at. ART BY DEFAULT 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more oddly fascinating exhibitions in a local museum of late 
relates to art only tangentially. The show at the Ventura County Museum of 
History and Art is called, with canny accuracy, "Making Life Easier: Tools, 
Household Technology and Office Equipment, 1870-1930." 
</P>
<P>
 What's really on display here is a provocative slice from the evolution of 
convenience and better-mousetrap building. Who would have thought that a 
gallery full of antique typewriters, washing machines (the 1927 Maytag is an 
immaculate beaut), vintage planes and other artifacts geared toward the easier 
life would have such appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 These functional, quotidian objects of yesteryear -- divided by curators Tim 
Schiffer and Barbara Schwartzberg into tools and appliances for the home, 
office and farm -- have, by now, taken on a more refined aesthetic character. 
We view them now as highly physical, surprisingly elegant and amusingly 
improbable implements with a strange resemblance to art, by default. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on the residual beauty of obsolescence. This show handsomely 
underscores the point that everyday objects eventually transform into either 
junk, art -- or both. Details

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; EX-CITY EMPLOYEE SAYS BIAS COST HER A JOB 
</P>

<P>
 A former city employee who suffers from multiple sclerosis sued the city this 
week, claiming she has been shut out of a job because of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit filed Tuesday, attorneys for Nancy I. 
Scrivens said the city had an obligation to retrain Scrivens after hip problems 
related to multiple sclerosis made her unable to continue work as a lab 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Since receiving a diagnosis in October, 1992 -- about three years after she 
began her 39-hour-a-week job with the city -- Scrivens was forced by the 
disease to take time off for hospitalization and recovery. She was given a 
temporary clerical assignment in 1993 but has not worked since hip-replacement 
surgery in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrivens asked the city for a new civil service assignment, but she has been 
offered only a 16-hour-a-week clerical position, which her attorney says is not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've labeled her an invalid, and she's not," said attorney Ellen Serbin. 
"She wants to work. All she wants is a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Serbin has also filed claims with the federal Equal Employment and Opportunity 
Commission and the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The federal 
claim is being investigated. The state action has been suspended pending the 
civil suit. A claim filed with the city in May was rejected by the City Council 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the city attorney's office were unavailable for comment. EMILY

CAROUSEL TO TAKE A SPIN TO BAY AREA

 The historic, hand-carved carousel at Shoreline Village in Long Beach has been 
sold to the city of San Francisco, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 88-year-old merry-go-round built by renowned craftsman Charles Looff will 
remain at the waterfront shopping and dining complex in Long Beach for about 
two more months, said Marianne Stevens, who owns the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, a collector who lives in Roswell, N.M., had leased the carousel for 
10 years to Shoreline Village, where the ride's multicolored horses, camels, 
giraffes, rams and chariots have been key attractions. The lease recently 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Sause, project director for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, said 
the carousel will be the centerpiece of a proposed multimillion-dollar 
children's center, which includes gardens and an ice-skating rink, near the 
George Moscone Convention Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid $1 million for the carousel, Sause said, adding that independent 
estimates had placed the value much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the merry-go-round has special ties to both San Francisco and 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Looff, who finished building the carousel in 1906, lived for many years in 
Long Beach and worked on his trademark amusement rides. The merry-go-round was 
in Seattle briefly before spending about 60 years at the now-closed Playland 
amusement park in San Francisco. Stevens bought the carousel when the park 
closed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has such sentimental roots in San Francisco, we're thrilled it's coming 
back," Sause said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said she has offered to lease another historic carousel to 
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., the owners of Shoreline Village. That 
carousel, built by Charles Carmel, is nearing the end of a two-year 
restoration, Stevens said. Officials representing Northwestern declined to 
comment about a possible replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, author of a book on merry-go-rounds titled "Painted Ponies," said 
that only 153 antique carousels are left in the United States. Many others have 
been broken up and the pieces sold to collectors. Of the 17 built by Looff, 
only 10 remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
 A Looff carousel at Long Beach's old Pike amusement park was destroyed in a 
fire in 1943.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens committee has begun collecting signatures on a petition asking 
county authorities to allow the city to break away from the Los Angeles and 
Compton school systems and form its own district. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Carson Unified School District Formation Committee say more 
than 100 volunteers are working to collect signatures.The independent district 
would include Carson High School, three middle schools and 14 elementary 
schools within city boundaries, except Compton's Ralph Bunche Elementary 
School, which serves Compton students primarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Office of Education authorized the group last week to collect 
signatures after reviewing its list of reasons for creating a separate 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say an independent district would allow local control of 
educational standards, more responsiveness to local needs and a fairer 
allocation of funds. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNEY; RENOVATED RIO HONDO GOLF COURSE TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will officially reopen its 18-hole public golf course Saturday after 
a $4.7-million renovation that added rolling fairways, waterfalls and lakes to 
the once dry, flat course. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews spent 11 months remodeling the 101-acre site at 10627 S. Old River 
School Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio Hondo Golf Club course features four lakes and two waterfalls. Greens, 
tees and fairways are larger and feature higher-quality grass. The course also 
has 36 enlarged sand bunkers. Much of the course will be irrigated with 
reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all new. We went right down to the dirt," said Bruce MacDonald, the 
course's manager. "The only thing left from the old course is the trees." About 
1,200 trees, most of which were standing before the renovation, line the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates for players have also increased. Weekend prices have jumped to $35 a 
person from $20 last year. Weekday prices have gone up to $25 from $16. Rates 
for senior citizens and children under 16 years old are up to $18 from $12. 
Downey residents are given a $5 discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Powell, assistant city manager, said the new rates will help pay for 
increased staffing and maintenance costs. The course's budget this year has 
increased to about $1.9 million from $1.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeling was funded primarily with revenues from a bond issued jointly 
by the city and county, and with surpluses generated by course fees, Powell 
said. About 100,000 rounds of golf were played at the club in the fiscal year 
that ended June 30, 1993. City officials expect about the same number in the 
next 12 months.  
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point architect Gerald W. Pirkl redesigned the course and Arizona-based 
Wadsworth Golf Construction Co. of the Southwest renovated it. JOHN CANALIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials have agreed to pay $70,000 into a trust fund for an 
8-year-old student who suffered permanent head injuries after a schoolyard 
accident three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by guardians of the student, Traevon Crumby, accused Compton 
school officials of negligence in failing to provide adequate supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorneys said the boy, then a first-grader at Roosevelt Elementary 
School, suffered head injuries when another student pushed him off a slide. 
Traevon still has periodic blackouts, according to the suit. The guardians 
initially had sought $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials approved the settlement because they did not want to take the 
case to trial, said Melanie E. Lomax, an attorney for the district. The 
district did not admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said the school district provided adequate supervision -- five teachers 
were overseeing about 150 schoolchildren -- at the time of the incident. "It's 
literally impossible for school officials to prevent all injuries to students," 
she said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

 The Police Department will open a community center in January to expand youth 
programs and Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will be part of an effort by police and other city officials to 
improve conditions in a blighted, crime-prone 20-block area with many 
apartments and absentee owners.The area is bounded by Pickering and Greenleaf 
avenues and La Cuarta and Philadelphia streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The center at Greenleaf Avenue and Whittier Boulevard will be staffed about 20 
hours a week. A police officer and workers from three other city departments 
will share the duties, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers will work with youth organizations to develop local sports programs 
and movie nights and will help increase Neighborhood Watch groups from nine to 
about 20 in the area. They also will offer residents brochures and advice about 
crime prevention, home repair and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to improve the blighted area began last November. JOHN D. WAGNER

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: RAY TAYLOR HAS LEARNED TO MAKE HIS MARK OFF THE AIRWAVES; THE 
POPULAR K-HAY DEEJAY IS A NATIONAL MUZZLELOADING CHAMP AND PLANS TO COMPETE AT 
THE 23RD ANNUAL SESPE RENDEZVOUS NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the six years since Ray Taylor has been an on-air personality at K-HAY, 
Ventura County's largest country radio station, he's emceed concerts and 
outdoor celebrations, escorted contest winners in limos, survived monster-truck 
car-crushing demos and supported charitable events, including the station's 
annual Toys for Tots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And on weekdays he and sidekick Charlye Parker, along with newsman Doug Drigot 
and sportscaster Barry Turnbull, energize the early morning drive-time crowd 
with their jokes and quips. But Taylor is one deejay who can shoot off more 
than a clever retort. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor is a crack marksman and a National Muzzle Loading Rifle Assn. national 
champion. So when he's not behind a microphone, chances are you will find him 
at the Ventura Shooting Range practicing for the 23rd annual Sespe Rendezvous, 
Oct. 12-16, sponsored by the Ojai Valley Gun Club at its Rose Valley range in 
the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 This family oriented camping event celebrates the pre-1840 fur trade era and 
attracts more than 500 day visitors and another 500 campers and participants. 
It's a great hands-on living and learning experience for children because fans 
of authentic and re-created black-powder weapons also usually make their own 
costumes and accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
 No modern firearms are allowed in the area. People who shoot muzzleloaders are 
interested in the costume and culture of America from the French and Indian War 
to the close of the Civil War -- not in brute firepower. And they shoot at 
paper targets, not animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an old saying (on loading a muzzleloader)," said Taylor. " 'First the 
powder, then the ball, or the damn thing won't go at all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. Ever since friends in Arkansas triggered his interest 17 years 
ago, Taylor has been "building and shooting guns." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the hands-on doing it -- taking a piece of wood and turning it into a 
relief and carved gun stock with inlays. It's very satisfying and I do it in 
the old traditional way with just hand tools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rifle he shoots is the first one that he built from scratch. He named it 
"Old Ten-Spitter" after the highest point value on the targets in national 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's won me two state championships (Arkansas and New Mexico) and a national 
title in February. I also finished second in the traditional offhand 
championships," said Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offhand" means standing with no support other than your body, explained 
Taylor. You can't use artificial rests. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you want to compete, eat, dance or just laze about -- there's 
something for everyone at the rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers can check in on a first-come, first-served basis (no reservations 
taken) between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Oct. 12-15. The event continues through Oct. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 15 event starts at 8 a.m. with the popular pancake breakfast ($3). 
Then comes target-shooting competitions using flintlock and percussion rifles, 
pistols, revolvers and even cannons. At 1 p.m., look for the period dress 
contests in categories for men, women and children. But even spectators are 
encouraged to arrive in primitive attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks will also enjoy the traders' row -- more than 45 booths and displays 
featuring unusual crafts, clothing and supplies from the era and demonstrations 
of handicrafts, bead work, spinning and scrimshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The day ends with a barbecue at 6 p.m. and dancing to the Blue Tigers 
country-Western band from 7:30 p.m. to midnight. But the number of dinner 
tickets is limited -- and at $6 they sell out fast. Details

NIGHT LIFE: TIME HAS COME AGAIN TO SAVOR '60S STANDOUTS; REUNITED CHAMBERS 
BROTHERS TO VISIT OJAI'S BOWLFUL OF BLUES -- AND PLEASE, DON'T CALL THEM AN 
OLDIES-BUT-GOODIES ACT.

 The Chambers Brothers, four psychedelic black guys and a white drummer, were 
one of the best, if not the best, performing rock bands of the '60s. Don't 
believe it? Doubters and those who know better will get their chance to see for 
themselves Saturday when the band headlines this year's Ojai Bowlful of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Four brothers from Mississippi -- Joseph, Lester, Willie and George -- started 
off as gospel singers, moved to Los Angeles and ended up recording a bunch of 
albums, including three memorable ones for Columbia. Their most famous song is 
"The Time Has Come Today," wherein Joseph informs his listeners: " . . . and my 
soul has been psychedelicized." The song continues to live long and prosper on 
the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brothers played with (and outplayed) about every '60s band. Most bands had 
one or no good singers; the Chambers Brothers had four. There was a 
particularly memorable show at La Playa Stadium in Santa Barbara in 1969 when 
the Brothers opened for the Doors and completely blew them away in the ultimate 
tough-act-to-follow scenario. All the dead rockers would have a tough time 
following the Chambers Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brothers broke up in the mid-'70s and all went their separate ways, except 
for sporadic reunion gigs. Now, managed by Beverly Noga, whose mom guided the 
career of Johnny Mathis, the Brothers seem set to have another go at it. Joseph 
Chambers recently discussed his favorite band. 
</P>
<P>
 So where have you guys been lately? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, we've been playing quite a lot, especially the last year or two; 
whenever we can is all I can tell you. We go up to Seattle, Portland and Eugene 
quite a bit, and we do San Jose and San Francisco a lot. We were all set to 
play the Woodstock thing, the one with all the original people on the original 
site, but it got canceled. Anyway, we're doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 How many brothers are still in the group? 
</P>
<P>
 There's three original brothers, George, Willie and myself. Lester's in Las 
Vegas, so he's getting closer. George's son plays drums, and one of our 
sister's sons plays bass. And we have another guitar player. The original 
drummer, Brian Keenan, passed on from a massive heart attack about 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do retrospective '60s specials usually omit the Chambers Brothers? 
</P>
<P>
 We've been wondering the same thing. For some reason, Columbia always pulled 
our singles off the market before they became hits, and our strong point was 
always album sales. I think a lot of those bands were chosen for the specials 
for their No. 1 hits, and we never had a No. 1 single. 
</P>
<P>
 But they used to play Time" on AM radio. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two versions, and most of the radio stations didn't want the cut 
version, they wanted the long version. A guy in San Francisco -- I forget the 
station -- played the long version and started getting a lot of calls. From 
him, most of the stations played the long version on AM radio. That song has 
done quite well -- it's been in 18 movies. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS didn't want you guys to record "Time"? 
</P>
<P>
 No. We were forbidden to do the song. I told them that this song would be the 
biggest ever for their label, but they said they'd get some white band to do 
it. "Not in my lifetime," I told them. We stuck to our guns, and things just 
turned out our way. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the Chambers Brothers play those revival glad-to-be-working tours for a 
bunch of old hippies? 
</P>
<P>
 We've been approached, but we don't want to fall into that status. We've 
gotten along in age -- I won't say how far -- but we're not an 
oldies-but-goodies revival act. People need our message, and we work at 
improving it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Is love, peace and happiness out of date? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not out of date. It's more needed now than it was in the '60s. The people 
then were more into oneness, and now it seems, we've taken so many steps 
backwards. I think our message will bring us back to the forefront of the music 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys made zillions -- why ain't you rich? 
</P>
<P>
 We're still trying to figure that one out. We're trying to reclaim what is 
ours. We didn't have very good management, our money was mishandled and we made 
some ill-advised investments. But we've kept our sanity, our health and our 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being rock stars in the '60s? 
</P>
<P>
 It was obviously exciting. We never started out to become big-time rock stars. 
We started out singing gospel music -- that's where our roots are -- and we 
just took it to the coffeehouses and just got caught up in the rock 'n' roll 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the band move from being a gospel vocal group to an electric rock 
band? 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a transformation that happened without us making a plan for it. We 
used to do a gospel set and a blues set, and the blues set became stronger and 
stronger. One time we were in New York City doing a benefit at, I think, 
Carnegie Hall, with Peter, Paul & Mary and Pete Seeger. We ended up in the 
studio with Bob Dylan, who was recording "Highway 61 Revisited" at the time. So 
he asks us if we've ever been to a discotheque. We never heard of such a thing, 
and he told us it was a place where they played records and people danced. So 
he takes us to this place called Ordell's, and the announcer says there's some 
special guests in the house and he called out our name. So we went up there, 
picked up some guitars and figured we'd do our coffeehouse set, only speeded 
up. Brian Keenan was the house drummer. We ended up staying there for three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bands didn't want to play with the Chambers Brothers? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we did have some trouble playing with certain people. No one wanted to 
follow us. But we had some good friends among the "J-People," Jimi Hendrix, 
Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison. Janis used to say, "Just put me on before those 
brothers." Jimi just did his thing and didn't care where he played, and Jim was 
always our friend. We played with those bands a lot of times; sometimes they'd 
open, sometimes we would. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Chambers Brothers music? 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers Brothers music is better than ever, and it's becoming more and more 
all the time. It's growing more progressive, it's harmony, it's happy, it's 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the band get a new deal? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's been very difficult for us, but a lot of bands from our era have 
been making their comebacks. Not long ago, we were advised to go into the 
studio with some musicians and record some stuff. When we circulated the stuff 
we were told that it wasn't really us -- that's not the Chambers Brothers. Next 
time we go into the studio, it'll be ourselves playing. I think we can get 
signed again to a major label; if not, we'll go with an independent label, God 
willing. We'll get our stuff out to the public. Details

THEATER REVIEW; A DOSE OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS; 
MEMBERS OF A WOMEN'S CLUB ARE DRAGGED INTO THE 20TH CENTURY IN DEL SHORES' 
'DAUGHTERS OF THE LONE STAR STATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Shores' best-known comedy, "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?" was 
abroad satire of life in the deep South among a family of what might be termed 
"trailer trash," even if they weren't living in a trailer. Shores' follow-up, 
"Daughters of the Lone Star State," features a somewhat snootier rung on the 
class ladder and brings in a bit of social consciousness. In the Plaza Players' 
current production, it's the (more or less) serious part that works best. 
</P>
<P>
 The titular organization is a group of women in a small Texas town dedicated 
to good works: Their oath reads, in part, "as a member of the privileged, I 
will help the underprivileged, whether the person is white, colored or anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 With a membership that's rapidly shrinking as Daughters leave or simply die, 
the group is in a financial crisis. The play takes place during the course of 
one meeting, in which several members find themselves pulled more than a little 
reluctantly into the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 First, former member Vergie Hopkins returns after a long absence: She's a 
troublemaker and a pain, but the Daughters need her past-due dues. But before 
she arrives, she sends a prospective new member, the former Ima Jean Winkler, 
who married a ( gasp !) Mexican. But dealing with that isn't preparation for 
the arrival of Sharon Johnson, daughter of Darlene Parsons' longtime maid. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilarity, and a bit of social commentary, ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who feel that many of the battles against such overt prejudice have 
been fought and won, "Daughters of the Lone Star State" (which takes place in 
1992) may seem awfully out of date, but the women's struggle is handled nicely 
enough in the second act. (Act 1 is just silliness, character establishment). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael Maynez has assembled a cast composed largely of (as is 
appropriate to the play) women of A Certain Age, with, it appears, varying 
degrees of theatrical experience. Some were still having trouble with their 
lines at Saturday's opening, but several are as appealing as can be, and in 
some cases the forgetfulness and hesitation can be considered part of the 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan G. Cook, Sharon Reinhold, Lela E. Baker, Jean Nussman, Claire Wilson, 
Olivia Hunter, Lucile Ferrie and Linda Hershman portray the Daughters, with 
Nussman again playing the character she portrayed in the Plaza Players' 
production of "Daddy's Dyin'." Betty Taffert plays the maid, Dawn V. Shreve her 
daughter, and Connie Ramos the young woman with the Mexican-American husband. 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Daughters of the Lone Star State." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Plaza Players Theatre, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Livery Arts Center),

 * WHEN: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m., through Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $10 all performances. On Wednesdays only, the second ticket is free.

CENTERPIECE: TAME TALK; RADIO LISTENERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HEAR GOOFBALL THAN 
HARDBALL ON COUNTY AIRWAVES. HOSTS MEAN TO ENTERTAIN -- NOT OFFEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave and Bob strike precisely at 5 a.m., five days a week, hitting Ventura 
County like a major temblor. Seldom pausing to breathe, the goofball hosts of 
KVEN radio's top-rated talk show assault us with canned train whistles, turkey 
gobbles, Bronx cheers and assorted wisecracks in between news bites, traffic 
reports and Speedy Rooter commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your last name is Edison?" Dave asks a caller. "Where do you live? Ormond 
Beach?" 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in Ventura County and want controversial, in-your-face talk radio, 
turn your dial to those distant Los Angeles stations carrying right-wing 
paragon Rush Limbaugh and raunchy Howard Stern. Locally produced talk radio is 
not out to shock or anger anybody. When President Bill Clinton scolded 
talk-radio hosts recently for their cynicism and negativity, he wasn't 
referring to anybody in this county. Nothing but comfy, warm feelings and good 
intentions crisscross our airwaves. Hosts can get away with being irreverent 
and silly, but the audience doesn't want them to be disrespectful or rude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main objective is to have fun and try not to offend anyone," says Dave 
Ciniero of the "The Dave & Bob Show," which has been on the air for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Dick Whittington, a madcap subversive at L.A. radio stations (once 
dumping a giant Alka Seltzer into the ocean to protest government toxic-waste 
disposal), has admittedly gone soft since becoming KNJO's morning host last 
March. His one venture into controversy -- flippantly accusing a Thousand Oaks 
City Council member of being pro-caning -- resulted in an on-air apology by 
Steven Angel, the station's vice president and general manager. The incident 
snapped Whittington back to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a smartass all the time," Whittington says. "Nice once 
in a while is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But nice can at times be, well, "bland and boring," says Phil Hendrie, host of 
KVEN's afternoon talk show for 18 months in the early '90s. Hendrie himself 
tried to be provocative and controversial at KVEN, which is why he's now 
working at another station, WIOD in Miami. Hendrie's liberal viewpoint and 
cynicism -- he once tried to stage a "Celebrity Lettuce Picking Day" -- 
alienated many listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was bringing in younger listeners," Hendrie says, "but driving away the 
older ones." 
</P>
<P>
 And the county's older, mostly conservative listeners comprise the core 
audience for local talk radio, which is dominated by Ventura-based KVEN, 1450 
on your dial and your only 24-hour talk 'n' news station. While both AM KVEN 
and FM KNJO (92.7) produce the county's only Monday through Friday live talk 
shows, only KVEN gets enough listeners among local talk stations to make a blip 
in the Arbitron ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to data compiled by Arbitron for spring, 1994, "The Dave & Bob Show" 
is rated second among listeners 35 and up in lucrative morning-drive time, 
beating Howard Stern, who comes in over Los Angeles' KLXS. In the same time 
period, KVEN's country-music sister station, KHAY, is No. 1 in the county among 
listeners 35 and up. (KNJO, a Westlake Village station too small to be tracked 
by Arbitron, declined to estimate its audience size.) 
</P>
<P>
 KVEN's other regular local talk show -- serious discussions hosted by Carl 
Haeberle -- isn't nearly as popular as its wacky morning counterpart. While 
"The Dave & Bob Show" grabs a 7.4 share of the total listening audience, 
Haeberle averages a 1.3 share in his 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Haeberle was hired last November to replace Frank Haines, the award-winning 
host who died of a heart attack Sept. 2, 1993. Haines started his career as a 
jazz-show host with KVEN in 1950, two years after the station opened. He 
pioneered talk radio in the county, launching his own show in 1967. Until he 
mellowed in his later years, Haines often was a scabrous interviewer, 
infuriating his guests with tough questions. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not Haeberle's style. Nor is intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make the big noises a Rush Limbaugh does," the 55-year-old Haeberle 
says. "I want to deal more in reality and fact than name-calling and rumors. 
It's not one of my things to be mean." 
</P>
<P>
 An earnest host with a wide range of knowledge, Haeberle takes seriously his 
job as the public's conduit for information and his role as democracy's 
advocate (his signature slogan is "Do what you can, but think about it first"). 
He avoids gratuitous controversy, the hot-button issues like abortion and gun 
control that are easy to fight about but wind up "not changing anybody's mind," 
he says. "I think people would rather learn through listening than arguing." 
</P>
<P>
 In his phone interviews with county experts and politicians, he steers a 
middle course through the day's local social and political issues, which 
decreases the chances for a spirited debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's hard for me to tell if he's liberal or conservative or 
moderate," says county Supervisor John K. Flynn, a frequent guest on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 KVEN fills out its broadcast schedule with syndicated talk shows originating 
in other cities. Gene Burns, a libertarian with strong opinions, deals with 
national and world events and issues. Dr. Joy Browne and Lee Mirabal give 
advice on relationships, and Bruce Williams offers financial tips. Like the 
station's home-grown lineup of on-air personalities, none of the syndicated 
hosts are radical, gross or offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our brief experiment with real controversy . . . people were turned off by 
it," says David Loe, KVEN president and general manager. "(Hendrie) was not the 
right guy for the market." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical KVEN listener, Loe says, is Ventura's Anne Shinder, a 57-year-old 
speech therapist, stepmother of five, and one of Dave and Bob's most loyal 
listeners. "They're like family," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday through Friday, KVEN's daffy duo wake her at 5 a.m., sweetly crooning 
"good morning" as she gropes through the darkness to the bathroom. They follow 
her to the shower -- coming over loud and clear on her special waterproof radio 
-- and accompany her as she drives to her job at the Ojai Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't start the morning without Dave and Bob," Shinder says. "This is 
true. You kind of wake up with a smile. You can get out of bed and laugh. 
They're fun. Dave's funny and Bob goes along. He's not known as the witty one, 
but he can be funny in a dry way." 
</P>
<P>
 Shinder has listened to Dave and Bob since moving to Ventura eight years ago 
and finding she was unable to pull in "The Ken & Bob Show" from Los Angeles' 
KABC. Now she's hooked on Dave and Bob and wouldn't consider anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't listen to those other types of shows," Shinder says. "It upsets me 
when they yell at each other. Dave and Bob are PG rated. They have to be -- 
that's their audience. This is Ventura. We're not big, cosmopolitan L.A."

COVER STORY; COURT RULINGS MAY FORCE CITIES TO LOOSEN THEIR LAWS ON ADULT 
BUSINESSES. BUT OFFICIALS' PLANS ARE RAISING THE IRE OF NEIGHBORING RESIDENTS, 
WHO ARE INTENT UPON . . .; BUCKING THE ESTABLISHMENTS

<P>
 Bill Bledsoe drives through his west Long Beach neighborhood, cringing as he 
passes the two X-rated bookstores and the racy topless bar packed with 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe worries about other adult businesses creeping in along Pacific Coast 
Highway just blocks from his home -- further eroding an area plagued by 
prostitution and other crime. "Trash breeds trash," he says with a snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his neighbors, Bledsoe wants to see the pornographic haunts run 
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 To his dismay, the city must make room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach and cities across southeast Los Angeles County are reluctantly 
planning to loosen their zoning laws on adult businesses so the measures will 
stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the cities used laws to keep adult establishments away from 
churches, schools, homes and parks. In Long Beach, officials earmarked the 
port, the airport and oil fields for adult entertainment. But court rulings, 
including a recent federal appeals court decision, have declared such areas 
commercially unsuitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, elected officials find themselves in a no-win situation. If they don't 
provide the businesses new, acceptable places to operate, their cities could 
face costly legal battles with little hope of winning. But if the officials 
pass laws that more loosely regulate adult entertainment, they will face irate 
constituents such as Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boils down to who's right -- residents who own homes in the community or a 
bad element that wants in," said Bledsoe, 64, president of the West Long Beach 
Assn., and a lay leader of a church in nearby Paramount. "Why should my 
standard of living be violated by sleazy entertainment simply because they want 
to express themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are considering the scaled-back laws in the wake of a federal 
appeals court ruling last year that stopped Los Angeles from enforcing its law 
against a group of adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the city's ordinance -- which 
required all adult establishments either to move into specific areas or shut 
down -- failed to provide enough suitable locations. Los Angeles had listed Los 
Angeles International Airport, the port and oil refineries as potential sites 
for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, leaving 
the appeals court ruling as the final authority for cities in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most southeast Los Angeles County cities have few -- if any -- adult 
establishments. Yet the very thought of topless bars opening down the street 
from playgrounds and schoolyards has sent officials scrambling to draft more 
flexible laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Hawaiian Gardens decided to review its ordinance after the 
owner of a club that features nude dancers sued the city. Officials had closed 
the club for violating its adult-business law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cerritos, where there is no adult entertainment, the City Council has 
enacted a 45-day ban on business licenses for such establishments so its staff 
can write a law. Whittier, which has lost a costly court battle over its 
adult-business ordinance, recently adopted a new measure. In Lakewood, the 
Planning Commission expects to review its community's rules next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any adult businesses and we don't want any," Lakewood spokesman 
Don Waldie said with a note of irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is in Long Beach where the issue is most contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city is facing lawsuits by the operator of the city's lone topless club 
and a group of adult bookstores. In both cases, the businesses allege that the 
city violates their rights of free expression because it does not offer enough 
viable places to operate -- effectively forcing them out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood associations and business groups, meanwhile, have attacked the 
city's move to weaken its law. From the gritty neighborhoods on the westside to 
the upscale enclaves on the eastside, groups have flooded council members with 
phone calls and letters blasting the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to fight this rip-off of the citizens of Long Beach with the toughest 
ordinance we can sustain before the courts," said Bill Niemeyer, president of 
the Lakewood Village Residents Assn. in east Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is considering a number of proposals that will alter its 
zoning law for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan, recommended by the city's attorneys and Planning Commission, would 
reduce the required distance between adult businesses and residential areas 
from the current 500 feet to 200 feet -- less than a city block. A 1,000-foot 
"buffer" between adult establishments and churches and parks would be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members have balked, saying the proposal would go too far. 
Several also objected to a proposal to exclude adult businesses from downtown, 
saying all parts of the city should shoulder the burden of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council placed a moratorium on all permits for adult businesses 
-- even though none are currently in the pipeline -- until the matter comes up 
again at the Oct. 11 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighborhood activists say the council should not change the law at all. 
They envision nude bars springing up on their corners -- subjecting children to 
lewd behavior and bringing crime to their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're old-fashioned, but our kids should not have to put up with 
this," said Martha (Mike) Croft, chairwoman of the North Long Beach 
Neighborhood Assn. "We're not setting a good example." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the changes will actually open the floodgates to adult entertainment 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials argue they are only providing additional sites for adult 
establishments. Anyone who wants to start an adult business will still have to 
obtain business licenses, entertainment permits and other city approvals before 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials point out that the proposed law will help curtail trouble 
through new provisions requiring adult businesses to close at midnight and to 
provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials are also hoping that simple economics will help resolve the 
issue. They are betting that landowners, particularly in upscale areas of the 
city, will refuse to rent to topless bars and other adult entertainment out of 
fear that property values will plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of allowing adult businesses in our properties," said 
Jean Bixby Smith, president of the Bixby Land Co., which owns three shopping 
centers in an east Long Beach neighborhood where zoning laws blocking adult 
entertainment would be lifted. "I would not be happy if other landlords 
approached it in a less responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over adult entertainment has surfaced in Long Beach at a time when 
such businesses appear to be on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, when the city was a thriving Navy port, its downtown core was known 
for a raucous night life that included adult theaters and massage parlors as 
well as seedy motels, tattoo shops and bars. But the businesses were driven out 
in the 1970s as the city launched an ambitious downtown redevelopment campaign. 
In 1977, the city adopted its adult-entertainment law, which prohibits the 
businesses within 500 feet of residential areas and 1,000 feet of schools, 
churches and parks. Since then, only one new adult business has opened, Angels 
nightclub in west Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are just seven adult businesses in the city -- including five 
adult bookstores and a massage parlor -- about half as many as a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a great demand for these particular activities," said Councilman 
Thomas J. Clark, whose eastside district would gain new areas for adult 
businesses under the changes. "The market is limited." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clark and other council members find themselves tiptoeing through a 
political minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people showed up last week0 during the City Council's first 
hearing on the subject. Several demanded that the council fight any changes, 
even if it means going to the U.S. Supreme Court. One man brought a petition 
signed by his neighbors calling on the council to stand strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Others simply issued warnings.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you vote . . . yes on this amendment, be prepared for what will happen to 
you at reelection time," said Julie Bescos of the Virginia Country Club Lane 
Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, city leaders say they will have no choice but to change the law. 
"We're dealing with a difficult situation," said Mayor Beverly O'Neill. "No one 
wants to see adult businesses near our homes, schools and churches. I know all 
the council members are struggling with this. If we don't write a new 
ordinance, adult businesses will be free to go in anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge has expressed doubt that the city's existing law is 
constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, U.S. District Court Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer barred the city from 
stopping topless dancing at Angels until the issue can be decided at a full 
trial. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angels, which had featured dancers in bikinis for seven years, began offering 
topless dancers in July. "The demand is (for) topless," owner Renee Vicary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer, in her ruling granting Angels a preliminary injunction, said Long 
Beach's ordinance mirrored that of Los Angeles. The Long Beach law "does not 
appear to provide sufficient . . . reasonable properties" for a topless club to 
operate, she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the places that Long Beach's existing law has zoned for adult 
entertainment are Long Beach Airport, an oil refinery, a power plant and the 
city's port. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a fraudulent ordinance," said Vicary's attorney, Roger Jon 
Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicary and other business owners contend that the city's attempt to force them 
to move into adult-entertainment zones would effectively run them out of town 
because the zones lack viable commercial locations. As a result, the city is 
violating their First Amendment rights to free expression, the owners say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through World War II to see that freedoms would be kept," said Robert 
Blake, president of Fluffy Inc., which operates South Seas adult bookstore in 
west Long Beach. "Burning books is not part of those freedoms." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they aren't trying to infringe on the owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody is talking about driving them out of town," said Deputy 
City Atty. Bill Keiser. "No one wants to take away their freedoms. We are just 
trying to control their locations within the constraints of constitutional law. 
I don't see this as any different than other zoning decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even under the proposed new law, Angels may face more trouble over topless 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has not been included in the new adult entertainment zones the city 
is considering. City officials say Angels is too close to a residential zone. 
Vicary says her location is ideal because it is on the western edge of town in 
a manufacturing district isolated from homes and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicary says she'll fight to keep Angels topless. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot keep us out of Long Beach," said Vicary, 33. "Everybody's answer 
is, 'We don't want any topless bars in Long Beach.' It cannot be done. They 
can't stop me from being here." 
</P>
<P>
 Vicary, Blake and other adult business owners accuse city officials of 
yielding to a small number of vocal constituents. The owners said their 
establishments don't bother most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a very religious man who believes in a higher power and so on, but for 
politicians to follow the whims of small, noisy groups is wrong," Blake said. 
"It appears to me that religious do-gooders are stepping into areas that they 
shouldn't step into." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members in Long Beach and other Southeast cities say they have an 
obligation to take action on behalf of their constituents. The officials 
bristle at the notion of courts cutting into that authority -- saying free 
expression stops at their city limits when it runs counter to community mores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities should be able to make the final decision based on the will of the 
people," said Hawaiian Gardens Mayor Kathleen M. Navejas. "It takes control 
away from us and the people we're elected to represent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens already has done battle in court -- and faces the prospect of 
more litigation in the months to come. In April, the city was able to close 
down a club that featured nude dancers after a federal judge decided the club 
violated a municipal ordinance prohibiting such businesses within 500 feet of 
churches. The owner, Thomas Shelley, has appealed. No court date has been set. 
So far, the city, which has an operating budget of $3.3 million, has spent 
about $150,000 on legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legal battle has raised new questions for Hawaiian Gardens. The city, 
only nine-tenths of a square mile in size, finds itself in a quandary because 
of its size. Attempts to keep adult businesses away from homes, churches and 
schools could, in effect, drive the businesses out, say critics of the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelley's attorney, Diamond, believes the city's law will be overturned by 
higher courts.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconstitutional because it totally bans adult businesses in the city," 
Diamond said. "We'll challenge that in court for as long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the state, adult businesses have sued cities -- and won -- over the 
years. Diamond, who represents many adult businesses, has successfully 
challenged laws in Anaheim, Stanton, Santa Ana and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier is among those that have lost in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the owner of an adult theater in uptown Whittier sued the city over 
its ordinance, which prohibited businesses from selling sexually explicit 
material within 1,000 feet of churches or schools. The Pussycat theater was 
located within a block of four churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was struck down in 1988 by a federal appeals court. A year later, the 
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, ending a 12-year legal battle that 
cost the city nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, Whittier adopted a series of temporary laws to keep adult 
businesses out. A permanent ordinance, which takes effect next month, erases 
the 1,000-foot church buffer zone, freeing up more space for adult businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is no adult entertainment in the city. The Pussycat theater, 
damaged in the 1987 Whittier earthquake, has reopened as a traditional movie 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials remain wary about scaling back their law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would all like to have more local control (over) these types of businesses 
in the community, but the (courts) have said you can't absolutely prohibit 
them," Councilman Bob Henderson said. "So, we're going to comply with the law."

KEEPING BANTER NAUGHTY BUT NICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Whittington was talking on the phone to a secretary at the Haitian 
Embassy in Washington, explaining his cockeyed plan to keep revolution and war 
from breaking out in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to trade your General Cedras for Fidel Castro," he tells the 
secretary, who has no idea what he's talking about -- or that the conversation 
is being heard over KNJO radio on "The Dick Whittington Show." 
</P>
<P>
 " What do you want?" she asks, mildly bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittington muffles a chuckle. "Let me ask you -- and you're being so nice, 
dear -- do you know how I can reach President Aristide?" 
</P>
<P>
 After she unexpectedly reads him a phone number, Whittington hangs up in glee 
and dials, but the phone's busy. Whittington is disappointed, as if the world 
had been denied an opportunity for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 (Sweet) Dick Whittington, 60, has been playing naughty pranks for more than 
three decades while working for nearly every major AM station in Los Angeles, 
including KGIL in the San Fernando Valley, where he was hired and fired four 
times. Known for bizarre humor -- a mail-order minister, he once married the 
Queen Mary to a mere harbor-cruise boat -- Whittington is on his best behavior 
at KNJO, which is heard mainly in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use Cathy's face as a guide," Whittington says, referring to his on-air 
sidekick, Cathleen Drury. "Her eyes tell me how far I can go." 
</P>
<P>
 If Whittington goes overboard these days, it's to celebrate a Thousand Oaks 
kids baseball team that won a national title. But he still can push the borders 
of good taste: Recently he made the crack that he "had hemorrhoids with more 
personality than Warren Christopher." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittington improvises most of his lines, using station employees as joke 
fodder. No one is immune. When Whittington spotted station boss Steven Angel 
entering the studio, he told the audience: "Our general manager just walked in 
and, oh geez, does his cologne reek." He motioned to Angel: "Go sit over there, 
away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, who has known Whittington for 25 years and worked with him at KGIL, 
hired him last March to juice the station's morning show. But Whittington, who 
was unfamiliar with the community and the 6-to-9 a.m. slot, stumbled out of the 
starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two months were terrible," he says. "I don't think we had 10 
listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 Avuncular and slender, Whittington presides over his show in an offbeat 
studio, more like a college dorm room with a messy oak dining table, sliding 
glass door open to a balcony and a zany cast of co-conspirators coming and 
going. Eric the Dorkmeister. Brian the Weenie. Tabloid Bob. And Drury. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks single mother with no radio background, Drury auditioned for 
the job last July, beating 10 hopefuls. During the show, she sits across the 
table from Whittington, reading news cribbed from local papers, playing 
straight woman and providing the laugh track for his jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We float around (from topic to topic)," she says. "Then calls come in and 
change everything. You've got to be able to think on your feet." 
</P>
<P>
 In his spare time, Whittington, a bachelor, works on a novel at his Wood Ranch 
condo. There, he prepares for his show by watching TV news and writing comic 
bits on yellow legal pads. Angel has given him a creative free rein, and 
Whittington promises not to cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what I'm doing," he says. "You've got to trust me. I'm not going to 
hurt you." JEFF MEYERS

OXNARD STATION PUTS CHRISTIANITY ON THE AIR

<TEXT>
<P>
 KDAR has been broadcasting "the truth of the Bible" for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The small 24-hour Christian station in Oxnard(98.3 FM) has decreased its music 
programming to about an hour a day and features mostly information and talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, all its programs are either syndicated or taped, including 
"Bible Answer Man," "Focus on the Family" and "Insight on Living." 
</P>
<P>
 KDAR broadcasts its only live show on Saturdays from 9 to 10 a.m. "Hot Topics" 
is produced and hosted by Chris Maguire and Al Pacheco of Ventura. They buy the 
air time and sell advertising themselves, although they often wind up losing 
money, Maguire says. JEFF MEYERS

TACKLING THE LOCAL ISSUES

<P>
 Unlike his happy-go-lucky colleagues on "The Dave & Bob Show," Carl Haeberle 
deals with weighty local issues: the electric company's rate increase, the city 
of Ventura's housing allotments, the county's traffic mitigation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-working Haeberle does his best to keep the conversations lively and 
balanced."If it gets boring, I shut it down," says Haeberle, whose smooth, 
stentorian voice rules the mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing such a local institution as the late Frank Haines isn't easy, and 
Haeberle admits "it was scary" when he went on the air last November, a month 
after Haines died. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio veteran, spending the last five years at KGO in San Francisco, 
Haeberle gave himself a crash course in local history and culture and now 
handles hometown issues like a native. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl has done a sensational job," says KVEN president and general manager 
David Loe. "Frank was a tough act to follow, but Carl's building a bigger and 
bigger audience every day." JEFF MEYERS

HOSTS REACH OUT TO LOYAL LISTENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave and Bob are not just disembodied voices to their fans. Like the revealed 
Wizard of Oz, they occasionally leave their hermetically sealed broadcast 
studio and take dozens of listeners on weeklong cruises to such exotic lands as 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our 11th cruise coming up," Dave Ciniero says. "Our last one, 244 
people came along." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiring their listening army with such lunacy as getting Dan Quayle to 
autograph a potato, Dave and Bob are popular for their on-air antics, but also 
because of their community involvement: Their annual talent show for the 
Special Olympics fills Ventura High's auditorium and Oxnard Civic Auditorium on 
successive nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're not (behind the mike), they call to see if anything's wrong," 
Ciniero says. "There's more of a loyalty between talk-radio listeners and 
stations than any other format." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dave & Bob Show" attracts an average of 4,800 listeners during its four 
hours, impressive numbers for a county as small as Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had good luck as an advertising agency with talk radio," says Teri 
Raley, co-owner of Ventura-based Creative Images. "It has a very defined 
audience. In this market, the response (from an advertiser's commercial) is 
predictably solid. . . . 'The Dave & Bob Show' is imperative for a balanced 
media buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Adams, who got his start in radio as a disc jockey in Fresno, was a news 
broadcaster at KVEN when Ciniero was hired to do sports 10 years ago. A station 
consultant noticed their on-air chemistry and they were teamed up for the 
morning show. But that meant a lifestyle adjustment: They wake up before most 
insomniacs go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You suck coffee beans during commercials," says Ciniero, who gets up at 1 
a.m. "But it gets pretty automatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Their cramped studio at KVEN looks like the cockpit of a 747. Visitors notice 
a sign that says "Danger -- Radioactivity." The bearded Adams, 56, sits 
opposite Ciniero, 46, who wears glasses, baseball cap, Lakers T-shirt and 
shorts. Like veteran basketball players, they know each other's moves. Their 
patter is seamless even though they seldom make eye contact during the show: 
Adams peruses his next newscast while Ciniero deftly transfers tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave and Bob's aim is no loftier than to tickle the funny bones of people 
getting ready for work. "Everything's got to be short and light and up," 
Ciniero says. 
</P>
<P>
 Raunch is not part of the act. "We have an over-35 audience," Adams says. "It 
would be ridiculous to try to be risque." JEFF MEYERS

CITIES PROMPTED TO LOOK AT ADULT ENTERTAINMENT LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent federal appeals court ruling on a law regulating adult businesses in 
Los Angeles has sent cities in the Southeast area back to the drawing board to 
review their own laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in March, 1993, upheld a preliminary 
injunction barring Los Angeles officials from forcing adult businesses to 
relocate in special zones.Among the new locations listed for adult businesses 
were Los Angeles International Airport, the port, the harbor and oil 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said Los Angeles was relegating the adult entertainment to sites 
that would probably "never become available" or were not readily accessible to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also frowned on other restrictions in the Los Angeles law, including 
a 500-foot buffer zone between adult businesses and homes, and a 1,000-foot 
buffer between adult businesses themselves. The court said the buffers also 
eliminated potential sites for the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The law presented "complex constitutional problems," Circuit Judge Dorothy W. 
Nelson wrote. ". . . The record indicates that the city may not have provided 
the adult businesses with reasonable alternative avenues of expression." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case in May. 
</P>
<P>
 One federal judge, citing the Los Angeles case, has already said Long Beach's 
adult-entertainment ordinance has similar flaws. Long Beach currently lists its 
airport, port and oil fields as relocation sites for adult businesses. DUKE

TOPICS / HISTORY; WHEN TERMINAL ISLAND WAS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced to evacuate his childhood home near San Pedro Bay during World War II, 
Kenji Yamamoto packed the only valuable possessions he had: his clothing, shoes 
and a portable radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a .22-caliber rifle and took it to the Japanese community hall," where 
it was confiscated by American soldiers, Yamamoto said. "They said they would 
give it back, but I never saw that (again)." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto, 76, now lives in Boyle Heights. He was among the last to see 
Terminal Island as a thriving, 3,000-member Japanese community of fishermen, 
fish-cannery workers and grocery store merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rumors that the village on Fish Harbor was a spy colony, American 
soldiers evicted all people of Japanese descent at gunpoint on Feb. 25, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 In 48 hours, the community was destroyed. Terminal Island was later turned 
into a military base, and Japanese-owned stores, fishing boats and other 
property were razed or taken over by outsiders or industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the island now stands as a slab of landfill in Los Angeles Harbor, 
Little Tokyo's Japanese American National Museum for the first time is 
revisiting the lost community through an exhibit of historical photographs and 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Island in Time: The Terminal Island Story" will run through Nov. 13.  
</P>
<P>
 The close-knit group of Terminal Islanders, who still hold annual reunions 
around Los Angeles County, formed a campaign committee earlier this year and 
raised more than $200,000 for the exhibit -- twice its $100,000 target, 
Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money has gone to pay for labor and equipment costs for the 
exhibit, which features 70 photographs and 40 artifacts, including a 
scaled-down model of a Japanese fishing boat, a handmade box containing fishing 
hooks and bait, newspapers of that period and report cards. Most of the items 
were loaned by former Terminal Islanders, said Chris Komai, a museum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Money left over will help establish a permanent Terminal Island collection and 
possibly allow for a traveling show, Komai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first (exhibit) inside the museum to be financed by a private 
group," he said. "We're interested in having them tell their own story." 
</P>
<P>
 The Terminal Islanders hope mementos from the past will raise public awareness 
of their former community and their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, even the people from Japan, don't know about Terminal 
Island," said Yamamoto, whose family moved there from Long Beach when he was a 
year old. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important for younger Japanese Americans to understand what their 
first-generation relatives -- the Issei -- had to endure during World War II, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit could encourage them "to carry on and appreciate what the previous 
generation did for them," Yamamoto said.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; VIBRANT STREET A COMFORT TO NEWCOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sam Joma, who owns a new electronic appliance shop on Pacific Boulevard, 
beamed as potential customers made their way along the crowded Huntington Park 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the way, an unlicensed street vendor nervously kicked her wooden crate 
filled with small fruit baskets out of sight until a police cruiser passed. A 
moment later she quickly sold two orders of watermelon and pineapple chunks for 
$1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 And a block or so down the boulevard, a teen-age boy hustled back and forth 
trying to peddle fake identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of what is accepted, or at least expected, by the thousands of 
shoppers, merchants, retirees, teen-agers, criminals, panhandlers and others 
who spend time each day on thriving Pacific Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, Pacific Boulevard may be most familiar as the place that became 
unruly after thousands jammed the strip in June to celebrate Mexico's 
advancement in the World Cup. But to local residents, the boulevard is a vital 
commercial district with about 400 businesses that account for at least 
one-third of the annual $3 million in sales tax revenue. It has emerged in 
recent years as a place that Latino newcomers throughout the region find both 
lively and comforting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That boulevard keeps this city alive," said Mayor Richard V. Loya. "It really 
does bring in a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is a strip still in transition from the largely white, blue-collar area 
it had been for so many years after Huntington Park was incorporated in the 
early 1900s. As Latinos poured into the area in recent years looking for better 
lives, businesses began to tailor themselves to the new clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's population is easily 95% Latino, officials say. The 1990 U.S. 
Census counted more than 56,000 residents in Huntington Park, but local 
officials say that factoring in recent arrivals, illegal residents and others 
missed by the count raises the total estimated population to 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the success of Pacific Boulevard registers in cash what many other 
largely Latino communities nationwide can calculate only as potential buying 
power. The boulevard is vibrant even as the community struggles with common 
urban ills such as low income and education levels and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So, those along the boulevard say, the widespread attention generated when the 
World Cup soccer celebration became too rowdy and led to the temporary closing 
of the strip by city officials was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Jeffers, the city's chief administrative officer, said the most 
recent quarterly figures available showed that retail sales on the strip 
increased about 7% or 8% early this year compared to the same period in 1993.

TOPICS / LAW; HARBOR TO HELP L.A., LONG BEACH FIGHT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles find themselves in the awkward 
position of fighting a suit that would enrich them by millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Long Beach and Los Angeles face a lawsuit that could make them 
return $90 millon to the ports. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, Long Beach and Los Angeles harbor commissioners have agreed 
to help pay legal fees to fight the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Veltman, a retired trucking company owner from West Los Angeles, is 
suing port cities throughout California for the money the cities took from 
their respective ports under state law during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A special bill passed by the State Legislature during the 1992-93 budget 
crisis permitted cities to take excess funds from their ports. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman argues that the law is unconstitutional and hopes to force the cities 
to repay the $140 million diverted to the cities' general funds between 1992 
and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The class-action suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names the State Lands Commission, the Department of Finance, Lt. 
Gov. Leo McCarthy, State Controller Gray Davis, the cities of Oakland, San 
Diego, San Francisco and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman's attorney, Richard I. Fine, said transfer of the money violates the 
California Tidelands Trust. "You can't give the money as an outright gift," 
Fine said. "It's against the California Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that port authority trust funds were established specifically for 
navigation, commerce, fisheries and other harbor uses. The funds, contributed 
by taxpayers, cannot be used to balance city budgets, he said. The $69 million 
the Port of Los Angeles transferred to city coffers is the most money paid out 
under the state law. Long Beach diverted $21 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stories in the garden, hot jazz in the streets and children covered in paint 
marked the start last weekend of Long Beach's annual celebration of arts and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of "October is Arts Month" got a jump-start on their eighth annual 
festival this year with two daylong events.On Saturday, eight downtown 
businesses hosted a kind of music walkabout featuring rock, blues, jazz and 
Latin-beat sounds. Sunday's event at the Rancho Los Alamitos Historic Ranch and 
Gardens featured stories in the Secret Garden, music and dancing from various 
cultures and painting and crafts for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Corporation for the Arts promises four more weeks of events, from 
free street festivals to a black-tie evening with legendary musician Ray 
Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Among this weekend's events will be the Anaheim Street International Festival, 
which begins Saturday with a half-mile unity walk at 10 a.m. The Anaheim Street 
walk, which is to bring together Latinos, Cambodians and other residents of the 
area, will be followed by a music and dance festival at MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the Sunday in East Village street fair will feature arts, crafts 
and food. The event on 1st Street, between Elm and Linden avenues, begins at 11 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The visual and performing arts will also be celebrated around town, with 
gallery and museum shows, architectural walking tours, plays and concerts. 
</P>
<P>

ON THE ROAD: RECOVERING THE KEYS TO HER MUSICAL PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is 9:30 a.m. at Maywood Acres Healthcare Center, a one-story building 
across from Mervyn's and next to a Catholic church, doctors' offices and a 
mortuary. In the Maywood's north dining room, 24 clients in wheelchairs are 
parked for what should be described as morning coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martha Van Zandt, 83, has changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Zandt is a native South Dakotan who has lived at Maywood for two years. 
She moved to Los Angeles 49 years ago "to get out of a mad love affair" in 
Minneapolis, where she was living at the time. South Dakota is pertinent, 
though, because people at the Maywood heard about Van Zandt's far-flung 
activities in high school in Harrold, S.D., in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Zandt was a working pianist in and about Harrold. She was paid $1 to play 
live accompaniment to the silent movie. Sometimes she did back-to-back shows, 
playing for hours. That was arduous work, as movie music has never had many 
breaks in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Zandt preferred regular dramas or even love stories. She was able to watch 
the screen and meld a sonic "mood" to what she saw. The worst, sadly, were the 
most common: Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those cowboys chasing Indians," she says, "meant fast, repetitive 
playing, and that would just wear me out." 
</P>
<P>
 She is, of course, speaking of a time in her life that was more than 65 years 
ago. Today there are no signs of her musical exhaustion as she entrances her 
Maywood mates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular morning -- she does this every day from 9:30 to 10 -- she 
plays rock-steady renditions of "When the Saints Go Marching In," "Jesus Loves 
Me! This I Know," and, among others, "Softly and Tenderly." 
</P>
<P>
 She takes no breaks. The songs segue seamlessly. The piano looks beat but 
works fine and is reasonably in tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Zandt, showing the influences of her silent movie era, pumps extra sound 
from the thing by heavy use of the sustain pedal -- resulting in fluid chords 
that fill every nook and cranny of the room. Her left hand jumps back and forth 
in flawless cadence; her right winds up and down the keyboard, mostly to find 
chord variations. Within the span of one tune, she may change key three times. 
</P>
<P>
 As Van Zandt plays, many of her mates sing along. Some clap in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor Bertram Godfrey wheels about the room passing out napkins in 
preparation for the postponed coffee serving. Even Godfrey, in transit and 
given to talking sports, apes a lyric or two. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the show, Van Zandt confesses that the piano has played many 
roles in her life. In her youth in South Dakota, it not only "paid for clothing 
in high school" but symbolized a special resourcefulness: She'd taught herself 
to play "since there was no one around in my town who could." 
</P>
<P>
 In her Minneapolis life, it was her ticket to work in nightclubs and won her 
regular solo performance time on local radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, the piano and its commercial possibilities left her. 
She lived in Los Angeles and then Camarillo and "gave the thing up" for more 
than 20 years. She worked as a secretary, got on with a life that, she notes 
with a laugh, "had two marriages and two divorces." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Martha Van Zandt, dressed in a green cable knit sweater and blue floral 
pants and slippers, is again playing piano -- in Oxnard in a fluorescent-lit, 
vinyl-tiled room to an audience that likes hymns more than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK by her. The Maywood's clients helped Van Zandt find her musical way 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have great support for my playing here," she says, smiling. "And while it 
can be quite tiring, I get satisfaction because it makes these people awful 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she is assisted in standing up from the piano bench. She shakes a 
bit. Slowly, she regains equilibrium, throwing a radiant smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the faltering you don't see when she's at the keyboard, performing with 
impeccable precision. Martha Van Zandt, itinerant and expansive spirit that she 
is, has Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily for her, and even more so for those who once wheeled in for a plain 
old coffee break, it just doesn't get in the way.

EARTHWATCH: HOW TO SAVE RESOURCES WITH WASTE WATER; REUSING IT FOR AGRIBUSINESS 
AND LANDSCAPING ( NOT FOR DRINKING) IS IN THE WORKS IN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you read the news that water supplies for Los Angeles may become scarce 
andcostly because the flow from Mono Lake -- almost 20% of the city's supply -- 
has to be cut back to preserve that body of water? Is something like this going 
to happen to Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
 Earthwatch went right to the source of water for 75% of the county's 
population. It's not a lake but an organization, the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, which purchases and pipes in water from many sources. Evidently, lots 
of people are asking General Manager Donald R. Kendall if their water bills 
will skyrocket. These days his answer is a firm "no." 
</P>
<P>
 His explanation, however, is not what you'd expect. Calleguas is going to 
reuse water. Reuse? Yes. The source of the water will be the city of Thousand 
Oaks' Hill Canyon Wastewater Treatment plant. Other deals are in the works to 
hook up to water treatment plants in Simi Valley and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't water for drinking, mind you. It's waste water, which is treated to 
meet high environmental standards before it is released into local creeks that 
flow to the ocean. Kendall notes that there are other uses for water in 
addition to drinking, including agriculture and landscaping; water also is 
pumped into our underground aquifers to push back the salt water that's seeping 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Many California communities are beginning to reuse water from their local 
treatment plants: Orange County cities have a long record of such use. In 
anticipation of problems with sources like Mono Lake, Los Angeles County cities 
have begun recycling water. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in drought conditions or times of price fluctuations, the flow from our 
homes into our waste-water facilities remains pretty constant. Yes, we practice 
conservation, sometimes lowering our per-household consumption by 25%, but the 
number of households grows and grows. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth issue makes for some urgency in the matter of water conservation. 
Calleguas needs to increase the amount of water it provides by 50% in the 
coming decades. Within six years, Kendall hopes to increase reclaimed water 
from 1% of sales to 20%. "We're doing studies to reclaim 50,000-acre feet," he 
said. That could mean capturing about 150 million gallons of water inside our 
county rather than depending on sources like Mono Lake and the Colorado River. 
That would take care of the 50% increase needed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall called this "drought-proofing the county" and explained the liquid 
economics: "We pay a dear price to get it here -- and then (after residents use 
it only once) it's discharged into the creek bed. I can capture it for 
one-fourth of what I pay" out-of-county water sources. He can also afford to 
build a separate system of pipes to deliver reusable water to agribusiness, 
golf courses and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Our local connection with L.A.'s Mono Lake problem was spelled out explicitly 
by Don Nelson, a Thousand Oaks water official: "Los Angeles will draw on other 
sources, making outside supplies to us even more limited. We have a resource 
that can be (reused) instead of being lost." He has plans to reuse 100% of the 
water that comes out his city's waste-water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out, however, that this doesn't mean that all the water coming into 
the city gets captured for potential recycling. Only about a third does. Most 
of the fresh water brought into the county is used outdoors and can't be 
recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 To truly drought-proof our county, we should change our outdoor watering 
habits and start using more of the reclaimed stuff. Earthwatch isn't advocating 
that readers siphon their wash water directly out to the rosebushes. That, as a 
matter of fact, is illegal in Ventura County. But local agribusiness is already 
beginning to buy safety-treated waste water now being provided by the utilities 
in their areas, as are some local golf courses, schools, apartment and 
condominium owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Mono Lake might be going dry, but Ventura County isn't. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information about reclaimed water, contact the county of Ventura's 
Resource Management Agency at 654-2494 or Water Conservation Program at 
654-2440. Information is also available from local waste-water treatment plants 
in Camarillo, Oxnard, Santa Paula, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Ventura or 
the Calleguas Municipal Water District (526-9323).

 SINK OR SWIM 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Silva missed classes at Long Beach City College Monday, but who could 
blame her? 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that morning, the 17-year-old freshman from Millikan High completed a 
21-mile swim from Catalina Island to Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro, a journey 
which required 13 hours, 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first day I missed and I felt really bad, but I was very tired." 
Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also suffering from a sore left arm and back, and recovering from 
three jellyfish bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, the 25th woman to complete the swim, left Catalina Island about 11 p.m. 
Saturday night to take advantage of calmer waters and light boat traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 She was followed by her coach Kalani Caldwell, who swam the channel in 1980, 
and Long Beach lifeguards Rick Miller, Matt Grunissen and Wayne Rahe, in kayaks 
during the journey. In addition to moral support, the support crew provided 
food -- Pop Tarts -- and liquids every half hour to prevent hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have done it without my paddlers," Silva said. "I owe so much to 
them. At times, I felt so awful and cold, all I wanted was my mommy and my 
blanket. They made a boring and grueling swim seem like so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said she was frightened by the darkness at the beginning of the swim but 
the most difficult part of the ordeal was spotting land about five hours into 
the swim and thinking she was almost done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I spotted land I was only halfway done, but it seemed like the 
beach was around the corner," Silva said. "I felt strong and it made me go 
harder. It seemed like an eternity until I reached the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 She was not done yet. Under Catalina Channel Swimming Federation rules, Silva 
was required to walk out of the water and take three steps onto the beach.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; ART HOUSE TITLES HIT MARQUEE AT VENTURA THEATER; 
THE MANN BUENAVENTURA HAS STARTED SHOWING SPECIALTY MOVIES, AND ALTHOUGH THE 
AUDIENCES AREN'T LARGE, SO FAR RESPONSE HAS BEEN GOOD.

<P>
 It used to be hard to find movies with Australian drag queens or Chinese 
subtitles in Ventura County theaters. But for the past several months, the Mann 
Buenaventura has been experimenting with specialty films, commonly called "art 
house pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes "The Adventures of Priscilla," a film about female 
impersonators in the Aussie outback; "Eat Drink Man Woman," a Taiwanese picture 
about a master chef and his three daughters, as well as "Barcelona" and "Mi 
Vida Loca." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann film buyer Denise Gurin said Ventura doesn't attract an art house crowd 
the way Pasadena or Santa Barbara does. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurin says she has "taken some criticism" from her bosses for booking the 
non-commercial films but she gets "revenge when the film does some business." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, an art film will become a commercial success, such as "The 
Crying Game" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, however, the small films don't pull in large audiences, but that's 
not too important to Gurin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not making any money off of them," she said, "but it affords lots of 
people a chance to watch films they otherwise don't see. I keep hearing from 
the manager that people are pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Gurin said that smaller films like "Eat Drink" and "Priscilla" appeal to her 
so she tends to buy them for Mann theaters. She said she usually buys any 
pictures distributed by Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurin said she is limited in the number of specialty films she can book 
because the number of prints is often low, or because her obligation to show 
commercial films means she might not generally have enough screens at a given 
time.

 Screenwriter Katherine Ann Jones will answer questions at a picnic dinner 
following the presentation of her 1988 film "The Christmas Wife" this Sunday at 
the Ojai Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The film stars Jason Robards as Tanner, a lonely widower who goes to an agency 
to hire a woman to be his Christmas companion. After an off-putting visit to 
the tacky agency and its smarmy owner (Don Francks), Tanner is paired up with 
Iris (Julie Harris), a self-effacing, sad woman who makes a mystery of her 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was nominated for best picture and screenplay by Cable's Ace Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jones, an Ojai resident who is on the faculty of the USC Cinema and 
Television School, the Q&A will be a warm-up for a two-day seminar, Oct. 8 and 
9, on television and screen writing. The intensive workshop is from 9 a.m. to 
4:15 p.m. Saturday and Sunday in the Ojai Art Center, 113 S. Montgomery St. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $150 fee, participants will get advice on how to choose a good story 
for a film or TV show, screenplay structure, plot and character development, 
constructing good dialogue and how to sell a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday's picnic dinner will be held at Boccali's restaurant, 3277 Santa 
Paula-Ojai Road. Dinner is $14. The film screens at 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai 
Playhouse. For more information call 646-8946.

CRIME: PRISON PROPOSAL, ECONOMICS AND THE IMAGE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While opponents of the proposal to build a prison in Compton cry foul -- that 
a prison will give Compton a bad image -- a 1993 report produced by the city 
indicates that Compton already has "a bad image." The report reveals an 
increasingly high crime rate in the city. According to the report, titled "The 
City of Compton, A California Community at Risk," there were 59 homicides, 85 
rapes, 1,135 robberies, 1,115 aggravated assaults, 1,750 burglaries and 1,486 
auto thefts in Compton in 1993 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A special report to Sen. Robert Presley, chairman, Joint Committee on Prison 
Construction and Operations in 1985, reveals that in cities where prisons have 
been built, crime was reduced significantly. It is believed that the reduction 
in crime can be attributed to the large number of uniformed peace officers 
visible in the community. In the city of Lancaster, some citizens say they even 
feel safer knowing the prison is nearby. "After all," they say, "it is not the 
criminals who are locked away that frighten us. It is those that are still at 
large." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate study also showed a significant increase in property values. It is 
believed that this increase can be directly attributed to the existence of a 
prison in the community. As crime decreases as a result of the presence of an 
increased number of uniformed peace officers, the interest in purchasing 
property increases. People believe the community is then safer to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's image is also that of producing gangs, drug dealers and notorious 
rap groups whose music promotes violence. The California Department of 
Corrections would work with Compton College in training corrections officers 
who live in Compton, and who would be positive role models for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton also has many alleys filled with debris, vacant lots overgrown with 
weeds and graffiti. In cities where there are prisons, the corrections 
department has an excellent public service program. The city's community 
beautification program is enhanced tremendously, and its costs for maintenance 
are cut significantly through the maintenance services performed by 
low-security inmate crews. The Monterey Bay coastline, for example, is kept 
clean and well-tended by an inmate crew from Soledad Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, prisons make good neighbors. They provide a strong economic base, 
create hundreds of jobs and supply and supervise inmate workers for vital 
community service projects. Corrections staff enrich community life. Many 
actively participate in local organizations and issues. 
</P>
<P>
 A prison is a clean, stable, recession-proof industry. It provides permanent 
employment to 600 to 1,600 people. This translates to an annual payroll of $20 
million to $52 million -- money that helps fuel the local economy. Every year, 
a prison also buys $1 million to $4 million in goods and services from the 
surrounding area. As local businesses prosper, more job opportunities develop. 
In fact, it's estimated that one new job in the community is created for every 
two prison jobs.

WHITTIER: APPEAL, PROMISE OF A COLLEGE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes when I walk through uptown Whittier, I get the feeling I'm walking 
through a college town. Drama and music at the performing arts center and civic 
auditorium, a fully restored cinema house, coffeehouses with poetry readings, 
bookstores, antique stores, fitness centers and dance studios. 
</P>
<P>
 And people everywhere. People sitting in outdoor cafes, walking, talking, 
window-shopping. Professionals in business suits out to lunch, bankers in town 
cars looking for parking places, students on their way to work or the movies, 
or older couples strolling along holding hands. Most people enjoy the walk. 
They just park their cars and walk. 
</P>
<P>
 People come here to enjoy the variety of arts, enjoy the shops and 
restaurants, enjoy an evening in the central city. It has much to offer daytime 
or evening. It's old, but it's filled with the wisdom of age. And it's new, 
with a youthful appeal and promise. It is, after all, a college town.

VIDEO REWIND

<TEXT>
<P>
 When we first meet Oscar Romero in the fact-based 1989 film "Romero," he is a 
bookish, timid priest seemingly unconcerned with the growing sociopolitical 
troubles gripping his country of El Salvador. Indeed, Romero is appointed 
archbishop largely because he is a passive figure unlikely to make political 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the film (which takes place in the late '70s and early '80s) 
progresses, the once unassertive monsignor becomes an increasingly outspoken 
critic of the violence and government oppression plaguing the small Central 
American country. Thanks to actor Raul Julia, the awakening of Romero's social 
conscience is both realistically subtle and deeply moving. Julia deftly conveys 
the internal and external emotions of a holy man desperately trying to make 
sense of the madness around him. 
</P>
<P>
 At times the actor reacts to the injustices around him with impassioned anger. 
But mostly he conveys a spirit of thoughtful though intense introspection as 
his idealistic character begins the difficult process of reshaping his role as 
a spiritual and moral leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's lofty goal is to help achieve social justice without violent 
confrontation. He feels great sympathy for the poor who live in squalid 
conditions under the dictatorial and sometimes brutish military regime. Yet he 
cannot reconcile the armed rebellion by leftist guerrillas with his own 
pacifist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero refuses to view himself as a political activist. He tries vainly to 
serve as a mediator between the guerrillas and the government. Still, the 
gentle archbishop is labeled a communist sympathizer by authorities when he 
decries the extrajudicial killings of priests and peasants who favor political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the film's most inspiring sequences, Romero attempts to reclaim a 
church that has been commandeered by the national guard. Initially, the 
courageous archbishop is threatened by gunfire and ejected from the premises by 
a surly American soldier. But soon after, Romero returns with a mass of 
believers in tow. It's a spine-tingling moment when the throng of worshipers 
marches peacefully past a group of helpless soldiers and into the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romero" also succeeds in bringing a human face to a combustive political 
situation that for years made worldwide headlines. The film presents both the 
grinding poverty of the masses and the privileged lives of the elite. While 
viewing this film it's not hard to understand why the common people want 
political and social change and why the ruling class is so insistent on 
retaining its monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romero" (1989), directed by John Duigan. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13. JON

FOR THE KIDS; PRESTO! IT'S A SNAP TO MASTER TRICKS OF TRADE; CLUBS, SHOPS AND

 Shawn McMaster told the seven boys in his magic class: "I'm going to make a 
prediction. I'm going to guess which card you'll pick." Then he wrote down the 
card and folded the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 After he made a few quick moves with a deck of cards, the boys unfolded the 
paper to find written down -- the three of diamonds -- the very one they 
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "How'd ya do that?" one kid marveled. You tell me, countered McMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasers, one kid offered. Nope. A special machine hidden in the chair, another 
theorized. Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
 They found out it involved more math than magic. But one of the things the 
boys in McMaster's magic class also learned was that you never reveal to your 
audience how a trick is done. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, ages 7 to 14, were in a beginning magic class offered through the 
Conejo Recreation and Park District. The four-week hourlong class will be 
offered again beginning Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is on an upswing," said McMaster, a professional magician who also 
teaches in several locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why mega-magician David Copperfield's two shows in December at 
the new Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks sold out the first week that tickets 
went on sale in July. 
</P>
<P>
 For kids intrigued with magic, a class is one way to learn some basics. In 
McMaster's beginner class, he teaches tricks with cards, coins, balls and 
ordinary household objects -- such as forks and spoons, string and cups. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first class of the ongoing series, the children learned three card 
tricks, including one in which the magician appears to detect a chosen card by 
the way it feels. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the boys in the class, 14-year-old Casey Patterson, already had a small 
repertoire of about seven card and coin tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends and I are really into it," said Casey, who does tricks when he 
gets together with friends or goes to Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster, 31, got into magic at the age of 6 when someone gave him a magic 
kit. As he got older, he performed tricks for his parents, friends and at 
parties. Now, in addition to teaching, he performs at restaurants and comedy 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from classes, there are other ways for kids to learn magic. McMaster 
said that as a kid, he went through "an entire shelf" of books on magic at the 
library. One he and other magicians recommend is "Mark Wilson's Complete Course 
in Magic." Henry Hay's "Learn Magic" is another. Bill Severn also has written 
several magic books appropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 For books and magic supplies, kids can go to Merlin's Mystical Emporium in 
Ventura and Camarillo. For several dollars, they can buy simple tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source is the Society of American Magicians, the oldest magic group in 
the country. SAM's local chapter meets monthly in Oxnard and welcomes older 
kids who want to sharpen their skills and knowledge. They can sign on with 
SAM's Society of Young Magicians and receive a monthly newsletter that gears 
magic to a younger level. 
</P>
<P>
 For the kids who become skilled at magic, performing at the venerable Magic 
Castle in Los Angeles is not an impossible dream. The private club sponsors a 
junior group of magicians, ages 13 to 20. The group meets monthly, usually at 
the club, where the young magicians learn performance skills in a workshop 
setting and can browse through the extensive library. However, admission to the 
group is by auditions, which are held only twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Magician Paul Dwork, owner of Merlin's Mystical Emporium, has some advice for 
would-be magicians: "Start slow. You don't have to spend a lot of money. Most 
magic has been around since the beginning of time." For kids, he said, magic is 
a good way to boost self-confidence, self-esteem and communication skills.

<P>
 When San Francisco's Overland Dance Company performs "The Velveteen Rabbit" in 
Oxnard in November, there will be some young local aspiring dancers on the 
stage as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls between 7 and 12 years of age can audition for the roles in the 
production at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at The Performance Studio, 34 N. Palm St., 
Ventura. Children selected will participate in about 10 rehearsals before the 
Nov. 17 and 19 performances. For information, call 643-5701 or 648-4767.

 Kids entertainers Lori Richards and the Happy Crowd are performing Sunday to 
raise funds for the community mega-playground planned in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is at 4 p.m. at the Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St. Tickets are 
$7 for adults and kids; children under 2 are free. Tickets are available at 
various locations around Ventura including the YMCA, Adventures for Kids, Heck 
Music Center and Lucy in the Sky. For information, call 641-5409. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground is a grass-roots community-based project, similar to one in 
Santa Barbara. As in Santa Barbara, the residents here are not only raising the 
money for the playground but they also will build it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, $20,000 has been raised. A total of $100,000 is needed before the 
playground will be constructed this spring at Blanche Reynolds School in 
Ventura. Details

FASHION; SHOWY SUNFLOWER CASHES IN ON ITS WHOLESOME IMAGE; THE BRIGHT YELLOW 
BLOSSOM SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE -- HATS, SHOES, SHIRTS, TOTE BAGS -- AND SHOWS 
NO SIGNS OF WILTING.

 If daisies defined the '60s, what floral symbol would work for the '90s? Let's 
see -- a passionflower's too effusive; a pansy's too effete. . . . Something 
that says back to basics, wholesome outlook, virtue, even. A family-values sort 
of flower. How about . . . a sunflower? Would they go for that? 
</P>
<P>
 They went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 At this writing, you can barely cross the street without confronting a 
sunflower on someone's hair band, tote bag or shoes (the Bayshore Sunflower by 
Keds $26). 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't noticed this, you don't shop and you work in a shielded 
environment, like mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Manhattan has planted sunflowers on its downtown traffic islands. 
They are on half of the straw hats at any patio party you may attend. 
</P>
<P>
 They show up in living rooms, in effigy and in life. At Pyramid Flowers in 
Oxnard, owner Fred Van Wingerden said his company is heavy into its second 
season of producing the crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's me and about 1,000 other (growers)," he said, "There was this demand 
from our wholesalers. They always asked us, 'Have you got any sunflowers?' so 
eventually you begin to say, "Well, maybe I should grow sunflowers.' It's just 
really caught on." 
</P>
<P>
 As a blase observer, you may be thinking: So, for awhile it was whales; now 
it's sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not that simple. Think about it. Did you see any whale shoes? Whale 
place mats? Whale cologne? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Women never longed for a redolence of whales. But many do long to smell 
like sunflowers, it seems. A fragrance by Elizabeth Arden called -- what else? 
-- is, according to the company's spokeswoman, "an absolute home-run hit," a 
phrase you will recall from a pre-1994 season. The fragrance sold so well, so 
fast, that the manufacturer has added sunflower soap and seven other products 
to its Sunflowers line. 
</P>
<P>
 All this in spite of the fact that sunflowers have no smell. The products 
contain sunflower oil for authenticity, but "sunflowers themselves don't really 
enhance the fragrance," we learned. It's the mood they invoke that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 That mood is "cheerful . . . it's upbeat, it's fun, it's loving," offered the 
company representative, excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 As further evidence, at Wet Seal -- a mod young women's store in Oxnard that 
is part of a chain -- where we would have expected slinky silhouettes and the 
new dark fall colors, we noticed a plethora of yellow flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are embroidered on various garments, splashed across journals, used on 
yellow-petaled picture frames and, for good measure, their seed is offered for 
sowing in colorful boxes along the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are men immune to the upbeat flower. At Rains, Ojai, manager Eric Zacher 
took a small risk ordering a shipment of men's sunflower print shirts, but it 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went fast; we're down to the last one -- I'm reordering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're seeing here is icon history in the making. The sunflower is gaining 
in the emblem polls and may become one of the all-time major league (oops) 
symbols, like the happy face. 
</P>
<P>
 Already it's passed the Holstein and the frog and, from our reckoning, appears 
to be closing in on that past favorite, the dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
 What is crucial now is that the emblem not be trivialized by some trite phrase 
or association that will bring it to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 This, you will recall, is what happened to the endearing happy face. In the 
prime of its glory, it became linked with that infernal cliche, "HAVE A NICE 
DAY!" and quickly dropped off the charts, never to regain its position. 
</P>
<P>
 The same fate befell the pyramid, a '70s symbol of vigor and renewal. The 
dreaded slogan, "Pyramid power!" linked it with fuzzy New Age energy, and 
thereby sealed its doom. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a constant hazard with icons and must be guarded against, particularly 
if the icon is a U. S. President, prone to inflict trivial phrases on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we must be on our guard. It's important that the sunflower not be 
subjected to this sort of cheap sentiment. Imagine if someone, trading on the 
link of Kansas as the Sunflower State, should team the flower with Judy 
Garland's famous line, "There's no place like home." 
</P>
<P>
 Cashiers wearing smiles and sunflower pins might inflict the motto on 
departing customers. Office workers holding sunflower mugs would pass each 
other in corridors intoning the now hollow "There's no place like home!" 
</P>
<P>
 That's all it takes. In no time, tainted by triviality, sales of the perky 
flower would wilt. Industries would have to retool to a new image, perhaps the 
armadillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another ironic motto might emerge for that mascot, such as "Be all you 
can be," a phrase that almost single-handedly brought down the U. S. Army. The 
inevitable cycle would repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 So, our counsel is: Let's hang onto the sunflower while we're ahead. It may be 
gaudy and tend to clash with skin tones -- but it beats an armadillo, hands 
down.

THEATER REVIEW; 'HELLO, DOLLY' STRIKES A FALSE NOTE; AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE 
HEROINE'S LARGER-THAN-LIFE CHARISMA IS MISSING FROM THE SANTA BARBARA 
PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I've always been a woman who arranges things -- like furniture and daffodils 
and lives," offers matchmaker Dolly Levi in "Hello, Dolly." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a woman who's withdrawn from life since the death of her husband, 
living vicariously through her intervention in the romances of others. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Hello, Dolly" first premiered 30 years ago, this musical adaptation of 
Thornton Wilder's "The Matchmaker" was intended as a joyful celebration of 
Dolly's re-entry into direct experience when she finally sets her sights on a 
match for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a central theme harder to distinguish than it should be in the 
Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera's season-opening "Dolly" revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the company's usual formula of guest artists headlining an ensemble 
of local performers, the production stars Leslie Easterbrook (best known for 
her recurring role in the "Police Academy" movies). An agreeable comic actress, 
Easterbrook speaks convincingly of Dolly's loneliness and her hopes for 
happiness during a monologue directed heavenward to her departed husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has trouble packing that soulful longing into composer/lyricist Jerry 
Herman's classic songs, especially the pivotal "Before the Parade Passes By" in 
the first-act finale. Without its rousing carpe diem subtext, the ensemble 
number comes across like a drill-team exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook's singing voice is not an ideal match for the role's vocal range, 
frequently dropping out entirely in the lower registers. But most important, 
she doesn't project the larger-than-life charisma that makes Dolly a worthy 
center of our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on the turn-of-the-century New York scenery offers little diversion. 
As Horace Vandergelder, the wealthy shopkeeper in search of a wife who becomes 
the unknowing target of Dolly's affections, Civic Light Opera regular Fred 
Lehto sustains a single note of pompous blustering devoid of sex appeal, which 
makes it difficult to fathom Dolly's attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Anna B. Vitetta provides brief comic relief as an overbearing potential 
match for Vandergelder. The mischievous antics of his two wayward shop 
assistants are sometimes amusing as well, particularly the attempts by chief 
clerk Cornelius Hackl (Charlie Mach) to pass himself off as a member of the 
gentry. Angel Benton's androgynously impish Barnaby Tucker, however, proves a 
borderline irritant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright spot is Pamela Winslow as the widowed Mrs. Molloy, another of 
Vandergelder's potential spouses, whom Dolly steers toward Cornelius. Winslow's 
operatic precision in her two main songs sends the production aloft but 
ultimately leaves us wishing she'd been surrounded with more performers of her 
caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 31-member ensemble certainly packs the expansive Granada Theatre 
stage with bodies, Ted Sprague's choreography rarely ventures beyond the 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
 As for production values, the enormous line-art period backdrops repainted in 
black and white by scenic coordinator Jay Michael Jagim supply a classier look 
than some of the fully constructed sets, though the posh restaurant for the 
"Hello, Dolly" production number is an eye-catching feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic Director Charles Ballinger, who scored a big hit with his staging for 
last year's "Oklahoma!" proves less adept with the fluffy, effervescent comedy 
and unabashed warmth that define the breadth and scope of Jerry Herman 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Following on the heels of the Civic's razor-sharp "Evita," "Hello, Dolly" 
marks an amateurish step backward in the company's quest for more professional 
stature. Details

MUSIC; SEEKING FAME AND MAYBE A DESIGNATED DRIVER; BEAT FARMERS, APPEARING 
SUNDAY AT THE UNDERGROUND, HAS PARTIED THROUGH 12 YEARS, SIX ALBUMS. AND 
THEY'RE STILL NOT RICH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Beat Farmers, four party animals from San Diego, will belch in the face of 
the New Sobriety when they bring their raucous blend of country rock and rhythm 
and booze to the Underground in Santa Barbara on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They require more lubrication than Jiffy Lube, according to the one and only 
Country Dick Montana, who, "for legal or 'very good' reasons," will not give 
his real name. Montana is the band's Keith Moon, except he's still around to 
beat those drums and sing really weird songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no one can drink as much as we can and still be able to play. When we 
play, we get three cases of beer, two bottles of red wine and a bottle of 
tequila. That's just for starters, and it's just part of the deal. You have to 
give us that or else you don't get the Beat Farmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, Rolle Love, Jerry Raney and Joey Harris put out an annual (if you 
call five times in 12 years annual) Beat Farmers' Almanac chock-full of advice 
certain to get you arrested or divorced in less time than it takes to shout, 
"More beer!" Sample bad advice for all: "Deny everything. If that doesn't work, 
blame it on booze or amnesia. If you're still in trouble, claim that the bikers 
made you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a ton of good reviews, the band still ain't rich, and they don't blame 
the bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, that's always been a thorn in our sides, not that we're in this for 
the money," Montana said. "I mean, I watch MTV and I can't figure out what 
these guys in shorts and backwards baseball caps are doing. I know if we broke 
up, we'd get famous, but we're too old to see the errors of our ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will the band not go away, they remain the "popes of stool pigeon 
bop" and the "most durable legends of marginally popular music." Translation: 
They've been around for a dozen years, six albums and countless hangovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that can relate to us hear about us through word of mouth," said 
Montana. "We don't have any big press machine or any kind of hype going. It's 
all done voluntarily. We get a lot of drunks at our show, although they don't 
start out like that. No one is very trendy at our shows, they just become 
unfriendly later. Then they feel bad about us for awhile afterward, but that 
passes, and we come back to their town a year later." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beat Farmers just put out a new album on Sector 2 Records entitled "Viking 
Lullabys." It's their first new release in a long time. The new release 
contains some of the Farmers' greatest live showstoppers, captured on disc for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 They set new lows, notably on three of Montana's notorious drinking songs, 
which he calls his "swillogy." The Ms. Wrong song of all time has got to be 
"Baby's Liquored Up." A sample line allowable in a family newspaper: "She 
smiles like a reptile and her lips are razor thin. Her legs are made of Jello 
and her voice will rip your skin." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, a lot of people can relate to that one, either as a finger pointer or 
else they can see themselves in that one," said Montana. "I was engaged to her, 
and we lived together for awhile. Then she sobered up and I couldn't handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The band doesn't do a lot of slow ones -- most of their stuff is incendiary 
roots rock that is often crude, obnoxious and mighty funny, if you're in the 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people still think we're some sort of frat party band, and we're 
definitely not that," Montana said. "Sometimes people don't understand the 
different sides of the band. On one side, there's Jerry and Joey -- great 
songwriters -- then on the other, there's clown time -- that's where I jump 
into the ring. Some people can't see how such opposites can coexist, but life 
isn't just one way. We're flying in the face of reality, or is it we're a fly 
on the face of reality?" Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Beat Farmers, Evil Farmer, The Gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Underground, 110 State St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 9 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $8. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 965-5050.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; INCONSISTENCY IS THE RULE AT CAPISTRANO'S; IT'S BEST TO 
STICK WITH SUCH BASICS AS SALMON FILLET OR PORK MEDALLIONS AT THE MANDALAY 
BEACH RESORT DINING ROOMS. 
</P>

<P>
 The tuna steak, described on the menu as "thick-cut," was not only slim but 
purple-raw within. Deciding that it might not be of sashimi quality, I sent it 
back, asking the waiter to have the kitchen bring it up to "rosy -- or medium 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with the same dish, everything a-sizzle, repeatedly warning me not 
to touch the white-hot plate. There would be no need to. The tuna was at this 
point cooked to Starkist shoe leather. 
</P>
<P>
 Politely, I invited the waiter to consider my dilemma. I said it didn't appear 
to be a tuna night at Capistrano's. I'd be willing to pay a second entree 
charge for a properly done piece of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiantly, he whisked the tuna away and said the kitchen would try a third 
time -- starting from scratch with a new tuna steak. 
</P>
<P>
 The third tuna serving was cooked properly but carried a repellent, metallic 
first bite. Concerned, I ate perhaps only a third of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours later, my nightmare began: I fell violently ill. Eight hours later, 
bloated and dizzy and green of complexion, I was considering a ride to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the bad news. To the extent good news is possible in this scenario, 
consider that Capistrano's went and did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 I called the next day as a customer -- not a reviewer for The Times -- to 
discuss my trials and request a full refund for dinner. Capistrano's food and 
beverage director, Jean-Claude Guerin, couldn't have been more responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 He issued a refund and profuse apology and a genuine invitation to give the 
restaurant another try. 
</P>
<P>
 I did, repeatedly -- but not without waiting a few nervous weeks -- and always 
unknown to the restaurant. Again, I have good and bad news, though not nearly 
on the harrowing scale of my inaugural visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano's setting within the oceanfront Mandalay Beach Resort is a stunner. 
Diners choose between the vaulted interior courtyard, a pastel Mediterranean 
space of classical yet rustic elegance; or a thatch-ceilinged, ocean-view, 
Tiki-like installation recalling some Caribbean hideaway. These rooms easily 
place Capistrano among the two or three prettiest places to dine in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano's food, on the other hand, is uneven. It is clear from the 
ambitious menu that every effort is being made to rise above the hotel-food 
genre. But it is also clear on the plate -- and every appetizer and entree is 
artfully presented -- that standards can be far lower than promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, an appetizer so simple as bruscetta ($5.50) fails. Usually a dish 
of vividly fresh chopped tomato with garlic, olive oil and basil arrives with 
color and flavor drained away: It is a sad cold amber mass, as if stored for 
days in a refrigerator tub. It goes largely uneaten. 
</P>
<P>
 But the far trickier rum-glazed tiger prawns ($8.75), in which shrimp are 
glazed with Myers's Dark Rum, brown sugar and passion fruit vinaigrette, are 
sparklingly fresh and cooked to just-before-done perfection. Likewise, the 
Sonoma goat cheese relleno ($5.75) is a delight: A mild green chili is filled 
with chevre, thyme and oven-roasted tomato salsa, the result fragrant and 
bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Onion soup ($3.95) showed well: deeply flavored in bronze-colored stock and 
onions, with the authentic thin mantle of pungent cheese on top. And wild 
mushroom ravioli ($7.25), tossed in a light garlic cream sauce, was deeply 
flavorful, if a bit overcooked and glutinous in the pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Dungeness crab cakes ($8.75) were, sadly, the embodiment of the dual ethic 
here. Flavorless and at times bitter in the meat, they were nonetheless a 
gorgeous sight of three nicely browned medallions set adrift in a moat of 
shimmering green tomatillo salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 For entrees, stick to the basics. Pacific king salmon fillet ($14.95), broiled 
perfectly and finished in cilantro and scallion pesto, is restorative and 
stylishly conceived. Shrimp and scallops basilic ($13.50) is satisfying in the 
properly sauteed shellfish but adrift in flavor -- the mix of accompanying 
sun-dried tomato, shallots, spinach, basil and linguine serving to blur rather 
than define. 
</P>
<P>
 Medallions of pork Normandy ($13.75) are expertly handled and smothered, 
decadently and happily, in a mushroom, apple and cream sauce edged in bright 
Calvados. For what it's worth, the implicated Ahi tuna ($14.75) -- my 
misfortune with it is Capistrano's only bad experience, insists Guerin -- is 
grilled and sauced in a ginger-lime teriyaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano seeks to broaden its customer base by having French Country cooking 
specials on Monday and Tuesday, and all-you-can-eat pasta specials on Wednesday 
and Thursday -- all at the bargain price of $9.95, which includes a salad or 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
 On the French night, I had a textbook coq au vin, or chicken in rich wine 
sauce atop buttered noodles, that lacked flavor and suffered from gummy pasta. 
On Italian night, when the diner conceives his own pasta sauce, I ordered 
linguine tossed in olive oil, roasted garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and scallions 
-- but it arrived without the garlic, bitter from dried herbs and overcooked in 
the noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are average, the best of them a deeply flavored creme brulee set in 
sunny orange sauce. But even the best come up uneven: Key lime pie on one visit 
was bracingly tart and fresh, on another without citrus flavor and, worse, wet 
and stale in the crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano's has a well-selected and fair-priced wine list, offering a full, 
tropical Leeward Chardonnay at $19 and a bright, laden-with-berries Rutherford 
Hill Merlot for $24. Decent bottle wines are available by the glass -- Martini 
Pinot Noir, for example, at $4.50 -- but the glasses are dessert-wine small, a 
not-too-subtle ungraciousness that probably yields more annoyance than profit.

dinner orders simple. Details

 Outside the county, but serious food activity nonetheless: The 8th Annual 
California Avocado Festival in Carpinteria on Saturday and Sunday -- a worthy 
food event itself and just minutes outside Ventura County -- will, for the 
first time, hold a series of avocado baking and cooking contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Categories for adults include main dishes, desserts, appetizers, guacamole, 
baked goods, and "other food items." There will also be a children's baked 
goods category. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will really be like a county fair," said organizer Debbie Murphy. "Whether 
it's avocado scones or avocado-shaped pancakes, somehow it has to be made with 
avocados, look like an avocado, be in an avocado shell -- somehow tie in with 
the theme of avocado. Who knows what somebody might cook up. An avocado malt? 
Avocado chocolate cake?" 
</P>
<P>
 Entries are not being taken in advance. Instead, they will be accepted at 
given times on the day of the contest, either Saturday or Sunday. For specific 
times and other entry information, call 684-0038.

 It's not too early to reserve a spot at the Wheeler Hot Springs Champagne 
Truffle and Tasting Dinner, hosted by Executive Chef Gael Lecolley on Oct. 26. 
The date is a bit off, but the reservation list is filling quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 This culinary event will highlight the talents of Lecolley combined with 
champagnes presented by Jean-Louis Carbonnier of the Champagne News and 
Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbonnier will bring along some of the biggest names in champagne production, 
including samplings of Dom Ruinart, Veuve Clicquot, Moet & Chandon, and 
Bollinger. Meanwhile, Lecolley will prepare a five-course meal featuring exotic 
truffles from the United States and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Hors d'oeuvres and champagne will be served at 7 p.m. with dinner to follow. 
Tickets are $95 per person and seating is limited to 120 people. Call 646-8131.

CHURCH IN O.C. POLLS CANDIDATES ON MORAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, Orange County's largest church is surveying candidates for 
local posts this election season, asking them pointed questions about 
controversial moral issues such as homosexuality, euthanasia and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented venture by Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa into local politics 
will include distribution of the responses to more than 50,000 people before 
the Nov. 8 election, to highlight which candidates agree with the church's 
values and views. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just tough for the average person to get accurate information . . . (on 
the) moral and family values that we are concerned about," said David Hocking, 
a pastor at Calvary Chapel. "We deal with picking up the pieces of people's 
broken lives. The whole culture is collapsing. Somebody better start asking 
some questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers and local candidates said they have never before seen a 
church issue such a questionnaire, though various advocacy groups -- including 
Christian political organizations -- have been conducting similar surveys since 
the early 1980s. Several candidates and political observers said they found the 
questions troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Englander, a Huntington Beach-based consultant who has worked for 
Democrats and Republicans, called the situation "unusual and disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just real concerned about the marriage of church and state that this 
voter's guide appears to be considering," said Englander, who added that he 
would advise candidates he is helping not to fill out the surveys. "I think if 
the Calvary Chapel wants to get involved in political campaigns, they ought to 
take it out of the church and put it in the political hall where it belongs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jo Ellen Allen, vice chairwoman of the Orange County Republican Party and 
president of the Eagle Forum of California, said that as long as the church 
does not endorse candidates, she sees no problem with the voter's guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the church should be is the conscience of the nation and the community," 
she said. "It has the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and make 
congregations aware of moral principles and how they're reflected in public 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 While the church is breaking no laws by publishing a "voter's guide," experts 
said, it appears to take advantage of a loophole in the laws governing 
political activism by tax-exempt organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches are not allowed to endorse candidates but can circulate educational 
information during campaigns. Unlike advocacy groups that endorse candidates, 
churches are not required to file disclosure forms about money collected or 
spent on politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Petracca, an associate professor of political science at UC Irvine who 
specializes in local government, said he is concerned about accountability when 
tax-exempt groups participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a circumvention mechanism, a very thinly veiled circumvention 
mechanism," Petracca said of the surveys. "What they're doing is dishonest. 
Their intention is not to give voters a guide but to give support to candidates 
who answer in the way they prefer." 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking denied that the guide is a method of disguising endorsements. "We're 
not going to favor one over the other. We're just going to publish the 
results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1965, Calvary Chapel is among the largest churches in America, 
Hocking said. It draws as many as 50,000 people to services in locations 
throughout Orange County each Sunday, he said. Headquartered in Santa Ana, the 
church has spawned 570 branches around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The church distributed 600 surveys to candidates throughout the county Sept. 
20, asking that they be returned within a week and warning: "If we do not 
receive your answers, we will be forced to state that you did not respond to 
our questionnaire." As of Wednesday, 166 candidates had responded, Hocking 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those running for county offices or city council seats were asked 10 
questions, while school board candidates were asked seven. Candidates for some 
special districts also received questionnaires, Hocking said, though there was 
no questionnaire specifically designed for them. 
</P>
<P>
 City council candidates were asked if they would oppose "special legal status 
for homosexuals," "insurance coverage for . . . homosexual partners of 
government employees," "businesses which sell or rent pornographic materials," 
and "removal of (religious) artifacts . . . from public property." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board questionnaire asks candidates if they would oppose 
"school-based 'health' clinics," and distribution of condoms on school 
campuses. It asks if they would support abstinence-only sex education, parental 
consent for abortion and equal access on school campuses for those who oppose 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this just gets (candidates') views on social and moral issues, and I 
think they should do that," said Costa Mesa City Council candidate Chris Steel, 
who returned his survey with mostly 'yes' answers, he said. "The voters have 
the right to know where people stand. As much as they can know about the 
candidates, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Arturo Moreno, a candidate for the Garden Grove Unified Board of 
Education, who also returned the survey: "I think it's great that we're getting 
more political candidates who aren't afraid to say we're Christians." 
</P>
<P>
 But some candidates complained that the questionnaires are slanted and 
simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to fill out surveys that will allow me room to explain my 
reasoning in full sentences," said Karen Wilson, who is running for the school 
board in the Newport-Mesa Unified district, but does not plan to return Calvary 
Chapel's survey. "Generally I'm not a real wordy person, but most issues, I 
think, deserve a well-thought-through answer and not just a yes or no." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he filled out the survey and supports the church's position on most 
issues, Capistrano Unified school board candidate Dorsey Brause agreed. "I 
don't like 'yes' and 'no,' frankly," he said. "I prefer some explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking, who spearheaded the organization of the voter's guide, said it was 
designed to be pointed and avoid any gray area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several incumbents said this was the first time they had received such a 
survey from a church, though other groups -- including the Anaheim-based 
Traditional Values Coalition and the Orange County Pro-Family Candidate 
Campaign -- have produced strikingly similar questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette B. Gude, who has sat on the Capistrano Unified board for 14 years, and 
Dick Hain, a 13-year veteran of the Garden Grove Unified school board, both 
said they did not return the surveys because the questions seemed irrelevant to 
school board business and because they fear the influence of the Christian 
right in school politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 'yes' or 'no' and it's like, 'Do you (still) beat your wife?' How do you 
say yes or no to that? These are loaded questions," Gude complained. "I don't 
trust them. It just concerns me because all of these things have nothing to do 
with the basics of education: reading, writing, arithmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet will be distributed at churches throughout the county about two 
weeks before the election, Hocking said. The cost of postage, photocopying and 
labor involved in the surveys have all been donated, he said, brushing off any 
criticism of the church's heightened involvement in campaigns this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breakdown of parental authority, the breakdown of families . . . we've 
got terrible problems. For people to sit there and shoot at us because we want 
to do something about it, we don't buy it," Hocking said. "If we really want 
people to participate in the American political system, stop criticizing people 
who are providing information on political candidates." Chapter and Verse 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, the county's largest church, has distributed questionnaires to 
candidates for school boards and city and county government posts, seeking 
their views on controversial religious and moral issues. A sampling of 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 FOR CITY AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you oppose an ordinance granting special legal status to homosexuals? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you support laws restoring legal protection for unborn children from 
conception, with the possible exception where a medical procedure is necessary 
to prevent the mother's death? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you oppose the removal of existing artifacts, monuments or works of art 
with a religious element from public property? 
</P>
<P>
 FOR SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you support a school policy prohibiting school personnel from 
counseling or assisting students in obtaining an abortion? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you oppose the distribution of condoms on school campuses? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will you support an abstinence-only program that does not present premarital 
sex (with or without contraceptives) or abortion as responsible and acceptable 
choices?

800 LOST AT SEA IN FERRY DISASTER; BALTIC SEA: THERE ARE 126 SURVIVORS FROM THE 
VESSEL THAT SAILED FROM ESTONIA FOR SWEDEN. A CREW MEMBER IS QUOTED AS SAYING A 
LOADING RAMP WAS IMPROPERLY CLOSED.

<P>
 Two boats arrived here late Wednesday night carrying 32 survivors of a sunken 
Estonian passenger ferry who had been scooped from the swollen Baltic Sea. 
Their arrival at the chilly harbor-front terminal brought whimpers of relief 
from desperate relatives but also brought to a bittersweet close the most 
tragic day on the Baltic since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the Swedish survivors are probably the last passengers from 
the doomed ferry who will be found alive, bringing the tally of those rescued 
to 126. Estimates vary of the number of people aboard the ferry when it sank in 
a severe storm early Wednesday en route to the Swedish capital, but authorities 
fear that more than 800 people are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue boats and helicopters braved high winds and pitching seas all day, 
checking and double-checking life rafts for survivors and making several 
miraculous snatches from the 50-degree water. But officials in Turku, Finland, 
where the rescue was organized, called off the search at nightfall because of 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very little hope of finding anyone alive," said Finnish Coast Guard 
Capt. Raimo Tiilikainen, who said the search for bodies will resume at dawn 
today. By sundown Wednesday, 42 had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 For hundreds of family members holed up in a hotel not far from the Stockholm 
ferry terminal, where the boat Estonia was to have docked Wednesday morning 
after an overnight trip from the Estonian capital of Tallinn, the suspended 
rescue effort was just the latest in a day of heartbreaking reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the majority of those on board the Estonia were Swedes, 
including about 60 civilian employees of the Stockholm Police Department, 
several dozen members of a Swedish senior citizens club and several judges 
returning home after visiting Estonian counterparts. Authorities said the ship 
carried passengers from Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Canada, Russia, 
Nigeria, Finland, Norway, Britain and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very big shock for everyone," said Stockholm Police Chief Richard 
Sevelius. "There is nothing to compare it with." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers said a young pregnant woman went into premature labor when she 
learned her fiance was not among those rescued, and other despondent relatives 
fainted or broke into hysterics as the hours of uncertainty dragged on. Dozens 
of counselors, clergymen and other volunteers tended distraught family members, 
whose counterparts gathered in Tallinn and in Turku, where most survivors in 
need of immediate medical care were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't describe how horrible it was to watch as an 11-year-old boy realized 
he had lost his father," said a glassy-eyed Carl Tosterud, a 20-year-old Red 
Cross volunteer at the Stockholm ferry terminal. "There are enormous tragedies 
wherever you turn." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman standing near the docks at the Tallinn waterfront clutched a teddy 
bear and wept. "My husband and son were on their way to Sweden," she said. "My 
son left his teddy bear behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was declared a national day of mourning in Sweden, Estonia and 
Finland, and the prime ministers of the three countries met in Finland to 
coordinate the rescue effort and launch an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible night for Estonia," declared Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar, saying it reminded him of another Baltic tragedy in 1944 when many 
Estonians drowned trying to flee the occupying Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a human tragedy beyond belief," said Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, 
"the worst disaster in my country in at least a century." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the three countries would not speculate about the cause of the 
accident, saying the ferry first needs to be recovered from the sea floor and 
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Scandinavian and Estonian news reports quoted a surviving crew 
member as saying that one of the ferry's loading ramps was not closed properly, 
allowing water to rush in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something wrong," crew member Henrik Sillaste said, according to 
the reports. "The outer ramp was closed but the inner door was not properly 
attached. Water was forcing its way through. There was so much water on the 
lower deck that it almost reached my knees." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl-Gustaf Akerhielm, spokesman for the ferryboat's co-owner, Estline, would 
not comment, saying "there are so many rumors around" that he did not want to 
guess which ones might be true. He also would not comment on reports that two 
Swedish ferry inspectors, apparently on a training mission, had noted defects 
in the loading ramp doors prior to the ship's departure Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a clear idea, and I am not going to speculate," Akerhielm said. 
"I cannot assume a major fault with the vessel. For me it is a mystery, and I 
am very astonished." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said bad weather alone would not have been enough to sink the 
515-foot-long boat, which in addition to its passengers carried 77 vehicles. 
Kari Lehtola, an official with the Finnish Ministry of Justice and a member of 
the investigation team, said it is not unusual for ferries to operate on the 
Baltic in bad weather. The Estonia, which sank about six hours into its sea 
crossing, was blasted by 20-foot waves and 56-m.p.h winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sail this route every day of the year," Lehtola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonia, built in 1980 in West Germany and owned by the Swedish company 
Nordstrom & Thulin and the state Estonian Shipping Co., issued a distress 
signal at 1:24 a.m. that was picked up by the Coast Guard in Turku. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonian Transport Minister Andi Meister said the crew actually sent two 
Mayday signals before going down, but the vessel's automated distress system, 
which would have signaled its exact coordinates, did not work. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the first of 16 rescue boats arrived at the scene near the Finnish 
island of Uto two hours later, the ferry was nowhere in sight. Some passengers 
said it took only a matter of minutes for it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayday! Here is Estonia! Outside Uto lighthouse. We have listed 20 to 30 
degrees," the Finnish Coast Guard quoted the distress signal. Communication 
then broke off. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger Lars Lamke, a Stockholm doctor who survived the disaster, said many 
people were sleeping when the boat began to list uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in green hospital-issued pajamas in Turku, a hospital identity tag 
hanging around his neck, 63-year-old Lamke was able to describe in detail the 
way it felt to be aboard the fast-sinking ship -- impressions that may prove 
useful in the coming days and weeks as investigators try to piece together what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized something was wrong when all of my luggage started rushing down" 
toward the door of his sleeping compartment, Lamke said. By that time, he said, 
the ship was tilting so severely that he found it hard to push the baggage 
aside and open the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamke said it may have been the location of his sleeping quarters that saved 
him. He was on the sixth floor of the ship, and the life rafts were just 
upstairs on the seventh. He made his way toward the stairs with his companion, 
who is missing and presumed dead, climbed to the top, opened the door and felt 
a fierce wind blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers found Lamke's raft just as the sky was starting to get light. A 
helicopter took him and his lifeboat mates to a small military hospital on the 
Finnish coastal island of Uto, and then moved them to Turku. Many of those 
brought there needed intensive measures to warm them up, but Lamke needed only 
an X-ray and some stitches for a cut on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamke's doctor says that the emotional wounds that he and the others have 
suffered will take far longer to heal. "They have all sustained a kind of 
mental shock," said Juha Niinkoski, head of the cardiology unit at Turku 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have difficulties in the coming days as they realize what really 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reported from Stockholm and Walsh from Turku, Finland. Times special 
correspondents Lisa Trei and Eva Tarm in Tallinn, Estonia, also contributed to 
this report. Sinking of the Estonia 
</P>
<P>
 At least 800 people are feared dead after a ferry from Tallinn, Estonia, sank 
in stormy waters off the coast of Finland. The ill-fated vessel was headed for 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 How It Happened 
</P>
<P>
 All times local, hour approximate 
</P>
<P>
 1) 7 p.m. Tuesday. Ferry leaves Tallinn. 
</P>
<P>
 2) 8:30 p.m. Ferry runs into heavy weather and 20-foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Midnight. An engineer notices water coming in from the bow door. Crew puts 
out first Mayday. 
</P>
<P>
 12:15 a.m. Wednesday. Pumps are overwhelmed. The ferry lists toward the bow 
from the weight of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 1:55 a.m. Two of the ship's four engines shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 2 a.m. The ship sinks 
</P>
<P>
 The Vessel 
</P>
<P>
 * Owner: Nordstrom & Thulin of Sweden and the Estonian government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operator: Estline, Estonia 
</P>
<P>
 * Length: 515 feet, 15,566 tons 
</P>
<P>
 * Crew: 188 
</P>
<P>
 * Capacity: 2,000 passengers 
</P>
<P>
 * Vehicle Capacity: 460 
</P>
<P>
 A Frigid Death 
</P>
<P>
 For those able to jump off the sinking vessel, the cold waters of the Baltic 
Sea posed a serious health problem -- hypothermia. In severe hypothermia, a 
person's breathing slows, muscles stiffen, he or she loses consciousness and 
may die.

DISNEY GIVES UP PLANS FOR PARK AT HISTORIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. unexpectedly hoisted a white flag Wednesday on the Civil War 
battlefields of Virginia, abandoning its preferred site for the $650-million 
"Disney's America" theme park that had been pilloried as a vulgar commercial 
assault on a piece of the nation's most hallowed ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney vowed not to scrap the project itself, however, and announced that it 
will search for a less controversial location for the historical theme park, 
preferably still in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives made the decision despite support from top Virginia 
political leaders, including Gov. George F. Allen. Just last week, Disney had 
won favorable rulings for zoning and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition from leading historians, members of Congress and local 
residents near the proposed site in Haymarket, Va., 40 miles west of 
Washington, appeared to be growing by the day. Disney's abrupt about-face drew 
quick praise from opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted that Disney has decided to take a responsive and commendable 
course, recognizing the genuine concern of both historian and 
environmentalist," said historian James McPherson of Princeton University and a 
leading opponent. "We wish them well in their search for another site that will 
not impact other historical areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney unveiled its grandiose plans in November, 1993, and the project has 
been embroiled in controversy ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed theme park and mixed-use development has been attacked by leading 
historians and environmentalists and debated in congressional hearings. Last 
month, about 3,000 opponents marched in Washington to protest the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating as many 30,000 visitors a day, the park's planners had 
contemplated such attractions as a Lewis and Clark raft ride, a virtual-reality 
display in which visitors could "fight" in Civil War battles and a high-speed 
train ride through the Industrial Revolution. Plans to create an attraction 
that would allow visitors to "experience" slavery were dropped after public 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the theme park, the plans for the remainder of the huge site 
included a subdivision of more than 2,000 homes, up to 2 million square feet of 
commercial development, 1,300 hotel rooms, two golf courses and a 283-acre 
campsite. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Gagne of Protect Prince William County, a group opposed to the park, said 
she was pleased Disney "finally saw the light." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their reputation as an environmentally conscious company will be upheld. They 
made the right decision. This was not the right spot for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-acre site is located in a region rich with early American history. 
The area was home to four of the nation's first five presidents, and the 
development would sit only four miles from the site of the Civil War's bloody 
Battles of Manassas. The development itself would sit on the former campgrounds 
of Union and Confederate troops, according to some historians. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming the project would "vulgarize" history, more than 200 prominent 
historians, including David McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who 
narrated public television's 1990 "Civil War" series, formed Protect Historic 
America to oppose the park's construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's supporters, which included many local businesses as well as 
Virginia's political leadership, had maintained Disney's America would prove an 
economic boon. They criticized the opponents as elitists. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's withdrawal comes only a week after the Prince William County Planning 
Commission approved rezoning plans to allow the park's construction. And a 
regional transportation commission approved $130-million worth of road projects 
that would help ease traffic congestion created by the park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney could draw on its own history to recognize the handwriting on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The company proposed 28 years ago to build a major ski resort in the scenic 
Mineral King Valley in the Sierra Nevada. Twelve years passed before that 
project died at the hands of Congress when an omnibus parks measure added the 
valley to Sequoia National Park and prohibited downhill skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of Mineral King is well-known at Disney, even though the Michael 
Eisner-led management team took over in 1984, six years after the ski resort 
project died. Unlike the abandoned ski resort, however, Disney insiders insist 
they intend to find another site for the history-themed park, and named new 
managers for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Channel President John F. Cooke will take on the additional role of 
chairman of Disney's America, while Dana Nottingham was promoted to president. 
Nottingham has served as director of development on the project. The two 
executives will assume the tasks of Mark Pacala, who is leaving Disney to run 
the Forum Group Inc., a company specializing in retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on Wall Street would just as soon Disney forgot about it, however. One 
respected analyst applauded the decision and predicted that Disney will scrap 
the project. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the analyst said that some 
top executives -- including the recently ousted studio chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg -- had opposed the park as ill-timed.

 Surrounded by razor-sharp barbed wire, dozens of American armored vehicles and 
hundreds of U.S. soldiers, Haiti's Parliament convened Wednesday for the first 
time in 16 months, taking a symbolic step toward the restoration of exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate and Chamber of Deputies were summoned by Aristide -- who remains in 
Washington -- under an agreement negotiated 11 days ago by former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter to return the Haitian leader and remove the military 
regime that overthrew him on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament is to write a law to ensure that the army, including Commander 
in Chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, 
and the police chief in Port-au-Prince, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, will 
be protected from prosecution for staging the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the three leaders will resign no later than Oct. 15, and Aristide 
will return to finish his term, which ends in February, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament -- usually inefficient and raucous and sometimes violent -- was 
merely slow and ineffective Wednesday, dillydallying for two hours and 10 
minutes past the scheduled opening time of 2 p.m. and adjourning after 50 
minutes of non-activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders indicated that they were in no hurry to move along with 
either the amnesty legislation or five other proposals related to Aristide's 
return and the weakening of the military's power. Indeed, it was unclear even 
when the next session will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, it doesn't matter whether Parliament passes the amnesty measure 
anytime soon -- or at all -- because the Carter agreement requires Cedras and 
the others to resign when the bill is approved or by Oct. 15, whichever comes 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of Haitians were kept at bay in front of the squat white building 
by the American soldiers and the treacherous wire, it was also unclear as the 
Parliament opened what type of law will be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft proposing only limited immunity, written last October when it was 
believed that Aristide was coming back soon, is one possibility. However, some 
experts expect that a commission will be appointed to draw up a more liberal 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wednesday session had the added, confusing ingredients of legislators 
returning from exile or coming out of hiding and a challenge by a group of 
senators who were excluded by the Americans on the grounds that their elections 
in January, 1993, were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The "legal" senators and deputies who had gone into hiding or forced exile 
after being threatened by the military when they last tried to meet almost a 
year ago emerged only at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the crowds gathered by the barricades shouted slogans favoring 
Aristide and against attempts by the excluded senators to enter. They also 
taunted the few Haitian police nearby, chanting: "You can't shoot, you can't 
shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few picket signs against Aristide appeared, a boycott of the 
session by his legislative opponents fizzled when 11 of the 17 authenticated 
senators and 50 of the 82 deputies showed, making a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
 The tedium of the wait for the opening ceremony, signaled by the doffing of a 
black fedora by the presiding officer, was interrupted by gunfire a few blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 A small crowd of pro-Aristide demonstrators chanting anti-Cedras slogans was 
attacked by gunmen in a car as the marchers headed toward a downtown bar and 
office run by a paramilitary group called the Front for the Advancement and 
Progress of Haiti, or FRAPH. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, shot in the chest, was critically wounded, and some other 
demonstrators were also wounded. The shooting sent the U.S. soldiers guarding 
the Parliament diving for cover and many of the thousands of watchers scurrying 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 American troops, armed with photographs and aided by Haitian spotters, were 
ordered to keep the "illegals," as the excluded senators were dubbed by U.S. 
Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager, from entering. 
</P>
<P>
 This appearance of foreign control, reinforced by searches and seizures of 
weapons from the entering senators and deputies, brought howls of rage from 
some legislators and their fellow Aristide foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantz-Robert Monde, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, complained bitterly 
about the barbed wire and the seizure of his handgun when he tried to enter the 
legislature Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outrage, a violation of national sovereignty," Monde told a 
reporter Wednesday. "This is as bad as August, 1991," when a pro-Aristide mob 
besieged the Parliament to prevent a vote of censure against Aristide's prime 
minister, Rene Preval. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that demonstration that galvanized the military and its civilian 
attaches to overthrow the country's first democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 Even pro-Aristide legislators complained about Wednesday's security measures, 
which required anyone entering the Parliament to undergo identification checks 
and searches by U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the National Front for the Concentration of Democracy, a loose 
coalition of pro-Aristide parties, said the security was excessive. One deputy, 
who asked not to be named, said: "This embarrasses us. It makes it look like we 
are puppets of the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening session took place in the sauna-like Chamber of Deputies, which 
was crowded with the 61 senators and deputies who showed up, plus dozens of 
diplomats, government officials and reporters massed overhead on a balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 The session opened against a background of apprehension and even spreading 
violence in the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the afternoon shooting near the FRAPH office, another man, reportedly a 
security agent of the military, was killed by a morning mob in the shanty slum 
of Cite Soleil, while hundreds of looters stormed a food warehouse on the edge 
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters witnessed at least two men being beaten with wrecking bars and 
wooden clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The men escaped, bloody but alive, by diving into a huge pothole filled three 
feet deep with a greenish slime. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pro-Aristide mob tried to break into the office of the Democrats for 
the Rescue of the Republic, another anti-Aristide group that is a remnant of 
the political party created by the Duvalier dynasty that ruled Haiti from 1954 
to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 As the looting and demonstrations seem to stay one step ahead of U.S. efforts 
to curb violence, the escalating trouble has American diplomats and military 
officers worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Today will present a further challenge as American troops reinstall Evans Paul 
as Port-au-Prince mayor. Paul, a wildly popular figure among the city's poor, 
has been in semi-hiding since army and civilian thugs tried to kill him last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular organizations have called on their followers to fill the streets today 
to celebrate Paul's installation and to practice for even larger demonstrations 
Friday, the third anniversary of the anti-Aristide coup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development Wednesday, U.S. Army and Marine troops in the 
northern city of Cap Haitien, acting on a request from Cedras, exhumed the 
bodies of 10 Haitian policemen killed in a gun battle with Marines on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military officials said they were simply "doing a courtesy" for Cedras, 
who asked that the bodies be brought today to Port-au-Prince for burial with 
full military honors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people gathered around the main Cap Haitien cemetery as the bodies 
were removed. They shouted obscenities at two Haitian army officials from 
Port-au-Prince who witnessed the exhumations, and they later rushed into the 
cemetery and yelled epithets at the open graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Richard A. Serrano in Cap Haitien contributed to this 
report.

UNIVERSE FAR YOUNGER THAN BELIEVED, TWO STUDIES FIND; ASTRONOMY: RESULTS SHOW 
COSMOS IS NEWER THAN OLDEST STARS -- CREATING A 'VERY PROFOUND' PARADOX FOR 
SCIENTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The universe is a far younger and smaller place than anyone suspected, two 
independent teams of distinguished astronomers announced Wednesday. In fact, 
the universe may be only about half as old as the oldest stars and galaxies it 
contains. 
</P>
<P>
 That fundamental paradox -- sure to keep philosophers, theologians and 
astronomers awake at night -- is one byproduct of the newest and most accurate 
estimates of the size and age of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the new findings promise to startle the astronomical world by 
challenging some long-held assumptions about the properties of the universe, 
which encompasses all known matter and space, since it evolved from a primeval 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives cosmologists and astronomers the marching orders to go and explain 
the discrepancy between the oldest stars and the age of the universe," said 
Stephen Maran, a senior astronomer at NASA's Goddard Space Center and a 
spokesman for the American Astronomical Society. "There is something very 
profound going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In an often frustrating effort to solve one of nature's most fundamental 
puzzles, scientists have argued for decades over the age of the cosmos and how 
fast space itself has expanded since creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers believe the key to any scientific answer is Hubble's constant, 
which is a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance for remote, receding 
galaxies. Scientists have been constantly refining their calculation of the 
constant, based on data gleaned from increasingly precise astronomical 
observations. The right answer holds the key to whether the universe may one 
day reach the end of its outward rush, reverse, and slowly collapse in on 
itself in what some astronomers like to call the Big Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 By radically different routes, the two international teams have arrived at 
what several experts say are surprisingly similar and unsettling answers. 
</P>
<P>
 One group, led by Indiana University astronomer Michael J. Pierce, developed a 
better yardstick for gauging the size, and hence the age, of the expanding 
universe by calculating with unprecedented precision the distance to the Virgo 
Cluster, 50 million light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Their calculations led them to believe the universe could be as little as 7 
billion years old, compared to previous estimates of as much as 20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The other researchers, led by Harvard University astronomer Robert Kirshner, 
used five exploding supernovas as surveyor's marks to calculate the cosmic 
distance scale. That group found the universe to be between 9 billion and 14 
billion years old, but still much younger than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indiana study appears in today's issue of Nature and the Harvard research 
is published in the current issue of the Astrophysical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the studies disagree in their age estimates, several experts said, 
they both determined very high values for Hubble's constant and agreed that the 
universe is not as old as previous estimates have suggested. Experts said that 
the larger the value of the constant, the younger the universe must be and the 
faster its rate of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies also share an "unwelcome" twist: The oldest stars and galaxies in 
the universe are, by the best estimates, about 16 billion years old. So how can 
the universe be younger than that? Astronomers use a separate gauge, based on 
their understanding of thermonuclear reactions and stellar evolution, to judge 
the age of individual galaxies and stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we have a problem," acknowledged Pierce. "Either we are missing something 
in our understanding of the evolution and the age of the oldest stars or we are 
missing something in our understanding of how the universe has been evolving 
since the Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be very interesting in the next few years while we struggle to 
unravel this mystery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirshner agreed. "Both of us are in conflict with our understanding of the 
ages of the stars," he said. "Maybe the expansion of the universe has perhaps 
not been so simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the apparent paradox can be explained in one of three ways: The 
Hubble calculations simply may be wrong. The estimates of the age of stars and 
galaxies may be wrong. Or the conventional understanding of how the universe 
has evolved since its beginnings in a cataclysmic Big Bang may be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one understands by any simple means how the universe can be younger than 
the oldest objects we see around us," Maran said. "My personal opinion is that 
there is a basic property of the universe that has not yet occurred to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indiana team used three rare flickering stars called cepheids, which vary 
in brightness on a regular timetable, to calibrate the distance to the Virgo 
Cluster directly for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronomers focused on Virgo because that cluster of galaxies has been 
used by many researchers to gauge the relative distance between other celestial 
objects, even before any precise measure of its distance from Earth was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, they 
determined that the distance to Virgo Cluster from Earth is 50 million 
light-years. Because the stars are twice as far away as the most distant 
cepheids previously studied, the team was able to calculate Hubble's constant 
with unusual precision. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Kirshner's team used geometric measurements of five supernovas to 
derive an accurate measuring scale for the vast emptiness that separates 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
 The farthest exploding stars were more than 500 million light-years from 
Earth, but so bright that the supernovas were a million times brighter to 
observers on Earth than the cepheid stars in Virgo. 
</P>
<P>
 To calculate the distance to the exploding star, the researchers used its 
color and brightness as measured on Earth, combined with the velocity of the 
expanding gases from the heart of the mammoth thermonuclear explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the proper measurements, astronomers must monitor the supernova in the 
first few weeks after the star explodes, before its superheated atmosphere has 
a chance to cool and become transparent. The new explosions enabled them to 
derive the new calculations. Rethinking The Age of The Universe 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers announced Wednesday that the universe is billions of years younger 
than previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Question: How long has it been since the Big Bang, the primeval fireball 
in which time and space began? 
</P>
<P>
 * The Method: Any calculation of the universe's age depends on a measure of 
the speed at which the universe is expanding, called Hubble's constant. That in 
turn requires the separate measurement of the distance to galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
 * What They Did: An Indiana University group used more precise measurements of 
the distance to a cluster of galaxies called Virgo, shown above, while Harvard 
University group used huge exploding stars called supernovas -- such as 1987A, 
shown below -- as surveyor's marks. 
</P>
<P>
 * What They Found: The Indiana group said the universe could be as little as 7 
billion years old; the Harvard group arrived at an age of between 9 billion and 
14 billion years. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Problem: Since the oldest stars are more than 16 billion years old, how 
can the universe be younger than the things it contains? 
</P>
<P>
 * Things to Explore: The calculation could be wrong, the age of the stars 
could be off or theire is a hither-to-known property of the universe at work.

CIA ISSUING 11 REPRIMANDS IN AMES SPY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey announced Wednesday that he is reprimanding 11 
current and former senior intelligence officials for their roles in failing to 
help detect that one of the agency's employees, Aldrich H. Ames, was spying for 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woolsey is not firing or demoting any of these officials -- all but one of 
whom worked for the CIA's Directorate of Operations, its clandestine service. 
Only four of the 11 officials will receive "serious" reprimands. Three of those 
four have already retired, so the only penalty they will suffer will be a ban 
on post-retirement work for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The current head of the Operations Directorate, Ted Price -- who served as 
head of the CIA's Counterintelligence Center while Ames worked for it in 1990 
-- was among the seven people given a mild reprimand. But he will keep his job 
as the CIA official in direct charge of spying and covert operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey's actions follow the completion of a classified CIA inspector 
general's report that found there had been, by Woolsey's own admission, "a 
systemic failure of the CIA." 
</P>
<P>
 "The consequences have been horrid for us at the CIA, for the American people 
and for those who helped us overseas and who, in a number of cases, in effect, 
were murdered by Ames," the director admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said 
in an interview Wednesday night that he would have liked to see "some heads 
roll" at the CIA for its mishandling of the Ames case. However, he went on, 
"the problem is that you'd like to see the right heads roll. . . . Most of the 
people I see really culpable and responsible are no longer at the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames began spying for the Soviet Union in 1985 and continued until he was 
arrested early this year. By official estimates, his actions in turning over 
CIA secrets led to the deaths of 10 people working for U.S. intelligence and 
compromised about three dozen cases. Yet Ames was left on the job and 
repeatedly given new assignments in extremely sensitive positions, including 
the CIA's Soviet/Eastern Europe division and the Counterintelligence Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press conference Wednesday, Woolsey acknowledged that Ames' drinking 
problem had been so egregious that, at one point while he was stationed in Rome 
in the 1980s, he fell drunk in a gutter and was retrieved by the Italian 
police. Yet when he returned from Rome, he was given a job in the Soviet 
Union/Eastern Europe division at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, CIA Director William H. Webster established a new Counterintelligence 
Center in an effort to respond to the spy case of Edgar Lee Howard, a young 
agent who defected to the Soviet Union. Officials in the Directorate of 
Operations assigned Ames to the new center in what Woolsey called "an easy 
solution to what they erroneously thought was no more than a personnel 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 With that transfer, Ames won access to the internal CIA computer system that 
gave details of double-agent cases -- people pretending to be spying for the 
Soviet Union, while actually reporting back to the United States. He passed on 
the details to the KGB, the Soviet secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey went to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to try to explain to Congress, in 
closed-door meetings, what disciplinary actions he is taking as a result of the 
Ames case. He told reporters he wants to "leave Ames behind . . . and turn our 
attention resolutely to the future." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear whether Congress will support him. One intelligence 
specialist, Jeff Richelson of the National Security Archives, said Woolsey's 
response will be seen as "clearly insufficient. . . . I'm surprised there were 
no demotions or firings." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet former CIA Director Richard Helms, himself a former head of the 
Directorate of Operations, said that Woolsey's personnel decisions were 
"reasonable. We don't really arrest policemen because they don't catch the 
burglars." Although Ames' work for the KGB resulted in the deaths of 10 people, 
Helms said, "the fact remains that people get killed around here all the time. 
Let's not exaggerate this." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey told reporters Wednesday that the 11 current and former intelligence 
officers were being reprimanded for "errors in management, as well as for 
failing to devote sufficient resources to the counterintelligence effort as 
questions arose." Price was the only one of the 11 people identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four people to whom the director gave serious reprimands, the only one 
still at the CIA will retire within the next few days, for reasons Woolsey said 
were unrelated to the Ames case. All four will be "barred from further 
relationships with the CIA" during retirement. They will receive their regular 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the seven who received milder reprimands, four still work for the CIA and 
three are retired. Woolsey said those who were reprimanded cannot be given 
promotions or performance awards for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA director said that Price worked as director of the Counterintelligence 
Center only for a "relatively brief" period of 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who conducted the mole hunt are explicit that they reported to him only 
during this period," Woolsey said. "Neither his superior nor his subordinates 
were calling for increased resources. . . . I have confidence in Ted Price's 
ability and professionalism, and I have asked him to stay on as director of 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 After discussing Price's case at Wednesday's closed hearing, Glickman said 
that "as I examine it today, he is not a particularly culpable" individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA's internal investigation turned up a long series of errors and 
management mistakes in the handling of the Ames case. For example, Ames stopped 
reporting his meetings with Soviet officials in clear violation of CIA policy, 
but his superiors took no action against him. When junior officers tried to ask 
Ames about this, "management dropped the matter, a most serious lack of 
attention to duty," Woolsey acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, the CIA director said, "Ames, who had been ranked as third 
from the bottom out of 200 officers, was selected to serve on a promotion 
panel. . . . In that assignment Ames was in a position to do substantial 
damage, for he was given easy access to the files of a group of our mid-level 
officers."

1ST STAGE OF JURY SELECTION ENDS; BID FOR DELAY REJECTED; SIMPSON CASE: JUDGE 
CALLS PROGRESS 'SPECTACULAR.' PROSECUTION HAD SOUGHT A CHANGE IN THE TRIAL 
SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito effectively ended Wednesday the first phase 
of jury selection in the O.J. Simpson murder trial and rejected a prosecution 
motion that would have postponed some juror questioning until after a hearing 
on scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito called the progress in questioning prospective jurors about possible 
hardships "spectacular," and announced Wednesday morning that enough jury 
candidates had emerged to allow him to end the face-to-face interviews that he 
has used to determine who could serve on the panel. Instead, he moved to excuse 
prospective jurors who indicated in written questionnaires that they might have 
difficulty being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 That left 257 selected since Monday and 53 more who will be chosen today. They 
will face more grueling questioning about possible biases and exposure to press 
coverage when the next phase of jury selection begins early next month. At the 
end of that process, Ito hopes to have 12 jurors and eight alternates who can 
impartially weigh the evidence and come to verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ito rejected an effort by prosecutors to alter the trial schedule 
to shield prospective jurors from publicity, particularly about an upcoming 
hearing in which DNA evidence will be vigorously contested by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's court session highlighted a day of diverse developments in the 
Simpson case. In addition to the proceedings in Ito's courtroom: 
</P>
<P>
 * KNBC-TV released a letter to Ito in which the station defended its efforts 
to report developments accurately and pledged to correct reports if they turn 
out to be inaccurate. On the air, the station acknowledged that its sources 
have now raised questions about KNBC stories stating that blood on a sock found 
in Simpson's bedroom matched the DNA of Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police Chief Willie L. Williams, appearing on the "Today" show, defended his 
department's handling of the case and said leaks about the investigation were 
coming from a variety of sources, not just police officers. The LAPD has 
launched an internal investigation to uncover the sources of some news reports, 
but Simpson's lawyers have asked the state attorney general to open an inquiry 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court officials indicated that the grand jury investigation of Simpson's 
close friend Al (A.C.) Cowlings appeared to be drawing to a close. Two people 
who saw Cowlings and Simpson on the freeway and reported them to police -- 
touching off a low-speed pursuit broadcast live around the world -- testified 
before the grand jury Wednesday, as did Cathy Randa, Simpson's longtime 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Randa, who had already testified twice before the grand jury, and the other 
witnesses were the last scheduled to testify in that investigation but 
prosecutors will continue to sift through the evidence. Cowlings is under 
investigation to determine whether he was aiding Simpson's flight from justice 
June 17, as authorities maintain, or whether he was merely trying to stop his 
lifelong friend from committing suicide, as his lawyer has stated. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Simpson murder case moves toward trial, attention this week has focused 
on the first phase of the complex process of picking a jury. Many factors 
complicate that task, most of them related to the enormous publicity that 
erupted within hours of discovery of the bodies of Nicole Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has proclaimed his innocence and has insisted on moving his case to 
trial as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed with which the case has moved has created a potentially difficult 
problem when it comes to picking a jury while holding what is expected to be a 
lengthy and hotly contested hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence. Ito 
and the attorneys spent much of this week trying to decide which prospective 
jurors should be excused because of work or personal hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, that process was very brief because Ito agreed to let any 
prospective juror who had claimed a hardship on a written questionnaire leave 
without further questions. Only one possible juror was questioned because she 
said she had discovered a possible conflict after answering the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 She was excused after meeting with Ito and the attorneys. Simpson attended 
that session, appearing relaxed. He briefly chatted again with reporters who 
sat near him in the intimate confines of the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to watch what I say to you guys," Simpson said to the reporters. "If 
I say it, I know I'll read it tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, underscoring his own vow to remain silent, Simpson recited a kind of 
name, rank and serial number: "O.J. Simpson, 47, No. 32," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to see you again under different circumstances," Simpson added before 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the trial schedule that Ito outlined earlier this month, a full panel of 
jurors and alternates was to be selected before the DNA hearing and then sent 
home and asked not to pay attention to the media coverage while the hearing is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman appealed to Ito's 
"sense of order and common sense" in urging that the final phase of jury 
selection be postponed until after the DNA hearing so that all prospective 
jurors could be questioned about their exposure to that debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because coverage is pervasive, prosecutors fear that jurors would inevitably 
be exposed to the publicity and that some would have to be excused. If enough 
jurors were tainted, a mistrial might be declared and the entire process begun 
again, even before a single witness had testified, prosecutors warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the name of common sense, and in the name of . . . reducing the potential 
for mistrial, I ask that the court seriously consider this proposal," said 
Hodgman, who warned that even conscientious jurors would hear about the case at 
work or in the supermarket. "We'll have our trial. We won't have downtime. Mr. 
Simpson already is getting his speedy trial, so to speak. Right now, what we 
have to be concerned about is whether both sides will get a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's lawyers argued that the prosecution's proposed alternative -- 
suspending the final phase of jury selection until after the DNA hearing -- 
would slow the process. Moreover, they insisted that jurors can be selected and 
then told to avoid coverage, admonitions that Simpson's lawyers said they 
expect jurors to take seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of confidence in jurors, your honor," said Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys. "If your Honor makes an order for a juror 
not to do certain things, I think you're going to find that jurors will 
traditionally follow the court's ruling. . . . Whether you bring them back on 
the 12th or whatever day, I think you're going to find that they've complied 
with your order." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, although conceding that jurors will have to be re-interviewed when they 
return after the DNA hearing, said that process could be handled in a single 
day and would not be too burdensome. Changing the rest of the schedule, he 
said, would inconvenience all 310 prospective jurors, a move he did not want to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a more impractical thing to disrupt that process . . . 
than to disrupt the courtroom proceeding here," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 310 remaining members of the jury panel are racially diverse -- about 30% 
are people of color, according to statistics kept by the judge -- and have been 
asked to report back in groups to the Downtown Criminal Courts Building 
beginning Oct. 12. All but one group has filled out questionnaires probing the 
prospective jurors' views on an array of topics. Ito and attorneys for both 
sides will follow up with oral questioning when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers and their jury consultants will have most of this week and next to 
review the completed questionnaires. They received the first batch Wednesday, 
along with instructions from Ito that the forms are not to be disseminated and 
must be shredded before any of them are thrown away. Ito will retain his own 
set of the questionnaires and plans to make copies public as jurors are 
impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of individually questioning potential jurors about their biases 
and exposure to press reports could last several weeks. Once it is complete, 
the two sides will move to the hearing on DNA evidence. Prosecutors are 
expected to seek the admission of blood and hair samples taken from the crime 
scene, as well as from Simpson's home and car. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA tests will probably form an important bulwark of the prosecution's 
case because they could establish whether Simpson was at the crime scene and 
whether the suspect tracked blood back to Simpson's home. If so, that could be 
powerful circumstantial evidence against him, but if the DNA tests suggest 
another person's blood, the tests could work just as powerfully in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's legal team is prepared to mount an aggressive challenge to the DNA 
results on several fronts -- suggesting that the blood samples were improperly 
collected and questioning the statistical significance of any purported DNA 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the DNA tests have been completed while others are under way. 
According to sources, results of tests performed on blood droplets found at the 
scene show that they genetically match Simpson's blood. Preliminary DNA tests 
of a bloody glove found at Simpson's mansion suggest the blood of both victims 
but were inconclusive for Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In its controversial report last week, KNBC-TV said DNA tests of a sock 
discovered in Simpson's bedroom matched Nicole Simpson's blood, another 
potentially damaging piece of evidence against the football star. But sources 
have told The Times that only conventional blood analysis has been run so far 
on the sock. Although that test tends to suggest Nicole Simpson as a possible 
source of the blood, it is not nearly as conclusive as a DNA test, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investigators plan to test the sock using DNA analysis, sources said, 
so there may still be DNA results offered on it at some point. The latest batch 
of samples in the Simpson case were forwarded to a laboratory for DNA testing 
this week, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The KNBC reports, which stated that two DNA tests on the sock had been 
completed and that the results had been returned, were contested last week by 
the rare combination of attorneys for both sides and by Ito. Although the 
station at first stood behind its story, in a report aired on the 11 p.m. news 
Tuesday, KNBC acknowledged that there may have been mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "KNBC has been told by some sources that information given to us and reported 
by us is -- in some respect -- factually incorrect," the report said. "But none 
will detail for us specifically what is wrong with our report." 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC said it had accurately reported the information provided by its sources 
and that it relied on people who had previously provided solid information. 
"Now, for the first time, some of them are changing portions of their stories," 
KNBC said. "The real truth may only come out in court." THE SIMPSON CASE. A 
daily update. Trial Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the key events in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson on 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: Having identified 310 potential jurors who may be willing to serve 
on the case, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito announced that he was ending the 
process of individually questioning prospective panelists about hardships. 
Starting Oct. 12, the remaining prospective jurors will begin returning to be 
asked about biases that may make it impossible for some of them to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court action: Ito denied a prosecution request to delay jury selection until 
after a hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the courtroom: KNBC-TV, which has come under fire for a report about 
DNA tests, released a letter to Ito defending its reporting techniques. In a 
report Tuesday, however, the station acknowledged that its sources now say the 
station erred last week.

HOLLINGS SAYS HE'LL BLOCK VOTE ON TRADE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's schedule for enacting a new world trade agreement 
was thrown into chaos Wednesday when an influential senator said he would block 
action on the measure until next year and President Clinton threatened to 
respond by keeping the Senate in session beyond Election Day to force a floor 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and 
Transportation Committee, said there was "no chance at all" that the Senate 
would vote on the trade plan before adjourning because he would block action 
for 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, threatened to thwart Hollings' tactics by calling the Senate 
back into session until the 45 days elapse and the measure goes to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Senate adjourns at the end of next week, as scheduled, and the 
contentious issue remains unresolved, it could carry into the new year, the new 
Congress and a new, potentially time-consuming debate. Those delays could 
undermine confidence in the United States' commitment to liberalized trade 
rules to such an extent that international support for the pact could fall 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected standoff with Hollings jeopardizes the most important issue 
remaining on the President's legislative agenda, one that the White House had 
hoped would help Democratic congressional candidates fend off Republican 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to do whatever I can, within the law, to get this done this year," 
Clinton declared at a news conference with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
at the White House. "I will urge that the Senate stay in session, take a recess 
for the election, come back afterward and pass this." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Wednesday, United We Stand America, Inc., the political organization 
begun by Ross Perot, urged Congress to reject the legislation implementing the 
trade pact, although Perot himself has expressed only skepticism and not 
outright opposition. Perot, who was a presidential candidate in 1992, tried 
vigorously, but unsuccessfully, to block the North American Free Trade 
Agreement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings said Wednesday that his objection was to U.S. trade policy in 
general, rather than to potential threats the trade plan might pose to the 
textile industry in his state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not shilling for a particular industry," he said. "I'm shilling for the 
United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had already tried to mollify complaints from textile 
manufacturers by shifting the way the United States would determine garments' 
countries of origin, to make it harder for China and other low-wage, 
high-production nations to export apparel to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the procedures by which trade legislation is acted on by Congress, 
amendments are prohibited once such measures are formally introduced in the 
House and Senate, as they were Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairmen of the committees to which the legislation is referred may refuse 
for 45 working days to forward it for final congressional action -- the step 
Hollings said he would take to block passage. But Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), 
chairman of the Senate International Trade subcommittee, said he would employ 
other parliamentary maneuvers to free the measure from Hollings' grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials were uncertain whether Hollings was using his threat 
as a ploy to wrest new concessions from the White House, or whether he would 
insist on holding up consideration of the measure regardless of attempts at 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in an unusually public game of chicken between the Democratic White 
House and a Democratic senator with whom Clinton is close, White House 
officials insisted the President would not retreat. U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said in an interview that Clinton has the support of a united 
Democratic leadership in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton makes good on his threat to call the Senate back into session to 
run out the 45-day clock, after which Senate rules would force Hollings to 
release the legislation to the full Senate, a vote would take place before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, negotiated over more than seven years and facing ratification 
by 123 nations, would slash tariffs -- the taxes charged on imports -- by an 
average of 40% and would undo other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas, to 
expanded world trade.

TOP OFFICIAL OF MEXICO'S RULING PARTY IS SLAIN; ASSASSINATION: FRANCISCO RUIZ 
MASSIEU'S DEATH IS THE LATEST INCIDENT IN A MOUNTING WAVE OF VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the second-ranking official of Mexico's ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, was assassinated Wednesday outside a 
downtown hotel in the latest incident in a mounting wave of violence that has 
shaken this nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old lawyer was believed to have been a candidate for the 
politically powerful interior minister post in the Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo, 
who was elected president last month and will take office Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu died in surgery Wednesday morning, an hour after he suffered a 
single shot in the left side of the neck from a machine gun. The bullet exited 
through his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested a suspect in the killing and identified him as Joel or 
Hector Resendiz. He is from Ruiz Massieu's hometown of Acapulco, assistant 
Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu, who is the victim's brother, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive has been established, though many Mexicans are convinced that this 
was another political slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, however, are said to believe that the killing was 
narcotics-related -- a warning to Mario Ruiz Massieu, who heads the federal 
drug enforcement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's assassination was the most recent indication of a growing 
propensity toward violence in this nation, which has prided itself on peace and 
stability. It is the first such incident to occur in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are still investigating the assassination last year in Guadalajara 
of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posados Ocampo and the Tijuana killings of PRI 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and Police Chief Jose Federico 
Benitez earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A rebel uprising that left more than 165 people dead in the southern state of 
Chiapas remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu was killed as he left a breakfast for newly elected federal 
deputies at a PRI building near the fashionable Paseo de la Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that they saw a young man with a burr haircut and 
wearing jeans approach the Buick sedan that Ruiz Massieu was driving as he 
pulled away from the curb in front of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect pulled a machine gun -- one witness said it was an Uzi -- out of a 
newspaper and fired through the windshield on the driver's side of the auto. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu slumped to the right. The suspect tried to keep firing but his 
gun jammed. A bank security guard tackled Resendiz and turned him over to 
federal police when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of prominent politicians, many with their eyes red and swollen, 
gathered at the hospital where doctors had struggled to save Ruiz Massieu's 
life, offering their condolences to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 A stern-faced President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called the slaying an 
"aberrant crime." Zedillo termed it "an aggression against the Mexican people." 
</P>
<P>
 The news sent the Mexican stock exchange index tumbling 3.12%, although it 
rebounded to close down 1.9%, or 53.61 points, at 2,764.82. The peso also 
dropped 2 centavos -- less than 1% -- against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reminder, an almost frustrating one for investors who had been 
waiting on the sidelines until they thought the issues were sorted out, that 
the political issues are not solved," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, president 
of Ecanal, an economic analysis firm in the capital. "This is a specific 
reminder that the political tension has not been eliminated despite the 
election results" that gave the PRI an overwhelming majority in both houses of 
Congress and the narrowest presidential victory in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence, particularly the Colosio and Ruiz Massieu assassinations, is 
widely seen as a graphic indicator of the deep divisions and breakdown of 
discipline within the PRI, which has ruled the country for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's ability to unite the disparate factions that emerged from the 1910 
Revolution -- by its serving as a clearinghouse for political favors -- has 
been threatened by the growing pressure for democratic reforms within the PRI 
and the overall Mexican political system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become the new form of politics, eliminating each other," said 
Homero Aridjis, an author and social critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the months between Mexico's presidential election and the 
inauguration have been notable for backbiting and minor instability as 
politicians jockey for positions in the new government. But that jousting is 
usually nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Ruiz Massieu was to become majority leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies. Unofficially, he and PRI Chairman Ignacio Pichardo were the 
contenders for interior minister in Zedillo's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruiz Massieu represented the younger breed, the least committed to the Old 
Guard," said Ramirez de la O. "Even if Zedillo gets away with imposing his 
choice now, anybody in that position knows that his life is in peril." 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that the motive for the killing was undoubtedly political, 
other analysts were less sure about what message was intended and for whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu "was capable of developing instant political ties and had the 
great political advantage of a bad memory -- he quickly forgot both friends and 
enemies," one party insider said. "He could quickly act as second to any boss. 
I see no reason for eliminating him." 
</P>
<P>
 A former governor of Guerrero, the state where Acapulco is located, Ruiz 
Massieu began working for the government as an official in the federal workers' 
housing program. His career took off during the administration of his former 
professor, Miguel de la Madrid, who named him undersecretary of health. Ruiz 
Massieu was divorced from Salinas' sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu represented the ruling party in the Federal Electoral Institute, 
which ran last month's presidential election -- generally considered the 
cleanest in modern Mexican history. He was secretary general of the PRI and 
"clearly a member of the inner circle," a high government official said.

CHURCH SURVEYS CANDIDATES FOR VOTERS GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's largest church is surveying candidates for local posts this 
election season, asking them pointed questions about controversial issues such 
as homosexuality, euthanasia and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa's unprecedented foray into local politics will 
include distribution of the responses to more than 50,000 people before the 
Nov. 8 election, to highlight which candidates agree with the church's values 
and views. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just tough for the average person to get accurate information . . . (on 
the) moral and family values that we are concerned about," said David Hocking, 
a pastor at Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers and candidates said they have never before heard of a 
church issuing such a questionnaire, though various advocacy groups -- 
including Christian political organizations -- have conducted similar surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they find the questions in the survey troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just real concerned about the marriage of church and state that this 
voters guide appears to be considering," said Harvey Englander, a Huntington 
Beach-based consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jo Ellen Allen, vice-chairwoman of the Orange County Republican Party and 
president of the Eagle Forum of California, said that as long as the church 
does not endorse candidates, she sees no problem with the voters guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches have "the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and . . . how 
they're reflected in public policy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the church is breaking no law by publishing a "voters guide," experts 
said, it appears to take advantage of a loophole in the laws governing 
political activism by tax-exempt organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches are not allowed to endorse candidates, but can circulate educational 
information during campaigns. Unlike advocacy groups that endorse candidates, 
churches are not required to file disclosure forms about money collected or 
spent on politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Petracca, an associate professor of political science at UC Irvine who 
specializes in local government, said he is concerned about accountability when 
tax-exempt groups participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a circumvention mechanism," Petracca said of the surveys. "Their 
intention is not to give voters a guide, but to give support to candidates who 
answer in the way they prefer." 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking denied that the guide is a method of disguising endorsements. "We're 
just going to publish the results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1965, Calvary Chapel is among the largest churches in the United 
States, drawing as many as 50,000 people to services in locations across Orange 
County each Sunday. Headquartered in Santa Ana, the church has spawned 570 
branches around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The church distributed 600 surveys to candidates in the county Sept. 20, 
asking that they be returned within a week. As of Wednesday, 166 candidates had 
responded, Hocking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those running for county offices or city council seats were asked 10 
questions; school board candidates were asked seven. Candidates for some 
special districts also received questionnaires, though there was no 
questionnaire specifically designed for them. 
</P>
<P>
 City council candidates were asked if they would oppose "special legal status 
for homosexuals," "insurance coverage for . . . homosexual partners of 
government employees," "businesses which sell or rent pornographic materials," 
and "removal of (religious) artifacts . . . from public property." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board questionnaire asks candidates if they would oppose 
distribution of condoms on school campuses. It asks if they would support 
abstinence-only sex education, parental consent for abortion and equal access 
for anti-abortion speakers on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters have the right to know where people stand," said Costa Mesa City 
Council candidate Chris Steel, who returned his survey with mostly 'yes' 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking said a booklet containing the results of the survey will be 
distributed at churches throughout the county about two weeks before the 
election.

BAN ON NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING SIGNED; ENVIRONMENT: GOVERNOR APPROVES MEASURE 
TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA COASTLINE. WATERS OFF VENTURA COUNTY WILL BE COVERED FOR 
THE FIRST TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday signed into law a bill to permanently ban new 
offshore oil drilling along California's 1,100-mile coastline, for the first 
time extending protections to waters off Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, called the California Coastal Sanctuary Act of 1994, replaces a 
hodgepodge of current prohibitions for most of the state's shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is particularly timely in three Southern California coastal counties 
-- Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Barbara -- where drilling bans were set to 
expire Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 other counties ranging from Del Norte at the Oregon border to San Mateo, 
drilling could have resumed when pacts ran out in less than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's author, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), said he and 
others had fought for eight years for legislation to permanently protect the 
state's shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 State waters stretch out to sea for three miles until federal jurisdiction 
takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although noting that the uniform ban will protect the entire coastline, 
O'Connell singled out Ventura County as a main beneficiary because it was the 
only one left unprotected by the patchwork of coastal sanctuary laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have a positive impact on Ventura County's tourism and fishing 
industries, and will further enhance the quality of life -- with less air 
pollution, fewer spills and less blight on the coastline," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that Gov. Wilson signed this legislation. It sends a signal that 
our coastline is not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson trumpeted the measure's benefits to the tourism and recreation 
industries, which depend upon unspoiled beaches to draw millions of visitors 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's coast is a treasure that attracts people from around the globe," 
Wilson said in a statement. "Its beauty . . . deserves protection from possible 
damage associated with future offshore oil and gas activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, existing oil and gas drilling may continue. But new 
ventures are banned permanently -- unless the law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's announcement came as a coalition of environmental groups blasted the 
governor for a record it said favored oil companies, campaign contributors and 
developers over the interests of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is trying to do some damage control here," said Michael Paparian, state 
director of the Sierra Club. "His environmental record for the past four years 
has been horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the coalition -- called Californians for Environmental Common 
Sense -- cited the Wilson Administration's response in cleaning up the massive 
Guadalupe oil spill by Unocal in San Luis Obispo County. Local officials 
complain that the cleanup, which started this year, is inadequate and is itself 
harmful to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing the offshore drilling ban was the Western States Petroleum Assn., 
whose spokesman, Bill Duke, warned that the new law will have a chilling effect 
on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're unhappy to see the bill get signed," Duke said. "We think it's bad 
legislation to lock up any natural resource in perpetuity. Because nobody can 
say whether there will be a future shortage."

DNA TEST FREES INMATE AFTER 10 YEARS; JUSTICE: FREDERICK DAYE SPENT A DECADE IN 
VACAVILLE ON KIDNAPING AND RAPE CHARGES. A LAWYER AND A TV REPORTER FOUGHT TO 
WIN HIS RELEASE. 
</P>

<P>
 A 36-year-old barber and ex-Marine who had been in state prison for 10 years 
for rape and kidnaping has been freed after DNA tests proved his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Rene Daye, convicted in 1984 in San Diego Superior Court after being 
identified by the rape victim and a witness, was released from Vacaville state 
prison late Tuesday and quickly caught a plane to Iowa for a joyous reunion 
with his family in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," Daye said as he left the prison. "Who can tell what I 
would have been able to achieve in the 10 years I've been incarcerated?" 
</P>
<P>
 Daye said he plans a lawsuit against his prosecutors. He won his freedom 
thanks to dogged determination by appellate attorney Carmela Simoncini and 
investigative reporter Mark Matthews of the ABC television affiliate in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After Simoncini filed numerous motions on behalf of Daye, prosecutors finally 
agreed to do a type of DNA blood testing that was not available in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Daye's co-defendant, who like Daye was serving a life sentence in 
prison, signed an affidavit saying that Daye was not involved in the crime. The 
same DNA test that cleared Daye confirmed the guilt of the co-defendant, David 
Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA test results were ready Monday and San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
E. Atkins immediately asked a judge to order Daye released. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what I can say to a man who probably is very bitter against the 
criminal justice system," Atkins said. "I'm sad he was convicted, but I'm happy 
we've finally been able to prove he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle and Daye were convicted of rape, kidnaping, auto theft and robbery in 
separate jury trials. Pringle refused to testify at Daye's trial, citing his 
5th Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Daye, who was an ex-convict when he was arrested for the 1984 rape, said he 
wants to get into show business. "I want to be a comic," he said. "I think I'm 
pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
 In Des Moines, Daye's mother, Eunice Ridley, said her son's release is the 
answer to her prayers. "I knew my son was too nice (to be a rapist)," she told 
the Associated Press. "I prayed every day and every night, and went to church 
and prayed. That's all you need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA tests that cleared Daye also pointed to a cousin by marriage of 
Pringle as a possible accomplice of Pringle, according to prosecutors. The 
cousin has never been charged in the crime. All three men and the victim had 
volunteered blood samples, which were matched against blood found on the 
victim's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Daye and Pringle's cousin are similar in appearance, and each has a metallic 
front tooth. Daye's alibi -- that he was with his live-in girlfriend at a 
gathering of military veterans -- did not prove credible to the jury. He was 
also identified by a witness who saw a woman in her early 20s being abducted 
from a pharmacy parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no statute of limitations on kidnaping with the intent to rape, and 
the investigation has been reopened, Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simoncini, who works for Appellate Defenders Inc., a nonprofit corporation 
with a government contract to represent indigent defendants, said she believed 
from the beginning that Daye was innocent. After three motions were denied by 
the courts, she finally persuaded an appeals court to pay $2,000 for a DNA 
test, over the objection of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 That test appeared to clear Daye when the results became known last spring. 
But prosecutors were unsure of the test's validity because the blood sample 
used had come from the trial evidence and age has been known to make such 
samples unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 A second test -- this time with fresh blood samples -- was then undertaken. 
When Daye and Pringle were convicted in 1984, tests could only determine 
whether a defendant had the same blood type as that found in a stain. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, forensic science has evolved so that DNA matches are considered 
nearly incontrovertible, particularly when large amounts of blood are available 
for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 While Simoncini pressed prosecutors to order the second test, Matthews did 
numerous stories on the case, locating Pringle's cousin and conducting an 
emotional interview with Daye in prison. The district attorney's office has 
been under pressure in several high-profile cases in the past year for 
declining to consider evidence that might exonerate a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is incredible," Simoncini said. "This is even better than a reversal or 
an acquittal, especially when it came so long after the fact and after such a 
hard-fought battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Daye said Wednesday that he plans to return to San Diego and file a lawsuit 
alleging that his civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed that someday I'd be free again," Daye said. "This must have 
happened to me because I was being tested to see if I could survive. I just 
want to go to church on Sunday and give thanks to God." 
</P>
<P>
 Daye was arrested two weeks after the rape after being stopped for a traffic 
violation. At first he gave a false identification and was "belligerent," 
Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daye was no stranger to trouble. He had been given a dishonorable discharge 
from the Marine Corps and later served a prison term in Minnesota for robbery.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN, HUFFINGTON TO DEBATE ON 'LARRY 
KING'; THE CANDIDATES AGREE TO APPEAR ON HOURLONG CABLE NEWS NETWORK PROGRAM. 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT BREAKS A LONG STALEMATE IN NEGOTIATIONS.

 Proving that California's U.S. Senate race is one of the nation's hottest 
political contests, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike 
Huffington will have a national audience for their first debate after both 
campaigns accepted an offer Wednesday to appear on the "Larry King Live" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is expected to take place next Thursday evening in the program's 
Washington studios. Officials from the program said, however, they have not 
confirmed the exact time. Still, both campaigns were anxiously preparing for 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an opportunity to take this race . . . beyond the paid 
advertising," said Feinstein adviser Bill Carrick. "All of this stuff in the 
context of his ads has been simplistic little marketing things. This will 
require ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokesman Mark Thiessen responded: "When the voters get to ask 
Dianne Feinstein questions, it's a victory. We want the debates to be as 
freewheeling and as open and involving the people who are going to be making 
the decision as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns said they remain interested in additional debates after King's 
program. But the announcement broke a stalemate in negotiations that had shown 
little progress for several weeks. As a result, the two campaigns appeared a 
bit surprised that the agreement was reached barely a day after the offer was 
made by King's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "She accepted the moment she heard about it," Feinstein spokesman Bill 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour program appeared to be just what the two sides were looking for. 
The campaigns said King has a reputation for fairness as a moderator. 
Huffington officials also said the call-in questions from viewers satisfied 
their requirement that the candidates be subject to public inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us, this is one of the most prominent national races," said Wendy Walker 
Whitworth, senior executive producer of "Larry King Live." "Both candidates are 
extremely high-profile and the issues are controversial -- like crime, 
immigration and education. And they're not only of interest to Los Angeles, but 
the entire country." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the program is based in Washington and broadcast nationwide, 
campaign officials said they expected the California audience would be bigger 
than it would have been under the other debate hosts being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is broadcast around the world on Cable News Network. In 
California, it begins at 6 p.m. It is also simulcast on some radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 King's program has already hosted a Senate debate this year among four 
Virginia candidates including Republican Oliver North and Democrat Sen. Chuck 
Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 The California race has gained increasing national attention recently as the 
battle over whether Democrats will retain control of the Senate has heated up. 
Republican candidates throughout the country have shown unexpected strength in 
opinion polls recently, placing more pressure on all of the Democratic 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 California is still considered a likely Democratic victory on most Washington 
political score cards. But recent polls have found Feinstein and Huffington are 
in a close, if not a dead even, race. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate negotiations between Feinstein and Huffington appeared to be 
stalled after the campaigns issued sharply different proposals. And they 
declined to talk with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has agreed to three late October debates -- one on radio in San 
Francisco, one on television in Los Angeles and another in San Diego. Both 
campaigns said those proposals remain under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign has sought a less traditional format. Earlier this 
month, the GOP nominee offered to debate Feinstein every week for the last 10 
weeks of the race in a different California location. Thiessen said the 
campaign hoped to have a town meeting style debate similar to one that the 
presidential candidates held in 1992. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 40 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Gov. Pete Wilson continued acting on bills sent to 
him by the Legislature before its Aug. 31 adjournment. The Brown campaign began 
airing a television ad accusing Wilson of mismanaging state government. The 
Peace Officers Research Assn. of California also announced sponsorship of an ad 
supporting Brown because, among other things, "Kathleen Brown will enforce the 
death penalty." Airing of the ad has not been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Wilson again will be signing and vetoing bills in his 
Sacramento office. Brown is scheduled to address a voter registration rally at 
San Jose State University. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Huffington were 
in Washington. Feinstein battled for passage of her Desert Protection Act. 
Huffington's wife, Arianna, was host of a $35-per-plate fund-raiser for women 
supporters of the campaign in Los Angeles that drew about 1,300 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Both candidates will remain in Washington today. 
</P>

INFANT DEATH RATE REACHES NEW LOW IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The infant death rate in California declined to its lowest rate ever in 1993, 
6.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual number of infants who died in 1993 during the first year of their 
lives was 3,970, the lowest since 1915, when the state's population was only 
2.9 million, slightly larger than the current population of San Diego County. 
There were 584,483 live births during 1993, according to data released by the 
department Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past five years, the infant death rate has declined consistently, 
from 8.5 (per thousand) in 1989 to 6.8 this past year," said Gayle Wilson, wife 
of the governor, who released the figures with state Health Director Kim 
Belshe. "Preventive health care and education are working." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the infant death rates in Los Angeles and Orange counties increased 
somewhat in 1993. The Los Angeles County rate went from 7.2 per thousand to 
7.3, and the rate in Orange County increased from 5.4 to 5.9. The latter 
increase, although apparently large, most likely represented a statistical 
correction from the preceding year, when the Orange County rate dropped 
dramatically, said Dr. Rugmini Shaw, chief of the state department's maternal 
and child health branch. "I wouldn't consider that significant," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Los Angeles County nor Orange County health officials had seen the new 
report and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 One disturbing note in the report was the infant death rate for African 
Americans. Although the rate dropped from 16.7 to 15.5 deaths per thousand, it 
remained more than twice the rate for whites of 6.2 per thousand. That ratio 
has remained more or less constant since 1989. The rate for Latinos remained 
constant at 6.4 per thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the infant death rate among African Americans remains unacceptably 
high, I am encouraged by the rate's decline," Belshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 report by a blue-ribbon committee appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson 
attributed the disparity in death rates to "long-term deplorable conditions in 
the African American community," including poverty, unemployment, substandard 
housing, single-parent households and lack of access to medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The California rate was the lowest among the 10 largest states in 1993, and 
was well below the U.S. rate of 8.3 per thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Wilson attributed the decreases in death rates, in part, to BabyCal, a 
multimedia campaign to encourage pregnant women to seek prenatal care and avoid 
alcohol, tobacco and drugs. The state has also provided special funds to 
improve birth outcomes for black mothers-to-be in selected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Irwin Silberman, director of family health programs at the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health Services, recently attributed the bulk of the 
decline to the expansion in Medi-Cal services, which gave more women access to 
care. He also noted that more physicians had agreed to accept Medi-Cal 
patients, which lessened the burden on public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The death rate decline has been steady. In 1970, the California rate was 17.2 
deaths per thousand, and in 1950 it was 24.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 38 largest counties in California, the rate ranged from a low of 4 
per thousand in San Mateo County to 11.8 in Mendocino County. The number of 
deaths in the other counties was too small for reliable measurements.

STATE SETS NEW SAFEGUARDS FOR MONO LAKE; ENVIRONMENT: BIOLOGIST WHO STUDIED THE 
AREA 50 YEARS AGO HAILS THE DECISION, WHICH CUTS OFF A LONGTIME SOURCE OF L.A. 
WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, a young state biologist named Eldon Vestal fell in love with 
Mono Lake. Just out of college, he meticulously studied the Eastern Sierra lake 
made famous by Mark Twain, took measurements of its tributary streams and 
documented plants and animals that depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
 When transferred to another part of the state, Vestal packed his notes away in 
cardboard boxes. They would not be opened for four decades, until environmental 
lawyers sought proof of the damage inflicted on the ecosystem by diverting the 
streams to the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The yellowed field notes became critical evidence in lawsuits against the city 
that ultimately led Wednesday to a decision by the State Water Resources 
Control Board to order new environmental protections for the ancient brine lake 
east of Yosemite National Park. The order effectively brings to an end, at 
least for the next 20 years, any substantial diversion of water from the Mono 
Lake basin to Los Angeles, 300 miles south, and defuses one of the state's most 
protracted environmental fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before the board recorded its 5-0 vote, the biologist, now hobbled by 
age and hard of hearing, made his way to the front of the room to talk about 
protecting Mono Lake, a step he had dreamed about but thought would never 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Los Angeles was a tremendous political power over the years," 
Vestal said, "and challenging it seemed like grabbing for a bite out of the 
moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, environmentalists and politicians characterized the board's action not 
only as one of their greatest victories but as a decision that symbolized the 
state's new attitudes toward water resources and their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, the growing needs of a burgeoning populace seemed to eclipse 
concerns about a small lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada and the wildlife and 
communities that depended upon it," said Sen. Tim Leslie (R-Carnelian Bay), who 
represents the Mono Lake area. "Today, the state stands ready to recognize the 
failings of the policy we set years ago and make amends for the decisions of 
our past." 
</P>
<P>
 Mono Lake, a landlocked body of salt water surrounded by high desert and 
formations of volcanic debris, is the nesting home to many bird species, 
including the California sea gull. Mark Twain wrote in his book "Roughing It" 
about spending time on one of the lake's nesting islands in the late 1800s. 
"Half a dozen mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake, but not a stream of any kind 
flows out of it," Twain wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a staff report that blamed decades of stream diversion for causing 
extensive environmental damage, the board ordered that Mono Lake be allowed to 
rise to a new elevation of 6,391 feet, 16 feet higher than the average level it 
reaches today. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the lake rises at least two feet, the board directed that the city of 
Los Angeles be prohibited from taking any water from the streams that tumble 
down from the Sierra. After that, the board said, Los Angeles could take 
minimal amounts, probably averaging no more than 12,000 acre-feet a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board estimated it would take 20 years for the landlocked lake, surrounded 
by high desert and ancient volcanic debris, to rise to its targeted level. Once 
that occurs, Los Angeles can only divert an average of 30,800 acre-feet 
annually, less than a third of what the city once took from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, relying in part on historical evidence provided by Vestal's 
notes, have argued in lawsuits and in nationwide publicity campaigns that those 
diversions had caused the lake to drop 26 feet and endangered the habitat of 
dozens of species. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing certain defeat, Los Angeles officials announced early Wednesday that 
they would accept the board's decision and had reached an agreement with 
environmentalists to end 16 years of litigation over Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a longtime advocate for the restoration of 
Mono Lake, said the city's action reflected a change of attitude among 
officials and their determination to increase urban water supplies without 
harming the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think virtually everybody recognizes that conditions today are 
different than they were when (William) Mulholland was out building the water 
system," she said, referring to the water engineer who spearheaded efforts to 
use water from the eastern Sierra to fuel Los Angeles' growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Water and Power General Manager Bill McCarley said the city 
would rely eventually on reclaimed waste water to replace some of the water 
formerly taken from Mono Lake. But he acknowledged that the board's decision 
will cause the city to continue to rely heavily on the Metropolitan Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the permanent loss of Mono Lake water would drive up 
costs if the city is forced to use more expensive water to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody in the state has to realize that water as a resource, as a 
commodity, is not going to be as inexpensive as it has been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's new attitude drew praise from U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 
Commissioner Daniel P. Beard, who said it had almost come too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "All parties have come to the realization that many serious environmental 
mistakes were made when we constructed the water projects upon which our urban 
and agricultural sectors now depend," he said. "Not surprisingly, some have 
been reluctant to confront those mistakes. We almost lost Mono Lake because of 
that reluctance."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: SENDING A MESSAGE WITH INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a familiar sound to the public debate over the anti-illegal 
immigration measure on the Nov. 8 ballot, a sound that we've heard in previous 
fights over "message" initiatives. You can hear the electorate telling 
opposition leaders to go jump off a long pier -- or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true with the less controversial "three strikes" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also another familiar sound -- the sound of the opposition in an 
initiative battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case -- especially regarding the illegal immigration proposal -- 
opponents are trying to reason with voters by saying this particular initiative 
is badly flawed. Yes, there is a definite problem that must be solved, they 
say, but this proposal isn't the answer. It hasn't been thought out. It goes 
too far and in the wrong direction. And it would cost billions in tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy -- support the goal, but pick apart the proposal, especially on 
fiscal grounds -- usually works when voters view the ballot proposition as 
complex. When in doubt, they vote no. Several initiatives come to mind: School 
vouchers last year, "Big Green" in 1990, most insurance reforms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it's an emotional issue, one voters react to viscerally, they tend to 
discount the campaign rhetoric -- and the civic leaders, the commentators and 
the editorial writers -- and go with their gut. The best example may be 
Proposition 13, the property tax cutter of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "When voters are looking to send a message, it's harder to pick apart 
initiatives," notes Stu Mollrich, one of the Proposition 13 strategists. "And 
voters this year really want to put illegal immigration on the national radar 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I called some voters who recently had been surveyed by The Times Poll and had 
said they wouldn't mind talking to a reporter. The poll had found likely voters 
supporting the anti-illegal immigration measure, Proposition 187, by a 
landslide margin of 62% to 28%. They were backing the "three strikes" 
initiative, Proposition 184, by 59% to 29%. (Prodded by 184, Sacramento has 
enacted a similar law.) 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to know why voters were dismissing the arguments of the opposition 
campaigns, especially the main arguments about huge losses in tax dollars. 
Opponents of 187 warn that the measure could cost the state $15 billion 
annually in federal revenue because California would be in violation of federal 
law. Los Angeles city schools alone could lose $450 million, they say. As for 
184, opponents contend, its tougher sentencing could double the prison 
population and cost many billions, meaning likely cutbacks in education 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're blowing smoke basically," said Cliff Powell, 34, a Eureka 
warehouseman who is trying to start a home mail order business. "The federal 
government is blackmailing us (on 187)." 
</P>

 Powell, like most of those interviewed, doubted that the Clinton 
Administration would ever cut off federal funds to California. Not with 
President Clinton facing reelection in two years and needing to carry the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Won't that make a beautiful political picture," said Dr. Paul Bedell, 57, a 
Camarillo physician. "People who think (politics) doesn't make much difference 
will say, 'My God, the federal government is suing the state, saying it has to 
spend money on illegal immigrants! That's why we can't maintain our highways 
and bridges, buy airplanes to spray water on fires, prepare for earthquakes 
that are bound to occur.' "

 Pat Lovejoy, 48, is a Torrance computer teacher who works at home and listens 
to a lot of talk radio. "This fellow called in to say he's had relatives 
sitting in Canada for x number of years waiting to come here, while everyone 
else just walks on in," she said. "Hey, I don't know what the solution is, but 
let's try this (187) for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Washington's threat to cut off funds, she said: "I'd be willing to 
bargain with them a bit. They're not going to want to be thrown out of office." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie McDaniel, 43, a Garden Grove mother who does volunteer work, said she'd 
be willing to pay higher taxes to jail more criminals. She's particularly 
incensed that the man convicted of attempted murder after stabbing Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter seven years ago has been paroled from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Pettit, 35, a Long Beach mailman, said it may be "ludicrous" to imprison 
for life the three-time loser who recently stole a slice of pizza from four 
children on the Redondo Beach Pier. "But I'll vote for (184) until we can get 
our judicial system worked around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for 187, he commented: "It's one of those things that's a drastic move. 
We're trying to say something. It may not be perfect, but it's on the right 
track." 
</P>
<P>
 And all these voters' message to the politicians: If you don't like the way we 
deal with problems, deal with them yourselves first.

8 OPPOSITION PARTIES JOIN TO TAKE ON JAPAN COALITION; POLITICS: NEW GROUP, 
REFORM, HAS 187 MEMBERS -- JUST 14 FEWER THAN THE LEADING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a step aimed at establishing two-party politics in Japan, eight opposition 
parties Wednesday registered in Parliament as a unified negotiating group to 
deal with Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's tripartite coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group, named Reform, contains 187 members of the powerful lower house 
of Parliament -- 14 fewer than the number in the Liberal Democratic Party that 
is now the major prop of the Murayama coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The move toward amalgamation by followers of former Prime Ministers Toshiki 
Kaifu, Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata and five other parties binds the 
group to acting as a single bloc in conducting deliberations and voting in 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "new-new party" because six of its eight groups were formed in the 
last two years, Reform declared that it will establish a full-fledged party by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuriko Koike, deputy of Hosokawa's Japan New Party, predicted that at least 
two or three more elections will be necessary to put into shape a two-party 
system. And even then, it may not happen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that a new-new-new party will emerge as a third force," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after she spoke, four Hosokawa followers, plus a member of Murayama's 
Socialist Party, announced that they will form their own parliamentary 
negotiating body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moves toward forming the new party are based on old logic that politics means 
power, and power comes from numbers . . . not democratic and grass-roots 
principles," the group, led by Banri Kaieda, a freshman legislator, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In still another move, a group of 50 conservative-leaning Socialists, while 
pledging to remain in Murayama's coalition, established a "study group" 
dedicated to "social liberalism" that would offer a "third path" alternative to 
Reform and the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to name a leader who would become candidate for prime minister, Reform 
has also failed so far to come up with clear-cut policies that would 
distinguish it from the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The former perennial rulers of Japan remain the "party to beat," especially 
now that political reforms enacted this year will transform the next 
lower-house election into battles for single seats in each constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, voters in each district elected an average of four representatives 
-- a system that promoted proliferation of political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform pledged to rid Japan of its "one-nation pacifism" -- the longstanding 
post-World War II thinking that Japan need concern itself only with its own 
peace -- and make positive contributions to the world, carry out administrative 
reform and ease government regulations. The platform differs in nuance from the 
Murayama coalition only in the degree to which Japan would dispatch troops 
overseas to participate in U.N. peace-keeping missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, the instigator of a rebellion that toppled the Liberal Democrats 
in 1993 who served as chief strategist for former Prime Ministers Hosokawa and 
Hata, was named to Reform's No. 2 post. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa -- one of Japan's most assertive and therefore controversial leaders -- 
will have the final say in nominating candidates for the next lower-house 
election expected late next year or in 1996.

AMERICAN ALBUM: ALASKAN PLAIN IS A KILLING GROUND FOR CARIBOU; WILDLIFE 
BIOLOGISTS ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN SUDDEN DIE-OFF IN HERD'S POPULATION. 
THOUSANDS ARE MISSING AND PRESUMED DEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wildlife experts are trying to unscramble the kind of mystery that unfolds 
only in Alaska, where herds of great animals can wander through the wilderness 
for months without ever encountering civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery surfaced this summer when biologists with the Alaska Department of 
Fish and Game discovered that around 3,000 caribou were missing and presumed 
dead from the herd that grazes on the flat coastal plains of Bristol Bay 
several hundred miles west of Anchorage. The herd normally numbers about 
15,000, so the missing caribou amounted to a significant percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 But more troubling than the decline was the fact that there seemed to be no 
apparent reason for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really puzzling," said state wildlife biologist Dick Sellers, who 
monitors the Alaska Peninsula's northern herd. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Pitcher, a state wildlife supervisor, said, "We just got smacked between 
the eyes with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Any decline in caribou population is of concern to wildlife experts because 
herds have been known to suddenly "crash," dwindling from tens of thousands to 
a few hundred in just a few seasons. But usually there are ample warning signs, 
such as a decline in calving or a particularly harsh winter. That was not the 
case this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The caribou, called reindeer in many other parts of the world, is an important 
food source for Alaskan natives who live in remote villages scattered across 
the far north. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other members of the deer family, both the male and female caribou grow 
antlers. The bull caribou -- which can weigh several hundred pounds -- produces 
a majestic set of horns that sweep several feet over his head and arch forward. 
The antlers on the female are much smaller, but the female is generally 
healthier and more robust than the male, according to wildlife experts. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one reason Sellers and Pitcher were so surprised by what they found in 
the field this summer. Radio collars are attached to some members of the herd 
each year to help monitor the migration of the animals across hundreds of miles 
of Alaskan wilderness, and 30 females in the herd were so equipped. 
</P>
<P>
 But when biologists were surveying the herd this summer, they were astonished 
to learn that 10 of the 30 collared animals were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly troubling was the fact that 16 of the 30 were collared in April, 
and they appeared to be in good health at that time, Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four of the 16 were dead by the end of June," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said spring came a little late to that remote area of Alaska, so the 
willows and dwarf birch and lichen that the caribou feed on were a little late 
developing, but the 16 caribou captured and collared in April showed no sign of 
disease or nutritional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a vet with us, and if there was anything wrong with them, he would 
have been able to pick up on it," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals had been dead several months by the time the biologists found 
them, so it was impossible in most cases to determine the cause. In two cases, 
the caribou appeared to have been killed by predators, probably wolves and 
bears, and a third was apparently killed by a hunter, but there wasn't a clue 
as to what killed the other seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers and his colleagues plan to monitor the herd closely, because they know 
how rapidly the numbers can decline. One herd that stays on the southern part 
of the Alaska Peninsula went into a precipitous decline in the mid-1980s, 
dropping from 10,000 animals to fewer than 2,000. Sellers believes poor grazing 
conditions caused that decline, and only recently has the herd begun a slight 
recovery. The number this year was up to 2,100, still a small herd compared to 
what it was just a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Both herds are relatively small compared to the vast populations that migrate 
across the northernmost parts of the state. There are believed to be 700,000 
caribou in Alaska today, with the largest herd concentrated in the extreme 
northwest part of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 They tend to shy away from populated areas, although great herds of thousands 
of caribou can still be seen by those traveling to some of the most isolated 
parts of the state. And while the numbers are still high, gone are the days 
when, old-timers will tell you, "millions" of caribou would wander across a 
highway, tying up traffic for days.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; PRO-ARISTIDE DEMONSTRATORS WOUNDED; U.S. TROOPS 
INTERVENE; HAITI: SHOTS ARE FIRED BY MEMBERS OF THE PARAMILITARY AS CROWD 
GATHERS OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT, WHERE AMNESTY FOR MILITARY RULERS WAS TO BE 
DEBATED.

<P>
 They were chanting for both reconciliation and the condemnation of Haiti's 
military leaders when the shots rang out, ripping into the crowd of hundreds of 
pro-democracy Haitian demonstrators and tearing through the chest of mortuary 
worker Sinclair Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators had just left the thousands who had gathered for hours 
outside the Haitian Parliament on Wednesday afternoon as it met to consider a 
general amnesty for military crimes just like this one -- bullets fired at 
unarmed civilians by a wing of Haiti's dreaded paramilitary apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a moment of fury. Joseph clearly was critically wounded, as were 
some others, and the crowd was about to become a mob. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a U.S. Army unit moved in, blocking all the streets around the 
nearby headquarters of the paramilitary force -- the protesters' apparent 
target -- and blaring through loudspeakers polite warnings to stay back. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the demonstrators regrouped and started up another chant: 
"Killing or no killing, the amnesty will go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Such, it seemed, was the mood of forgiveness among the Haitians in the 
capital's streets on Wednesday: guarded, though apparently sincere, support for 
the amnesty on what most hoped was the eve of the end of their three-year 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 There were taunts and jibes, to be sure. Their targets were members of 
Parliament who have backed Haiti's army chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, in the 
coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In ragged T-shirts and baseball caps, some of the throng shouted voodoo curses 
as they blocked the passage of late-model Jeeps bearing parliamentarians in 
fine dark suits -- delaying their arrival for the legislative session, which 
began more than two hours late. Others denounced them as zenglodo , a Creole 
word for invaders who rob and kill at night. 
</P>
<P>
 But none called for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this amnesty is nothing," said Maurice Marcelin, 26, an unemployed 
university graduate with degrees in engineering and telecommunications who had 
been chiding the military-backed legislators for destroying Haiti's economy and 
dimming his own future. 
</P>
<P>
 "God tells us we should give a pardon," he said. "Look, when you have a child 
who makes a mistake, you talk to him. You forgive him. And then you go on. So 
it is good to pardon people even when they have done such things to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the throng, Jonas Thelumas was more pragmatic. He too complained 
about unemployment, unofficially estimated at more than 80%. "We are young 
people. We have gone to school, and now we have nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked about the amnesty under consideration inside the 30-year-old 
Parliament building, Thelumas said: "This is good, because it is a means to an 
end. I'm happy not so much about the amnesty but that after that something good 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 That "something good" was also reflected in the daylong chants of "Vive 
Aristide!" After three years of exile in the United States, the Roman Catholic 
priest, who was elected in December, 1990, is due to return after Cedras and 
Haiti's other military rulers step down -- by Oct. 15, the deadline set by the 
agreement with former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Whitner, who also spent Wednesday afternoon near the barbed-wire cordon 
around Parliament, clearly was among the core of Aristide supporters known as 
lavalas , a Creole word that roughly means a deluge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Together! Together! We will prepare the day," declared the poster bearing 
Aristide's photograph that Whitner held as he spoke firmly but gently about 
what he hopes that day will hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people in the military must answer for what they have done, because 
they have spilled so much of our blood in these three years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shall be justice, but it must not be violent justice. Our priest, 
President Aristide, knows how to bring this justice according to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitner also echoed most of the crowd in his anger at what the last three 
years have wrought. "There must be some justice, because every day, when you 
leave your house here, you see two or three dead people in the street. They 
whip your sisters, your brothers disappear, and your friends are left to die in 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 In this street, a few feet away, 11-year-old Ilfranc Joseph, an orphan from 
one of Port-au-Prince's many slums, was in fact dying. He had been in a bus 
accident, was mistreated at a local hospital and now had lain for several hours 
half-naked beneath a plastic sheet, his stomach ballooning with infection in 
the broiling sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. David C. Meade, deputy commander of U.S. forces here, happened by. 
Within minutes, a dozen American soldiers clambered over the wire with a 
stretcher, lifted the boy onto it and carried him to a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was stunned. After the soldiers left, a frantic woman grabbed a 
reporter on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen an army do such a thing in my life," she said with awe. 
"Your army in America actually helps people? Here, we will be happy if only 
they just go away. That's why the people support the amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this thing I just saw your American soldiers do, this is something beyond 
our dreams. Is this what democracy means?"

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; QUIET ALGERIAN AWAITS HIS CUE IN HAITI; DIPLOMACY: 
LAKDHAR BRAHIMI, BOUTROS-GHALI'S TROUBLE-SHOOTER, WILL BE IN CHARGE WHEN U.N. 
PEACEKEEPERS TAKE OVER FROM THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When U.N. peacekeepers take over the Haiti mission from the United States in 
six months or so, the most powerful foreign official in Haiti will be an 
ascetic-looking, soft-spoken Algerian who has become Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali's favorite trouble-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 As Boutros-Ghali's new special representative for Haiti, 60-year-old Lakdhar 
Brahimi has a title that sounds innocuous. But his is the single most important 
post in any U.N. peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, will be in charge of the entire 
operation, with the authority even to veto decisions by the military commander 
of the 6,000 troops in the U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little more than a year, Brahimi, who is not a regular U.N. bureaucrat, 
has served Boutros-Ghali as a special envoy or special representative to Zaire, 
South Africa, Yemen and Liberia. Although his work is completed only in South 
Africa, Brahimi will give up all other duties and devote himself entirely to 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials worked with him closely in Zaire as he tried to mediate a 
bitter political conflict that was pushing the country close to chaos. His work 
draws high praise from U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brahimi had a significant impact in getting the parties together," said an 
admiring U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
 The only complaint from the Americans was that Boutros-Ghali, in their view, 
sent Brahimi off to other trouble spots too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Brahimi signifies a reversal of policy for Boutros-Ghali in 
organizing a U.N. mission that will take over from the American-run mission. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, the only precedent, Boutros-Ghali gave in to American pressure and 
appointed an American as special representative -- retired Adm. Jonathan Howe, 
personally selected for the job by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Somalia mission turned into a debacle, officials in Washington put 
all the blame on Boutros-Ghali, even though he had given Howe full rein to run 
things in Mogadishu. In Haiti, Boutros-Ghali has clearly put his own man in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. sources, the Clinton Administration is pressuring the 
secretary general to put an American commander in charge of the military force. 
U.S. troops are expected to make up half the total force. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali, according to these same sources, was strongly against this 
several weeks ago because he did not want the U.N. peacekeeping mission to be 
confused with any American military operation that invaded Haiti forcibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Americans have landed in Haiti peacefully, the sources said, 
Boutros-Ghali is more amenable to the idea of naming an American military 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahimi is looked on as a leading practitioner of what the U.N. calls 
"preventive diplomacy" -- the art of negotiating a settlement before a conflict 
breaks out rather than afterward. Perhaps that is why he is so little known in 
the United States. He is not a high-profile U.N. official. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diplomacy is at its very, very best in preventive diplomacy," Brahimi said in 
a recent interview. "The best that can happen to you is that no one notices 
what you do. And since nobody sees anything, why should anyone say thank you? 
When a problem appears, then you have failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brahimi has had a long and distinguished diplomatic career. He served as 
Algeria's foreign minister from 1991 to 1993 and began his diplomatic work, in 
fact, during the Algerian war of independence, acting as the ambassador to 
Southeast Asia of the National Liberation Front from 1956 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the newly independent Algerian government named him ambassador to Egypt 
and then to Britain. From 1981 to 1984, he was the diplomatic adviser to 
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. From 1984 to 1991, he was the 
undersecretary general of the League of Arab States. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali named him special envoy to Zaire in July, 1993; special 
representative to South Africa in December, 1993; special envoy to Yemen in 
June, 1994, and a special envoy to Liberia in July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with the problems in many countries where he served, Brahimi said 
he faced limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have is your personal skill and some moral authority," he said. "I 
have no money and no army."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; PANEL BACKS DEADLINE FOR TROOPS; HAITI: HOUSE MEASURE 
AUTHORIZES U.S. PRESENCE UNTIL MARCH 1. GOP HAD SOUGHT EARLIER PULLOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress took the first step Wednesday toward limiting President Clinton's 
authority to deal with the crisis in Haiti, as the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee approved a resolution authorizing the presence of U.S. forces there 
only until March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was backed on a 27-18 vote along party lines after a spirited 
debate in which both sides made it clear that they still have deep reservations 
about the Haiti mission. Democrats succeeded in turning back efforts by House 
Republicans to support an even earlier deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while the House seems certain to vote for a withdrawal date before 
Congress adjourns for the year next week, Clinton's supporters said they hoped 
that a confrontation will be avoided in the Senate, where the sentiment for 
setting a mandatory deadline appears to be dissipating in the face of strong 
opposition from the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people still want to get out of Haiti as quickly as possible, but the 
argument that setting a deadline would undermine both the mission and the 
morale of the troops is beginning to gain ground," said a senior Republican 
foreign policy aide, who predicted that the Senate will end up "fudging" the 
issue by calling for an early withdrawal in a non-binding resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Many senators had initial misgivings over what they believed was an 
ill-defined and overly ambitious mission. But the fact that the deployment has 
gone "very smoothly over the first week has taken some of the air out of the 
balloon," and there is less momentum to confront Clinton with a "hard and fast" 
deadline, said a Democratic aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of "another Somalia" drove the congressional debate over Haiti last week, 
as lawmakers voiced alarm that an incident like last October's slaying of 18 
Army Rangers by Somali gunmen could occur in Haiti. Members of both parties, 
however, said they have been swayed by the arguments made by senior Pentagon 
officials over the last several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, Deputy 
Defense Secretary John M. Deutch and Lt. Gen. John J. Sheehan, director of 
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. commanders would lose the 
tactical and psychological advantage they now have in Haiti if, in Sheehan's 
words, "the enemies of democracy . . . know that all they have to do is blend 
into the background and wait 30, 60 or 90 days" for U.S. troops to leave. The 
two men made similar arguments before a House panel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although support for the mission is still thin, "we are starting to see a 
bipartisan approach that would not put our troops in peril by setting a date 
certain for their withdrawal," said Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to do anything to increase the risk to our troops," agreed Sen. 
Carl Levin (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the House, however, was more jumpy. Most lawmakers still insist on 
an opportunity to set a deadline for withdrawing the troops before adjourning 
to confront an electorate with whom Clinton's decision to occupy Haiti remains 
unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to set a date, and the only question is whether it's March 1 or 
sooner," a House Foreign Affairs Committee aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution adopted Wednesday contains no funding cutoff to force 
compliance, it has a provision providing for an expedited vote as early as Feb. 
1 to force termination of the mission within 30 days if Congress feels the 
Administration is not making sufficient progress toward a troop withdrawal by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 It also orders Clinton to provide Congress with three "progress reports" on 
the Haiti mission between now and Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This defines the limited role to be played by U.S. forces and gives the 
President a reasonable time to complete the mission," said committee Chairman 
Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
 A committee aide described the resolution as an attempt to preserve some 
degree of flexibility for Clinton while giving Democrats the "political cover 
they are demanding" in case the mission goes awry during the recess.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; SOME HAITIANS DETAINED IN CUBA PREPARE TO GO HOME -- 
AS POLICEMEN; REFUGEES: MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE VOLUNTEERED FOR THE FORCE. BUT 
MOST AT GUANTANAMO ARE WARY OF RETURNING.

 A year ago, Louissant Nesly was afraid to so much as glance in the direction 
of his local police station, for fear of drawing a beating by the uniformed 
thugs who controlled Haiti. Now he is in training here to be a policeman 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what bad policing is like," said Nesly, 30, explaining why he is one 
of 435 Haitians at Guantanamo who volunteered for training. The U.S. Justice 
Department, which is running the operation, says it hopes to train a total of 
800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesly fled Haiti last month on a makeshift boat, hoping to start a new life in 
the United States. A U.S. Coast Guard cutter intercepted him, and he was 
brought to a holding camp here sheltering about 14,000 Haitians, with the 
intention that they would be allowed to return to Haiti after U.S. pressure 
drove out the military leaders who had ousted Haiti's elected president in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an imminent U.S. invasion, Haiti's generals agreed to step aside by 
Oct. 15 in favor of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is in exile in 
Washington. And a growing number of Haitians here, buoyed by the presence of 
U.S. troops in Haiti to keep order during the transition, are choosing to 
abandon the hot, dusty tent city for their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nesly, many will return as police officers. Gay Jean-Michelet, 34, said 
his best friend was killed by plainclothes police thugs. That inspired him to 
enter the police training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police in Haiti are not trained in civility," he said. "But the Americans 
must understand that we want real work. We are not toys. We want to be real 
policemen." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the vast majority of Haitians are not prepared to return to Haiti in 
any capacity, at least not until Aristide returns to the country as scheduled 
next month, and the military coup leaders are stripped of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm staying here until I'm certain the country is secure," said Francoise 
Gabrielle, 36, who still bears the scars under her left eye of an encounter 
with police that caused her to flee Haiti in a sailboat in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the U.S. pledge to disarm the security forces that have terrorized 
Haiti since the coup three years ago, the majority of refugees interned here on 
Cuba's southeast coast have not decided whether to stay or go. 
</P>
<P>
 Here they are covered by canvas and fed three times a day, and they spend long 
hours fighting boredom and depression. At home, especially if they lived in the 
countryside and beyond the reach of U.S. soldiers, they could be fighting for 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who go now are taking a chance," said Mettelus Dumerci, 37. "What 
happens after Aristide leaves office in a few months?" 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's term officially ends in February, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who have volunteered for the 180-mile ride home aboard a U.S. 
Coast Guard cutter say they found life here even worse than in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state I'm in, I have to go," said Duradis Presler, 25. "The food, the 
smelly latrines -- I'm going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration hopes that all the Haitians interned here choose to 
return, for whatever reason. It has vowed that neither the Haitians nor the 
30,000 Cubans quartered in a nearby tent city will enter the United States from 
Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 But camp officials, both U.S. military chiefs and Haitians elected by their 
fellow refugees, admit that many are prepared to endure the harsh life of 
boredom here in hopes of a policy change by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy Avril, 36, an elected member of the Camp No. 6 Council, says his goal is 
to reach the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all those who want to go back are there, then a small group of us will 
remain," he said. "By being a leader here, we are showing the Americans we 
would make good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is to be a waiting game, American officials here hope that they will 
win it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let the camp leaders watch the news on TV," said Army Col. Dan Watkins, 
who oversees the Haitian camp. "And when they see Aristide back in Haiti, that 
may change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 So far there have been no reports of reprisals in Haiti against those who have 
chosen to return. But for many in the camps, that's not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll stay here for the rest of my life," said Francois Colas, 33. "That's a 
long time, but I don't want to get killed."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; IN CONTRAST TO SOMALIA, WHITE HOUSE IS LETTING 
MILITARY CALL SHOTS IN HAITI; OCCUPATION: OFFICIALS SAY ADMINISTRATION'S 
APPROACH DOES NOT AFFECT MERELY TOP COMMANDERS. IT MEANS MORE IMPROVISING BY 
TROOPS ON THE GROUND. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton is doing something in Haiti that he did not do during the 
U.S. intervention in Somalia: He is letting the military be the military. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say that in marked contrast to the Somalia venture, Washington 
is stepping back and leaving the military operation to its generals and 
admirals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that may cause some nervous moments for top Clinton Administration 
officials, it has given the military far more latitude than it has had in 
previous operations not only at the top levels of command but also among squad 
leaders and sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, has meant far more on-the-spot improvisation, both by senior 
commanders and by soldiers and Marines in the field, concede officials familiar 
with the Haiti operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for example, after the Port-au-Prince police beat a Haitian 
civilian to death, it was Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, the U.S. commander in Haiti, 
rather than Administration officials, who decided to assign U.S. military 
police to oversee the Haitian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and the Pentagon's civilian leadership essentially went along. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, the military delayed the departure of a contingent of Marines 
until next month, to avoid giving the appearance that Washington agreed with 
accusations by the Haitian army chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, that U.S. troops 
had been committing "atrocities." 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials say the broad latitude for the generals stems from several 
factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike the U.S. venture in Somalia, the Haiti operation is entirely 
American-run, so U.S. commanders have not had to tailor their actions to fit 
the demands of U.N. officials -- which had been a major constraint in 
Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 * Planning for the Haiti venture was meticulous, with major units and their 
weapons packaged as separate components that could be interchanged and shifted 
as the situation required, giving field commanders added flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the U.S. troops now in Haiti -- particularly the Army's 10th 
Mountain Division -- served in Somalia and have experience with such 
peacekeeping operations. One lesson that the Army learned: Keep ordinary combat 
troops away from day-to-day policing duties. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the wider discretion now being afforded to military commanders -- 
combined with the rapidly changing situation in Haiti -- has led to occasional 
confusion and a few inconsistencies in the way U.S. troops respond. 
</P>
<P>
 During the beating incident last week, for example, while U.S. troops in that 
part of Haiti were forced to do nothing more than watch, American soldiers in 
another part of the island nation, using the same rules of engagement, were 
permitted to step in and halt such excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, however, the effort has gone fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the broad autonomy being given U.S. troops is the case of U.S. Army 
Staff Sgt. Tony Campbell, whose contingent of MPs was assigned to "build a 
rapport" with the Haitian police in an effort to curb their abuses and turn 
them into a professional force. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's orders were so vague they were almost unmilitary. "I was pretty 
much told I could do anything I want to improve relations with them," he 
recalls. He says his commander told him: "If you guys need to use some 
ingenuity to bond with these people, just go and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Campbell threw away the manual. On Tuesday, it was lunch: The MPs 
and their Haitian counterparts shared a midday meal prepared by the wife of the 
Haitian commander. On Wednesday, it was a volleyball game between Campbell's 
men and the Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 And each day since, the 11-year veteran said, he has tried to "share ideas" 
with the Haitians that truly are foreign to a force accustomed to enforcing the 
orders of a dictatorship rather than maintaining order in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not to say their approach is wrong and ours is right," Campbell says, 
choosing his words carefully. "It's just to show that this is the way it is 
done in an open society where the police and army are there to serve an elected 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. MPs -- who are assigned to serve as a buffer between the Haitian 
forces and the people until a U.S.-led multinational U.N. police force forms 
here -- do, of course, have their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, they are not an occupation force. They are not authorized to 
enforce Haitian law or arrest Haitians. And, for now, U.S. commanders have 
decided not to deploy joint patrols, largely to avoid painting U.S. troops as 
comparable to the Haitian policemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of that, Campbell and others at the front line of the Haiti operation 
said they were specifically urged to improvise. "I've never done . . . or seen 
anything like this before," he says. "It's going to be very interesting to see 
how it all works out." 
</P>
<P>
 The case-by-case approach is expected to undergo even more-stringent tests 
over the next two weeks, when military planners fear increased looting and 
violence as the deadline approaches for the transfer of power to exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

YELTSIN PLEDGES TO END ARMS SALES TO IRAN; SUMMIT: U.S. OFFICIALS WARN OF 
POSSIBLE LOOPHOLES IN RUSSIAN LEADER'S PROMISE THAT COULD MAKE IT MEANINGLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin pledged Wednesday to cut off future sales 
of weapons to Iran, but American officials quickly warned that the promise may 
contain huge loopholes that could render it meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many problems along the way, but we've come to terms," Yeltsin 
said at a news conference with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, Yeltsin said, will fulfill the terms of a 1988 arms contract with Iran 
signed by the government of then-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, "but no 
other new contracts, no other new supplies, no other new shipments of weapons 
and weapons goods will be shipped." 
</P>
<P>
 But immediately afterward, Clinton offered a notably tepid rejoinder, saying 
it is generally accurate "we reached a conceptual agreement in principle" but 
"we cannot say that it is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials later explained the reason for the reticence -- Yeltsin's 
government has not yet revealed how long the 1988 contract runs, what more 
weapons shipments it may cover or how many weapons now are in the pipeline. "We 
will need to understand precisely what it is" that Yeltsin's pledge means, a 
senior U.S. official said. "It is a very elusive subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Iran has bought tanks, planes, armored personnel carriers and at least two, 
possibly three, submarines from Russia -- roughly $1 billion in arms over the 
last year, U.S. officials say. The arms sale issue remains a major stumbling 
block preventing full normalization of economic relations between the United 
States and Russia, and U.S. officials said they remain skeptical the matter 
will be resolved before the two presidents meet again next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's announcement provided a moment of drama at a news conference 
otherwise dominated by the Russian president's rapid-fire, jocular rendition of 
issues he and Clinton covered in their two days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nations had come a great distance from their Cold War enmity, Yeltsin 
declared, comparing the issues dividing them to quarrels among relatives. "What 
family doesn't have some kind of squabbles occasionally that eventually they 
kind of work out?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those talks dealt with economic issues, including extensive attempts 
by Clinton to prod Yeltsin into clearing the way for American companies to do 
business in Russia. From Mars bars to oil wells, Clinton took up the cases of 
American exporters and investors who have been stymied by Russian bureaucracy, 
warning Yeltsin that he will not be able to win approval of improved trade 
status for Russia until such problems are fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The direct intervention by top U.S. government officials on behalf of American 
companies was, until recent years, rare. But beginning in the George Bush 
Administration and escalating rapidly under Clinton, such economic bargaining 
has become a central part of American foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin promised to work on the issues and asked for help from American 
experts in drafting something his country has never had -- a tax code. U.S. 
officials said they were heartened by the progress but cautioned that the 
Russian leadership still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton brought three American business leaders -- the chief executives of 
General Motors, Dresser Industries and U.S. West -- to talk with Yeltsin about 
issues faced by the automobile, oil drilling and communications industries in 
Russia. U.S. officials said the meeting did appear to help, particularly in 
impressing upon Yeltsin the problems posed by Russia's chaotic and 
unpredictable tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the talks highlighted the wide gap between American and 
Russian perceptions of how an economy functions. At one point, for example, GM 
Chairman Jack Smith, Yeltsin and the head of a Russian company, Autovaz, which 
participates in a joint venture with the U.S. auto maker, became embroiled in a 
long discussion on how many cars the venture should produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians kept saying, 'We want a big project,' " a U.S. official said. 
Autovaz would like to produce 300,000 cars a year, rather than the 20,000 to 
30,000 that now come off its assembly lines. Smith, for his part, cautioned the 
Russians that they had to find a way to sell the cars before they could talk 
about producing more. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton personally intervened with the Russians to promote U.S. investments. 
He and Vice President Al Gore, for example, warned Yeltsin that Russia had to 
stop threatening to interfere with a deal reached by Azerbaijan and a 
consortium of American and European oil companies to drill for oil in the 
Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Clinton pressed Yeltsin on reducing trade barriers that have cut 
into U.S. exports to Russia of American products.

NEWS ANALYSIS; OPENNESS, COOPERATION MAKE IT A SUMMIT OF SUPERPOWER BUDDIES; 
DIPLOMACY: CLINTON, YELTSIN SEEMED TO ENGAGE IN A BRAINSTORMING SESSION ON MANY 
OF THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 When the leaders of the world's two nuclear superpowers got together and 
agreed on as much as Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Clinton 
did Wednesday, the outlines of the New Order seemed to emerge from the 
post-Cold War fog. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a world order in which, in sharpest contrast with the old days, Russia 
and the United States consult closely on everything from obscure conflicts to 
nuclear stockpiles. Their leaders come to summits ready to discuss anything and 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a world moving away from military blocs such as the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization and toward open discussion clubs such as the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could be a world where nuclear arsenals have been so drastically cut 
that the superpowers can switch to defensive nuclear arms and can finally lay 
to rest the nerve-racking doctrine of mutually assured destruction. In short, 
the world could be a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Yeltsin and Clinton emphasized that they respect the rights of 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the summit buddies -- both tall, beefy and folksy -- almost sounded like 
co-presidents of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin reeled off a list of items the two leaders had harmoniously discussed 
that included such bones of cooperation as the environment, military doctrines 
and space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the style of the summit went beyond consultations; it seemed to be a 
Russo-American brainstorming session on the world's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is worked out jointly," Yeltsin spokesman Anatoly Krasikov said of 
the presidents' approach to resolving the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. "It's 
not that Russia says, 'I think this.' They work together." 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders appear to have worked together, in part, on developing the 
vague ideas Yeltsin broached in his United Nations speech on Monday about 
moving toward some kind of new global security design, some organization that 
could replace NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's interest in liquidating the alliance contradicts the American line 
that NATO should rather expand to include would-be members in Eastern Europe. 
But whether the alliance eventually grows to include Russia or evolves into 
something new, either way, the military bloc system is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally convinced that the time of NATO is passing, because NATO is 
the concrete product of an absolutely concrete, specific epoch, the epoch of 
confrontation," Krasikov said. "Now some new structures should be created -- 
which ones, I don't know. I think no one knows." 
</P>
<P>
 The era of mutually assured destruction may be passing too. The Cold War 
doctrine held that this is the best way to prevent nuclear war: Each side 
should maintain such weak defenses against nuclear attack that it can never 
launch a first strike, because it would be devastated by even a weak 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in both the Clinton and the Yeltsin administrations, talk is mounting of 
new thinking that could allow the superpowers to put up nuclear shields, at 
least enough to defend themselves from terrorists' bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin openly relished the announcement that he and Clinton had begun talk of 
a "START-III," a follow-on to the two arms agreements that cut the superpowers' 
arsenals by about two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Their summit agreement to speed up the dismantling of the missiles cut under 
START II -- after it is passed by lawmakers in both countries -- showed what 
impatience they feel about the prospect of moving the world toward nuclear 
tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, we economize seven or eight years and give humanity the hope that 
our people will probably live in peace," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the atmosphere at the summit, Cold War graduates are already living 
in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials described an amazingly informal mood in which Yeltsin 
stripped to his shirt sleeves for some of his long chats with Clinton, leaning 
his elbows on the table and addressing questions directly to U.S. Cabinet 
members, as well as to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Krasikov recalled, everything would be worked out "to the 
last comma," and the leaders would sometimes sign documents without even 
knowing what they were signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian and American views differ on lifting the arms embargo in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, on whether Russia should have a "sphere of influence" in 
the former Soviet Union, on arms sales to Iran and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the summit Wednesday, Yeltsin could say: "We agreed on 
practically all questions. There were some compromises from the United States, 
some compromises from the Russian side, but for peace, humanity and our Earth, 
we agreed."

BOBBITT GETS 30 DAYS ON SECOND CHARGE OF BATTERING GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt was convicted of a second domestic battery charge Tuesday 
and ordered to serve 30 days in jail by a judge who called him a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristina Elliott testified that her former fiance twisted her arm behind her 
back and threw her against an apartment wall May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt served 12 days of a 15-day sentence this month for battering Elliott 
in a separate incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing is apparent and that is that you are a bully," Municipal Judge Ron 
D. Parraguirre said. "I don't know how we're going to get this across to you 
that this is unacceptable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt gained national attention when his wife, Lorena Bobbitt, sliced off 
his penis last year, saying he had sexually assaulted her. The penis was 
surgically reattached. Lorena Bobbitt was found not guilty by reason of 
insanity and filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Parraguirre sentenced Bobbitt to 90 days in jail with 60 days suspended and 
placed him on probation for one year, during which time he must abstain from 
alcohol and receive counseling. Bobbitt's attorney, Michael Stein, said he will 
appeal.

 Declaring that children "should not be used as pawns in debates regarding 
immigration policy," the governing board of the largest school district in 
Orange County has voted to condemn Proposition 187, the November ballot measure 
that calls for barring illegal immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote after an emotional debate Tuesday night, the Santa Ana Unified 
School District Board asserted that the measure is unconstitutional and would 
turn district employees "into inquisitors and adversaries of the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which currently enjoys widespread support in statewide polls, 
could force more than 300,000 students out of schools statewide and would 
require school administrators to report any students or parents they suspect of 
being in the country illegally to federal immigration authorities. Among other 
provisions, it would also prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving most 
health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji, noting that her ancestors had 
been thrown into World War II detention camps for Japanese immigrants who were 
legal residents, said Proposition 187 invites racist enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would we be looking at blond, blue-eyed children who might have come here 
illegally from Canada?" she asked. "Or are we going to look at little Juanito 
or Juanita?" 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Robert W. Balen said that if the measure passes, he will refuse 
as a matter of principle to cooperate with anyone who attempts to question his 
own family members about their immigration status. "There is a tendency in 
economic downturns to look for scapegoats, and I think that's what's happened 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Rosemarie Avila, who spoke in favor of Proposition 187, compared 
the United States to a lifeboat that could only accommodate 10 people at one 
time. Although compassion demands that people try to save others, she said, "If 
you put 40 people on a (10-person) lifeboat it will sink and no one will be 
saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new statewide Field poll registered a dip in support for 
Proposition 187. The poll shows the measure favored by 57% to 31%, compared 
with 64% to 27% in July. The margin of error for the new poll was 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll director Mark Di Camillo said the shift may be traced in part to the fact 
that more information about the potential financial impact of the measure was 
provided in the new poll. This time, respondents were read language not 
previously available that will appear on the November ballot summary. The 
summary says that the measure places at risk billions of dollars in federal 
funding for California.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: JUDGE SHOWS FAITH IN JURORS AND DOUBTS ABOUT THE 
MEDIA'S INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Judge Lance A. Ito has been irately critical of the O.J. Simpson news 
coverage, it appears he doesn't think people are taking what they read and see 
very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Ito has denounced news leaks about evidence and even 
threatened to pull the plug on television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he really believed that the millions of words and pictures were a 
threat, Ito probably would not have turned down a prosecution request Wednesday 
designed to protect jurors from the overwhelming tide of Simpson news. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman had asked that Ito interrupt jury 
selection, now in progress, until a hearing is completed on the admissibility 
of DNA evidence. DNA testing of blood seems to be the prosecution's main weapon 
in trying to prove Simpson killed his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend, Ronald Goldman, in a crime that, at least so far, has no witnesses. As 
a result, the DNA hearing will be the focus of massive coverage, speculation, 
and -- if patterns continue -- of leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman objected to Ito's plan of picking 12 jurors and alternates before the 
DNA hearing. He thought it was wrong to pick the panelists and send them home 
during the hearing only to recall them when the trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Under present plans, Hodgman said, "We will send our 20 jurors out into 
society and ask them not to read, not to listen, not to peek at the 
all-pervasive media. That is an unrealistic and impractical solution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your honor," he said, "in the name of common sense and reducing the potential 
for mistrial, I ask the court to adopt our proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, however, accepted the defense argument that the jurors and 
alternates will follow Ito's orders to ignore news coverage because they 
respect the obligations of jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my colleagues said it was inconsistent of Ito to denounce the press, 
and then turn down the prosecution on this point. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought Judge Ito's decision made sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed an admirable faith in the jury system. It indicated that Ito feels 
jurors take their jobs seriously enough to ignore media distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 This view is supported by polls showing that although the public had avidly 
read and watched almost everything about the case, most people had not been 
influenced enough by the coverage to have made up their minds whether Simpson 
is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll of Los Angeles County residents taken last week provided some 
fascinating insights into this point. 
</P>
<P>
 We've already reported that half of those surveyed said they haven't formed an 
opinion about his guilt or innocence. A substantial number of others said they 
were leaning one way or another, but hadn't made up their minds. Only 19% were 
certain of Simpson's guilt and just 9% were sure of his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 What's really interesting are the omnivorous reading and viewing habits of 
this largely undecided sampling of Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 66% read a daily newspaper at least a few times a week. More -- 93% 
-- are a-few-times- a-week local TV news watchers. Interestingly, the 
comparable figure for tabloid TV shows such as "Hard Copy" was 33% and for the 
weekly supermarket tabloids 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this information, most of it coming from the traditional sources of 
newspapers and television news broadcasts, has not, as they say in politics, 
moved many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the prosecution doubts this apparent open-mindedness will carry 
into the jury box. But that's not giving jurors much credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective jurors are a rebellious lot. I've been one, and complained plenty 
about the bad conditions. But once on a jury, citizens' attitudes change. For 
serving on a jury is the most important and consuming civic duty most Americans 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders from judges have real impact, coming down from a robed presence on an 
elevated bench. There is a solemnity to jury duty. Most jurors want to do a 
good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gerald L. Chaleff, a member of a court-appointed committee trying to 
improve jury conditions, told me that "when a person gets on a jury, the vast 
majority try their hardest to obey all the court's rules and decide the case 
based on the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are judging a human being, and that adds to the import of what you are 
doing. You interact with your fellow jurors and you see that they think it's 
important. Then you sit down and deliberate and you see the intensity and you 
are all caught up with what you are doing and how important it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a revolutionary idea, that old-fashioned civic obligation is stronger 
than the vaunted power of the press. Unfashionable, too. It could destroy a 
cottage industry of journalism seminars, featuring academics, editors and 
reporters ruminating about the best ways of wielding the great power they 
believe they hold in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, Judge Ito seemed to be saying they aren't all that 
influential. The media do a lot of shouting, but not everybody is listening.

FPPC DROPS CASE OF WILSON CONDO IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a complaint from the California Democratic Party, the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission has decided to take no action against Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson for accepting a rent-free Century City condominium from a 
nonprofit foundation set up by his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats charged that Wilson violated a state ethics law by moving into 
the $4,150-a-month condo, where the governor and his wife stay on their 
frequent visits to Southern California.The law generally limits gifts to a 
state official from any one source to $270 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the five-member commission, meeting in closed session earlier this 
month, sided with the governor, who contended that the rent payments were gifts 
to the state and did not represent a personal benefit. The two Republicans on 
the five-member, bipartisan commission, both recused themselves from the debate 
because of their potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the commissioners did find what they described as "a technical 
violation" of the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy memo closing the books on the complaint, the commission noted 
that the California Governor's Foundation did not formalize its gift to the 
state for two months after a rule requiring it to do so went into effect. But 
because the nonprofit group did eventually meet the requirement, "this 
violation has been satisfactorily cured." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Democratic Party, however, disagrees with the commission's findings 
and is contemplating legal action, said Drew Mendelson, the party's 
communications director.

CONGRESS OKS $284.1 BILLION IN SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmakers gave final approval to three appropriations bills and sent them to 
President Clinton on Wednesday: a $247-billion bill financing labor, health and 
education programs; a $13.6-billion measure financing the Interior Department 
and cultural programs, and a $23.5-billion bill for the Treasury, Postal 
Service and some smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Congress had shipped two other bills to Clinton: a $90.1-billion 
measure financing veterans, housing and space programs and a $68-billion bill 
financing agriculture and food initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Congress has now sent Clinton 10 of its 13 annual spending bills for 
fiscal 1995, which begins Saturday. It has not completed all 13 measures in 
time for the beginning of the government's new year since Sept. 30, 1988, when 
it shipped the final measure to President Ronald Reagan at three minutes to 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor-health bill finances many of Clinton's most important initiatives, 
though at lower levels than he sought. The Head Start preschool program would 
get $3.5 billion, $500 million less than Clinton wanted, and the National 
Institutes of Health would get $11.3 billion, $100 million below the 
President's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans and housing bill contains $14.4 billion for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, about $150 million less than this year; 
$1.1 billion for housing aid for the homeless, a $300-million increase, and 
$17.6 billion for veterans compensation and pensions, a $100-million boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the NASA budget is $2.1 billion for the proposed space station, 
nearly $200 million more than was provided in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's 90-9 passage of the veterans bill came after the Senate refused 
to strip out $155-million worth of lawmakers' pet projects. Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.) argued that the money for sewer, housing and other projects was 
wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the agriculture bill on a voice vote. It reduces last 
year's spending levels for many programs, including flood prevention, food 
distribution to the poor and government subsidies to companies that sell food 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury and Postal Service measure is most noteworthy for what it 
prevents: a pay raise for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also eliminates $157 million in new federal buildings that the 
Senate had included in an earlier version of the legislation. Among the major 
projects eliminated were courthouses in Santa Ana, Calif., and Laredo, Tex., 
and a U.S. Geological Survey lab in Lakewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was approved Wednesday by the Senate on a voice vote. The House had passed 
it on Tuesday, 360-53. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the Interior bill 92-7. The House approved it Tuesday on a 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Included was $168 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, $3 million 
less than Clinton wanted.

SCHOOLS SHOWING PROGRESS, FEDERAL GOALS PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation is making progress -- albeit slowly -- toward improving its 
educational system and the health and safety of its students, but direct action 
on the local level is needed to reduce dropout rates and drug use, a federal 
report released Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Education Goals Panel, which was convened in 1989 to assess the 
quality of education in America, cites several areas of improvement over the 
five years: Incidents involving violence and abuse of alcohol in schools have 
declined, while mathematics achievement and student health have improved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel warns that drug abuse in schools is on the rise, and little 
improvement has been noted in other key indicators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're closer to meeting our national education goals," said Maine Gov. John 
R. McKernan Jr., outgoing chairman of the panel. "But it will take concerted 
action on the part of the public and policy-makers if we are to meet the goals 
we've established." 
</P>
<P>
 Performance on mathematics achievement tests among fourth and eighth-graders 
increased markedly from 1990 to 1992, the most recent year from which the test 
results are available. In 1990, only 20% of students in eighth grade and just 
13% each in grades 4 and 12 were able to meet the panel's performance 
standards. This year's report shows a 5 percentage point jump in scores for 
fourth and eighth graders, and a 3 percentage point improvement for 12th 
graders. 
</P>
<P>
 But a breakdown of those results shows remaining difficulties. Female students 
did as well as males in grades four and eight, but lagged significantly in 
grade 12. White students in grades four and eight were the only racial group to 
make substantial gains in mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The math results are based on a nationwide sample of public and private school 
scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test. While national 
testing showed overall improvement, California math scores for eighth-graders 
went from 16% meeting the panel's performance standard in 1990 to 20% in 1992. 
Other new results for California were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at alcohol and drug abuse among students shows mixed results. While 
incidents of extreme alcohol consumption among public school students have 
dropped, student drug use remains a significant problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of 10th-graders who reported using any illicit drug during the 
previous year remained at about one in four in 1993, the report said, and 20% 
said someone had offered to sell or give them drugs at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five percent of 10th-graders reported being threatened or injured at 
school in 1993, a figure the panel said remains "unacceptably high" even though 
it is down 5 percentage points from the 1991 level. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other findings in the report: 
</P>
<P>
 * There has been no progress in efforts to increase the number of low-income 
families that enroll children in preschool. High-income families remain much 
more likely to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 * The percentage of infants born with two or more health or developmental 
risks dropped one percentage point between 1990 and 1991, to 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 * White students still enroll and graduate from college in higher numbers than 
black or Latino students.

ANOTHER 14 CHARGED IN PROBE OF NYPD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen more New York police officers, including two sergeants, have been 
charged in the city's investigation of drug trafficking, theft and other 
crimes, prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 28 present and former police officers have now been charged in 
state and federal cases as part of the corruption crackdown.All of the officers 
are from the 30th Precinct in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sergeants, who are the first supervising officers to be charged in the 
investigation, and seven of the other police officers were arrested on federal 
criminal complaints which charge them with perjury, federal civil rights 
violations and extortion. Five other police officers pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
state and federal criminal charges of perjury, grand larceny, narcotics 
trafficking, possession of narcotics, federal civil rights violations and 
income tax evasion.

HOUSE DENIES FUNDS FOR DISNEY'S PARKING GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's elusive transportation funds, which all year have been granted 
and then yanked away by Congress, were restored in part by the House on 
Wednesday, but without the money requested by the Walt Disney Co. to construct 
a massive parking structure it says it needs for its proposed Westcot resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The House had earlier granted $10 million to pay for the Disney garage, as 
well as for ramps on and off the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways in Costa 
Mesa. But the Senate refused to grant any money, distributing it instead to 
projects in other states. A conference committee this week restored $5 million, 
solely for the ramps. Officials said none of the funds would be used for 
Disney's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $1 million to improve Bristol Street in Santa Ana was also restored, 
less than the original $3 million the House had allocated, but enough to keep 
the project on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate must still pass the bill, but no opposition is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has said that it needs the money if it is to build the $3-billion 
Westcot resort near Disneyland. The garage, which would be one of the largest 
in the world, would allow Disneyland to remain open while the new resort is 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials could not be reached for comment regarding whether the lack 
of funds will influence their decision to build Westcot. But local 
transportation officials said the money for the Disney garage was never really 
expected because Disney has yet to commit to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The restored funds were a victory for lawmakers such as U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein and Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who fought to win back 
the money the Senate had essentially redistributed to other projects around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case when perseverance definitely paid off," Dornan said. "I wasn't 
going to stand by while Orange County's tax dollars were shipped off to remote 
places around the country."

POLICE FEAR WORST IN PAIR'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Cecilia Newball disappeared last week, she left behind her car and inside 
it a cryptic "goodby" card, her wedding and engagement rings, and a snapshot of 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the message wasn't clear enough, a week later her husband received a 
letter saying Cecilia -- who is 8 1/2 months pregnant -- was headed for 
Honduras with another man. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed painfully obvious: Cecilia, 31, had left her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But the husband, Alfredo Newball, didn't buy that theory for a minute. And 
neither do police, who have more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: Why would Cecilia leave when she was excited about having a 
baby? Why was the "Dear John" letter typed? Why didn't Cecilia take a change of 
clothes for herself or her son, and take her son's eyeglasses? 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no arguments, nothing," said Newball, who hasn't slept much and 
hasn't worked at all since the disappearance. "There was no sign that she 
wanted to leave. If something was wrong, she would tell me about it. She was 
like that with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Police fear the worst. "There are things that make us think it was foul play," 
said Detective Alex Valadez, who wouldn't say much more. 
</P>
<P>
 As police try to sort it out, Rene Perez Sr. -- father of the missing 
6-year-old, Rene Perez Jr. -- has moved into the Newballs' Chatsworth 
apartment. The two men say they can do little but pray and hope that everything 
turns out well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has brought us closer," Perez said on Wednesday as the two sat in the 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting tears, Newball said, "It's hard . . . everything I look at reminds me 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Newball's ordeal began Sept. 20, after he went to his nursing job just before 
2:30 p.m., leaving his wife and stepson at home. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left, Cecilia, who was on maternity leave from her job as a customer 
service representative at a nearby company, was writing thank-you notes for 
gifts the couple had received at a surprise wedding shower two days earlier, on 
the first anniversary of their wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Newball remembers kissing her goodby, and coming back and kissing her again. 
He doesn't remember why. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, on his lunch break, he called home. No one answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, when he came home from work, Newball found his wife's 
Jeep parked out front, instead of in the garage. On the front seat lay a 
printed card bearing her signature. But something seemed amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It said, 'Thank you for the good times we had,' " Newball remembered. "But 
the only writing on it was her signature, but not her last name." 
</P>
<P>
 Newball searched the neighborhood, asking everyone he saw if they had seen her 
and the boy. Only one neighbor remembered seeing Rene -- outside the apartment 
at about 5 p.m. With no other leads and no reassurances, Newball returned home 
to discover that his wife had taken nothing with her but her purse and keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't take her toothbrush, her deodorant, her maternity vitamins," he 
said. "They practically left with what they had on their backs." 
</P>
<P>
 As Newball spoke, the telephone rang. Someone on the other end asked for 
Cecilia. The caller wanted to know when the next payment on the Jeep would be 
made. Newball explained the situation, and promised a check in a day or so. 
Then he started to cry again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there was just something to tell us they were OK or something," he 
said, after hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clues Newball has had to his wife's whereabouts were in a typewritten 
letter he received in the mail on Saturday. The postmark was Van Nuys and the 
message was that Cecilia was going to Honduras -- where Newball said she has no 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed odd to Newball. Valadez, who is investigating the case, concurs. 
"Something wasn't right about the letter," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the disappearance, Cecilia's friends and co-workers have covered the San 
Fernando Valley with 3,000 flyers in English and Spanish featuring pictures of 
Cecilia and Rene. The family has checked local hospitals and telephoned all the 
relatives and friends they can think of from the U.S. all the way to El 
Salvador, where Cecilia was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Newball has even visited maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see the women with their babies, it just breaks my heart," he said. "I 
wish it was her." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing, he adds, "I checked the mail again today. But nothing. My heart hurts 
every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Cecilia Newball and Rene Perez should call 
police at (213) 485-5381.

9 HOMES LOST IN 2ND FIRE; PALMDALE: ARSON STRIKES NEW 'CALIFORNIA FOOTHILLS' 
TRACT TWICE IN QUICK SUCCESSION. SECURITY IS INCREASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A second arson-caused fire within a week at a new housing tract has destroyed 
nine homes under construction and alarmed residents who have already moved into 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires, which occurred while residents were asleep early Sunday and then 
again early Tuesday, caused an estimated $400,000 damage at Kaufman & Broad's 
highly promoted California Foothills tract. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have determined that a flammable liquid was poured on the 
foundations to ignite the partially constructed houses, according to sheriff's 
arson investigator Terry Danielson. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred ninety houses in the tract are occupied, and the developer plans 
to build 80 more. Residents were evacuated during both fires. Some reported 
that their wooden fences and decks were scorched by flying embers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a demolition crew entered the construction area to tear down the 
charred structures, while sheriff's deputies continued to puzzle over the 
arsonist's identity and motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether we've got kids goofing off or union problems or what," 
said Danielson. "It could be simple vandalism or something more serious than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Mezger, president of Kaufman & Broad's Antelope Valley Division, said he 
was also bewildered. "We have no motives," he said. "There's no disgruntled 
subcontractors, no homeowner disputes. It's been a very quiet, smooth-running 
community. We're mystified." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 20, someone ignited a small amount of lumber in the construction 
area, but authorities say they are uncertain that it was the work of the same 
arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires caused fearful homeowners to begin organizing a Neighborhood Watch 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a pyromaniac, someone who gets a thrill out of watching fires," 
said James Hall, a postal supervisor who moved his family from Los Angeles to 
the Palmdale tract just five weeks ago, believing it was a safer environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to get away from the rat race, all the ambulances, the fire engines, 
the shootings and drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall joined other residents in a meeting with Kaufman & Broad executives on 
Tuesday during which the residents demanded increased security. The developer 
agreed to put up more fencing, post security guards and install floodlights at 
the construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel a little more at ease, but not totally safe," Hall said. "We're not 
going to let our guards down." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Tuesday's fire, two residents armed with shotguns confronted a 
man entering the construction site. The residents allowed him in after learning 
he was a subcontractor assigned to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielson discouraged such face-to-face confrontations during a meeting with 
anxious residents Tuesday night. Instead, he urged them to write down license 
plate numbers and descriptions of suspicious people entering the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Richardson, who moved her family from Compton to Palmdale six weeks ago, 
said residents have a right to be edgy after two dangerous fires in quick 
succession. Soon after Tuesday's fire started just beyond the Richardsons' back 
yard, her husband, Rudy, smelled smoke, hustled her out of bed and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got up, got my kids out and started to wake the neighbors, two 
houses (in the construction area) were fully engulfed," Richardson recalled. "I 
was ringing doorbells and saying, 'Get up! Get Up!' I was worried because the 
embers were going over the roof of my house. It was raining embers in my front 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Kaufman & Broad crews were repairing the damage caused by the 
embers and removing ashes from yards and driveways near the fire scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the new security measures, Richardson said it's difficult to relax 
after the recent fires. "I think it's fear of the unknown," she said. "You 
don't know who's doing it. It could be a crazy person, a lunatic out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbors, Henry and Isabel Blum, have also had trouble getting a good 
night's sleep. "We wake up every hour," Isabel Blum said. "We're afraid to look 
out the window. It could happen again."

DOCTOR LOSES LICENSE OVER DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctor accused of prescribing narcotic painkillers for patients at Olive 
View-UCLA Medical Center and then injecting herself with the drugs has had her 
medical license revoked by state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Monica Watts Hurtado, formerly a first-year resident at the county-run 
hospital in Sylmar, ordered nurses to prepare two shots of Demerol for patients 
but took one herself and gave the patient a second shot of saline solution she 
secretly prepared, state investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado was fired from Olive View in 1991 after switching needles on five or 
six patients, according to charges filed by the Medical Board of California. 
She worked at the hospital's busy gynecology and obstetrics department after 
graduating from the UCLA School of Medicine in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hurtado, 31, was arrested at a San Bernardino residence as she 
mixed an injection of heroin for herself in the bathroom, accompanied by her 
infant son, according to medical board documents. Police said she admitted she 
was a heroin user and had numerous needle marks on her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical board in June revoked Hurtado's license by default after she 
failed to demand a hearing to defend herself on charges that she fraudulently 
prescribed drugs for patients but took them herself. The board released 
documents on the case this week. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. E. A. Jones, who had been assigned to prosecute 
Hurtado, said Wednesday that apparently no Olive View patients suffered because 
Hurtado had diverted pain-suppressing medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been a situation where patients didn't really need (Demerol) but 
she prescribed it anyway," he said. An Olive View spokeswoman said patients 
probably were not injured by the saline shots because the solution is harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado could not be reached for comment. The medical board could not provide 
information Wednesday on what, if any, jobs were held by the physician after 
she was dismissed from Olive View. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said that in April, 1991, Hurtado ordered a nurse to 
prepare two shots of Demerol for a patient. With Hurtado in the patient's room, 
the nurse placed one syringe on a desk and turned to administer the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a supervising nurse saw a syringe on the desk with the needle 
improperly pointing out. After the first nurse said she did not leave the 
needle in that position, it was tested and found to contain salt solution 
instead of Demerol. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado later admitted that on five or six occasions she prescribed two doses 
of Demerol for patients, one larger and one smaller, according to board 
documents. She said she gave the larger Demerol shot to herself. She was fired 
from the hospital in May, 1991. In May, 1993, Hurtado tried to pass an altered 
prescription for the narcotic painkiller Vicodin at a drugstore in Highland, 
state officials said. A pharmacist summoned San Bernardino County sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hurtado was arrested on heroin charges in June, 1993, she was placed in 
a diversion program aimed at treating medical professionals addicted to drugs 
or alcohol. She was also ordered to stop practicing medicine for one year. But 
she was dropped from diversion for failing to complete the treatment program, 
state investigators said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SCHOOL GETS SMART ABOUT RAISING FUNDS 
</P>

 Forget PTA bake sales. 
</P>
<P>
 A parents committee at Mark Keppel Elementary School in Glendale has taken 
school fund-raising to the corporate level. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, called Make Keppel Special, acts as a foundation for the school and 
accepts grant applications for educational projects from teachers and 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's latest endeavor is an elaborate playground on campus, complete 
with a rubber mat floor to prevent accidents.  
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ellis, chairman of Make Keppel Special and parent of two Keppel kids, 
helped pull in $40,000 for the construction of the playground, which officially 
opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian made a dream come true," said Cynthia Livingston, an administrative 
intern at Keppel. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston described Ellis as an aggressive, effective fund-raiser who has 
made possible the remodeling and expansion of the school library and the 
creation of an Apple Macintosh computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our committee has been submitted 20 grant applications so far, but we've only 
turned down two," Ellis said, explaining that those grants were rejected 
because the Glendale Unified School District did not approve them. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's next project will be building a science bungalow where a 
full-time teacher will conduct classes and labs for all grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis estimated that the science bungalow could cost up to $60,000, and he has 
already started thinking of how to cut the price. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school rents a bungalow instead, the project might only cost $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing we need is for parents and community members to work 
together to make schools more successful," said Sheila Beauchamp, president of 
the Glendale Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In the district she represents, Beauchamp said, 10 schools have developed a 
foundation committee, like the one at Keppel.MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; CIVIC PRIDE MARCH PLANNED FOR SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents here are encouraged to demonstrate unity and pride in their 
communities by participating in the first-ever Sunland-Tujunga pride march 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some great folks and some great groups in this community, and we want 
to get out and show our togetherness," said Joanne Wright of the Sunland 
Tujunga Coordinating Council, which is organizing the march along with the 
Sunland Tujunga Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said Saturday's march is a good time for people to promote the 
positives of living in their communities, and to counter negative perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The march will begin at 10 a.m. at the Verdugo Hills Family YMCA parking lot 
in Tujunga, continue on Foothill Boulevard and Commerce Avenue, concluding at 
Little Landers Park at Commerce Avenue and Valmont Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A unity rally will be held at the park, followed by a catered party complete 
with a deejay and entertainment for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Valmont Street between Samoa and Commerce avenues will be closed to traffic 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Glendale) is expected to speak at the rally. Features 
of the party will include a police car and fire engine for children to explore, 
Daisy the Clown, a caricaturist, hot dogs, hamburgers and beverages served by 
the Sunland-Tujunga Kiwanis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be information tables about Neighborhood Watch, the 
Sunland-Tujunga Citizens Patrol and other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers should gather at the YMCA at 9:30 a.m. Parking will be available at 
the Elks Lodge, 10137 Commerce Ave. and at the Masonic Lodge, 7216 Valmont St. 
Shuttle service from those parking lots to the YMCA will be provided beginning 
at 8:45 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent start," said Debra Anderson, executive director of the 
Verdugo Hills Family YMCA. "It gets people, families, seniors out making a 
statement saying, 'Hey, this is our community, and we want to be safe and free 
of drugs and graffiti.' If we stand together, we have a better shot at cleaning 
our community up." TIM MAY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 'COWBOY BANDIT' NOT IN CUSTODY, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale police said Wednesday that a man arrested last weekend in connection 
with a string of recent bank robberies is not the "Cowboy Bandit," as they 
first believed, and that the man who wore a Western disguise while holding up 
banks is still on the loose.  
</P>
<P>
 However, police still believe Warren Matthew Sims, 37, a Los Angeles roofer, 
was involved in at least three of the six robberies the Cowboy Bandit -- so 
dubbed because he wore a Western hat and shirt and sported a thin beard in 
three robberies -- is believed to have committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims and the Cowboy Bandit, who is as yet unidentified, may have been partners 
in the crimes, said police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Sims) has been positively identified by witnesses at the last three bank 
robberies, but as of now we haven't been able to completely connect him with 
the three previous robberies," Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three crimes occurred at a Wells Fargo bank in Montrose Aug. 29, a 
Union Federal Bank in Silver Lake Sept. 3 and a Citizens Bank in La Canada 
Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In each incident, the Cowboy Bandit walked up to a teller window and ordered 
the teller to empty the cash drawer into a bag he was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 Police then thought the Cowboy Bandit dropped his disguise and shaved his 
beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank security camera photos released earlier this month were allegedly of 
Sims, who is charged in the Sept. 10 robbery of a Great Western Bank branch in 
Glendale and two robberies in recent weeks at a Bank of America branch in Eagle 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, Glendale police tailed Sims on Saturday from a construction 
project where he was working in the Atwater area of Los Angeles and arrested 
him in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims, who is being held at the Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $500 bail, 
already has been formally charged in the Great Western robbery, in which he 
reportedly escaped with about $3,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be arraigned in the two Bank of America heists. If convicted, he 
could face up to 15 years in prison, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keuroghelian would not comment on whether police have any leads on who the 
real "cowboy" is. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there are several reasons that police believe he and Sims may have 
been working together, such as the way they approached the teller window, used 
similar guns and ordered the teller to put the cash into a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also appeared several times that they both were aware of the bank robbery 
alarm systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, Sims told the teller that she should not have pressed the 
alarm button," Keuroghelian said. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SEWER-SLUDGE FACILITY OPENS FOR RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state-of-the-art sludge-processing facility that has been touted as the 
answer to the area's solid-waste recycling needs officially opened Wednesday, 
ending a 10-year effort to make the project a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the morning, Las Virgenes Municipal Water District officials led 
visiting dignitaries on tours of the district's $50-million facility, which 
turns sludge into fertilizer that is safe to use on gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably a prime example of how well this technology can work," said 
keynote speaker Alan Rubin, senior scientist of the Water Environment 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only does it turn out a product that meets all the federal and state 
requirements," he added, "but it's also a facility that protects the public 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Las Virgenes Composting Facility, 3700 Las Virgenes Road, is one of 
the first in the nation to recycle nearly all of the water and solids from the 
sludge it collects, according to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to give the fertilizer to Kellogg Supply Inc., a Carson firm that 
sells various kinds of fertilizer, district officials say. The district's 
customers will get for free any fertilizer Kellogg does not use. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility works like this: Sewer solids are brought by pipe from the Tapia 
Water Reclamation Facility about two miles away. The sludge is kept in tanks 
for about two months to allow microscopic bugs to feed on harmful bacteria.  
</P>
<P>
 The sludge is then spun dry and pushed by conveyor belt to another building, 
where it's mixed with sawdust and baked for another month. The entire facility 
is enclosed to keep foul odors from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has not been without critics. Tad Mattock, director of the 
Camarillo-based Camrosa Water District, said that, while recycling sludge is "a 
great idea," the facility is not self-supporting because the fertilizer is 
being given away. 
</P>
<P>
 A. MacNeil Stelle, vice president of the water district's board of directors, 
said the project "was never intended to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials decided to take financial risks to build the facility, he 
said, because they were afraid there would be no place to put sludge in future 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our alternative was to put the sludge in the landfill," Stelle said. "I know 
this was risky, but when you have no alternative, you have to assume the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Another critic, Diane Eaton, who is running for a Division 2 spot on the board 
of directors, says water district customers will have to shoulder the burden of 
paying for the facility. She noted that the district's board of directors voted 
Monday to increase rates for customers by an average of 7%, which she says will 
go to pay off a $60-million loan taken out by the district in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be some time before the facility will be able to accept green waste 
such as grass and leaves, something Calabasas officials had been hoping the 
facility would be able to do. This would help the city comply with a state law 
that requires the city to reduce the amount of solid waste that it takes to 
landfills by 25% in 1995 and 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Councilwoman Lesley Devine said she was a little disappointed that 
the facility is not accepting green waste. "But I guess it appears that, 
technically, there is not much choice." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN FILLS POST IN MINORITY PROGRAM

 In partial concessions to protesting Latinos, Cal State Northridge President 
Blenda J. Wilson has filled the vacant director's job for the campus program 
that aids low-income and minority students, and promised an earlier resolution 
to its uncertain future. 
</P>

 Two weeks ago, more than 100 Latino students, faculty and staff members 
marched on campus and picketed Wilson's office to protest her reorganization of 
CSUN's Educational Opportunity Program last spring.One of their key demands was 
that Wilson fill the EOP director's vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, campus administrators had said the job would remain vacant until a 
task force studying the future structure of the program issues a report this 
spring. In a second concession, Wilson also directed that task force to finish 
its study by December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could hear the intensity of feeling from the campus community," 
said CSUN Provost Louanne Kennedy in explaining the changes. Jose Luis Vargas, 
an administrator in the EOP program, has been given the interim director's job 
and a corresponding pay raise, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's actions did not, however, respond to the two other main demands 
voiced by campus Latinos: first, that EOP staff, who were scattered to 
different offices under the reorganization, be restored to a single entity, and 
second, that alleged misuse of campus EOP funds be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Juana Mora, chair of CSUN's Chicano studies department and a participant in 
the protest, applauded Vargas' appointment, saying she hadn't expected Wilson 
to respond so quickly. But Mora said the shorter deadline for the EOP review 
may be unrealistic, and minority students want a role in the process. JOHN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; ENTIRE PANEL SPEAKS AGAINST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Angela Guerrero emigrated from Colombia to the United States in 1969, she 
was given the same freedom and privileges as any American. But little did the 
then 9-year-old girl know that 25 years later she might have to renounce 
citizenship in her native country to keep these privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Colombia and I love America. It's like having two mothers. How can I 
be expected to choose one or the other?" Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero joined a crowd of 150 community members and Latino activists Tuesday 
night at Our Lady of the Valley Catholic Church in Canoga Park to hear a panel 
discussion about Proposition 187, the ballot initiative aimed at curbing 
illegal immigration. If approved, it would deny publicly funded benefits, such 
as health care and education, to those who cannot prove United States 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the "Save Our State" initiative by its proponents, Proposition 187 
would also require teachers, police, health-care workers and other individuals 
in public service positions to report those suspected of being illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must ask ourselves if this measure will be truly beneficial to society or 
if it will merely impose punitive measures against those who have little 
political power," said panelist Effie Clark, of the Commission for Justice and 
Peace of the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the initiative would promote fear and suspicion between doctors and 
patients, teachers and students, social service workers and clients and law 
enforcement officers and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, another panelist, said that as a law 
enforcement officer, he is greatly concerned about illegal immigration. But, he 
said, he opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will deny thousands of kids the right to attend school, and put them out 
on the streets where they will be more vulnerable to turn to crime," Block 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Children won't be inoculated against disease. This initiative is not the way 
to approach the problem of illegal immigration. It will create a range of 
problems that will become even greater in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelist Eleanor Leo, senior legislative analyst with the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, said the initiative violates the federal Family Education 
Rights and Privacy Act, which prohibits the release of information about public 
school students except in limited circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal funds are denied to schools that violate this act," Leo said. If the 
initiative passes, she said, California could lose $2.3 billion dollars for 
elementary and secondary schools and $1 billion for colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Manson, a 25-year Woodland Hills resident, was one of a handful of 
Proposition 187 supporters at the meeting. She said the measure does not deny 
illegal immigrants the right to an education, but rather forces them to pay for 
it themselves through the private school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are making a decision on an initiative they aren't even 
completely familiar with," said Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah Silvey, a California native and Encino resident, said she's "mad as 
hell" that Tuesday's panelists voiced only opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this meeting because I have an open mind and I wanted to hear both 
sides of the issue before making my decision," Silvey said. "But there was not 
one panelist in favor of the proposition. They didn't even let . . . people 
hear both sides so they can make up their own minds about the issue. Shame on 
them." ALICIA DOYLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; WEST VALLEY POLICE PLAN OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers are "just people, not machines," said Officer Larry Monte, and 
the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley station will open its doors 
Oct. 8 so that residents can see that for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual open house is designed to break down barriers between police 
and the people they serve, Monte said, barriers that seem sturdier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers want "to get the community involved, have them come to the station 
and realize . . . they have nothing to be afraid of when we come," he said. 
"We're the good guys, not the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, organizers have rounded up some 30 police displays as well as 
others from private crime-fighting groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain to draw a crowd is the LAPD criminalist van detectives employed when 
gathering evidence at the scene of the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman 
slayings, and at O. J. Simpson's Brentwood mansion. A SWAT team, bomb squad and 
police helicopter also will be on hand, as well as information on drug and 
community policing programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Recruitment officials will be available to discuss possible employment with 
those interested in careers in law enforcement, and the LAPD Mobile Museum -- 
complete with "Dragnet" and Jack Webb memorabilia -- will also stop by. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to LAPD displays, Los Angeles Fire Department officials will offer 
earthquake safety tips, and members of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Mad 
About Rising Crime will distribute information on their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will run from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the West Valley Station, 19020 
Vanowen St. in Reseda. ERIC SLATER

VALLEY RESIDENTS PROTEST TWO-LEVEL DWP SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposals to reduce Los Angeles DWP bills for families living on big lots and 
in hot climates -- typically residents of the San Fernando Valley -- were 
called insufficient by several speakers at a public hearing Wednesday night at 
Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 people attended the hearing, the first of eight such sessions by 
the Board of Water and Power Commissioners, including three in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate revisions, announced in June, were designed especially to provide 
relief to Valley residents, following an outpouring of protests against a 
previous rate change. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage water conservation, a two-level rate system was introduced last 
year, imposing higher bills on customers who used more than twice the median 
amount of water and a lower rate for more frugal users. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the Valley, residents complained last summer to City Hall about 
their ballooning water and power bills, some of which approached or topped 
$1,000 for two-month periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try as they might to conserve water, they could not stay below the upper 
level of charges," said Ken Worthen, a member of the mayor's Blue Ribbon 
Committee on Water Rates that proposed the revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee decided that the two-level system made it unreasonably difficult 
for many customers to stay within the lower level of usage, even when they were 
conscientious about conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not washing down our driveways with water," said Bert Bogash of Shadow 
Hills, "but it is not fair for us to subsidize the people who live at the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended in June that the existing two-level structure be 
retained but the method of calculating charges be modified. Under the proposal, 
three climate zones and four categories of lot sizes would influence how much 
each customer would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, households with more than six people would be eligible to apply 
for an increased amount of water at the lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have estimated that under the revised rate schedule, nearly 63% of 
customers will have lower bills while about 32% will see an increase in their 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But several residents contended at the hearing that the proposed benefits to 
the households in the hot Valley amounted to a difference of less than 10% from 
the water price in cooler areas of the city. "It is ludicrous," said one 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of people pleaded for fast action by the water board, which is 
scheduled to shape the final revisions in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Lerchenmuller of Sunland said his water bills, which previously ran $80 to 
$90, jumped to $250 under the two-level system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley is a desert area," he said. "If you look around, you'll see the 
area becoming very unsightly because people are not watering their grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 An Arleta resident, landscaper James Grumbach, said water bill for his 
half-acre lot almost equal his mortgage bill. He said he saves his bathwater 
and dishwater for plants and uses standard conservation methods. "But I feel 
penalized nevertheless -- and I guess I just need a shoulder to cry on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the resentment expressed Wednesday night was aimed at the sewer 
charges on DWP bills. Greater water usage triggers higher sewer use charges, on 
the theory that water entering a property must leave by the sewer system. 
Homeowners complain that this does not take into account the large amount of 
water that is soaked up by landscaping or evaporates from swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Tito, president of the board, said the public works department sets 
sewer use rates and that subject could not be discussed at these hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The next hearings in the Valley will be Oct. 11 at the DWP's Water and Power 
Aqueduct Filtration Plant, 13101 Sepulveda Blvd., Sylmar, and Oct. 27 at 
Parkman Middle School, 20800 Burbank Blvd., Woodland Hills. Both meetings will 
begin at 7 p.m.

TRUCK KILLS WOMAN AS SHE CROSSES BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-ton semi-trailer truck Wednesday ran over and killed a 71-year-old woman, 
apparently because she came so close to the tall truck in a Ventura Boulevard 
crosswalk that the driver could not see her from the cab, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small woman, whose name was not made public pending notification of her 
relatives, was walking south across the boulevard at Crebs Avenue when the 
18-wheeler rolled forward as the light turned green. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so close to the truck, and because (the cab) is so high, he didn't 
see her," said Sgt. David Clinton of the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man was throwing his hands in the air and I was wondering what was wrong 
with him when I figured it out," the truck driver, Ron Darnold, said shortly 
after the accident, holding his head in his hands as his voice shook with 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't see her. I feel so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 As police investigated at the scene, Darnold, 47, of North Hollywood, sat 
quietly on the step to his truck cab, tears welling in his eyes and wringing 
his hands. "In 20 years, I have never had an accident like this," said Darnold, 
a driver for California Land Clearing Inc., a debris-hauling company working 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Darnold was not arrested but the accident investigation will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Markas had just left his accounting office in a building on the northwest 
corner of the intersection for a walk when he saw the accident unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to happen in slow motion," he said. "The lady didn't even flinch. 
She didn't move out of the way or scream. She just kept walking as if the 
driver could see her and he ran right over her. " 
</P>
<P>
 Markas said the truck did not stop until a second pair of wheels had passed 
over the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is incredible to see that someone's life could end just like that," he 
said. "It seemed like something out of 'The Twilight Zone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The center lanes of Ventura Boulevard were closed for more than two hours by 
the accident investigation. Passersby in cars or on foot stared at the woman's 
sheet-covered body still under the truck, some holding their hands over their 
mouths in horror at the sight. A black shoe and brown handbag lay next to her 
on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Others just drove on, honking impatiently at the gawkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Scoggin watched the aftermath of the accident and traffic jam from the 
Chick Wide Shoes store, where he is the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first death I have seen here," said Scoggin. "My heart really 
goes out to that guy who hit her." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Robbins said he felt compelled to pull over his furniture delivery truck 
to see for himself what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad part about it is," Robbins said, "if you have family and you drive by 
and see the accident, you wonder if you know this person."

LAPD DROPS PLAN TO USE SALARY MONEY FOR PICNICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After sharp criticism from city lawmakers, Los Angeles police officials 
withdrew a proposal Wednesday to divert $40,000 from police salaries to pay for 
picnics for volunteers of a newly expanded cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake," said LAPD Deputy Chief David Gascon. "We made a 
bureaucratic blunder." 
</P>
<P>
 The department will pursue other funding sources for Operation Sparkle, which 
has been operating for five years on donations in the San Fernando Valley and 
is about to be expanded citywide, Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon introduced the motion at a City Council meeting 
Wednesday at the request of the LAPD, which runs the cleanup program. To reward 
volunteers, picnics are planned after each weekly cleanup event. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Laura Chick and Mark Ridley-Thomas criticized the 
proposal, saying the picnics should be funded with donations, as they have been 
in the Valley, and not with money intended to put police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've somehow managed to have it in the Valley without having to take it out 
of LAPD's budget," said Chick, adding that the money could pay for police 
equipment or overtime salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas agreed, saying "As much time as we spent . . . getting pay 
raises and salaries (for police), to advance a motion that would spend as much 
as $40,000 for picnics and the like seems to be questionable at the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Chick and Ridley-Thomas said they were happy to learn that police were 
backing away from the proposal but said they plan on examining closely whatever 
alternative funding police propose. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she will push to keep the program cost-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will only be happy if the picnics will be of no expense to any entity in 
the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, paint and equipment for Operation Sparkle have been donated, 
either by volunteers, businesses or corporate sponsors. Last year, for example, 
the Southland Corp., owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, provided 
food and beverages for volunteers while Waste Management Co. loaned the 
dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Operation Sparkle has employed volunteers in the Valley to pick up 
trash, sweep sidewalks and paint over graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But beginning Saturday, Operation Sparkle will launch cleanup efforts in each 
of the LAPD's four bureaus by mobilizing an estimated 20,000 volunteers. 
Planners hope to remove more than 30 tons of trash and cover graffiti with 
about 20,000 gallons of paint.

OFFICIALS DENY ACCUSATIONS OVER PANEL MAKEUP 
</P>

<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens and other officials Wednesday denied accusations that 
African Americans were kept off a 14-member city task force on hate crimes and 
Givens said she expects some will be added to the task force later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware at the time (the group's members were chosen) that there was not 
an African American, and I realized that was a missing component," Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the idea all along was that this would evolve into a committee of people 
that would be more and more inclusive. This was never meant to be an exclusive 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 Givens said race was not the only criteria used in forming the task force, 
which includes two Latinos, one member of Filipino descent, one of Korean 
descent, three of Armenian descent and seven other whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the members are a rabbi, a former head of the Glendale Chamber of 
Commerce's cultural exchange committee, an expert on senior citizen issues, and 
people who have worked on intercultural relations with the local Police 
Department and school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was hurriedly formed by Givens after vandals sprayed 
anti-Armenian slogans on the headquarters of an Armenian scouting organization 
in May. Givens said she tried to put together a group that represented 
Glendale's ethnic and social groups as best she could, taking recommendations 
from community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, at the recommendation of the task force, the City Council established 
a city response team to promote public condemnation of hate crimes, offer 
counseling to victims and help with graffiti cleanup and property repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was condemned by an African American activist, Emzy Veazy III, who 
excoriated the mayor for not including black representatives on the task force 
and demanded that a new group be created with black members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is selective in their categorization of hate crimes," Veazy said. 
"The black community is continually excluded from these kinds of concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans made up less than 2% of the 184,000 population of Glendale 
in the 1990 census, but their numbers were steadily growing, jumping from 428 
in the 1980 census to 2,065 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Glendale school district, the number of African American 
students has roughly doubled in the past 10 years, from about 138 in 1984 to 
about 340 today. But they are far outnumbered by other minorities, including 
Armenians and Armenian Americans -- of which there are an estimated 40,000 in 
Glendale -- and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 An African American businessman heads the local Junior Chamber of Commerce and 
an African American woman ran for the Glendale school board two years ago. But 
some members of the hate crimes task force contend it has no African American 
member primarily because there are few prominent African Americans in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double-edged problem," said Chahe Keuroghelian, the Police 
Department's cultural relations coordinator and a member of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, the city has not been able to recognize local African 
American leaders and encourage them to participate. On the other hand, when 
African Americans are the second-largest victim of hate crimes in the city, you 
anticipate they will come forward on an issue like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, when the city began keeping statistics on crimes perpetrated 
against people because of race, religion, age, gender or sexual orientation, 59 
such incidents have been reported. People of Armenian descent have been the 
target of 20 such crimes, while African Americans have been the victims of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the numbers in Glendale, the African American population is 
about 2%," said Herman Sillas, a task force member and a lawyer who specializes 
in human relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the 14 of us were put together as a starting block, but there will be 
other persons added in the future, including African Americans and other ethnic 
groups that were excluded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale officials said another problem is that there was no precedent 
dictating how the members of a city-sponsored task force on ethnic relations 
should be chosen.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOBILE HOME ON SAUGUS HILL UPSETS NEIGHBORS, 
CITY COUNCIL; REAL ESTATE: TEACHER SUGGESTS A GOOD ENOUGH FINANCIAL OFFER FROM 
THOSE DISTURBED BY HER PRESENCE MIGHT ENTICE HER TO LEAVE.

 A woman who has moved a mobile home onto an empty lot in a neighborhood of 
custom-built homes has every right to be there, city staffers told irate 
neighbors and City Council members Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report during a City Council meeting, the staff members suggested 
that residents of the quiet Saugus neighborhood of single-family homes make 
their peace with the mobile home owner, Carol Wise, who took out appropriate 
permits before moving the home onto the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of residents on hand for the meeting were in no mood for peaceful 
coexistence. They were especially outraged by city planner Rich Henderson's 
suggestion that they "work together to make the mobile home an asset to the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperated City Council members said their only option was to initiate 
negotiations to buy the property. But this hardly mollified neighborhood 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something's wrong when the City Council requests a staff report regarding a 
mobile home on a residential lot and they receive a gallon of whitewash, one 
quart of gloss and the recommendation by Rodney King, 'Can we all get along?' " 
said Richard Trimble, president pro tem of the neighborhood's Galaxy Highlands 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The association had been inactive for several years, but came to life with the 
arrival of Wise's mobile home earlier this month. Several of the residents said 
they feared the mobile home's presence would decrease their property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, who was also at the meeting, said she had planned to move into the 
mobile home on the winding Barbacoa Drive when improvements, including an 
attached garage and covered porch, were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school teacher said her affection for the well-kept neighborhood was 
rapidly diminishing, but she had no intention of moving if it meant losing the 
$145,000 she has invested in home and property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the City Council members would be more in tune with upholding 
the law than pandering to public opinion," Wise said after the meeting. "(But) 
offer me enough and I'll leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The city just might. Council members, who have been hounded by complaints from 
the residents, voted unanimously at the meeting to enter negotiations with Wise 
over a buyout of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson suggested that "all parties involved," 
including the homeowners group, meet and discuss how it could be financed. He 
said some of the money could come from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the role of the city is to take a leadership role, saying 'We made a 
mistake here,' " he said in an interview Wednesday. He suggested that Wise not 
demand an inflated price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she's going to want to live in that neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeowners said they would be willing to pay several hundred 
dollars apiece toward a buyout. "It's something I would seriously consider," 
said Jeff Miller, vice president pro tem of the homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot is one of four on a hillside that had been vacant since the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake and only recently declared safe for building. Pederson 
suggested the properties could be made into a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also took Henderson's suggestion that they draft an ordinance that 
would prohibit mobile homes from being placed on such lots. There is a state 
law already in place that allows cities to prohibit mobile homes more than 10 
years old being placed on residential lots (Wise's is 15 years old), but that 
law did not exist when Wise applied for her building permits, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said it will probably take at least 60 to 90 days before such an 
ordinance would be ready for approval.

SANTA CLARITA MOVES TO ANNEX PARK THE COUNTY CAN NO LONGER MAINTAIN; 
RECREATION: IF ALL GOES WELL, PEOPLE WHO VISIT BOUQUET PARK WON'T NOTICE THE 
CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
 A park that Los Angeles County officials say they can no longer afford to 
maintain will probably be rescued by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council voted Tuesday to start the application process 
to annex the 10.5-acre Bouquet Park now owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, park-goers will hardly notice the change in ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 City softball, basketball, tennis and other programs are already offered at 
the park throughout the year by an arrangement Santa Clarita has had with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always used it for our programs and facilities," said Rick Putnam, 
director of the city Parks, Recreation and Community Services department. 
</P>
<P>
 While recreation activities will continue, officials say the workload of 
another park is a strain for city workers. There are currently 10 city parks in 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a real stretch on our staffing," Putnam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has actually been leasing Bouquet Park for $1 since last fall, 
when Los Angeles County began jettisoning its recreation areas to reduce 
maintenance costs. A total of 11 county parks are now leased to cities and an 
environmental group is acting as the temporary caretaker of another, according 
to Joan Rupert, facilities planner for the county's Parks and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is among the first of the cities to annex the parks, an action 
supported by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our financial status hasn't changed," Rupert said. Santa Clarita's 
application to take over Bouquet Park must be approved by the Local Agency 
Formation Commission, the county's boundary-setting agency. The review process 
is expected to take six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business Tuesday, council members discussed a change made in the work 
schedule for city employees earlier this year that has them staying longer each 
workday in exchange for receiving every other Friday off. 
</P>
<P>
 The modified schedule was enacted to meet South Coast Air Quality Management 
District requirements that call for agencies with 100 or more workers to reduce 
car trips. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is difficult to track the actual air quality benefit, residents have 
certainly noticed the City Hall closures. This month, city employees had three 
Fridays off, including one that stretched the Labor Day weekend into a four-day 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not happy with this program," said Councilwoman Jan Heidt. "I have not 
been happy from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the council members said they've received calls and letters from 
citizens about the closures, and said they would like to explore alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees previously worked a modified schedule with half of them off 
Mondays, but department heads said the half-staffing days were not productive.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMFORT; IT'LL BE COLD SOON. NO, REALLY. TIME TO BUNDLE UP

 Forget your coat? That won't be likely if you're sporting one of this season's 
long shearling overcoats or other memorable outerwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers have created all kinds of unforgettable coats for the coming big 
chill. There are coats of many colors, materials and shapes -- short or long, 
full or fitted, belted or loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Many styles flow like never before. There are sweeping A-line swing coats that 
move with the body. Some coats are inspired by the 1940s; they come fitted to 
the waist and flare all the way to the ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are little car coats that tie around the middle and reach to the thigh 
and long, three-button coats made of soft, cushy wool and cashmere blends. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring out the beast in people, there are coats covered in fake fur. Others 
are made of genuine leather and animal skins, the oldest materials known to man 
for keeping warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers from Calvin Klein to Dolce & Gabbana have developed a sheep 
mentality regarding coats, using shearling on collars, cuffs or the entire 
garment. Calvin Klein indulged heavily in the woolly stuff, creating a long 
coat entirely covered in dark brown shearling ($2,150 at Barneys New York in 
Costa Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
 People began buying up shearling coats as early as August, says Don Witkowski, 
vice president and divisional merchandise manager of men's clothing at Barneys 
New York in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shearling's been selling well, even in Southern California, because it's 
lightweight. It's uncanny the way it's taken off," Witkowski says. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who feel sheepish in shearling, Barneys has coats in leather, suede 
and soft wovens that remind one of wool blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fun with jeans and sweaters or over a sport coat," Witkowski says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce & Gabbana created a short, loose coat out of a heavy charcoal-colored 
ribbed knit that feels as comfortable as an old sweater but has a lot more 
style ($885). Another relaxed style is Barneys' loose-fitting jacket of wool 
plaid in earthy shades of ecru and gray ($445) and a soft, three-button coat in 
buttery black suede ($695). All are available at Barneys in South Coast Plaza, 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Emporio Armani's fashion-forward coats this season are wool-cashmere 
swing coats, faux fur car coats and long princess coats with banded collars and 
fitted bodices that flare at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes them unique is we take classic styles and make them in 
non-traditional fabrics," says Courtney Chamine, spokeswoman for Emporio Armani 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearling appears on everything from bomber jackets to long overcoats. One 
men's collarless overcoat is covered in tan-colored shearling ($730), available 
at the Emporio Armani boutique in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's really fun and youthful," Chamine says. "There's a twist to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Classic coat styles also get a wilder look thanks to fake fur. There's a car 
coat for women that's covered in plush fake chinchilla ($790). 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be worn with a great wool sweater and velvet skirt. It's meant to be 
playful," Chamine says. 
</P>
<P>
 How to work a fake chinchilla coat or shearling overcoat into the wardrobe? 
Chamine says the key is to mix materials. For instance, she recommends wearing 
a pair of suede or cashmere gloves and a velvet beret with the chinchilla car 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking a lot of different elements and putting them together into a chic 
outfit," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the luxurious fakes, Western wear designers are creating 
ranch-style coats out of authentic natural materials. They're using genuine 
skins as well as finds such as arrowheads and turquoise beads to create jackets 
with character, according to Ted Greve, buyer and general manager of Out of 
Santa Fe in Fashion Island Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going back to their roots," Greve says. Many make their jackets by 
hand out of goat-, calf- and deerskin. Some coats have hand-crafted details 
such as fringe, braiding and whip-stitching. Hand-braided leather trim adorns a 
black leather jacket by Ren Ellis ($655), while long fringe decorates a 
wheat-colored pigskin jacket by Patricia Wolf ($595). 
</P>
<P>
 Designer/artist Robert Bowley of Santa Fe hand-paints his jackets with 
pictures of Indians, horses and other Western motifs. One of his deerskin 
jackets has a mountain lion painted on the back ($1,850). 
</P>
<P>
 Dusters, rugged-looking, canvas overcoats, are another favorite with people 
who prefer natural, back-to-basics cover-ups. Dusters were originally designed 
for riding a horse (hence the split up the back), but they've proved popular 
with city slickers. They're available at Out of Santa Fe for about $150 to 
$250. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are moving away from processed, synthesized looks," Greve says.

A PERSONAL DISCOVERY OF SMALL TOWN, U.S.A.

 When you get to the fork in the road, take it.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Yogi Berra 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the back-road towns that are now my home and in the little cafes where I 
linger too long over coffee and idle conversation, I have become an oddity, 
like some dispossessed traveler from another age. 
</P>
<P>
 People gather around my bicycle, as they must have around the first Model T 
Fords that came to town 70 years ago, and want to know what peril I have 
encountered on the road and where I'm coming from and what's in my saddlebags. 
"Orville, take a look here," one man said to his friend in Frankewing, Tenn. 
"This fella's got a cellular telephone on-board." 
</P>
<P>
 California-bound, I pulled into Memphis, three weeks and 980 miles from home 
in northern Virginia. From my motel, I can hear the steady, monotone hum of 
cars and trucks headed westward on Interstate 40 -- a straight, 2,000-mile shot 
to Barstow without so much as a traffic light to slow their pace. Their drivers 
will beat me there by weeks but will know no more about America when they 
arrive than they did when they left. 
</P>
<P>
 There are small blessings to be counted in Memphis: a place to wash my 
clothes, another to get a glass of wine with dinner, a third to buy a set of 
inner tubes for my bike. Still, I find the city is not a welcome sight after 
dawdling through a world of drive-in movie theaters, restaurants with carhops 
and country roads where stalks of harvested tobacco dry in weathered wood 
sheds. I do not intend to stay long. 
</P>
<P>
 The local newspaper informs me that almost half the 11th-graders surveyed by 
the city know someone who has been shot, and one in five carries a weapon to 
school for protection. Although I have many enemies on the open road -- all 
cars, most dogs, a few rednecks, every pothole -- I feel more vulnerable, more 
a stranger, here than I do alone, gliding silently through Soddy-Daisy and 
Monteagle and McBurg, the success or failure of my days measured in hills 
conquered and miles covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and your bicycle are one of the strangest things to come through town but 
not the strangest," a woman in Bean Station, Tenn., said to me a week ago. "The 
strangest was a man on a pack horse two years ago, just after the big blizzard. 
He was going coast to coast and I remember saying to him, 'Don't you worry? 
There's so much meanness in the land now. You've always got to be so careful.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Bean Station isn't much of a town, just a crossroads on Route 11 really, done 
in by the interstate that had cut through the mountains a generation ago. Like 
most of the other little towns that stretch through the foothills of Appalachia 
and the Smokies, it is struggling to survive and everyone around looks 
middle-aged and tired.  
</P>
<P>
 I washed my laundry in my sink at the motor court and hung it out to dry on 
the barbed-wire fence by the cow pasture outside my window. It was 5 p.m. I 
pumped air into my tires, filled my water bottles, studied the map and wondered 
how I'd pass the evening. The highway was deserted. There was nothing to do but 
wait for nightfall and, at last, first light, when I could roll on again. 
</P>
<P>
 On my way here, I'd peer around the bend of a new road, hoping to discover 
some charming Southern village from the cover of an old Saturday Evening Post. 
But there were precious few. In town after town, a video store and tanning 
salon had replaced the barber shop and movie theater as the bedrock of Main 
Street, and in the stillness of the dark, quiet evening I could hear the 
labored breathing of Small Town, America. 
</P>
<P>
 I left Bean Station early, heading for Memphis and the Mississippi that would 
carry me into Arkansas. At the end of a five-mile climb up Jasper Mountain, I 
happened upon three old men sitting on tree trunks at the peak. They were 
selling watermelons and firewood. One of them was whittling a chunk of oak into 
what appeared to be a walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you making?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothin'," he said. "I don't make nothin'. I just whittle." 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, an 86-year-old farmer named Dale, told me how there hadn't even 
been a road up the mountain when he bought his first car in the 1920s, for 
$400. He asked me what I'd paid for my bike, and I mumbled, hoping he wouldn't 
fully hear, "Twice what you did for the car." He offered me an apple and spat a 
stream of tobacco juice. Then he said: "I always meant to go to California but 
I never did and now I'm too old. Now, ain't that a sad thing?" Off and Pedaling

GETTING REAL; MANNEQUINS OR HUMANS? ADEL ROOTSTEIN'S BEAUTIES LOOK SO ALIVE 
YOU'D SWEAR THEY BREATHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Have you ever bumped into someone while shopping, turned to make amends and 
realized you were speaking to a mannequin? 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are it was a "Rootstein" -- a particular brand of fiberglass beauty 
crafted by the London-based Adel Rootstein Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, Rootsteins -- as they are known in the trade -- have reigned as 
the supermodels of the mannequin business. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrospective tracing the evolution of this Cadillac of mannequins from 
Carnaby Street to the Rave era opened Wednesday at the Fashion Institute of 
Design and Merchandising (FIDM) in Downtown. "Mannequins -- An Exhibition of 
the Work of Adel Rootstein" runs through Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Orfinik, curator of the show, describes Adel Rootstein -- who died two 
years ago -- as "a visionary who realized mannequins could have personality, 
drama and character." 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman Marcus creative director Kenneth Downing notes: "Adel was the first 
person to make mannequins realistic. She took them from stagnant presentations 
and made them active." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we learned Adel had passed away," Orfinik says, "we thought a 
retrospective would be an incredible tribute to a great artist. There had never 
been a Rootstein exhibit before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '60s, Adel Rootstein -- a young display artist -- arrived in 
London from her native South Africa. Carnaby Street designers Mary Quant, Ossie 
Clark and Zandra Rhodes were poised to unleash Day-Glo miniskirts, Op art 
blouses and huge plastic accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a tiny problem. The mannequins of the day didn't have the 
personalities to go with the mod clothes. With their haughty expressions and 
metal rods stuck up their backsides, the standard wax-headed, plaster-bodied 
mannequins looked more like socialite Babe Paley than London street kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Rootstein saw the designers' dilemma and recognized a business opportunity. 
She began making fiberglass mannequins modeled on young stars of the London 
club scene. More importantly, she cast them in exuberant poses -- no polite 
back-arched, knees-together, one-foot-slightly-in-front-of-the-other stances 
for Adel. Her mannequins crouched, they leaped, they hung from ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adel wanted the looks she saw on the street. What she saw was young, gawky, 
theatrical kids," says Michael Southgate, Rootstein creative director. "It was 
a time of an elegance revolt against Paris chic." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, she spotted the teen-aged Twiggy in a newspaper advertisement. 
Rootstein had the girl's 5-foot-4 likeness ready to sell to the stores at the 
same time Carnaby Street fashion went international. An army of Rootstein's 
spindly Twiggy mannequins usurped the aristocratic Babes, and Adel's girls took 
over the display windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Rootstein died in 1992, but her career-launching Twiggy mannequin is in 
attendance at the FIDM retrospective, as are Joan Collins, Joanna ("Absolutely 
Fabulous") Lumley, and models Pat Cleveland and Dianne de Witt. The beauties 
are even lovelier immortalized in fiberglass, with legs a little longer, chins 
a little firmer, eyes a bit larger and waistlines trimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make life casts. The models are sculpted," points out Southgate, who 
accompanied the exhibit to Los Angeles with mannequin sculptor John Taylor and 
designer Kevin Arpino. "We're not selling real people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a fashion collection, a new group of Rootstein mannequins is unveiled 
twice each year. Each group has a name, and new models are showcased in an 
elaborate setting. Clothes are designed especially for the mannequins, and once 
the orders are taken about 20,000 are produced. 
</P>
<P>
 A mannequin can run $800 to $1,200, but it will last a lifetime. Still, as 
with a fashion collection, a mannequin can go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Twiggy mannequin was unveiled, for example, it was touted as 
lifelike. But contrasted with later Rootstein figures, the mannequin looks 
quite artificial: Its features are extreme and Twiggy's trademark eye makeup is 
ghoulishly overemphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes in the fashion of musculature and makeup, mannequins can 
be recycled. For example, some '70s models were unearthed recently from the 
storage closets at Neiman Marcus. They were all clenched fists, aggressive 
stances and strong faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their original makeup looks like that on Nadja Auermann on the cover of 
Harper's Bazaar," Downing says. Very in keeping with the current neo-'70s 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take care of them and keep the ones in storage covered, they last 
forever, but of course that's in a perfect world. I'd say Rootsteins last 20 to 
25 years," says Michael Bewley, visual coordinator for Saks Fifth Avenue. 
Seventy percent of Saks' 150 mannequins at the Beverly Hills store are 
Rootsteins. The percentage goes up at I. Magnin. Diane Gatterdam, vice 
president of visual merchandising, estimates that 90% of her store's mannequins 
are Adel's girls. Neiman's Downing claims to be a 90% user as well. Nordstrom 
uses mannequins only in its display windows and prefers to use mannequins from 
Los Angeles-based Greneker. 
</P>
<P>
 Should a mannequin need a face lift, her head is simply sent back to the 
company for refinishing. A new Rootstein makeup job will run $40 to $55. When 
the needed repairs are more than skin-deep, the mannequin is sent back for body 
work. Cracks, chips and broken fingers can be fixed, and a new coat of skin 
color applied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a mannequin hierarchy, which, although very subtle, is played out at 
Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills. The sportswear mannequins look a little younger 
and a bit rounder. The models in the Armani and Chanel areas are a head taller, 
slimmer and not quite so friendly looking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have specific mannequins for specific areas. We choose them depending on 
lifestyle and the customer," Downing says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heroines" -- with their realistic bodies, stylized heads and hands, and 
makeup-less faces -- reside in designer sportswear departments in all Neiman 
Marcus stores. The swanlike, taller and thinner "Calendar Girls" hang around 
Couture, of course. Those casual girls in the store's leisure sportswear 
department are from the "Snapshot" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are careful about who we are appealing to," Downing says. "It would be 
obvious if you put a flat-footed 'Snapshot' girl in with a 'Calendar.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the real problem is getting clothes on any of their 34-24-35 bodies. It's 
like dressing a 35-pound infant, says Christy Whistler, a fashion coordinator 
for the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to dress them in parts, taking off the arms and hands and sometimes 
removing the legs from the torso," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And inevitably, no sooner is a mannequin dressed than a customer asks for the 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers shop right off the mannequins, in the display windows and on 
the selling floor. But that's what mannequins are for," Downing says. "They are 
a selling tool." 
</P>
<P>
 FIDM's Orfinik prefers to think of them as works of art. "We look at 
mannequins all the time and don't realize what a detailed art form they are," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are getting their day in the gallery.

 In the treacherous world of romance fiction, a reader could always count on a 
few certainties: 
</P>
<P>
 Bodice-ripping covers of the latest releases would smolder alongside the 
incendiary tabloid headlines at the supermarket checkout. 
</P>
<P>
 The hero would be tall, dark and handsome. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroine would have the body of Cindy Crawford and the maturity of the 
Olsen twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Point of view? Feminine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending? Happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, even in the entrenched realm of romance that accounts for nearly half 
of all paperback sales, things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Pinnacle Books introduced a line in which the storyteller's voice 
drops into the masculine register. Named after its first entry -- "A Man's 
Touch," by Debra Falcon -- the series will release a new title each quarter, 
unless readers clamor for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's that heroine thing. Invariably, she was an 18-year-old virgin 
with cleavage you could get lost in. But two years ago Zebra Books debuted the 
To Love Again line -- contemporary tales of love between heroines and heroes 
for whom the bloom of youth -- if not the hormonal imperative -- has long 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with "To Love Again" and "The Time of Her Life," the publishing house 
produces two books a month about women who are divorced or widowed or have been 
supplanted by younger women. They deal with underachieving adult children, 
suffer breast cancer and doubt their ability ever again to engage in meaningful 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
 And the men? While romance-novel heroes have always tended to be tall and 
handsome, until recently they were rarely very dark. Although people of color 
have popped up in romance novels -- say, a Native American integrating a 
historical Western romance or an exotically good-looking stranger of mysterious 
but clearly mixed heritage -- the featured players generally have been as white 
as a Des Moines housewife in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer Pinnacle rewrote this rule as well, colorizing the genre with 
Arabesque, a line that publishes two books each month featuring multicultural 
characters and situations. So far, all have concerned African Americans, but 
Pinnacle plans to introduce Latino heroes and heroines next year, and Asian 
characters later. 
</P>
<P>
 The romantic fiction industry, it seems, finally recognizes that passion -- 
nay, even true abiding love -- is not limited to a homogenous population of 
young white naifs in which only women show emotion and only men take action. 
</P>
<P>
 All these changes are making the fantasy world look a bit more like the real 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The genesis of A Man's Touch, says Pinnacle Senior Editor Jennifer Sawyer, was 
a staff suggestion to portray a single man in the cover illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out a few books like that, but they didn't really catch on," she says, 
although the stories followed the romance formula. "For whatever reason, the 
traditional clinch scene always seemed to work" on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago the magazine Romantic Times was touting a male model with the 
traditional credentials and Pinnacle decided not only to employ the studly 
specimen on the cover, but to tell the story within from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted tall, dark and mysterious," Sawyer explains. "Essentially, A Man's 
Touch is historical romance, but it's not traditional historical romance." 
</P>
<P>
 The To Love Again stories, says Zebra Books Executive Editor Ann LaFarge, 
involve more than sexual reawakening and the thrill of coupledom. They are 
about finding "a whole new life -- a new career, a new man . . . making a 
move." 
</P>
<P>
 New love, she says, is only a part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LaFarge reports receiving positive letters from readers as young as 
18, To Love Again is aimed squarely at an older audience. The books are printed 
with larger type, and cover models often fall to the high side of 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were publishing into a strong and growing market -- older women 
with the time and money to enjoy life," she says in the promotional magazine 
produced by Kensington Publishing Corp., of which both Zebra and Pinnacle are 
imprints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers have fiddled with the formula before, but never have whole series 
dared to depart from the beloved norms responsible for 48% of all paperback 
book sales, says Kathryn Falk, owner of Romantic Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Falk notes that Silhouette (an imprint of the renowned Harlequin books) has 
published male point-of-view romances, but that Pinnacle is the first to offer 
a dedicated line. Likewise, Zebra is first so dedicated to the mature 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Silhouette, Avon, Doubleday and Dell have all broken the color barrier in 
single-title releases. Tiny Odyssey Books of Maryland has published African 
American romances since 1990 and will release four titles this year. But 
Arabesque is the first major line dedicated to multicultural stories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Holloway House Group issued Heartline 
Romances, which featured black characters. But, says executive editor Raymond 
Locke, "there was no market for them at the time." The company, which publishes 
fiction and nonfiction on multicultural topics, now releases only three or four 
historical romances a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Romance writer Sandra Kitt, who is African American, says when her first books 
came out in 1984, "all of my publishers' writers and their characters were 
white. . . . They knew not all of their readers were white, but they felt . . . 
if women of color are willing to read romances with white characters, why fool 
around with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1992, came the crossover best-selling success of Terry McMillan's 
"Waiting to Exhale," a book of popular fiction about middle-class black 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt believes that establishing Arabesque, for which her book, "Serenade," was 
one of two premiere titles in July, "was absolutely a business decision, but 
with good statistical reasons." She says nearly a quarter of romance fiction 
readers are not white and have money to spend on books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know a lot of women of color read (romance) books," Falk confirms. "As the 
population ratio changes you're going to see more books with Spanish 
(-speaking) heroines and Asian heroines and heroes, and that's just reflective 
of the reader." 
</P>
<P>
 Falk points out that the average reader devours 20 to 40 romance titles a 
month, and that about 120 are published monthly. Diversity is essential, which 
is why, she says, romance fiction has so many sub-genres (historical, Western, 
women in jeopardy) -- of which the mature, male and multicultural perspectives 
are the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These books cater to the reader with a voracious reading appetite, and like 
fashion, she doesn't want to read or wear the same thing all the time," Falk 
says, noting that the next big romance trend is erotica. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Shatzkin, director of advertising, promotions and publicity for 
Kensington Publishing, says that the company's considerable promotional effort, 
particularly for Arabesque, reflected more than the launch of a new line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a recognition of the size and power of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Harris, editor of the Arabesque books, says she "hopes to bring in 
people who never considered reading romance fiction because they could see it 
doesn't offer what they're looking for; it doesn't have someone who looks like 
them on the cover." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Kitt devoured romantic fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first introduction to what male-female relationships were like," 
she says. "And even though the characters were all white, that didn't bother me 
-- I was tied in to the love story." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she never read a story where the characters looked like her, Kitt 
always wanted to write about her culture. Now manager of library services for 
New York's American Museum, she sold her first book when the romance market was 
at its peak in the mid 1980s, and was the first African American writer to 
publish with Harlequin. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what makes a black romance different from a white romance, Kitt says 
that "the whole concept of love relationships -- marriage, conflict -- is 
pretty universal. What makes ethnic romance different is the subtleties, the 
texture of the story." 
</P>
<P>
 The hero of her "Serenade," for example, is a musician whose roots in jazz 
inform the tale of love found, lost and found again. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt doesn't write in dialect, but her characters do communicate in 
identifiably ethnic ways. In the black community of her youth, she says, women 
often expressed exasperation by sucking their teeth. "I grew up with that, and 
every black woman I know understands that (gesture). I described it in one of 
my books, and the white editor didn't understand it because she didn't have the 
(same) experience." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a major reason, Kitt suggests, that the publishing industry's executive 
ranks should be culturally diverse. "There has to be someone who understands 
the experience. . . . That's the only way you can decide if it's authentic to 
the culture you're writing about." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessary to be African American, Kitt believes, to write a 
compellingly black story, but it's the unusual white person whose exposure to 
and understanding of the culture can impart authenticity. Kitt's more skilled 
at writing stories with white characters than most white writers are in a black 
milieu, she says, because "as an African American, I've had to adjust to a 
society and culture that's predominantly white." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the (happily-ever-after) end, color is a decidedly tangential issue. 
Does the heroine get the guy, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 "My responsibility as an African American writing romances with black 
characters is to stay true to the culture and the tradition, but to remember . 
. . what my audience wants," Kitt says. "No matter how I texture the story, 
what they're primarily interested in is the love story between the hero and 
heroine. Everything else is dressing."

BY DESIGN; THE GLAMOUR QUEEN; PAMELA DENNIS MIXES SEXY WITH ELEGANT IN EVENING 
WEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Cindy Crawford, RuPaul or Jamie Lee Curtis turn on the glamour, they very 
often turn to designer Pamela Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis tangoed in a slinky Dennis dress at the end of "True Lies." The actress 
also wore the designer's short beaded dress to the film's London premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rolled it in a ball and carried it in my backpack," Curtis said. She and 
other Dennis fans -- who don't hesitate to drop $1,000 to $2,000 for an evening 
gown -- gathered at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills last week to see a trunk show of 
the designer's holiday and resort collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to look elegant and sexy at the same time," said the slender, 
blond 34-year-old designer, whose dresses are generally cut along simple, 
body-hugging lines. "There's a comeback of glamour, but it's a quiet glamour. 
There's less beading." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Hayman has carried Dennis' dresses since she started seven years ago 
(ultimately choosing a career in fashion over law school). Today she's one of 
the top three evening-wear labels in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Her holiday looks are varied: tiny dresses, mermaid gowns, tuxedos with 
cigarette pants, bust-enhancing Empire dresses, long columns and evening 
separates. The clothes are sexy enough to turn heads but fall a few raised 
eyebrows short of a Cosmo cover. For example, Dennis supplies nude liners under 
lace (in four shades to match various skin colors). Midriffs are never bared 
because her customer, she says, simply doesn't want to show that part of her 
anatomy. And skirts are almost always longer than 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis listens to her customers and credits part of her success to her 
willingness to be flexible. A strap, for example, might be widened to 
accommodate a bra. And the designer worried before the trunk show about the 
relative comfort of one particular style. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I don't know how this corset thing is going to do," she said of 
the season's ubiquitous built-in corset look. "But if it makes them feel 
secure, they'll wear it." By the end of the show, it turned out to be a 
bestseller, along with her little daytime suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Hayman doesn't release figures, but Dennis said a good trunk show can 
bring in $200,000, and this one, which carried on well after store closing, 
appeared to be right on track.

BY DESIGN; DOWN TO SIZE; KNOWN FOR GRAND WORKS, THESE ARTISTS ALSO TURN CLOTHES 
AND JEWELRY INTO ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Most people keep a discreet, reverent distance from art. But Pascal, Pal 
Kepenyes and Mercedes Lasarte -- three international artists currently 
exhibiting in Los Angeles -- want to draw collectors closer. 
</P>
<P>
 They beckon with art to wear -- similar, less costly versions of sculptures 
and paintings in museums and private collections around the world. They use 
silk, crystal, semiprecious gems and bronze for their wearable collectibles, 
which are signed, issued in limited editions and infused with the same spirit 
and magic, the same zest for life as their more monumental pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a poolside corner of Pascal's Beverly Hills home stands her most ambitious 
work: a four-ton green-glass seated torso sold recently to billionaire John 
Kluge for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just work hard and keep that hammer going," says the energetic, age-defying 
80-year-old artist, whose sculptures -- in Pennsylvania glass, Swarovski 
crystal or stainless steel -- and paintings on canvas or wood routinely fetch 
$10,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paint, I do stainless steel, I carve. You keep fresh going from one medium 
to the next," she explains after working with a hammer and chisel, glass shards 
flying dangerously close to her signature blond topknot and custom-made 
menswear. (The last time she wore a dress was 29 years ago, by request, for her 
daughter's wedding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although she can hear now, after four operations, she was born with a 
congenital malformation that rendered her nearly deaf. She lived in silence as 
a child and communicated through her drawings. Sent to Europe by a wealthy 
uncle to study sculpture, she fell under the spell of Impressionist painting 
instead. Decades later, she returned to the United States, bought the contents 
of an abandoned glass factory and developed her unique carving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, at the urging of her daughter, Jill Petty, Pascal launched a 
collection of crystal miniatures that can be worn or displayed. The jeweled 
pieces -- including a smug cat, a festive circus horse and a proud duchess -- 
are formed in molds rather than carved, cost $1,900 to $3,400 and are sold 
under license worldwide. Locally, they are available through the Dyansen 
Gallery in Beverly Hills and Liscot Enterprises in Los Angeles, the company run 
by Petty, her husband and their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by creativity and memories of hard times -- when, for example, the 
electricity was cut off in her home and studio -- the artist works five days a 
week starting at 6:30 a.m. She breaks for lunch, driving every day with her 
husband to the Four Seasons Hotel. And she means break . They purposely sit 
where they cannot see the Pascal painting that hangs in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taught to work with a fast brush," she can finish a painting in three hours. 
But sculptures, like the $25,000 painted stainless steel geisha girls on wheels 
that dot her two living rooms, take so many hours she loses count. 
</P>
<P>
 Her home is filled with her art: the decorative geishas who hold functional 
serving trays; crystal heads of women and Indian chiefs; paintings of trees, 
boats, wheat fields, young girls walking in the snow; huge stainless steel 
figures outside her poolside studio, and a life-size steel sen orita in a 
ruffled metal costume, which stands in the entrance hall. 
</P>
<P>
 She is willing to part with them all. "I'm only 80. I'm still young," she 
says, her perky topknot, confident voice and strong hands attesting to the 
truth of her words. "I might do something better." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pal Kepenyes, a Hungarian-born artist living in Acapulco, has been creating 
bronze sculptures and jewelry for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His wearable art, priced $300 to $1,000, was introduced recently at Fred 
Hayman in Beverly Hills. A showing of his sculptures is scheduled for October 
at the new Chac-Mool gallery in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The burly, blue-eyed artist says the pieces are of equal importance to him: 
"Every technical process connects. I get a lot of experience for the sculptures 
from my jewelry." And while a necklace of tail-to-tail mermaids might be 
lighthearted, his gift to Beverly Hills sends a more serious message. The 
sculpture, titled "Walls," stands in City Hall as a testimony to liberty and 
the sister-city relationship between Beverly Hills and Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, an optimist despite spending five years in a Hungarian prison for 
his anti-communist views, is fascinated with freedom, time and space. As a 
child and later as a student in Budapest and Paris, he says: "I was always 
looking back and I was also very futuristic. After art, my second favorite 
subject was space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alteration of material from nothing to nothing excites me," he adds, 
explaining why so many of his works have movable parts or flip sides to 
symbolize the inherent changes in life. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't like city life: "To me, it limits the human spirit." So he 
resides atop a high peak in a breathtaking home frequented by friends and 
collectors who happily participate in his evening ritual: In silence they all 
watch the sun set and make a wish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Argentine-born artist Mercedes Lasarte lives and works in her own hilltop 
haven -- a sun-drenched, Mediterranean-style home in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brightly colored scenes, which include bowls of succulent fruits, exotic 
women in repose and polo players in action, appear on canvas and silk. The 
canvases cost $3,500 to $7,500, and her ties, vests, kimonos and silk scarves 
(many of them large enough to double as sarongs) are $100 to $600. Her works 
are sold through the DeVorzon Gallery in Beverly Hills, which is open by 
appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
 The silk produces more vivid colors than canvas. And it requires a different 
set of skills. "The oil painting takes much longer," she explains. "I can do it 
slowly. It is like a pleasure. When I paint on silk, I have to go very fast, 
make fast decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 She starts with white fabric, sketches on it and colors every inch with 
special dyes. The finished work is stretched, then placed in a steamer for two 
hours, a process that sets the colors and allows dry cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Every artist has a muse; Lasarte's is her hearth. "I am always making the 
ultimate painting for my fireplace," she says. Her sarong-sized scarves are 
large enough to fill the bill, and when they are hung from plexiglass rods, 
rather than framed, she categorizes them as "earthquake art." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, she created T-shirts and postcards for her now-defunct 
studio-galleries in Santa Monica and Venice. And she still thinks fondly of the 
postcards: "The original idea was to support my gallery. But I love to sell to 
lots of people. To me, to sell one card, one painting is the same thing. 
Someone likes what I do, wants to have it. And there is the possibility of it 
going all around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The T-shirts, however, "weren't a very good idea. They were too much work. The 
silk is so much more satisfying. People who buy it are like sybarites. They 
love it." Her $100 ties are "the easiest to sell. I didn't know that men buy so 
many ties -- and it's men, not their wives." 
</P>
<P>
 An athlete who Rollerblades, golfs, plays tennis, swims and adores polo, she 
is also a world traveler and confessed artistic late bloomer who has changed 
her direction: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always postponing the process of creation. Now it is part of my life. I 
have to paint. It is the same as if you have to talk to someone on the phone."

FASHION; BRIGITTE BARDOT, THEN AND NOW; IN HER YOUTH, THE ACTRESS WAS A SEX 
OBJECT. NOW, IT SEEMS, SHE IS AN OBJECT ONLY OF RIDICULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES BREMNER, TIMES NEWSPAPERS LTD., LONDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two screen goddesses reaching their 60th birthdays this month, it would 
be nice to draw a parallel moral on time and fading beauty, but Sophia Loren 
and Brigitte Bardot have taken so differently to senior citizenship that we are 
left to muse on the cruelty of the coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren has worn the years well, aging with her myth. Her birthday pictures, all 
glamour and elegance, epitomize the modern dream that time's hand can be 
stayed, preserving youth and sex appeal into a seventh decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bardot's case, the lesson is of a different kind. There are no Loren-style 
glamour shots to celebrate B.B.'s birthday. Her only public outing of late has 
been to defend the wolf of the Vosges, an elusive animal that has made 
headlines for killing sheep. "Just leave him alone," she pleaded to the hunters 
who are out to bag the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bardot's sun-weathered and unlifted features are familiar from her 
infrequent appearances on behalf of dogs, donkeys, whales, bulls, horses and 
all the other fauna to which she has devoted herself since, as she puts it, "I 
gave my beauty and my youth to men." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever jealous of her image, she sends lawyers leaping to protect her from 
anything outside those tightly controlled occasions where the light is kept 
soft and television cameras avoid close-ups of the famous pout and the hair 
still piled high, the look once copied by females around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardot has not forgiven that world, which she once said robbed her of her 
life, and the feeling in her homeland this month seems to be somewhat mutual. 
Just as B.B. transcended movies to stand as the symbol of an epoch, her aging 
seems to be resented in a France obsessed these days by its lost innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of Bardot that women do not exist. She killed them like Parker 
killed the saxophone," L'Express magazine noted recently as one television 
channel devoted a night to her films. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardot has long been the source of unease in France. Even though she emerged 
in retirement in the 1970s as a national monument, with her likeness given to 
Marianne, the allegory of the Republic whose bust sits in every town hall, she 
was reviled by many in her years of greatest fame. Women spat at her in the 
street, priests denounced her from the pulpit, and the press chronicled with 
morbid delight the misfortunes of her marriages, the abandonment of her baby 
son and her suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Vadim, her Svengali, had barely launched her in "And God Created Woman" 
in 1956 when the intellectuals were already trying to fathom the deep trouble 
that she was inflicting on the French psyche. In a celebrated essay, Simone de 
Beauvoir diagnosed the threat she posed as a force of nature. Catholic, 
strait-laced France, said an approving De Beauvoir, could not swallow such a 
shameless hussy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardot was a femme fatale who was not a cinematic artifice like Ava Gardner or 
Marilyn Monroe, but a barefoot waif with a predatory sexual appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren, De Beauvoir wrote in 1959, was the former type, a "full-blown woman" 
shaped by moguls to appeal to men. Bardot, in turn, was "the perfect specimen 
of the ambiguous nymph." As France knew, Juliette, the wanton gamine of "And 
God Created Woman," was Bardot herself, not a figment of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 With the birthday, France is being reminded of those pre-Pill years, when 
happiness was a white convertible speeding to Saint-Trop' down the Route 
Nationale 7. A younger generation, saturated with the vulgarities of Madonna 
and the sexless B.B. mimicry of Claudia Schiffer, is being offered a glimpse of 
a seemingly sweeter age. 
</P>
<P>
 In old black-and-white newsreels, B.B. dazzles along with those other marvels 
of Gallic superiority, the DS Citroen, the Caravelle jet and the haughty 
silhouette of Charles de Gaulle. The documentaries and the rebroadcasting of 
some of her four dozen films are reminding the country of the way a single 
Frenchwoman held the world in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 B.B., we are reminded, achieved her initial glory thanks to America, where 
Vadim's film, with its nudity and lovemaking, was a scandalous sensation after 
it flopped initially at home. No French product since then has managed to grip 
the American imagination in the way that Bardot did, and she never even worked 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 As an export industry, De Beauvoir said, she had become more powerful than 
Renault cars. In 1960 France, an age before pop stars or sportsmen had scaled 
the celebrity heights, a poll showed that B.B. was the main topic of 
conversation in 47% of all households. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, watching those old newsreels, you can see the torment that was being 
inflicted on a woman whom France would not allow to grow up and lead her own 
life. "She only pleased us on condition that she was not allowed to exist," Le 
Figaro remarked recently.  
</P>
<P>
 You can see the pain already there in the newsreels as she faces walls of 
reporters whose questions seem as archaic in 1994 as their trilby hats and big 
box cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think of free love, Miss Bardot?" they asked her in New York on 
her first American trip, in 1965. "I don't think when I am making love," she 
replied. "Will you still be like this at 60?" another man asked. "I'll never be 
60 because, between then and now, I'm certain science will make a lot of 
progress," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, she was right, because the Bardot who turned 60 on Wednesday 
considers herself to be entering the third decade of another life, the one she 
began when she abandoned acting in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand that everything before my work with animals has 
nothing to do with me," she told Jeffrey Robinson, her latest biographer, 
earlier this year. "The woman who made those movies, that's not me." 
</P>
<P>
 For France this month, she is two people. There is the B.B. of the cinema, 
brought down by the trail of broken marriages and self-indulgence, but fondly 
remembered as the icon of France's postwar rebirth. And there is Mme. Bardot -- 
the embittered animal activist, scourge of horse butchers, nuisance to 
politicians, wife of a far-right political figure and butt of jokes at the 
corner bistro. This is the one that Globe magazine described the other day as 
"ridiculously eternal."

GORDON GRANT, TIMES REPORTER, DIES AT 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon Grant, a Los Angeles Times writer whose more than two decades covering 
South County and its maritime affairs earned him a harbor park site named in 
his honor, died Wednesday at South Coast Medical Center. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Grant's family, he died peacefully at 3 p.m. after a lengthy 
hospital stay for a failing heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant began his journalism career at the Chicago Times in 1935. He moved to 
the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, which sent him to Europe as a war correspondent 
during World War II. During the last years of that war, Grant lost sight in one 
eye after a shell burst near him. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined The Times in 1955 and was among the staff assigned to open The Times 
Orange County newsroom in Costa Mesa in 1968. He was assigned to South County 
coverage, writing articles on a variety of topics but gaining a reputation for 
articles dealing with wildlife, maritime topics and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired in 1989 and soon afterward was honored by the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors, which named a bayside picnic area in his honor at Dana Point 
Harbor, an area he had covered since its opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "This award for Gordon is long overdue," said Eric Jessen, a county harbors, 
beaches and parks official during a ceremony Oct. 22, 1990, to dedicate the 
picnic ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A plaque unveiled at the ceremony praised Grant's "warm, sensitive articles 
about Orange County's characters and wildlife, its wilderness and parks, its 
harbors and beaches," saying they "enriched this county, inspiring respect for 
natural beauty in everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, in accepting the honor, said, "By and large, people have the idea that 
newspaper reporters are ink-stained wretches who work at the bottom of the wage 
scale. But when something like this happens, who cares about a paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant worked long past the typical age of retirement and did not quit until 
his eyesight failed in 1989 at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordon Grant was truly a special person," said George Cotliar, managing 
editor of The Times who in the early 1970s was editor of the Orange County 
edition where Grant was assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordon was one of the best feature writers I have ever known," Cotliar said. 
"And the closer he came to the ocean, the more beautiful his prose became." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district included the harbors 
and wild lands about which Grant so often wrote, said he was saddened by the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him to have been a respected and well-loved journalist whose love for 
the coast and his neighbors endeared him over many years," Riley said. "I'm 
pleased that we were able to honor him during his lifetime so that he would 
know of the high esteem he was held by his friends and neighbors and 
professional acquaintances." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is survived by his wife of 30 years, Gloria Grant; his daughters Patty 
Grant of Marina del Rey and Linda Grant Vars of Mound, Minn.; stepdaughters 
Amanda Bereny and Lisa Bereny, both of Oakland, and by numerous grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife said that during a private ceremony, Grant's ashes will be scattered 
at sea off the Orange County coast, as was his wish. No funeral services are 
planned.

 Paid attendance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa 
during the eight performances by the American Ballet Theatre hit a company low 
of 14,755, or 63% of capacity, according to a center spokesman. The 
performances of Kenneth MacMillan's "Manon" and shorter repertory which ended 
Sunday grossed about $506,228.By contrast, the premiere last December of Kevin 
McKenzie's "Nutcracker," the ABT artistic director's version of the perennial 
favorite, brought in 77.5% of capacity and $1.3 million. (Performances of 
"Giselle" and shorter repertory at the beginning of 1993 grossed $686,000 at 
73.5% of capacity; "Don Quixote" in 1992 earned $641,000 at 76.3% of capacity). 
Center officials had no explanation for the drop-off in attendance, the 
spokesman said, except to note that the unfamiliarity of "Manon" may have been 
a factor.

GROUNDLINGS AT 20: DEFT TURNS AT LAUGHTER; 'GOOD & TWENTY' REVIEW OPENS WITH A 
SOUND PROBLEM THAT DEMONSTRATES THEIR SMOOTH PROFESSIONALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's 20th birthday party for the Groundlings focused primarily on the 
company's alumni. But it wasn't just a homecoming. The weekend opening of the 
troupe's latest revue, "Groundlings Good & Twenty," proved that the current 
model remains a lean, mean comedy machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewed performance began with an announcement from director Deanna 
Oliver that the sound system was broken, so the opening sketch, "Boogie 
Nights," would be skipped. No problem. The unlisted substitute, "Caution," was, 
well, a caution -- a disaster movie spoof in which a group of office workers 
confronted a deadly wet floor, with pitch-perfect performances by writers Jim 
Jackman and Cheri Oteri, plus Phil LaMarr and John Cervenka. 
</P>
<P>
 This ability to reach into a bag of tricks and come up with something that's 
just as funny as the already announced sketches is a testament to the depth of 
this Groundlings team and its sense of smooth professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this Groundlings outing may have seemed especially sharp because 
Oliver restricted the always risky group improv to one set early in the program 
-- and that one set, a quick charades game among four disparate brothers, was 
as funny as most of the 19 rehearsed sketches. It also helped that the sound 
system was quickly fixed so that the two-man band of Willie Etra and Teddy 
Zambetti, and the company's sound effects, got to show off after all. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Groundlings themselves. It was quite a night for Jennifer Joyce, 
shifting with precision from a distressed Kathie Lee Gifford, to a woman 
repulsed by her date's (Tim Bagley's) odd laugh, to a teen-ager impatient with 
her annoying "Grandma Strawberry," to a weary rural mom, to a disgruntled bra 
purchaser. But then most of the others executed similarly deft turns, if not 
quite as many of them. Karen Maruyama, for example, transformed from "Grandma 
Strawberry" into Judge Lance Ito doing a stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other sketches also addressed local subjects, and Mike Hitchcock wrote 
or co-wrote the most successful: a conversation with Steve Kehela about the 
relative merits of Westwood and the Valley, and a crisp musical satire of 
CityWalk, sung to the tune of "Camelot." The biggest visual gag of the evening 
came in the appearances of Mary Scheer and Jim Wise as Faye Dunaway and Andrew 
Lloyd Webber on their day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley and LaMarr did a sharp bit about a middle-aged man who wants to be a 
homeboy, Oteri and Cervenka were a charming pair of freeway ramp dwellers and 
directions mavens, and Michael McDonald demonstrated enough quick wit as a fake 
talk show host to inspire the hope that he might someday do it for real. A few 
less stellar sketches were at least short. 
</P>

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: GOLF JUST GOT LAZIER, BUT IS ANYONE TEED OFF? YOU'VE GOT 
TO BE KIDDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 STEP RIGHT UP: Golfers don't have to run. They don't have to walk fast. Some 
don't even break a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough just bending over and placing that ball on the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they don't even have to do that at a practice range in Carson, where a new 
automated system tees the ball for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just about as close to lazy man's golf as you can get," said Roy Forbes, 
general manager of the Dominguez Golf Course and Practice Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The operators, American Golf Corp., say the $2-million system is the first of 
its kind in the United States. Once a debit card is inserted into the machine, 
the tee lowers into the ground and then reappears with a ball on top of it. 
When sensors show the ball is no longer on the tee, it automatically lowers to 
pick up another. 
</P>
<P>
 With this system, a bucket of balls that used to take 45 minutes to hit now 
takes 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Forbes: "It's not a gimmick. (Players) really seem to appreciate the 
convenience."

 CLIFFHANGER: You might call Tara a news hound, although she is actually an 
8-month-old Argentinian dogo, which resembles a bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Palos Verdes puppy fell off a 40-foot cliff into a cactus-infested 
area near Yacht Harbor Drive Monday, where she spent the night. Tuesday 
morning, the Los Angeles chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals was called to the scene and spent 3 1/2 hours attempting to rescue 
the purebred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to almost a dozen SPCA officials, three news helicopters were 
abuzz at the scene, said Rose Channer of the SPCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two SPCA officials successfully rappelled down the cliffs, put Tara in a sling 
and carried her up to safety. Tuesday afternoon, she was recovering from what a 
veterinarian termed minor injuries in the Golden Cove Animal Hospital in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not minor, however, was the cost of the rescue, which Madeline Bernstein, SPCA 
executive director, said could reach thousands of dollars.

 DON'T GO, 90210: If "Beverly Hills, 90210" wants to house its characters at a 
Hermosa Beach residence, they can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, they can move the whole film crew in now. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill last week that will prevent residents from 
using zoning laws to boot film and TV productions from their neighborhoods. Now 
a city must have a law on its books that specifically prohibits filming in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a Torrance Superior Court commissioner evicted the popular Fox TV 
series from a beachfront location on The Strand. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers had been shooting exterior scenes at a home where three of the 
show's characters lived. A group of residents successfully sued the city, 
arguing that the film permit issued to the show conflicted with zoning laws 
that restrict commercial activity in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be more pleased of the outcome," said Patti Archuletta, director 
of the California Film Commission. "This is a resolution of what could have 
been a large Achilles heel for film production in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 It may keep producers in the state, but don't expect the show's producer, 
Aaron Spelling, to bring "90210" back to Hermosa. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has been doing just fine with a patio set reconstructed at a Van Nuys 
soundstage. The actual home is still shown occasionally, but it is from footage 
taken before the controversy. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "For young kids like preschoolers, play is work. It's through playing in the 
world that children start to create explanations for what they observe around 
them. This is how they develop an ability to think."

NEW SCHOOLS CHIEF SAID TO BE INSIGHTFUL, THOROUGH; EDUCATION: ANN NESBITT 
CHLEBICKI, NEW SUPERINTENDENT FOR PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, IS KNOWN TO LISTEN TO 
ALL SIDES OF AN ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Roofs need repairing, two of three high schools have been closed and the 
school district rarely qualifies for special funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most educators would gladly take the job of superintendent of the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, as Ann Nesbitt Chlebicki did earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes students consistently have some of the state's highest test 
scores, parents last year chipped in $640,000 for math, computer and drug-abuse 
programs, and schoolyard violence is rare.  
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki (pronounced kleh- bick -ee) says she has a vision for improving the 
8,600-student district, where she expects to remain for 10 years. Chlebicki 
will not be specific because she says she first wants to talk with parents, 
teachers and students, and does not want to influence them. But she says her 
guiding principle is: "There is only one side to take: the side of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Her three-year, $104,000-a-year contract officially begins Oct. 10, but 
Chlebicki, 44, has already begun making the 45-minute drive between her 
Huntington Beach home and the peninsula as she becomes acquainted with her new 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 She replaces Michael W. Caston, who left Palos Verdes to run the Santa Barbara 
school district in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki's former colleagues say the peninsula district has hired an 
insightful, hard-working administrator known for her ability to listen to all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki's boss for the past nine years credits her with keeping abreast of 
educational and technological developments, and showing planning and leadership 
skills -- doing her job and doing it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw what she did, you'd know she did it better than at most school 
districts," said Peter A. Hartman, superintendent of Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki, even by her own account, is persistent and tenacious.  
</P>
<P>
 "She is a tough negotiator. She's not a pushover," said George Anderson, an 
eighth-grade history teacher in Saddleback Valley and president of the 
1,250-member teachers union. "She's very thorough and she's well-prepared, and 
it's not easy to get her to change her opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki says she vigorously pursues her goals only after consulting with 
other interested parties and achieving a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki began her career as a business and computer science teacher at 
Huntington Beach High School, and later served as assistant principal and 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 As principal, Chlebicki discovered that a handful of female students were 
suffering from eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, and made 
headlines when she called attention to the often ignored maladies in a 1985 
newsletter to parents. Chlebicki then worked with teachers and students to help 
identify other students with eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some concerns about the societal pressures that are put on young 
girls," Chlebicki said. "The image is more important than the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, a Huntington Beach city committee chose Chlebicki as the grand 
marshal for the city's annual Fourth of July parade.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it was because the community became part of the high school again, 
and vice versa," she said, referring to efforts to promote communication 
between students and alumni, especially senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Chlebicki was promoted to director of curriculum and staff 
development for intermediate and high schools in Saddleback Valley. Two years 
later, she was promoted to assistant superintendent for instructional services. 
The district serves 28,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Chlebicki also was named to a four-year term on a 16-member state 
commission that recommends textbooks and other instructional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman says he has never received a complaint about Chlebicki. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Chlebicki's jobs on the peninsula will be to help raise money for the 
district. The state provides about $3,400 for each student, said interim Supt. 
Erwin N. Jones. But the district receives little, if any, special state 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also needed is money to repair aging buildings. The board recently budgeted 
$1.5 million to repair roofs, Jones said, but he estimated that the district 
could use another $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki, who grew up on Staten Island in New York City, received bachelor's 
and master's degrees in business and computer education from Boston University. 
She earned a doctorate in curriculum and instruction from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to California when her husband, Gene, now the chief operating 
officer for a medical trade association, was transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki, who says she gets up at 4:45 a.m. on weekdays (5:30 a.m. on 
weekends) for her morning walks, is described as caring by her daughter, Cara, 
11, who tells of her mom making chicken noodle soup for sick neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 And her son, Craig, 15, talks of her determination.  
</P>
<P>
 "If she has an idea in her head," said Craig, "she will carry it out and stick 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an assessment Chlebicki agrees with. "If you want the project done, give 
it to Chlebicki," she said.

POLICE SEEK KILLER OF PRICE CLUB EMPLOYEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a dozen detectives from the Inglewood Police homicide squad are looking 
for "a real dangerous guy" who shot and killed the assistant manager of a Price 
Club store in a street holdup that netted the killer and his accomplice only 
$15 in change. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred about 6:45 p.m. Saturday when two men armed with an ice 
pick and a gun approached assistant manager Randy James Terrian, 37, of Agoura 
Hills, and another male store employee. The two workers were walking outside 
the store on Century Boulevard across from Hollywood Park racetrack after 
closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified employee was carrying a black cash box that the robbers 
apparently thought contained currency, Inglewood Police Sgt. Bill Thompson 
said. In fact, it contained only credit card receipts and $15 in coins.  
</P>
<P>
 When the men accosted them, Terrian apparently told the other store employee 
to "give them the box," Thompson said. The employee handed over the box, but 
the robber with the gun shot Terrian anyway, hitting him once in the head. More 
shots were fired as the other employee fled, but he was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrian later died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "To kill somebody after they've given you what you want is just brutality," 
Thompson said. "It means we've got a real dangerous guy out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the robbers probably didn't realize how small their take was 
until later, when they opened the box.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the killing, Inglewood police have flooded the neighborhood with 
hundreds of flyers in English and Spanish seeking information on the incident 
and the two suspects. Thompson said he hopes the relatively large number of 
detectives assigned to the case will result in quick arrests and will reassure 
owners and customers of other businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want other people and businesses down there to worry too much," 
Thompson said. "This was a tragedy, but it was a random thing, the kind of 
thing that can happen anywhere in the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the Price Club has instituted more security measures, including 
more guards. A security guard was on duty when the killing took place, Thompson 
said, but was in another area. The store manager was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson asked anyone with information about the killing to call the Inglewood 
Police Department's anonymous 24-hour "Drop a Dime on Crime" hot line at (310) 
412-8825, or they can call homicide detectives at (310) 412-5246.

DOG GONE, AND IT COULD PUT OFFICIAL OUT OF COMMISSION

 For the second time, Cassie -- or maybe it's Lady -- is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 So the search is on again in a dog-custody case that has pitted a Lawndale 
planning commissioner against a local family, Lennox sheriff's detectives, the 
district attorney's office and several members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old unlicensed black dog was last seen Monday night in the back 
yard of Planning Commissioner Edie Warwick's home.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem, officials say, is that Warwick is not the owner of the missing 
dog she calls Lady. Its name is Cassie, they say, and it belongs to Lawndale 
residents Joseph and Vicky French, who claim Warwick has been holding the chow 
mix against its will. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Warwick is facing criminal charges for keeping the dog and dismissal from 
her job as commissioner.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem started Sept. 11 when Cassie disappeared from the Frenches' yard. 
After a futile search, the family placed a lost dog ad in a local paper.  
</P>
<P>
 That same day, Warwick found a black dog wandering several blocks from her 
home. She took it home, named it Lady and took out a "found dog" ad, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Frenches saw Warwick's ad on Sept. 16, Joseph French and his two 
sons, ages 11 and 7, went to retrieve their wayward pooch. French produced a 
photo of himself with the dog, but Warwick says the dog failed three times to 
"bound across the floor and leap into his arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Because French produced no vet bills, dog license or a clear photograph, she 
decided he was not the owner and refused to release the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he is not the rightful owner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 French called the sheriff. Warwick called the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 When sheriff's deputies arrived, they demanded the dog be handed over to the 
Frenches. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick refused, saying she feared for the dog's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Harold E. Hofman and Councilman Larry Rudolph asked Warwick to release 
the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Warwick refused.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials assured the Frenches they would get their dog back and 
turned the case over to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detective H. D. Garcia had no luck, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his warnings that she would be charged, Garcia said, Warwick refused 
to give up the dog. On Friday, the district attorney charged Warwick with 
delaying an investigation and misappropriating lost property. She is scheduled 
to be arraigned Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick said she would only yield to a judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to figure out what you are about and live a life that shows it," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, Cassie -- or Lady -- has disappeared again. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick says she went shopping Monday evening, and when she returned, she 
found her two white American Eskimo show dogs alone in the back yard with no 
sign of the black chow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frenches blame Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does she really believe we'd believe (the dog) just disappeared?" Vicky 
French asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick said she has no idea where the dog is and denied she has hidden it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in enough trouble already -- why would I do something so stupid?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shaprio said he intends to prosecute Warwick on the 
initial charges and vowed that more charges could be filed if evidence is found 
that Warwick has hidden the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick says her friends have abandoned her, and the City Council is 
discussing her removal from the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought these people were my friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Frenches still have no dog. "I told my boys, 'Don't worry, we've got 
the law on our side, we'll get Cassie back,' " Vicky French said. "Now what do 
I tell them? I can sue, but that doesn't mean we'll get our dog back."

GANG MELEE AT SCHOOL SPURS IDEAS FOR SECURITY; EDUCATION: SUCH MEASURES AS 
ARMED OFFICERS AND METAL DETECTORS COULD STEM VIOLENCE AT LEUZINGER HIGH, 
DISTRICT OFFICIALS AND PARENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best way to deter gang and racial violence at Leuzinger High School is to 
have armed Sheriff's deputies on or around the campus during the school day, 
school officials told a group of students and parents.  
</P>
<P>
 But axle grease on the fence might help too. 
</P>
<P>
 Centinela Valley Union School District officials, prompted by a gang-related 
brawl at Leuzinger on Sept. 16, are searching for ways to stem violence and 
ensure the safety of students. 
</P>
<P>
 They have installed a 24-hour information hot line and are considering using 
hand-held metal detectors year-round. Other proposals for coping with violence 
range from installing a new public address system and creating a detention area 
for troublesome students to enforcing a stricter dress code. One administrator 
suggested coating the wrought-iron fence that surrounds the school with axle 
grease so intruders cannot climb over.  
</P>
<P>
 The brawl at the Lawndale school led to the arrest of seven youths, including 
at least five Leuzinger students, but no charges have been filed against them. 
Ten students have been suspended from school.  
</P>
<P>
 The melee, which involved blacks and Latinos, was apparently started by 
several Latino gang members in retaliation for an off-campus shooting Sept. 14 
that left one Latino dead, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some students, school officials and parents say that armed officers 
will help keep racial tensions in check, most agree that fights will probably 
erupt again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, as administrators, do your best . . . (but) it's beyond your control," 
parent John Dragone told Supt. Joseph M. Carrillo, Leuzinger Principal Sonja 
Davis and a panel of teachers, student leaders and school board members at a 
meeting Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel agreed but said they faced serious problems in reacting to incidents 
like the brawl, including limited access to first aid equipment, broken 
internal and external public address systems, and no drill for students and 
teachers to practice lock-down procedures, which are used in case of a major 
disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lock-down, teachers are supposed to go to their designated rooms, 
account for all students, lock the classroom doors and wait until 
administrators give approval for building-by-building dismissal, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents complained that they were not informed about procedures to pick 
up students after they have been dismissed from a lock-down. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents said their children, trying to seek safety from the fight, were 
locked out of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said she went from room to room, looking for a place to go," said 
Gurtrude Heisser. Her daughter, she said, finally made her way into an open 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say that many of the proposed solutions are only stopgap measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how high a fence you have, people are going to get in or out," said 
parent Lois Brown, who has two sons at Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents fault the parents of the youths involved in the brawl for the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much security you have, it won't help because parents need to 
teach their kids that they are there to learn," parent Elizabeth Klemick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said a plan to implement some of the proposals would be ready this 
week.

POLITICAL NOTES: COHEN, DILLS BOTH SEE POLL AS GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 POLL PUNDITRY: Attorney David Barrett Cohen's campaign was crowing this week 
about a new poll that shows he's within eight percentage points of state Sen. 
Ralph C. Dills(D-El Segundo). 
</P>
<P>
 But politics is a game of expectations, and Dills' campaign says their man is 
thrilled as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, commissioned by the Cohen campaign, showed 29% of the voters would 
select Dills, 21% would pick Cohen and 42% were undecided. The survey of 350 
registered voters in the 28th Senate District has a 4% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that whatever support Dills does have is very soft," said Cohen, who 
lives in Redondo Beach. "He is tremendously vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Another poll figure -- of voters considered most likely to make it to the 
polls -- shows Cohen within two points of Dills. Dills got 28%, Cohen 26%; 42% 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even sent out my first piece of mail yet," Cohen said. "People are 
giving me the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' campaign coordinator, Tim Mock, didn't comment on the survey of the 
most likely voters. But he was encouraged by the 29%-21% spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good news for us," he said. "We're eight points ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 He expects the gap to widen once Dills steps up his campaign. Although the 
84-year-old incumbent has a legal and judicial career dating back to 1938, 
reapportionment carved up his old Gardena-area district. His district now 
covers new territory of Torrance, the beach cities and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to win by substantially higher margins," Mock said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BY THE NUMBERS: Republicans hope a backlash against Democratic leadership 
helps Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks defeat Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 But registration in the 36th Congressional District so far has not changed 
much since 1992, when Harman defeated Republican Joan Milke Flores. As of Sept. 
8, 42.6% of the voters were registered Democrats and 42.4% Republicans. The 
deadline to register is Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also have widened their registration leads in two Assembly districts 
where registration was almost evenly split two years ago. In the 54th Assembly 
District, Democrats account for 45.9% of the registered voters, Republicans 
40.8%. Incumbent Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) is facing Rancho Palos Verdes 
Mayor Steve Kuykendall in that district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd Assembly District, 43.3% of the voters are registered Democrats 
and 40.9% Republicans. There, first-term Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina 
del Rey) faces insurance agent Julian Sirull. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on past trends, political analysts say, Republicans are more likely to 
go to the polls, which means their party still can enjoy an edge in districts 
where they are slightly outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THEY MEET, AT LAST: For politicos, Sunday is the day for their candidates to 
shine -- or say something stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in three races will meet at a League of Women Voters Forum at the 
Torrance Cultural Arts Center. Among the faceoffs: Bowen and Sirull at 1 p.m.; 
Dills and Cohen at 2 p.m.; and Brooks and Harman at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates won't be debating one-on-one. Instead, audience members will be 
able to submit questions to a moderator, who will choose which ones to pose to 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The event's other sponsors are the American Assn. of University Women, 
Torrance Branch, and the Torrance Council of PTAs.

STUDENTS GET A JAPANESE EDUCATION AT 2 PALOS VERDES SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At two Palos Verdes Peninsula schools, each day begins with a bow to the 
teacher and ends with the students cleaning the classroom as part of a strict 
disciplinary code. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, every student learns to play the flute, do calligraphy and work 
out on the bars as part of the required gymnastics program. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is all taught in Japanese.  
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned schools teach children of Japanese executives based in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Kokusai Gakuen, also known as International Bilingual School, was started in 
Torrance in 1979, moved to Hermosa Beach and then settled on the campus of the 
former Malaga Cove School in Palos Verdes Estates in August, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Nishiyamato Academy of California opened at the former Dapplegray School in 
Rolling Hills Estates in April, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum of both schools, mandated by the Japanese government, matches 
that of all elementary and junior high schools in Japan. Students learn 
Japanese language, literature, history, politics, geography, culture, home 
economics for the girls, music and art. The Japanese government provides 
textbooks.  
</P>
<P>
 Ninety government-sponsored and 20 privately operated Japanese schools are 
located throughout the world, wherever Japanese companies are concentrated.  
</P>
<P>
 "So far at our school, we have had more than 1,500 students enrolled who have 
returned to Japan," said Kokusai Gakuen founder Tadao Hara. "The majority of 
Japanese businessmen are assigned here three to five years, then return to 
their homes."  
</P>
<P>
 Hara said he started the school because Japanese children educated in the 
United States did not do well academically when they returned to Japan. As a 
consequence, many parents left their children in Japan when they were stationed 
in America.  
</P>
<P>
 In American schools, the students might learn English and experience American 
culture, but they did not learn the subjects they needed to pass the rigorous 
exams to get into Japanese high schools and universities. Japanese schools 
outside Japan help prepare students for these exams.  
</P>
<P>
 Each class at Kokusai Gakuen has a maximum of 15 students, and school is in 
session 210 days a year, compared to 180 days at American schools. The school 
charges $405 to $470 a month in tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is just like it is in school in Japan except we learn English and 
learn about American culture," said Sho Toyoda, 14, a ninth-grader, who has 
been at the school two years. His father is an executive with Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 All ninth graders at Hara's school take a trip to the East Coast as part of 
the school's program for students to get to know the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go to a Broadway play, visit historic sites in Boston, Philadelphia, New 
York and Washington, D.C., visit the Japanese Embassy, Congress and the White 
House," Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year, his school had 48 students. By 1989 there were 269 students 
attending classes. "Then the bubble burst. Both Japan and America have been 
suffering economically ever since," he said. Enrollment this year is down to 
175 students in grades one through nine.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, 693 Japanese companies were located in Southern California. Now there 
are 615. The number of Japanese expatriate managers and executives has dropped 
from a high of 3,800 to 3,400, said Sadao (Bill) Kita, executive director of 
the Japan Business Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara said to boost enrollment, he is working with high schools in Japan to 
bring 30 to 40 students to the school from Japan to spend a semester. "This 
would expose them to American culture and the English language. Students would 
live with American families in the South Bay area," Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decline in the number of Japanese companies and Japanese 
executives in this area in the past four years, Japanese politician Kyotaro 
Tanose decided to open an overseas campus of his Nishiyamato Academy, which is 
located in Nara, Japan. Tanose is a member of the Diet, Japan's parliament.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there are enough Japanese families in this area knowing the 
Nishiyamato Academy reputation that will send their children to our school even 
during this period of economic decline," said Hideki Shindo, 28, vice principal 
of Nishiyamato's campus in Rolling Hills Estates.  
</P>
<P>
 Nishiyamato Academy of California started last year with 38 students in grades 
six through eight. Now it has 71 students enrolled in fifth through ninth 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly tuition is $630.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; 2 CITIES ORDER PARAGON CABLE TO MAKE REFUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a consultant's report that Paragon Cable overcharged for some of 
its services, two South Bay cities have ordered the cable company to make 
refunds to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other cities plan to take action next month on the report, which also 
found that the company changed the status of two channels to evade rate 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon has informed the cities that it will appeal rate changes and refunds 
to the Federal Communications Commission. Gardena, Hawthorne, Lawndale and 
Torrance jointly hired Telecommunications Management Corp. to review the 
documents that Paragon submitted in calculating its rates for basic service 
from Sept. 1 to July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the consultant's findings, Gardena and Lawndale voted this week to 
order Paragon to refund the overcharge, reduce rates by as much as 56 cents, 
and make changes in its advertising and billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne's City Council will review the issue Oct. 10, and the Torrance 
council will take it up Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute concerns whether FCC rules permit Paragon to remove two channels 
(American Movie Classics and Turner Broadcasting System) from basic service and 
make them "a la carte" channels that viewers have the option of paying for 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
 If the FCC agrees with the consultant's interpretation of FCC rules, Paragon 
would owe more than $1 million to its 66,000 customers. That would mean a 
refund of about $20 for each subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the FCC could take months to make a decision on the rate structure, 
residents probably won't see any refund soon, said Michael J. Friedman, the 
cities' consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paragon agreed to make the changes suggested by the consultant 
concerning itemizing fees on customer bills and including franchise fees in 
advertised prices, the company objects to the consultant's conclusions about 
the two channels. By Paragon's estimation, it owes a total of $88,000 in all 
four of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Paragon officials say, the company has undercharged subscribers 
under the most recent FCC rules. The company has proposed allowing the rates to 
remain the same until it has undercharged by the same amount it believes it has 
overcharged. MARY GUTHRIE

 Eight top managers and administrators at Palos Verdes Estates City Hall will 
get 3% raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises were approved 4 to 0 Tuesday by the City Council, with Councilman 
Michael Moody absent. A city report said the managers' raises are merited given 
the city's well-managed finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Gary Johansen will now earn nearly $75,000 a year, and the stable 
manager could earn close to $33,000. Others receiving raises include the city 
clerk, the finance director and the city manager's secretary. The raises are 
retroactive to July 1. 
</P>

 Most city employees got 3% pay increases earlier this year. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; SIGN ORDINANCE GETS PRELIMINARY APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a sign of the economic times: The Rolling Hills Estates City Council has 
given preliminary approval to an ordinance allowing businesses to increase the 
number of signs in their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will take a formal vote in two weeks.If approved, the ordinance 
will take effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous business owners testified that increasing the number of signs would 
help boost sales, especially in a slow economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new ordinance, businesses will be allowed to display 12 square feet 
of signs for every 20 linear feet of window space. Four square feet of signs 
are now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Open and closed signs smaller than four square feet will not count toward the 
sign limit. All signs must be professionally designed, and no handwritten signs 
will be allowed, said City Manager Doug Prichard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prichard said the issue has been discussed for nearly two years, and the 
Planning Commission approved the sign ordinance in July.

<P>
 A local fund-raising group presented the school district with $550,000 in 
donations to help pay for classroom aides, instructional materials and a 
program to fight substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peninsula Education Foundation solicited donations for the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District from fall, 1993, to June, said Administrative 
Director Linda Mardorf. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation placed an additional $90,000 in a permanent endowment fund to 
benefit the school district, Mardorf said. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 49.2%, or 2,754, of school families contributed this past year, 
according to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the donation presented Monday, the foundation has given more than $4 
million to the district since the group was founded in 1980. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; CITY PLANS TO INSPECT HOMES LISTED FOR 
SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your house is up for sale in Palos Verdes Estates, the city building 
inspector may soon be paying you a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 New code enforcement guidelines were unanimously given preliminary approval by 
the City Council on Tuesday.City staff will now draw up the final guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the city did not inspect homes that were for sale, but did require 
sellers to obtain a list of permits on file. 
</P>
<P>
 One amendment proposed by Councilman William A. Finer would allow the city to 
strike pre-existing code violations if residents need to refinance their homes. 
The planning director estimated that the new policy will cost the city an hour 
of staff time for each home investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft guidelines also prevent code inspectors from responding to anonymous 
tips and stress voluntary compliance. The city plans to give homeowners four 
weeks to bring their houses up to code.  
</P>
<P>
 If homeowners do not correct violations after four weeks, they could be fined 
$100. That fine would rise to $500 if the violation continues for two more 
weeks. After that, the city would begin proceedings to correct the violations. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent spat with one homeowner, who the city said placed illegal trees and 
rocks outside his home, lasted more than a year. The offending landscaping was 
removed by city bulldozers in August.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO BUILD MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerns about traffic congestion and safety led the Torrance City Council to 
reject a plan to build a McDonald's restaurant on a busy Torrance street. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials said they were surprised at Tuesday's council decision 
but said they will just look for other sites in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "McDonald's strives to be an asset in each community we serve," company 
spokesman Ron Street said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who lived near the site at Crenshaw Boulevard and 236th Street 
worried that a fast-food restaurant would increase crime, traffic, noise and 
pollution in their neighborhood. The proposed building's 2,200-square-foot 
floor plan was only half the size of some of the company's restaurants, but 
residents feared that cars waiting for the drive-through window would back up 
onto Crenshaw.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some inherent problems with this particular site by virtue 
of the heavy traffic on Crenshaw," said Councilman George Nakano. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to prohibit construction of the McDonald's. Both 
the Planning Department and the city's Planning Commission had recommended 
approval of the project, but on Aug. 8 an appeal was filed to ask the council 
to make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Because neighbors complained about the original plan to allow traffic from 
side streets to enter the restaurant parking lot, McDonald's changed the design 
to allow access only from Crenshaw Boulevard. But members of the council still 
believed the plan had flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at what they've come up with, and there isn't a way . . . to get out 
of that facility and safely go north," said Councilman Dan Walker. "I think 
what they should have is a larger lot and a larger facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Both residents and McDonald's officials said they would like to see one of the 
company's restaurants built on a larger site somewhere in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love McDonald's; I just don't want to see a drive-through go right there," 
said Kathy Boedeker, who lives on West 237th Street.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; POLICE COPTER STIRS UP DISCUSSION OVER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After complaints about noise created by a new police helicopter, Hawthorne 
officials called for a public hearing on the matter. But at Monday's hearing, 
only a few residents complained and a majority expressed approval for the 
two-man airborne patrol unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawthorne and Gardena Police departments began using the Robinson R22 
helicopter in August as part of a pilot program to help decrease police 
response time and cut crime in the two cities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter flies five nights a week and is being evaluated during a 90-day 
trial, said Hawthorne Police Chief Stephen R. Port. So far, officials say, the 
helicopter has been effective in such usages as tracking stolen vehicles and 
breaking up large parties. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, some residents complained that the helicopter is too loud, 
costs too much and is unnecessary on many police calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like we're watching a Vietnam War movie. Why can't we spend all 
this money on more police cars and officers?" asked Lory Cerletti, a resident 
of the Bodger Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run the helicopter, $160 an hour, is split by the cities, 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 But the majority of those who spoke at the hearing favored the helicopter 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since the helicopter started, I've noticed two things: less sirens and less 
foot traffic on my streets," said resident Sandra K. Cardaropoli. Before the 
helicopter, "we'd find trash on our lawns and people going to the bathroom on 
our lawns. It was getting to be a real problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardaropoli said she does not mind the noise of the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot safer. This is for our protection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say they are working on controlling the noise level by 
varying the helicopter's flight altitude. Port said a final recommendation on 
noise, effectiveness of the program and whether the city should keep the 
helicopter will be released after the trial is finished in a month.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; CITY WEIGHS PLAN TO RAISE WATER RATES 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne officials are considering a plan to raise water rates 10% for the 
remainder of this year. And rates could go up an additional 34% over the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 A study revealed that increased water costs have been absorbed by the city, 
but consumers' rates have not gone up since 1989, said Charles Herbertson, 
director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim City Manager James A. Algie recommended the study in June after 
warning the City Council that the cash-strapped city could no longer afford to 
absorb the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the average single-family household that pays about $23 a 
month this year will pay about $35 a month by 1999. For large water users, 
including apartment buildings and businesses, the hikes could reach hundreds of 
dollars a month, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases are necessary because West Basin Water District, which supplies 
more than 70% of Hawthorne's water, is paying more for less water from state 
water projects, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rate hikes initially would raise enough money to keep the city's 
water department from dipping into the general fund. The increased revenue also 
would be used to upgrade the city's water system, including replacing aging 
water mains and increasing the capacity of the water treatment plant, 
Herbertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to vote on the 10% rate increase Oct. 10. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; POLICE CHIEF IS NAMED ACTING CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Stephen R. Port has been named interim city manager while the 
city continues its search for a permanent chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Port will continue as police chief and balance both jobs while city officials 
interview candidates for city manager, Mayor Larry Guidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port replaces interim manager James A. Algie, who came out of retirement in 
June to run the city for three months. That temporary position ends Friday. 
Since taking over, the former Long Beach chief financial officer has balanced 
the city's budget and received praise from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has really cleaned up. He's going to be a hard act to follow," Guidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has narrowed the field of candidates from 50 to eight and will 
begin interviewing the finalists next weekend, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Port will be doing both jobs, he will not receive extra pay, Guidi 
said, and his double duty should only last a couple of weeks.

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; SOCCER FIELD CONSIDERED AS SENIOR HOUSING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUSAN WOODWARD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are considering converting a soccer field into a housing site 
for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Dear said the city is trying to secure funding from the 
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to build 50 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer field in South Park between Vermont and Normandie avenues is a 
potential site for the development, Dear said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a logical spot, but it's certainly not a done deal," he said. "We 
haven't even got the (funding). " 
</P>
<P>
 Although only in its infancy, the city proposal has drawn criticism from the 
South Park Community Assn. and Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Rafael Garcia, who has lived next to the soccer field since 1976, 
said too many city vistas are being eroded by development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city previously took large parts of South Park for two other senior 
housing buildings built in the past five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has taken a 27-acre site that was for a park and gradually they're 
turning it into a senior housing development," Garcia said. SUSAN WOODWARD

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: BLESSED WITH THE FLAVOR OF EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While growing up in Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria, Fred Lami rarely 
took advantage of the countless bakeries and cafes. It wasn't until he moved to 
Malibu to attend Pepperdine University in 1975 -- during the Dark Age of 
coffee, before there were as many Starbucks as 7-Elevens -- that he realized 
how much he missed the strong espressos and delicious pastries of Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 So a few years after graduation, Lami took matters into his own coffee cup by 
opening Saint Honore, named after the patron saint of pastry bakers, in Malibu. 
In 1985, he opened a second bakery/cafe of the same name, this one in Palos 
Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The new location, complete with outdoor seating at umbrella-topped tables, is 
in the picturesque community of Lunada Bay, where the waitresses seem to know 
many of the customers by name. Here Saint Honore has expanded its pastry and 
coffee menu to include a selection of sandwiches, salads and omelets.  
</P>
<P>
 The breakfast menu lists, in addition to a variety of muffins, scones and 
croissants, seven omelets. They include the Greek ($5.75), with feta, eggplant, 
black olives and tomatoes; the Italian ($4.85), with prosciutto, mozzarella, 
green olives and tomatoes; and the Scandinavian ($4.85), with sour cream and 
lingonberries. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, the tasty baked chicken breast sandwich comes with roasted red bell 
peppers, radicchio and mustard on rosemary-and-thyme-topped focaccia ($6.50). 
The smoked Scottish or Norwegian salmon is served in a baguette with capers, a 
smear of cream cheese and lemon ($8.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the most popular orders are the two reasons Fred Lami opened Saint 
Honore in the first place: the buttery pastries and strong cappuccinos and 
espressos that evoke memories of Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Saint Honore is at 2201 Palos Verdes Drive West, Palos Verdes Estates. (310) 
544-3100. Open Monday through Friday 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 7 
a.m. to 7 p.m.

 HELPING HAND 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado wide receiver Blake Anderson didn't catch a pass in Saturday's game 
against Michigan, but he did manage to get his right hand on the most dramatic 
reception in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a fifth-year senior from Palos Verdes High, tipped quarterback 
Kordell Stewart's desperation pass near the goal line, enabling teammate 
Michael Westbrook to catch it in the end zone with no time remaining. The 
64-yard touchdown play gave Colorado a stunning 27-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch came on a designed play called "Jets Formation, Rockets Left," where 
three receivers race up the left side of the field. Anderson said they practice 
it every Thursday but only go through the motions to make sure all the 
receivers are in the correct positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to try and tip the ball," Anderson said. "I set up around the goal 
line and Michael gets in the end zone. There were about four (Michigan) 
defenders around me. It's just something that worked out perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Being part of the play provided Anderson with a rare personal highlight. The 
former Palos Verdes quarterback has played primarily on special teams at 
Colorado. He has only one career reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I'll never forget," Anderson said. "Everybody was just yelling 
and screaming. We were excited beyond belief. Guys were crying and everybody 
was hugging each other. It was an incredibly emotional victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the emotion was the fact that Anderson's father, Dick, a former 
Colorado standout and All-Pro safety with the Miami Dolphins, attended the game 
at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nice," Anderson said of his father's presence. "I feel great about 
it. It's probably one of the greatest plays in college football." FIELD OF 
SCREAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Banning High's football team will return to the site of recent disasters when 
it visits Daniels Field for an attractive Southern Pacific Conference opener 
Friday night against San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots have lost their last three games at Daniels Field by a total of 
five points. After upset losses to Washington, 7-6, and Crenshaw, 9-6, at 
Daniels Field last season, Banning Coach Ed Paculba said he would never play 
another home game at the San Pedro facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different now," Paculba said. "We're going as visitors. It's 
(San Pedro's) home field, not our home field." 
</P>
<P>
 Banning assistant Titus Tuiasosopo says the Pilots have nothing to fear in the 
San Pedro sod. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to go out and play, no matter what field you're on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuiasosopo said the return of All-City guard Andrew Lalau and tailback Ricardo 
Diaz last week in a 21-7 victory over South Gate caused a marked improvement in 
the Pilots' running game. Both players missed the first two games -- losses to 
Muir and Long Beach Poly -- because of knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz rushed for 117 yards in 18 carries, many of them over the right side of 
the line anchored by Lalau (6 feet, 260 pounds) and tackle Fa'aisea Mailo (6-5, 
315), a promising junior who transferred from Hawaii. LEAGUE RACES 
</P>
<P>
 Our predictions on the eve of league-opening play for most of the area's prep 
football teams: 
</P>
<P>
 Bay League -- Hawthorne, Leuzinger and Peninsula (combined record of 6-2-1) 
will again battle for the title and three playoff spots, as they have for the 
past three seasons. That leaves West Torrance, Torrance, North Torrance, 
Inglewood and Santa Monica (combined record of 2-13) to fight for a possible 
wild-card berth, although it will be difficult for any of them to finish with 
the .500 overall record required for wild-card consideration. Predicted finish: 
1. Leuzinger; 2. Hawthorne; 3. Peninsula; 4. West Torrance; 5. Torrance; 6. 
Santa Monica; 7. North Torrance; 8. Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean League -- There are four teams, perhaps five, with legitimate shots at 
the title. Leading the pack is Mira Costa, which has the league's best running 
back in Mike Fikes, a strong defense and last season's South Bay Coach of the 
Year, Don Morrow. Defending champion Culver City, the only team to beat Mira 
Costa in 1993, has the most talent in the league, but has played erratically so 
far. Predicted finish: 1. Mira Costa; 2. Culver City; 3. Beverly Hills; 4. 
South Torrance; 5. Morningside; 6. Redondo; 7. El Segundo; 8. Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific Conference -- Carson is 0-3. Victory-starved Banning, after 
losing its first two games, treated last week's triumph over South Gate as if 
it were a monumental feat instead of the routine accomplishment it really was. 
Yes, it's a brave, new world for the area's City Section teams, with San Pedro 
in the leader's role. Or did you forget that the Pirates had the best 
conference record last season? Predicted finish: 1. San Pedro; 2. Carson; 3. 
Banning; 4. Dorsey; 5. Crenshaw; 6. Washington; 7. Gardena; 8. Narbonne. WRONG 
FLOOR 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne Coach Dan Robbins seemed to know what was coming when his team 
played Mater Dei last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei is a mistake-free football team, and we have to step up to that 
level," Robbins said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars took their game to a new level, all right -- the basement. They 
committed seven turnovers as Mater Dei rolled to a 52-11 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rout, Hawthorne may have played the worst quarter of football in school 
history. The Cougars lost four consecutive fumbles late in the second quarter, 
helping Mater Dei score 38 points in an eight-minute span and take a 45-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hawthorne's worst defeat in four seasons under Robbins, eclipsing a 
36-25 loss to Loyola in 1992. HANGING TOUGH 
</P>
<P>
 A demanding nonleague schedule has left Carson 0-3, but Coach David Williams 
doesn't believe the disappointing start has damaged his players' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morale of the kids is fine," Williams said. "We'd all prefer to have 
three wins under our belt. More importantly, we know we're improving as a 
football team. I think that is the focus, so hopefully we can be there in 
December for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 One Carson player who has been missing in action, at least offensively, is 
J.R. Redmond. The senior running back-receiver, who entered the season billed 
as a player-of-the-year candidate, has totaled only 90 yards rushing and 47 
yards receiving in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's there," Williams said. "I'm sure he'll be a major factor. His attitude 
is there and his work ethic is there. Our focus is on doing better as a team 
and he realizes that." 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond has had a bigger impact on defense, where he plays safety. He ranks 
third on the team in tackles and had an interception last week in a 23-16 loss 
to Los Alamitos. .300 HITTER 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore middle blocker Tate Medley, a former Mira Costa High standout, has 
been a pleasant surprise for the Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team, 
which improved to 6-5 Tuesday night with a 15-3, 15-4, 15-7 victory over 
winless Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Medley entered the week leading West Coast Conference players in hitting 
percentage (.395) and had already played in as many games, 24, as she did in 
her entire freshman season. She had career-highs of 15 kills and four blocks 
Saturday in Loyola's four-game victory over Rice at Notre Dame's Golden Dome 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have also gotten a boost from setter Tracy Holman, a freshman from 
West Torrance, who beat out three-year starter Robin Ortgiesen (Mira Costa) for 
the job. Holman entered the week leading the WCC in assists per match (12.69). 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola opens WCC play this weekend, playing host to Santa Clara on Friday and 
St. Mary's on Saturday. Both matches start at 7 p.m. NOTABLE 
</P>

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; SCHOOLS: 40 COMPUTERS DONATED TO SAN PEDRO HIGH

 A city of Los Angeles program has helped secure 40 computers for the San Pedro 
High School library. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Shares, a nonprofit city program, accepts corporate and business 
donations and gives them to cash-strapped schools and other nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the program and Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., whose 
district covers San Pedro, gave the school seven computers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation brought the number of computers in the library to 20. The Los 
Angeles-based Detwiler Foundation is expected to donate another 20 computers 
through a computer matching program, school Principal Rey A. Mayoral said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the resources in our budget to purchase big-ticket items like 
this," Mayoral said. "So, we try to do some innovative things to get some of 
these high-tech items." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral estimated that the cost to the school to purchase the computers would 
have been more than $35,000. SUSAN WOODWARD

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; DEVELOPMENT: DEADLINE FOR BIDS ON CARSON MALL SITE

 Federal officials have set Friday as the deadline for submitting bids to buy 
the government's interest in a proposed shopping mall in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. inherited $28 million in loans on the 
157-acre Metro 2000 site when it took over Consolidated Savings & Loan of 
Irvine in 1986.The new owner will assume the loans but not a controlling 
interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC spokesman Andrew Porterfield said advertisements in the Wall Street 
Journal and other publications have brought in requests for information about 
the property from all over the country, including from loan brokers and finance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been lots of interest," Porterfield said. "But I don't know how many 
people are just kicking tires." 
</P>
<P>
 The sealed bids will be reviewed Friday night, and the highest bidder will 
win. Depending on how the sale is financed, the transaction could take several 
weeks to complete, Porterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the proposed mall has been slowed by cleanup of environmental 
hazards at the site, formerly the Cal Compact landfill. It is being developed 
by a partnership of several organizations, including the Southern California 
and Arizona Glaziers, Architectural Metal and Glass Workers Pension Fund. The 
pension fund also has made a bid on the property. MARY GUTHRIE

TOPICS / SENIORS; POLICE ARE PROS AT HALTING CONS AIMED AT ELDERLY; SPECIAL 
UNIT OF LAPD WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SAFEGUARD 
VULNERABLE CLASS OF VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's been called the crime of the '90s. The victims are trusting, isolated and 
fearful of losing independence. The criminal takes advantage of their trust and 
tries to cash out the assets the victims worked for all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has responded to the proliferation of scams 
involving senior citizen victims by forming the Elder Persons Estate Unit -- a 
division of the bunco-forgery operation. It's not just a "cops rescue poor 
victims, throw sleazy con artists in jail" story -- the crime of the '90s is 
being fought with the police work of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Chayo Reyes is a 20-year veteran of the LAPD. In 1987, he was 
assigned to investigate the kidnaping of a wealthy woman in her 80s. As a 
result of the case, Reyes learned about the state penal code section covering 
elders and dependent adults who are swindled by people entrusted to care for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes had been coping with one of the frustrations of police work -- a sense 
of futility -- when he suggested that a separate unit be dedicated to 
investigate the abuse of elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like all policemen -- I wanted to make a difference, and you find out quickly 
that you can't. In fact, you're not even making a dent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Elder Persons Estate Unit was a turning point for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this assignment, you are making a difference by protecting the home and 
life savings of an elder, and I'm proud to say that the LAPD, in spite of all 
the cutbacks, recognizes the importance of the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, in operation for seven years now and consisting of Reyes and 
Detective Dave Harned, gets 25 calls a day. It has recovered $27 million in 
cash and property. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are frustrations, the officers say. Offenders frequently serve 
short sentences. Of the hundreds successfully prosecuted as a result of the 
work of Reyes and Harned, only three remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Their successes are gratifying, however, in part because of a close working 
relationship with their counterparts in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a team," Reyes explained. "There are two of us, two people in the 
district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is also assisted by FAST -- the Fiduciary Abuse Specialist Team, a 
project coordinated by a Santa Monica-based group called WISE Senior Services. 
One member of FAST, Westside attorney Marc Hankin, is the author of a 
groundbreaking California law that allows victims to collect damages for pain 
and suffering as well as attorney fees. These sums can be collected by heirs 
even after victims die. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also work closely with adult protective services and the public guardian's 
office," Reyes said. "There's no way we could do it from our office alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Susan Aziz, the coordinator of the 18-month-old FAST: "Chayo Reyes is the 
true collaborator and an innovative visionary who is extremely tenacious and 
ethical and still gets around bureaucracies." 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz said Reyes' unit is the only one of its kind in the country. Reyes has 
participated in the training of 6,000 investigators throughout California, 
including prosecutors and, recently, bank employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes brought along his partner Harned and Ardith Javan, the lawyer in charge 
of the district attorney's elder abuse section, for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harned described con artists who prey on the elderly, saying, "They're good 
judges of character. They might follow a man home from church, for instance, 
and engage him in conversation all the while, filling the void of family 
members not paying attention (to the victim). 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal says he's there for him. They feed on an elder's fear of being 
put in a home or taken advantage of by government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the family of the victim may be relieved at first that Mom or Dad has 
a friend, the criminal may alienate family members by taking over such things 
as answering the phone or by intercepting mail, maybe cashing small checks of 
$100 or $200, Harned said. 
</P>
<P>
 Javan added that the criminal sometimes has a partner or, in some cases, whole 
families who appeal to the elder person's sympathies by saying that money is 
needed to care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Harned recalled, a con artist said he was the son of the 
victim's deceased tax preparer, then obtained power of attorney under the guise 
of consolidating the elder's many bank accounts. In reality, the criminal 
closed out the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim eventually moved in with the perpetrator and the victim's mail was 
routed to the criminal's address. Property was taken from the victim's house, 
stocks were sold and the criminal pocketed the assets -- close to $500,000 -- 
before anyone figured out what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 scam involving older people, Harned said, is a telemarketing fraud 
in which a criminal obtains information about an elderly person's investments 
with a bank, then calls asking for money to cover fees related to a purported 
class-action suit against the bank designed to "protect" investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Such con artists typically request that money not be mailed, thus getting 
around federal mail fraud laws if they get caught. "Beware of someone who 
avoids using U.S. mail and requests alternate means of sending money," Harned 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering such tips and arresting con artists are not the only reasons the 
detectives enjoy their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mark success by making the victim secure again," Reyes said. "That's where 
the team comes in; we plug victims into the mainstream so they are not isolated 
and vulnerable anymore. We address the crime, but what's equally important is 
protecting the elder."

PROTESTERS TARGET FORMER INS OFFICIAL; PROP. 187: DEMONSTRATORS GATHER OUTSIDE 
HAROLD EZELL'S IMMIGRATION CONSULTING FIRM. HE SAYS SUCH TACTICS WILL BACKFIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 50 predominantly Latino protesters from Los Angeles staged a peaceful 
demonstration outside the Newport Beach office of one of Proposition 187's 
co-authors, Harold Ezell, a former regional commissioner for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell has emerged as one of the most visible spokesmen of the so-called "Save 
Our State" initiative, which would bar illegal immigrant children from 
enrolling in California's public schools and would deny all but emergency 
medical treatment to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls have shown that the initiative, which will be on the November 
general election ballot, stands a good chance of passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the church-sponsored Southern California Organizing Committee, 
carrying signs with slogans like "SOS means Strangle Our Schools" and "We Want 
Justice," pointed out that Ezell, who headed the INS' Western Region from 1983 
to 1989, is in part responsible for the problem that the initiative seeks to 
solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Ezell was in charge of immigration on the West Coast for years," said 
Father David O'Connell, one of the protest organizers. "Why didn't he do 
something then?" 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said the initiative has further divided an already fragmented 
community by singling out Latinos as a problem population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just handy for the politicians to scapegoat one group," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Protest organizers said they had made their point, even though security guards 
prevented them from entering the business complex where Ezell's immigration 
consulting firm has its office. Guards ordered protesters off the Koll Center 
property and onto a public sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him to be aware that we know who he is," said Anita Nicklen, one of 
the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell later dismissed the protest as the work of "hired guns" in the pay of 
initiative opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first heard about (the protest demonstration) when I heard somebody singing 
in Spanish outside my window. I think they should do that every day all over 
the state, because I think that's going to bring more people out to vote," 
Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely ridiculous that they would come to my office to carry on 
like that. Now we've seen the kind of tactics they use. They're not local. This 
priest is from the 213 (telephone) area. I don't know who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said the crowd was distributing "disinformation" about the initiative. 
"On the education thing, we want the Supreme Court to go back and revisit that 
1982 decision and say, 'We can't afford to educate every 5-year-old who comes 
here for 12 years of free education,' " Ezell said. "That's why we put it in 
there, so we have a mechanism to do it. So the entire issue will get its day in 
court."

SANTA ANA TRUSTEES CONDEMN PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: THE SCHOOL BOARD CONTENDS 
THE BALLOT MEASURE IS MEAN-SPIRITED AND RACIST. A DISSENTER SAYS IT'S A 
WELL-REASONED INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Complaining that it is an unconstitutional measure that would turn school 
"employees into inquisitors and adversaries of the students," the governing 
board of the county's largest school district has adopted a resolution 
condemning Proposition 187, the November ballot initiative that would bar 
illegal immigrant children from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emotional debate Tuesday evening, the Santa Ana Unified School 
District Board of Education narrowly approved the resolution on a 3-2 vote, 
with Trustees Sal Mendoza, Audrey Yamagata-Noji and Robert W. Balen supporting 
it, and Rosemarie Avila and Tom Chaffee in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would make illegal immigrant children ineligible for 
enrollment in public schools, and require school officials to report any 
students they suspect of being in the country illegally to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. The measure would also bar non-emergency medical aid 
and social services to all illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board majority blasted the measure as immoral, mean-spirited, and 
racist. They said the legions of children turned out of schools by the measure 
would become a permanent, uneducated underclass susceptible to involvement in 
gangs, drugs and other criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chaffee and Avila argued that immigrants must go through proper legal 
channels before being afforded the rights and privileges the United States 
offers legal residents, and that the country simply cannot accommodate the 
current levels of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that the "children of our community should not be used 
as pawns in debates regarding immigration policy. . . . The proposal would 
impermissibly invade the privacy interests of this district, and turn our 
employees into inquisitors and adversaries of the students they are employed to 
serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution also noted that the initiative is in conflict with a 1982 
ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that illegal immigrant children 
have the same right of access as U.S. citizens to elementary and secondary 
public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata-Noji said the initiative invites racist enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would we be looking at blond, blue-eyed children who might have come here 
illegally from Canada? Or are we going to look at little Juanito or Juanita? 
Would we be suspicious of people because of what they look like, or what kind 
of accent they have, or what their parents look like?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Balen called the proposition "evil, mean-spirited and very unjust to 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency in economic downturns to look for scapegoats, and I think 
that's what's happened here," she said. "It's the same thing that happened in 
Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s. We're asking our teachers to become 
brownshirts and turn in children and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if the initiative happened to become law, he would refuse on 
principle to cooperate with anyone who attempted to question his own family 
members about their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila spoke up in favor of the proposition, describing it as a "well-reasoned, 
moral and viable" way to deal with the problem of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 She compared the United States to a lifeboat that can accommodate only 10 
people at one time. Although compassion demands that people try to save others, 
"if you put 40 people on a lifeboat (designed for 10), it will sink and no one 
will be saved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee defended the ballot initiative and criticized the school board 
resolution, saying "it is wrong for this board to tell people how to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yamagata-Noji and Mendoza noted that their ancestors, despite being legal 
residents, had either been thrown into detention camps built for Japanese 
immigrants during World War II or deported to Mexico earlier this century 
because of widespread anti-immigrant hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The two trustees said they opposed Proposition 187 because it provokes racist 
feelings similar to those that swept the country in earlier times, and does 
nothing to address the real issues of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza agreed that "there's got to be reform, but it's being done in the 
wrong manner."

POSTAL SERVICE POSTPONES RELEASE OF NIXON STAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to honor late President Richard Nixon with a first-class stamp on his 
birthday, Jan. 9, have hit a snag. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service has decided to delay issuing the new stamp, probably 
until next April, because of a pending postal rate increase, and now a key 
congressman opposes a Nixon stamp altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Nixon resigned in disgrace, he forfeited his right to be honored on a 
postage stamp," says Rep. William Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the House Post 
Office and Civil Service Committee. "The logic of honoring this disgraced 
President escapes me." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Washington Post, Clay made the comments to Postmaster General 
Marvin Runyon in a letter released Wednesday. If Clay successfully blocks the 
stamp, Nixon would have the dubious distinction of being the only former chief 
executive excluded from that honor. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, postal officials aren't backing down and plan to release the Nixon 
stamp, according to postal service spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou in Los Angeles. 
Local politicians were quick to defend the much venerated and vilified Orange 
County native. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Elvis Presley can get on a postage stamp," said state Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), "I think we can let Richard Nixon on one." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing a commonly held opinion of Nixon, Ferguson praised the former 
President's skill in managing U.S. foreign policy. But regardless of his 
performance, argued Ferguson, Nixon deserves his own stamp simply by virtue of 
having served in the nation's highest elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Jimmy Carter deserves a stamp," said Ferguson. "But I'd put a peanut by 
his, though." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some Orange County officials would not discuss Clay's attack on 
Nixon, who died in April at 81 and is buried at his presidential library in 
Yorba Linda. Apparently to avoid fueling a postage stamp controversy, officials 
with the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace declined to comment Wednesday, as 
did Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Customarily, postal officials will not consider a person for a stamp unless 
they have been dead for 10 years. However, U.S. Presidents usually are placed 
on stamps on the birthday that follows death. 
</P>
<P>
 But postal officials decided to postpone Nixon's stamp until after his 
birthday so it would not conflict with a proposed postal stamp increase, postal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just would have been a ridiculous situation," Bouffiou said. "We don't 
know if the rate change is going to occur Jan. 8 or Jan. 10 or some other 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials are still consulting with the Nixon family regarding a 
suitable portrait for his presidential stamp, Bouffiou said. The Nixon family 
must approve the final design. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials will probably release "first day of issue" stamps at a 
ceremony at the Nixon library, said Bouffiou.

GRAND JURY REVIEWING CASE AGAINST FAMALARO; CRIME: HUBER AUTOPSY REPORTS NO 
OBVIOUS SIGNS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BUT FLUIDS ARE COLLECTED FOR FURTHER TESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the Orange County Grand Jury reviews evidence against a handyman charged 
with murdering Denise Huber, an initial autopsy report released Wednesday said 
there were no obvious signs of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But the autopsy noted that bodily fluids were collected for testing to 
determine more conclusively whether Huber may been sexually assaulted, a 
finding that could be a key factor in either prosecuting or defending the case. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro, 37, is accused of kidnaping and bludgeoning the 23-year-old 
waitress in June, 1991, after her car broke down on a local freeway less than 
two miles from her home. Her nude, handcuffed body was discovered in July 
inside a running freezer at Famalaro's home in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic testing is being performed by Orange County's crime lab, but local 
law enforcement officials have refused to reveal any results, fearing a local 
version of the O.J. Simpson case, where details about new evidence are being 
leaked almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury has begun reviewing the latest evidence in the case and law 
enforcement sources say an indictment could come by week's end, allowing 
prosecutors to circumvent a public hearing process in their case against the 
former Lake Forest resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-page autopsy report released in Phoenix by the Maricopa County medical 
examiner's office said Huber suffered at least 14 blows to the head and a 
fractured nose. The report indicated that the time of Huber's death cannot be 
pinpointed because of the condition of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities suspected the murder weapon was a claw hammer or a nail puller -- 
objects that appeared to carry bloodstains and were found in Famalaro's 
cluttered home. A forensic anthropologist hired to reconstruct Huber's smashed 
skull to help determine what caused the blows concluded the nail puller was the 
more "probable" of the two suspected weapons, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said "clear frozen fluid" was taken from the vagina and "clear 
liquid" collected from the rectum for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from severe injuries to the head, there are no other signs of inflicted 
injuries, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who is being held without bail in Orange County, has pleaded not 
guilty to the charges. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors handling the case did not return repeated phone calls for comment 
Wednesday. But witnesses called so far by the grand jury include a Lake Forest 
woman who was formerly engaged to Famalaro and told police he once tried to 
forcibly handcuff her during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there, that's all I can say," said Nancy L. Gowan, who added she 
testified before the panel on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday that 
the lead investigator and two others who handled the Huber murder investigation 
had traveled to Orange County and were expected to return to Arizona today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding they are there for the grand jury," said spokeswoman 
Laurie Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has easily become one of Orange County's most notorious murder 
suspects in the wake of his arrest in July, when Huber's frozen remains were 
discovered in a freezer kept inside a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro's 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 An electrical cord ran from the freezer to Famalaro's house, where authorities 
found the dead woman's clothing in a box marked "Christmas" and yellowed 
newspaper clippings about her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona officials were prosecuting Famalaro for the murder until local 
authorities traced Huber's blood to a Laguna Hills storage facility where 
Famalaro was illegally living at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was coming home from a rock concert in the early morning hours of June 
3, 1991, when her tire blew out along the Corona del Mar Freeway. Officials now 
believe Famalaro kidnaped Huber and killed her in the storage facility. He 
purchased the freezer days after Huber's disappearance, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual assault issue is a key one for both sides. Proof could bolster the 
prosecution's death penalty case or help the defense eliminate a possible 
motive or assist a theory that the killing was not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have refused to discuss their strategies in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one way, however, the case has followed in the shadow of the 
Simpson trial. In June, the supervising judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court 
alluded to the media attention surrounding the Huber case when he ended the 
grand jury's review of the prosecution's case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia on Monday asked Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Michael Brenner to question grand jurors whether publicity 
surrounding the Huber case has tainted their ability to fairly review evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said Wednesday he was recently notified by Orange County prosecutors 
that a grand jury review could be imminent but said as a defense attorney he is 
not privy to the working of the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me in any way," said Gumlia, who said he also presented 
Brenner with dozens of pages of newspaper clippings about the Huber case. "We 
presume that it (a grand jury review) is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia has already stated his intention to seek a change of venue for his 
client because he has doubts that Famalaro can receive a fair trial in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber became a household name after her disappearance, as her frantic parents 
and law enforcement officials launched a high-profile search for her 
whereabouts. Famalaro is being held in protective custody in the Orange County 
Central Men's Jail after becoming the subject of death threats.

 A fire in a duplex Wednesday morning damaged both units, displacing five 
residents but injuring no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the cause of the blaze in the 300 block of East Orangewood 
Avenue may have been a malfunctioning dryer in a garage attached to the units. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began about 9 a.m. and spread quickly through the attics of both 
units. Damaged was estimated at $30,000 to the building and $40,000 to 
contents, Battalion Chief Benny Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in one unit were home when the fire started but got out, Ramirez 
said. No one was home at the other unit, he said. 
</P>

 Firefighters controlled the blaze in about 15 minutes, Ramirez said.KEN

 To Chantel Miller, peace means "being nice, helping, sharing, loving and 
caring for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-year-old girl demonstrated what she meant with about 700 other students 
at Orangethorpe Elementary on Wednesday as part of the school's ninth annual 
commemoration of the United Nations' International Day of Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spent the morning shaking hands, hugging, singing, cheering, reciting 
poetry and using sign language to express their hopes for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should choose to be peaceful and stop all the hate and crime. There 
should be peace throughout the world," 11-year-old Beau Gordon declared after a 
fourth-grade class sang "We Are the World." 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope for peace because that way, we'll have a better life," said 
second-grader Chris Burgner, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Added fourth-grader Matthew Mego, 10: "Peace is the greatest thing in the 
whole universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Rose, the school's special-education resource specialist and Peace Day 
coordinator, said the purpose of the event is to teach children to think of 
ways to promote peace in school and life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to learn that we can make a conscious choice to relate to other 
people in a peaceful manner and that it matters that each one of us make that 
decision," Rose said. "If you're going to have peace in the world, you must 
start with the children." Teachers said the event also helps students learn to 
resolve conflicts in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace has to start from within, and small people can make a big difference, 
and then it spreads," said Gretchen Francisco, a third-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton School Board President Robert C. Fisler watched the activities, 
which culminated with the release of a large helium balloon carrying messages 
of peace from the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great feeling of unity here," he said. "This is an awfully nice 
feeling." MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 2 SUSPECTS HELD IN THEFT OF MUNICIPAL TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two suspected thieves were nabbed late Tuesday when they returned for tools 
stolen from a municipal storage lot the night before, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools worth about $2,000 were taken from city-owned trucks parked at the lot 
on Newhope Street, then stashed in a large pipe near the property, said Lt. 
John Woods.After employees discovered the cache, police put the site under 
surveillance in case the thieves returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said police were waiting when Marvin Leroy Walker Jr., 28, of Cypress 
and Nicholas A. Nolan, 34, of Buena Park collected the tools about 11:30 p.m. 
Walker was captured immediately and Nolan, who ran away, was caught 30 minutes 
later hiding behind a nearby business, Woods said. All the tools were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of vehicle burglary, 
and possession of stolen property and burglary tools, Woods said. Nolan was 
also booked on suspicion of prowling, Woods said. Bail for each was set at 
$10,000.

 What strange political bedfellows a tollbooth can make. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's City Council meeting, there they were, united in opposition to 
tollbooths planned for Newport Coast Drive: conservative Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), his former rival Jim Toledano, a Democrat and 
candidate to succeed Ferguson, and activist Patrick Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people as far apart as Assemblyman Gil Ferguson and myself can come to 
agreement on something, you know it's a bad project," said Mitchell, 27, who 
was arrested a year ago Tuesday along with seven other Earth First! activists 
who had chained themselves to bulldozers to protest construction of the San 
Joaquin Hills toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said coastal residents will ask the courts to block a 50-cent toll 
planned for a 1 1/2-mile section of Newport Coast Drive by the Orange County 
Transportation Corridor Agencies. He also warned that Culver Drive could end up 
with 10,000 vehicles a day as motorists turn to the thoroughfare to avoid the 
toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will soon be a toll road through the middle of Irvine," Ferguson 
warned, urging formal opposition from council members. "I'm certain that the 
way they did it is unconstitutional and against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen residents -- including those who use Newport Coast Drive as 
a direct link from Coast Highway to UC Irvine, John Wayne Airport and South 
Coast Plaza -- spoke against the planned tollbooths. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they will review environmental reports in January.RUSS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tustin Assistant City Manager Christine Shingleton 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Marine Corps Air Station will be closed by 1999 or sooner, and 
Tustin officials are working on plans to develop the property into an area 
complete with homes, parks, schools and commercial buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1,620-acre helicopter base is known for its twin blimp hangers, which have 
been recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as the largest 
wooden frame structures in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Directing the base redevelopment project for Tustin is Assistant City Manager 
Christine Shingleton.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times correspondent Alan Eyerly, Shingleton 
outlined the planning effort. Q: What are some of the proposed uses for the 
base property? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A big thrust of the plan is to focus on education. We're looking at about a 
100-acre learning village, and we do have interest from an educational 
consortium that's made up of (Saddleback and Rancho Santiago colleges) and a 
number of other interested organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing (Marine) village is like a campus environment. They'd be looking 
at basically doing a vocational training facility and international village 
that's going to orient itself to 21st-Century jobs and also to Pacific Rim 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be language schools, foreign business training and a whole variety 
of high-technology training. We have a big, 88-acre regional park at one of the 
hanger locations. The county is interested in developing the park as a 
historical interpretive center. Their desire is to retain one of the hangers, 
which is nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the southerly portion of (the base) is oriented toward commercial 
business, and the residential areas are on the north and east sides of the 
base.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the most difficult aspect of the redevelopment project?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the biggest challenge is going to be creating the infrastructure 
necessary to accommodate the development. Most of the infrastructure here is 
more than 50 years old. These are all major arterial roadway extensions and 
loop systems that we're proposing, and none of that infrastructure exists now. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs are terrific. Roadways and infrastructure like water and sewer could 
bring our costs up to $200-$300 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Tustin officials enthusiastic about this project? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's extremely exciting. There are very few opportunities for communities 
like Tustin to be faced with planning from scratch the reuse of 1,600 acres. 
And we had it in Tustin with the East Tustin/Tustin Ranch area that's owned by 
the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 So we get one more shot. And that's really unique.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY URGED TO JOIN FIRE SERVICE COALITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversy over the city's future fire services erupted at the City Council 
meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of former council members and mayors warned the council that it should 
not consider contracting with the city of Orange for fire services.The former 
officials said the city should instead join the new countywide Joint Powers 
Authority, or JPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority is a proposed coalition of county government and 18 cities whose 
fire services are provided by the Orange County Fire Department. The coalition 
is scheduled to be in operation this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is the only one with service from the Orange County Fire Department 
that has so far refused to join the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to joining the authority, the council proposed that the city 
explore contracting with Orange for fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal alarmed 12 former mayors and council members. In a letter to the 
council, read by former Mayor Wayne Silzel, they warned that it would be 
dangerous to put the city "at the mercy of an already financially burdened 
city." The letter added: "Orange preferred and still would like to have the tax 
base of our city to augment its strained resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Patchin tersely responded to the warning and denounced what he 
called "uninformed backbiting." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as currently written, the Joint Powers Authority agreement is 
flawed and potentially dangerous. The council has protected the city by 
questioning the authority and refusing to join, Patchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silzel, in rejoinder, said, "I came here to say you're not listening to the 
community. . . . If you want to fight, I'll see you at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members are seeking reelection Nov. 8. BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After almost five years of fighting in court, city officials and plaintiffs 
who challenged the $335-million Bristol corridor redevelopment project have 
negotiated a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox will consider within the next several days 
whether to approve the settlement.The project is designed to expand Bristol 
Street and revamp more than a dozen commercial areas along its length, City 
Atty. Edward J. Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the settlement. I know staff is pleased to start work on 
the project area" to improve rundown areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Spix, who represented Robert T. Gonzales, an optometrist with 
offices in the project area, and Evangelina Avalos, a single mother who lives 
in the area, also praised the agreement as "beneficial to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement calls for the city to set aside 30% of the revenue generated by 
the project for low- and moderate-income housing. State law requires 20% to be 
set aside for that purpose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city must now reserve about $200 million during the 35-year 
project to buy, build or renovate housing for low- and moderate-income 
families, Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're targeting the lowest of the low-income families, the ones most in need 
and least able to protect themselves from economic distress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the agreement, the city will pay $149,000 in attorneys' fees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was originally approved in 1989, but Gonzales and Avalos sued to 
stop it. They argued that the city failed to do enough to find replacement 
housing for hundreds of families who might be displaced. JON NALICK

 Where is downtown, and how do its business owners pull it out of an economic 
tailspin? 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen business owners took the first steps toward answering those 
questions in a meeting Wednesday morning with city officials, who hope to 
encourage local merchants to band together and improve their commercial 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have one main street. We have so many, who do you pick to help?" 
City Manager Kevin J. Murphy asked the group.  
</P>
<P>
 While the problem might seem obvious to some people, what to do about it is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, according to Murphy, Mayor Clarence J. Turner, Economic Development 
Committee Chairman Rush Hill and consultant Edward Henning, is for merchants in 
each commercial district to bring in professional, mall-style management. 
</P>
<P>
 If the idea takes root, business owners in each district would get together to 
identify the strengths and weaknesses of their area, formulate plans and pay 
agreed-upon amounts into assessment districts to fund the management of each 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from business owners was wary but generally favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owner Joey Evans said she was encouraged by the possibilities of a 
business improvement district in central Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea and that finally people are waking up and smelling 
the bad stench," she said.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; PLANE CRASH REPORT EXPECTED NEXT WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release a preliminary 
report next week regarding Tuesday's airplane crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report will consist of information detailing what happened and, 
most likely, will fail to state the probable cause of the accident, which left 
its pilot and passenger in serious condition. The cause will be determined and 
released in a final report that could take up to six months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, Peter Fennell, 30, a California Highway Patrol officer from Orange, 
underwent a 12-hour surgery for severe lacerations to his right ankle and two 
broken ankles, said Lorraine Neher, a UCI Medical Center spokeswoman. She said 
Fennell was recovering from the surgery Wednesday and was listed in stable but 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger, Jeffrey Scott Brown, 27, of Mira Loma, was treated for a head 
injury at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim Hills and released 
Wednesday, Kaiser officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fennell had radioed the Fullerton tower Tuesday afternoon, saying he was 
experiencing trouble and requested permission to land the Piper Comanche 
aircraft just moments before he crashed into a telephone pole at the 
intersection of Malvern Avenue and Gilbert Street, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they heard the small plane sputter shortly before it crashed, 
and the lack of gasoline near the crash site caused speculation that it might 
have run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Elder, director of the airport where the crashed aircraft is being 
stored, said he did not want to speculate on the cause of the accident. "I 
don't know what the cause is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder said he may recommend that the City Council commend the crash onlookers 
who helped the victims out of the aircraft. Police said two of the helpers were 
Al Pregler, a Fullerton pilot, and Samuel Aguilar, a Whittier resident who 
works at Hughes Aircraft Co. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; HUNTINGTON'S GROWTH PLANS WORRY COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has expressed grave concerns over efforts to update 
neighboring Huntington Beach's General Plan, fearing significant increases in 
traffic if the proposed maximum development levels there are achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington Beach is becoming a new nation," said Seal Beach Councilwoman 
Marilyn Bruce Hastings after reviewing a report that listed proposed maximum 
development levels for that city by the year 2010."It just blows me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials are preparing a draft environmental impact report 
on a revised General Plan that would allow construction of an additional 18,400 
residential units, 3.2 million square feet of commercial space, 1.6 million 
square feet of industrial space and 2,800 rooms for overnight accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's maxed out, and if the project developers are not required to mitigate 
those impacts, someplace down the road we might end up bearing the cost of road 
improvements," said Lee Whittenberg, director of development services in Seal 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Beach Assistant Planner Brian James called the numbers a 
"worst-case scenario" that includes 4,286 homes proposed for the controversial 
Bolsa Chica development. He also said the revised General Plan would actually 
allow less development than the city's current General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just for the purpose of our environmental review," James said. 
"Realistically, those numbers won't be achieved. They are very inflated 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittenberg said that even if the Huntington Beach General Plan revision were 
approved, it would not guarantee approval for individual development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seal Beach Mayor George Brown said he was not reassured. "Once the door is 
opened, it will be very hard to close," he said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PLANNERS OK GATES AT EL NIGUEL HEIGHTS

<P>
 Under the watchful eyes of about 60 impassioned residents, the Planning 
Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved allowing El Niguel Heights to become 
a gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners also recommended letting non-residents through the gates during 
daylight hours to use the public Seminole Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The gates and the turnover of 22 city streets to the El Niguel Heights 
Homeowners' Assn. must still be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have urged privatization for years applauded the commission's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to just do it," Donald Kent said. "Privatize El Niguel Heights." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Commissioner Robert Healey voted for the gates at Augusta Drive and 
Niguel Road and at Glen Abby and Club House drives, he said he doesn't like 
seeing Laguna Niguel residents "running away from the problems of society by 
locking them out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in people shutting themselves off from the rest of the 
community," Healey said. "But it is not government's right to protect people 
from their own folly." 
</P>
<P>
 The association had wanted access to the park provided only at the Augusta 
Drive gate, which will be controlled by a guard. A commission majority, though, 
recommended installing a park access push button at both gates so pedestrians 
and drivers can let themselves past the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Three out of four homeowners in El Niguel Heights had voted for privatization, 
saying they hope gates will keep out thieves, speeders and vandals. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY HALL MOVING TO RENTED SPACE ON PALA 
</P>

<P>
 The city will get a new City Hall Monday, but it definitely won't resemble the 
Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although plans for a new civic center complex have been shelved for the near 
future, city officials will move into new, rented quarters after six years at 
the old La Alameda location.The city tried to build a City Hall in 1992, but 
the proposed building was criticized as being an opulent "Taj Mahal" and voters 
subsequently defeated a bond measure to fund construction of the facility by an 
overwhelming margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, movers will pile desks, computers and other office equipment 
from the only headquarters that Mission Viejo has known and move City Hall to a 
new home at 25909 Pala, Suite 150, near Alicia Parkway and Jeronimo Road. 
</P>
<P>
 When negotiations to extend the La Alameda lease failed, City Manager Fred 
Sorsabal struck a deal with owners of the Pala street building at a 
substantially lower rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo will pay $1.25 per square foot at its new location, rather than 
the $1.70 per square foot charged at the La Alameda location. 
</P>
<P>
 About 26,000 square feet will be rented on a five-year lease, which contains 
an escape clause after two years in case the city decides to build its own City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are nearing completion of a land swap with an Irvine-based 
developer that would trade eight acres of land at Los Altos street for a 
two-acre parcel at Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the land swap deal, the Staubach Co. would build a city library 
next to the two-acre site, which city officials say would someday become home 
of a new City Hall. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 2 NEW LAWS TOUGHEN PENALTIES FOR GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing the uphill fight against graffiti, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a pair 
of bills Wednesday authored by two Orange County lawmakers that increase 
parental liability for property defaced by their children and make it a crime 
to possess a marker with the intent to scrawl graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson cited the enormous costs of cleaning up graffiti and the proliferating 
violence associated with it in signing the measures authored by Sen. John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange) and Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti is more than just a blight to the eye," Wilson said. "It is also a 
major financial drain. . . . These bills will not only assist cities and 
counties in paying for their cleanup efforts, but also put the burden of 
punishment where it belongs -- with the vandal and the parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' bill makes it a misdemeanor to possess an aerosol paint can, a felt-tip 
marker or other marking device with intent to use it for graffiti. Maximum 
penalties are six months in jail, a $1,000 fine and 90 days' community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's measure, which was spurred by the Orange County Graffiti Task 
Force, would double the civil liability of parents whose children do graffiti, 
making the adults even more accountable for their children. Under current law, 
parents are liable in civil court cases for up to $10,000 damage caused by 
their children. Bergeson's bill raises the limit to $20,000.ERIC BAILEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; WOMAN LURED TO VAN, RAPED AT GUNPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old woman was raped Tuesday night after an armed man lured her into 
his van by asking for help with his sick child, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Mike Corcoran said the woman was walking in the alley behind a 
shopping center at the southwest corner of Beach Boulevard and Terry Drive 
about 6 p.m. Tuesday when she was approached by a man who pleaded for help with 
his child.The man told the woman that the youngster was inside a dark blue van 
and had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The man coaxed the woman toward the van's open side doors and, as she peered 
inside, grabbed her and pushed her into the vehicle, Corcoran said. The 
attacker then pulled out a handgun and threatened to kill the woman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, a Huntington Beach resident, was raped, then let out of the van, 
Corcoran said. The suspect fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said the woman was taken to a local hospital, where she was treated 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is still at large. He was described as a Latino with short dark 
hair, about 30 years old, six feet tall and weighing 180 pounds. He was 
unshaven and wearing a turquoise T-shirt and gray sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim described the van as possibly a late-model Dodge with tinted 
windows and a tire rack in the rear with no tire, Corcoran said. The vehicle's 
license plate is believed to contain the letters R and N and the number 4, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said that because of the partial license plate description, police 
believe they have a good chance of apprehending the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty confident with this one," he said. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PNEUMONIA BLAMED IN DEATHS OF MORE THAN 40 
GOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Test results released this week indicate that an outbreak of bacterial 
pneumonia apparently caused the deaths of more than 40 goats that had been 
grazing on city hillsides as part of a fire-prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 The goats, who create fire breaks on often rugged terrain by eating dry 
vegetation, suddenly began dying last week, prompting an investigation by the 
Fire Department and county health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no mystery disease, no major problem," said Dr. Richard Evans, chief 
of veterinary services for the Orange County Health Care Agency. "Everything 
seems to be under control now." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it does not appear that the animals had been grazing on poisoned 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 No new cases of pneumonia have been reported since Friday, he said. The sick 
goats have been isolated from the rest of the herd and are being treated with 
penicillin. About a dozen of the animals remain ill, and one died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said it is difficult to explain what caused the deadly outbreak, but he 
suspects that a highly contagious form of bacteria had been circulating in the 
herd of about 800 goats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably most of the goats picked it up, but some couldn't fight it off," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next 10 days, Evans plans to issue a series of recommendations to 
the Fire Department on ways to minimize outbreaks of such diseases. He added, 
however, that given the large herd size, the number of deaths "seems like a 
lot, but it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Richard Dewberry said the goats have become popular among Laguna 
Beach residents since the grazing program began in July. He also said it is 
much more cost-effective for goats to clear out excess vegetation than it is 
for human work crews to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's the best one out there," he said of the program.ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN ONOFRE; SURFER, 39, PULLED OUT OF OCEAN DIES

<P>
 A 39-year-old Cardiff man died Tuesday after he paddled out on a surfboard to 
take advantage of larger-than-normal waves generated by tropical storm Olivia. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, identified Wednesday as Marc Woods, was pulled from the ocean 
about 9:50 a.m. after another surfer discovered him face down in the 
water.Woods was taken to Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente, where he was 
pronounced dead at 11:16 a.m., said a spokeswoman for the Orange County 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy has been completed, the spokeswoman said, but the official cause of 
death will not be released pending results from toxicology and microscopic 
tissue tests. Woods had no history of medical problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tope, chief ranger at San Onofre State Beach, said the surfer who found 
Woods had exchanged pleasantries with him a few moments earlier while both were 
paddling out in an area about 150 yards from shore where the waves don't break. 
The area is between two surfing spots known as "Old Man's" and "The Point." 
</P>
<P>
 Tope said the witness reported that Woods' hair was dry and he was wearing a 
full wet suit when the two men spoke. But Woods was gasping and unconscious 
when the surfer next found him, Tope said. The man and two other surfers 
brought Woods to the beach, where two other bystanders helped begin CPR, Tope 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was one of several surfers lured to the water Tuesday by 
larger-than-normal surf, Tope said. The waves were smaller Wednesday, and no 
other serious incidents were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's spokeswoman said that Woods lived in a motor home and kept a 
post office box in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who worked for a fire extinguisher company in San Diego County, was 
unmarried and had no children, the spokeswoman said.JEFF BEAN

GSA CHIEF SAYS COURTHOUSE FUNDS ARE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new funding scheme to keep construction of Orange County's federal 
courthouse on track despite a surprise congressional budget cut is "a done 
deal," General Services Administrator Roger W. Johnson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who was home in Orange County on Wednesday, said his agency has 
culled $25 million from the long-term budgets of other projects and obtained 
approval from all the necessary congressional budget committees to use it for 
the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this "reprogramming" of GSA funding, unlike requests for new spending, 
does not require a vote of the entire Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, the money was shifted from projects that don't need it as 
immediately as Orange County's courthouse, on which construction was scheduled 
to begin in the upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case we were going out for bids. That's why it was so critical," 
Johnson said. Although Congress last year awarded $103 million for the 
courthouse project, the remaining $25 million was needed for full funding 
before the contracts could be awarded, he said. Johnson said he took notice 
when a congressional conference committee late last week cut the courthouse 
funding as part of a larger public works budget slash. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the GSA had studied and approved plans to build Orange County's first 
federal courthouse in Santa Ana. "It is a sound project that is needed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, former chairman of Western Digital and an Orange County resident, 
added: "I didn't do it just because it was Orange County. I would protect any 
worthwhile project anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In rapidly putting together a stopgap funding plan, Johnson said he received 
valuable cooperation from Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the 
Senate Treasury appropriations subcommittee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif).  
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne has done a very good job in protecting, or trying to protect, 
resources in California that she thinks are very necessary," he said. "She put 
a lot of pressure on the Senate to make sure we would find an alternative 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Feinstein delayed the Senate's final vote on the conference 
committee's slashed GSA construction budget "until we could find the money" for 
the courthouse. The Senate voted to approve the budget Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's Republican congressmen have berated the congressional 
conference committee for what they said amounted to sneaking construction 
projects into the GSA budget that were not authorized by the proper committees 
and cutting others to punish critics.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson declined to comment on that, saying, "It's just politics."

 An estimated 350 people turned out at City Hall on Wednesday to discuss -- and 
mostly disagree about -- a new environmental impact report for the proposed 
development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the Bolsa Chica project is a critical element of the future of 
this county," Bruce Brown, representing a pro-development group called 
Californians for Bolsa Chica, told the county Planning Commission. "We don't 
want to see the wetlands sit and degrade any further when there is an 
opportunity to restore them." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Boardman, president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, disagreed. "This is 
not a restoration plan," she said of the proposed development. "It is not 
permissible to build homes on wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first of three by the Planning Commission on the county's 
latest environmental impact report analyzing the development of Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 That report, released last month, contains two less ambitious alternatives to 
the plan proposed by Koll Real Estate Group, which owns most of the wetlands. 
While the Koll company proposes to build 4,286 homes, the latest county 
document proffers alternatives of either 3,200 or 2,500 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll plan is still on the table; the county's environmental impact report 
merely offers some alternatives and sends a message that the Koll plan might 
not be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Koll plan includes homes on 400 acres of both bluff areas and 
protected lowland marshes, it also commits the company to restoring 1,100 acres 
of wetlands. The county's 3,200-home plan calls for some development on 
protected lowland marshes and requires the company to restore the rest of the 
wetlands. The lowest-density plan would allow no homes on protected areas but 
would relieve Koll of any responsibility for restoring the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans proposed by the county would eliminate a $20-million tidal inlet 
connecting the wetlands to the ocean that is the centerpiece of the Koll 
company's proposed restoration plan, an omission that became a major point of 
contention Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were somewhat dismayed by the elimination of the tidal inlet," said Chuck 
Nelson, president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group. "It just 
makes sense for restoration that you include a tidal inlet." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Monroe, speaking for the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club, 
maintained that the wetlands could best be preserved without the inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask you to protect the full (area) and preserve it as open space," he told 
the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the public comments in an interview, Lucy Dunn, senior vice 
president of the Koll company, said the developer is sticking to its original 
plan. "Our wetlands restoration is the best," she said, "and the number of 
homes we have proposed is the number we need to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first of at least three planned by the commission to 
consider the Koll plan and the county's suggested alternatives. Eventually the 
commission will make a recommendation to the County Board of Supervisors. 
WHAT'S NEXT 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's was the first of at least three public hearings on the wetlands 
project that will be held by the Planning Commission between now and late 
November. After the hearings, the commission will make a recommendation to the 
Board of Supervisors, which is expected to consider the matter by the end of 
the year. If the supervisors approve the Koll Co. project, which they also can 
amend, it then needs the approval of the California Coastal Commission and the 
Army Corps of Engineers, which could take an undetermined amount of time. Once 
both agencies approve the plan, construction can begin. If everything goes 
well, proponents hope, construction could begin sometime in 1996. Supporters 
hope to begin restoration work on the wetlands by 1998.

CONFUSION, CONCERN OVER EL TORO LAND SWAP PROPOSAL; DEVELOPMENT: COUNTY PANEL 
DOUBTS IT WILL HAVE A SAY IN PLANS FOR THE MARINE BASE IF THE IRVINE CO. 
ACQUIRES THE PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of the Interior said Wednesday it is prepared to swap all 
of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station with the Irvine Co. except for 1,100 
acres, which the federal agency wants to keep as a gnatcatcher preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Department spokesman Jay Ziegler told the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority -- the county panel formed to study how the 4,700-acre base should be 
developed -- that the Irvine Co. was interested in obtaining the entire base, 
minus the 1,100 acres the federal agency wants to preserve, as part of a land 
swap. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine Co. Executive Vice President Gary Hunt, who addressed the planning 
group after Ziegler, said the developer has not decided how much of the base it 
wants to acquire and that it is not interested in land that might be used later 
for a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting punctuated with confusion and contradictory information, planning 
authority board members also expressed concern that they would only play a 
limited role in development plans for the base if the property is transferred 
to a private developer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once it becomes private property, how much can we dictate . . . what's going 
to be on the base?" said board member and Irvine Councilwoman Christina L. 
Shea. The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is scheduled to close by 1999, when 
the Marines are expected to have completed their move to the Miramar Naval Air 
Station in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting of the county planning agency was billed as the first time 
that Interior Department and Irvine Co. officials would publicly lay out 
details of their land-swap discussions. Instead, comments by Ziegler and Hunt 
added to the confusion and speculation surrounding the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a land swap, the Irvine Co. is looking at the entire" base, 
Ziegler said. Deeding it all to the Irvine Co. will simplify development plans, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunt followed Ziegler to the podium and contradicted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know what land we're interested in. We do know what acreage we're 
not interested in -- that's the acreage necessary to operate an airport," Hunt 
said. However, he quickly added that "if the county puts an airport there, we 
would be prepared to assist in that effort." 
</P>
<P>
 He also addressed Measure A, the initiative that would require a commercial 
airport at El Toro, and told the panel that the Irvine Co. is neutral on it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, it was apparent that nobody is sure how many acres the 
Irvine Co. would get in a land swap or how much of the company's property in 
the Cleveland National Forest, in North County, the federal agency would get in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler said afterward that his agency wants to acquire "ecologically 
sensitive" Irvine Co. land in and around Gypsum, Weir and Fremont canyons, 
which the federal government wants to preserve in conjunction with county and 
state environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for both the Irvine Co. and the Interior Department insisted they 
will support any development decisions for El Toro made by the county planning 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members are clearly nervous about the proposed land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder asked Ziegler what good the Interior 
Department's promises to continue working with the planning authority will be, 
once the federal agency makes a land swap with the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an issue I would need to take back to Washington," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Interior Department succeeds in establishing a gnatcatcher preserve at 
the base, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez asked Ziegler, "would you in effect not 
take these 1,100 acres out of (the county planning) process?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ziegler quickly backpedaled under further questioning by Vasquez and 
others, and said that if the planning board does not support the idea of a 
gnatcatcher preserve, his agency would drop the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Roger R. Stanton indicated he is not impressed with the idea of 
establishing a bird sanctuary at El Toro.  
</P>
<P>
 "They'll find someplace else to live if they had to," he said.

MAN GUILTY IN GANG SLAYING OF BYSTANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old man was convicted of first-degree murder Wednesday in Orange 
County Superior Court for his part in a gang shootout that left a 15-year-old 
bystander dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Van Nguyen of Westminster was the driver of a car that engaged in a 
shootout with rival gang members outside an Orange church on Aug. 6, 
1993.Lozaro Omar Acosta Jr., a Century High School sophomore and church choir 
member, was killed by an errant bullet while sitting nearby in his parents' 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's lawyer, Thomas Avdeef, said his client could receive life 
imprisonment when he appears in court for sentencing on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen is the third person to be convicted by juries of murder stemming from 
the shootout between warring factions of the local street gang. Three other 
members of the gang involved in the shooting have pleaded guilty, and another 
suspect is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Avdeef called the first-degree murder conviction harsh because Nguyen never 
held or shot a gun during the fight. Avdeef said he believes the jury was 
angered by the criminal history of the gang to which Nguyen belonged and did 
not look separately at his role in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Woodsmall said he believed the jury acted properly. 
"When someone in a gang commits a crime and is supported in that crime by his 
fellow gang members, they can all be found guilty," he said.

A HEALTHY GLOW FROM SUMMER; MOVIES: ORANGE COUNTY ART HOUSES MANAGE TO DO WELL 
WITH TITLES THAT MOST FILM-GOERS MIGHT NEVER HAVE HEARD OF. THOSE IN THE 
BUSINESS SAY THERE'S ROOM FOR GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a summer dominated by a handful of blockbuster films, "The Lion King," 
"Forrest Gump" and "Speed" leading the pack. It was also a summer that left 
some high-priced hopefuls gasping for want of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the art houses survive the dog days amid such bruising competition? 
Quite well, thanks, at least according to a check with Orange County's two 
leading outlets for foreign and independent films, the Edwards South Coast 
Plaza Village in Santa Ana and the Port Theatre in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Wardner, who manages the South Coast Plaza Village cinema, said the 
foreign film business in Orange County has secured a niche that frees it of 
competition with the summer blockbusters. Wardner said the art-house audiences 
seek out foreign films year-round and in a good week, 6,000 to 8,000 people buy 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty steady," he said. "We have established a base of people who 
really enjoy foreign films. I'll see the same people come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis O'Connor, who booked the Port until recently, said summers 
traditionally used to be a quiet time at art houses, a time to lie low until 
fall, the season for "serious" films. But, he continued, that has changed 
dramatically, largely because of two films that broke the mold: "The Crying 
Game" in 1992 and last year's "Like Water for Chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wardner agreed. For "Like Water for Chocolate," a Mexican film, "we had lines 
around the block," he said. "That was unheard of around here." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer didn't produce that kind of breakout hit, according to Joanna 
Siegel, who now books the Port. Some films, such as "Bhaji on the Beach" and 
"Go Fish," did well in short runs, but overall it was been a more "traditional" 
summer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One late entry had an effect, though: "Eat Drink Man Woman," the second film 
from Taiwanese director Ang Lee (who made "The Wedding Banquet") has been 
playing the Port for more than a month, and its audience continues to expand 
(the film is also showing at Cinemapolis in Anaheim and at the Bay Theatre in 
Seal Beach). "The word of mouth," Siegel said, "has been wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said it looks like a strong fall, not only for foreign and 
independent films but for offbeat or serious films from the major studios. Even 
Disney is getting in on the act, with "Quiz Show." Other entries coming to 
Orange County include Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp 
Fiction" and Woody Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are only two full-time art houses in the county, each is able to 
book exclusives without much direct competition. Indeed, representatives of 
both theaters have said there is room for growth here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found basically that Orange County is underserved in terms of the 
foreign, artsy type film," said Wardner. "You hear over and over people say 
they have to go all the way to L.A. to see an art film." 
</P>
<P>
 Mega-chain Edwards' entry into the art-house market is unusual given that 
nationally, the market tends to be dominated by smaller specialty chains (such 
as the Los Angeles-based Landmark, which operates the Port). 
</P>
<P>
 Wardner has tried to distinguish the theater with several touches, including 
tables and chairs in the lobby where people may sit and soak up classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an art gallery there. With cooperation from the Costa Mesa Art 
League, local artists have been lining up to display their photographs, 
paintings and sculpture in the lobby, and Wardner said the walls are booked 
through December of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater recently finished renovating the largest of its three screens, 
installing a digital sound system and bringing seating capacity up to 800, 
making it one of the largest theaters in the county, Wardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Port has plans of its own. The single-screen theater would be 
expanded into a triplex and would get a face lift under plans filed recently by 
Landmark with the city of Newport Beach (a permit still has to be issued). 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plans, Landmark intends to refurbish the 925-seat Port (new 
wallpaper, carpets and lighting fixtures) and to split its balcony area into 
two theaters, each with about 115 seats. The first-floor seating configuration 
would stay pretty much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Landmark used to operate the Balboa Theatre in Newport Beach until its lease 
ran out in 1992 (the building still sits vacant). Landmark also was a partner 
in plans for renovation of the Fox theater in Fullerton, until the recession 
scuttled that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel said she cannot comment on the proposed expansion of the Port but did 
say that booking it now is a challenge. She noted that most of Landmark's Los 
Angeles locations have multiple screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port "is a difficult theater to book because it's just a single screen and 
we like to put those 'A' titles in there," she said. When those "A" titles 
aren't available, as during much of this summer, the Port must engage shorter 
runs of less bankable titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Three screens at the Port could be a boon for local film aficionados in that 
they would allow Landmark to book the larger screen with relatively popular 
films and to reserve the smaller rooms for more adventurous fare that now often 
doesn't make it to Orange County at all.

TICKETS ARE A HOT TOPIC ON CAPITOL HILL; REGULATION: A HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE IS 
DISCUSSING A BILL TO REQUIRE DISTRIBUTORS TO DISCLOSE THEIR SERVICE FEES, AND 
IT IS EXPECTED TO ASK TICKETMASTER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS PRACTICES. THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS EXPANDING ITS INQUIRY INTO CONCERT SALES. 
</P>

<P>
 The debate over concert prices resumes today on Capitol Hill as a House 
subcommittee convenes to explore regulation of the ticket distribution 
industry, and as federal investigators expand their inquiry of the $1-billion 
concert business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's session, called by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), is intended to 
discuss a proposed bill that would require ticket distributors to disclose 
their service fees, but the session is also expected to explore whether 
Ticketmaster, the industry's largest ticket agency, was upfront about its 
practices at an earlier hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster is included in a Justice Department inquiry 
into anti-competitive practices. The investigation was prompted by a civil 
antitrust complaint filed in May by Seattle rock band Pearl Jam, which accuses 
Ticketmaster of exercising a national monopoly over ticket distribution and 
using its influence with promoters to derail the group's plans for a low-priced 
tour this summer. Ticketmaster denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell, the influential chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has 
asked Ticketmaster to provide additional data about industry practices and the 
company's financial dealings in an effort to clarify information the firm 
provided at a June 30 House Government Operations Committee hearing. That 
hearing focused primarily on the controversial arrangements involving 
promoters, venues and Ticketmaster that underlie pricing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the June hearing, Ticketmaster Chief Executive Frederic D. Rosen estimated 
that in 1993 his company sold less than 3% of the tickets to entertainment 
events nationwide and that it earns only about 10 cents profit per ticket. A 
recent internal Government Operations Committee memo obtained by The Times 
characterizes Rosen's explanation of Ticketmaster's transactions and profits as 
"misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Dingell sent Rosen a list of questions to be addressed at 
today's hearing, at which Ticketmaster is expected to be represented by company 
Vice President Ned Goldstein. Goldstein said Wednesday that suggestions that 
Ticketmaster may have provided misleading information at the last hearing are 
"absolutely and unequivocally false."  
</P>
<P>
 "We presented the facts and provided documentation to substantiate those 
facts," Goldstein said. "If they have questions, they have not contacted us to 
ask any questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), chairman of the subcommittee that called the 
first hearing, has since written to Anne K. Bingaman, the top prosecutor in the 
Justice Department's antitrust division, challenging Ticketmaster's 
arrangements with promoters and venues. Ticketmaster pays a portion of each 
service fee it collects to maintain exclusive long-term contracts with many of 
the nation's biggest promoters and concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Condit's Sept. 12 letter also demanded a public accounting of why the Justice 
Department approved the merger in 1991 of Ticketmaster and Ticketron -- which 
in effect put Ticketmaster's primary competitor out of business and resulted in 
higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That merger led to a monopoly," said Condit, who is a co-sponsor of Dingell's 
bill. "It's up to the antitrust division to do the right thing for consumers. 
We hope these hearings will help us get to the bottom of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's bill would address concerns about concert ticket sales raised 
recently by consumers. These would include complaints about tickets for this 
summer's Eagles concerts, for which service fees were not disclosed to ticket 
buyers. Those fees -- which sources said exceeded $6 per ticket -- were 
included in the face ticket price of each purchase but not explicitly 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 If it passes, Dingell's bill would mark the first nationwide regulation of 
ticket distribution. It would put transactions conducted by ticket service 
companies and ticket brokers -- those who buy and resell choice seats for 
profit -- under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission. Ticketmaster, 
which supports the bill, maintains that it already discloses its fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Justice Department investigation, which began in May, is 
proceeding. A department spokesman declined comment but acknowledged that the 
inquiry is moving forward. Among the recent developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials from the Justice Department -- which in May ordered Ticketmaster 
to surrender records pertinent to the inquiry -- have added investigators to 
the case and are continuing to conduct extensive interviews in several states 
with talent managers, promoters and venue operators, sources said. Industry 
figures contacted so far by the government include representatives for rock 
acts Sting, Meat Loaf, the Grateful Dead and R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month, investigators interviewed executives at several software firms 
who maintain that Ticketmaster's alleged lock on the concert business has 
prevented the implementation of cheaper, technologically superior systems in 
the ticket distribution market. One software firm was served with a "civil 
investigative demand" -- the equivalent of a subpoena -- requiring it to turn 
over documents that could help expand the scope of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three weeks ago, the Justice Department spoke with executives at MovieFone, 
a New York-based firm that sells movie tickets, whose partner, Pacer-CATS, 
recently sold a majority interest to Ticketmaster. Sources said MovieFone is 
concerned that Ticketmaster is attempting to establish a presence in the film 
ticket market as dominant as its position in the concert market.

THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE; COMMENTARY: CULVER CITY'S 
DECISION TO REVISE ITS ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM SENDS A MESSAGE THAT 
ARTISTS ARE EXPENDABLE AND SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. IT SHOULD BE REVERSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Culver City, artists are expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the blunt message sent last March, when the City Council made a bizarre 
revision of Culver City's art in public places program -- one that sent shock 
waves through the national arts community. 
</P>
<P>
 The volatile subject will be revisited tonight, as the City Council holds a 
public discussion on its controversial action. The fun begins at 7 p.m. in 
council chambers at the interim City Hall, Overland Avenue and Culver 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The original ordinance, like those in many other American cities, required 
that 1% of construction costs of major new public and private developments must 
go toward acquiring public art. The virtually unprecedented revision of the 
plan says that, in certain circumstances, the new building itself could satisfy 
the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city likes the design of a new building, the art requirement will be 
considered to have been met. Where architecture and art were both once 
encouraged to flourish, now architecture will be eligible to replace art. 
</P>
<P>
 How this diminishment qualifies as an improvement is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Both architects and artists can be expected to be on hand tonight to argue for 
and against the March decision, which was opposed from the start by the city's 
own advisory art committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance change was instigated by developer Frederick Smith and architect 
Eric Owen Moss, who are jointly executing several projects in Culver City. In 
advance of the March meeting, they lined up support for the change from a 
variety of sources, among them Museum of Contemporary Art director Richard 
Koshalek and curator Elizabeth Smith, who have organized several architecture 
shows at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a City Council report, Moss and Frederick Smith first approached 
the city's art committee in early 1992 about waiving the percent-for-art 
requirement on an already completed building renovation, based on the artistic 
quality they claimed for the project. The request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 A second request on another building renovation was made in November, 1992, 
the report says. Smith and Moss stated that a "steel ring, trusses and a 
circular piece on the roof were designed as artwork" by Moss, with the 
intention of meeting the art requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The art committee deliberated over the second plan on several occasions, the 
report says, ultimately denying the request in March, 1993. Basing their 
decision on a similar public art ordinance in Los Angeles, the committee 
unanimously voted to declare ineligible as project artists either participating 
architects, members of any consulting firms or "anyone with a vested or 
familial relationship" to them. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the City Council made its cataclysmic revision. Henceforth, a 
positive assessment of the architecture's quality, pending recommendation by 
the arts committee and subject to case-by-case review by the City Council, will 
qualify as having fulfilled the art in public places ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 While its supporters have claimed the change as a visionary recognition of 
architecture's civic significance, the acknowledgment has come at the cost of 
art. With one hand it places a laurel wreath on the architect's head, with the 
other it shoos the artist out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout of this less-is-more decision has been extreme. Hard-fought public 
art programs everywhere have been jeopardized by the precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the revision makes no sense, for the uniquely creative capacity of 
architects is already being tapped in public projects.

THE SOUND YOU HEAR IS GURUS' SPIRIT; THE AGGRESSIVE AUSTRALIAN ROCKERS RETURN 
TO THE RECORDING STUDIO TO HARNESS THEIR 'LIVE' ENERGY 
</P>

 The early '80s produced a bumper crop of rock 'n' roll groups encouraged and 
emboldened by the "anyone can be a rock star" mentality wrought a few years 
earlier by the punk and new wave schools. Unfortunately, staying power didn't 
seem to be a quality enjoyed by many of these groups: Such trends as "new 
romantic," "ska," "techno-pop," "cowpunk" and "psychobilly" came and went, 
seemingly within weeks of one another, making and breaking dozens of bands in 
their wakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because they never identified themselves with any fly-by-night 
movement of the moment and thus were harder to define, Australia's Hoodoo 
Gurus, who play tonight at the Coach House, have endured, even as they have 
functioned (at least in America) on the fringes of the "alternative" scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with their debut album "Stoneage Romeos" in 1983, the Gurus carved 
out a small but comfortable niche with an aggressive but melodic and 
entertaining blend of Fleshtones-like garage rock energy, Ramones-like humor 
and Crammps-like fascination with pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year hiatus from the recording studio, the Gurus' recently 
released sixth album, "Crank," finds them in an even louder and more audacious 
mode than usual. According to singer/principal songwriter Dave Faulkner, the 
album is an attempt to come closer to capturing the band's notoriously kinetic 
concert energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sound of it is a lot closer to our real, live sound," he said during a 
recent phone conversation. "We've always tried to get that, but I think it's 
not quite been nailed until now. I guess the songs we wrote were a bit more 
like our live show, too. Our songs have that same sort of atmosphere from the 
get-go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping to achieve the desired sound was producer Ed Stasium (Ramones, 
Living Colour, Smithereens), who allowed the normally self-produced group a 
chance to relax and to concentrate more on performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed made the difference," Faulkner said. "He was an arbitrator, hand-holder 
and general mood-lifter, that's what he did for us. He kept things nice and 
light and we were able to lean back and enjoy ourselves instead of having to 
worry about looking at each other and stressing out about the production 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, 36, grew up in remote Perth, Australia, listening to the Beatles and 
Rolling Stones albums his older brother brought home. When punk rock began to 
get its first wave of attention in the late '70s, Faulkner was all ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The punk experience really crystallized things for me, because I really 
always had a problem with the art-rock genre. I actually bought a Yes album 
once ('Tales of Topographic Oceans') and I couldn't understand it. I went to 
the record store and it was, like, a groovy import store with headphones and 
bean bags, marvelous innovations. I took the album home and was quite 
intimidated by it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Itching to join a band, Faulkner hooked up with some local kids, and a career 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first group was an R&B group, which I didn't appreciate at the time 
because I wanted to be in a punk group so badly. But there's things I learned 
in that group that I still draw on all the time today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoodoo Gurus came together in Sydney in 1981, combining the spirit and 
energy of punk with the rhythmic muscle of R&B and the pop sensibility of the 
early British groups. Faulkner utilized all the musical lessons he'd learned to 
that point in creating the group's sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got all these fans that come out and see us, luckily," Faulkner 
said. "I guess there's a lot of different bands that have come and gone -- 
mostly gone -- and we're still here, comin' at ya! As long as the music's fun, 
people want to hear us and there's no creditors hounding us, we're OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hoodoo Gurus play tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano. 9 Days Wonder and the Lemmings open. 8 p.m. $19.50. (714)

KPCC-FM STAFF CRITICIZE THE HANDLING OF ACCOUNTING ERROR; RADIO: LAYOFFS AND 
PROGRAM CUTS MAKE EMPLOYEES BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE $100,000 LOSS, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of layoffs and program cuts at KPCC-FM (89.3) stemming from a 
$100,000 "accounting error," employees at the public-radio station are upset 
about bearing the brunt of the financial crisis and have accused management of 
glossing over its responsibility to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 station employees -- some of them on-air personalities such as Ian 
Whitcomb and Zoe Walrond -- have had their hours reduced, and three others were 
laid off (but are continuing to work as volunteers). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually fuming with anger over this," said an employee who requested 
anonymity. "It seems that the innocents who are providing the programs are 
getting punished for something done by bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Several station insiders said they feel Pasadena City College, to which the 
station is licensed, has not sufficiently investigated who is responsible for 
the error. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the college is sweeping this under the rug," said a KPCC 
volunteer who also requested anonymity. "We have no sense that there is any 
kind of disciplinary action pending for the people who have responsibility for 
the accounting. I think it's unfair to ask the listeners and the staff to 
account for management's mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena City College President Jack Scott and KPCC General Manager Rod Foster 
said they did not know how the bookkeeping error occurred and refused to say 
whose responsibility it was and whether any disciplinary action was taken, 
citing the confidentiality of personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Scott initially told The Times that he was unaware 
of the error and denied that any staff members had been laid off, then 
clarified that no full-time staff had been cut. (The station has only five 
full-time positions, all management.) He disputed the suggestion from some KPCC 
staffers that no investigation had been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time there's a mistake at the college we look into it," Scott said. "We 
did look into it and found they did not have as good an internal accounting as 
they should have. We took steps to correct it. We simply said to them, 'You pay 
that back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foster maintained that the accounting mistake was being blown out of 
proportion. He said an equally significant cause of KPCC's belt-tightening was 
a drop in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're focusing too much on the accounting error as the source of our 
financial problems," Foster said. "It's not extraordinary at all to have some 
stuff just not get counted on the expenditure side, especially on informal 
books. The long and the short of it is, yes, there was an error and it did 
affect our budget, but also our fund-raising was down. We also had a lot of 
expenditures as a result of moving to our new building." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the station operates by borrowing from the college against 
projected income and then, after fund-raising efforts, pays the college back.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to account for exactly what happened," said Foster, who 
explained that the budget covered 5 spreadsheet pages and more than 300 line 
items. "Not every transaction got tracked in the informal books. Some paperwork 
probably got lost in the move." 
</P>
<P>
 But station insiders are upset that no one seems to be accountable for the 
mistake and question how the public will respond during the next fund-raising 
drive in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they would go to the listeners and say, 'Gee, we lost money. 
Now we want you to give us some more,' " one of the employees said. "You're 
either dealing with listener money or some kind of public money: That's all we 
have. And you have responsibility in either case to keep track of it. Let's 
face it, anybody who lost track of that kind of money in a private business 
would be on the street yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials have said that their decision to cut back personnel, though 
regrettable, was preferable to cutting out popular and expensive signature 
National Public Radio programs such as "All Things Considered" and "Morning 
Edition."

DUCKS TRADE AWAY YAKE; HOCKEY: RIGHT WING SHIPPED TO TORONTO FOR DAVID SACCO, 
WHO WILL START SEASON IN MINORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' original team is fast disappearing, and the team continued 
its overhaul Wednesday by trading right wing Terry Yake -- who led the team in 
scoring during its first season and has the only hat trick in team history. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira isn't hesitating to put his confidence in the 
batch of rookies who pushed Yake down the depth chart during the exhibition 
season. He sent Yake, 25, who had 21 goals and 31 assists last season, to the 
Toronto Maple Leafs for center David Sacco, 24, a 1994 U.S. Olympian with 
little NHL experience. Sacco is the younger brother of Duck right wing Joe 
Sacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said the younger Sacco, a playmaking center who was assigned to San 
Diego, gives the organization much-needed depth at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks haven't been sentimental with personnel decisions, having traded 
Yake and their first All-Star (Alexei Kasatonov), first captain (Troy Loney), 
first game-winning goalie (Ron Tugnutt) and first goal-scorer (Sean Hill). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the reality of the league that everybody gets better. You can't 
stand still," Ferreira said. "With first-year teams, you can get to a level 
really quick and then kind of hit a plateau. That's where you have to either 
get better players or be patient. You try to prepare for not taking a dip 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake, who turns 26 next month and has two consecutive 20-goal seasons, fell 
behind rookies Valeri Karpov and John Lilley at right wing during a poor 
training camp. But the Ducks' confidence in him was shaken by a poor finish 
last season in which he scored only one goal after Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry has a history of being inconsistent," Coach Ron Wilson said. "We've got 
roles for certain people, and the role he was falling into, he wouldn't be able 
to play. If he's on the third or fourth line, would he be able to check?" 
</P>
<P>
 The team believes rookies Paul Kariya and Karpov are ready to carry a large 
part of the scoring load, along with Bob Corkum, who finished one point behind 
Yake for the team scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Onward and upward. That's the whole thing," Wilson said. "You've got to make 
sure you improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake, who scored the first hat trick of his career Oct. 19 against the New 
York Rangers, said he has been happy in Anaheim and didn't realize until the 
past couple of days he might be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit like a hammer," Yake said after being called off the ice to meet with 
Ferreira while his teammates stretched, realizing what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did think I was in a good situation, and I considered buying a house over 
the summer," Yake said. "Then I slapped myself upside the head and said, 'You 
could get traded.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To say you're safe is never possible. If Wayne Gretzky can get traded, 
anybody can get traded. Being the leading scorer doesn't make you safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ferreira said he thinks Yake could have a better year playing in Toronto 
if he's on a line with Doug Gilmour, Mats Sundin or Mike Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect a better year this year myself," Yake said. "I feel if I scored 
50-something points with somewhat limited ice time in a situation here where I 
was not playing a lot on the power play, maybe with a team like that I'll pick 
up a few more. Especially if I do get to play with one of those three great 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco was surprised by the trade, even though he talked to his brother the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was hoping to get traded; we didn't talk about where," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing a good guy in Terry, a very good player. But I'm happy for my 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said David Sacco, who had three goals and five assists in eight games 
in the Olympics, lacks his brother's speed but can play the point on the power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is more the explosive winger, David's more the center iceman with good 
hands, clever with the puck." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco's scouting report was similar. "Oh yeah, and I think he's a pretty 
good guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Francois Jomphe, a minor league center, has been assigned to the Canadian 
national team. . . . Jon Battaglia, the Ducks' sixth-round pick in June, has 
been named to the U.S. national junior team for the World Junior Championships 
Dec. 26-Jan. 4 in Red Deer, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Yake said it was particularly hard to tell his wife, Tanya, about the 
trade because she was enjoying Southern California and was taking a class at 
Chapman University. They'll find it easier to tell their dog he's headed for a 
Toronto winter: "We have a nice Siberian husky. He'll probably enjoy it," Yake 
said.

O'MALLEY: BUILD A BRIDGE TO PLAYERS; BASEBALL: DODGER OWNER TELLS BUD SELIG 
MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO REACH OUT TO UNION TO MAKE IT A LEGITIMATE PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owner Peter O'Malley was back at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday, saying he went 
to Milwaukee this week to urge acting Commissioner Bud Selig to reach out to 
the players union and begin a process that will make the union a legitimate 
partner of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 While the trip could be perceived as the first indication of a big-market 
crack in the owners' solidarity, O'Malley said that would be wrong. He said he 
was acting on his own and still supports the salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, he thinks that both sides in the labor impasse need to be 
more creative and there is nothing contradictory about striving for the cap -- 
which the union steadfastly opposes -- while trying to build a bridge to the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we can't agree on the formula, there's no reason we can't let them in 
on the ground floor now," O'Malley said of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much going on in the area of TV, licensing properties and the 
commissioner's office that now is the time to give the union a meaningful 
presence and not just that of a potted palm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no downside to it." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said there are many areas in which the union could be involved in the 
discussion and decision-making process. He said the 1994 negotiations were 
based at one point on the concept of a partnership, but the long history of 
mistrust on both sides -- as well as the ideological differences over the cap 
-- have seemed to foreclose on that objective. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the players believe the owners plan to unilaterally implement 
the cap and try to break the union, O'Malley seemed to offer a different 
perspective, saying even if the union is unwilling to accept the current terms, 
there is no reason the environment and relationship can't begin to change, the 
mistrust confronted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult problem, but all problems are solvable," he said. "The 
challenge is to show creativity and imagination, and to solve it soon. I've 
been concerned for a long time about our inability to work together, and I'm 
concerned about the threat of the current situation on next season and the 
preparations we have to make over the winter. We have to resolve this in the 
next week or two, not the next month or two." 
</P>
<P>
 As owner of one of baseball's richest and proudest franchises, O'Malley has 
been something of a silent partner in the current dispute, on the outside 
looking in. His tenuous relationship with Selig has been chronicled, but he 
said that he did not go to Milwaukee to impose himself on the process or any 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a falling out over the need to have a full-time, outside 
commissioner," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He favored the hiring of a commissioner after joining Selig and Chicago White 
Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf in pushing Fay Vincent out of office, but Selig and 
Reinsdorf preferred waiting until the labor negotiations were resolved, 
avoiding the possibility of a commissioner interfering. 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Malley has questioned Selig's conflicting role as small-market 
owner and acting commissioner and recently apologized to Vincent for 
participating in his overthrow, saying he wouldn't have done it had he known 
the consequences, he insisted Wednesday that "there was no need for fence 
mending" in his meeting with Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said they have been friends for more than 20 years, worked together 
on many projects and that he understood Selig's desire to surround himself with 
the people he is most comfortable with. O'Malley named Jackie Autry of the 
Angels, Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Tom Werner of the San Diego Padres, 
Fred Kuhlmann of the St. Louis Cardinals and Doug Danforth of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said Tuesday's hour meeting was clear, direct and devoid of "any 
beating around the bush." 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Bud that I continue to support Richard Ravitch's proposal and pointed 
out to him that he has an extraordinary opportunity as leader of the 
small-market clubs, acting commissioner and chairman of the executive council 
to accomplish something significant in terms of the future of the game and the 
relationship with the players," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I impressed on him that both sides need to be more imaginative and creative 
and that we need to reach out to the players and resolve this now because I 
fear our longtime fans have reached the absolute limit of their patience, and 
that's the most important issue of all." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said the meeting was cordial and constructive and that he agreed with 
O'Malley on everything, particularly the need to establish a partnership with 
the union. He acknowledged, however, that 30 years of mistrust on both sides 
has made it impossible to find agreement on the most basic issues and that 
"there are probably people on both sides who are so resentful of the other that 
they'd say 'to hell with it.' I don't accept that and don't agree with it. Any 
reasonable and rational future would have to be based on a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but there is no sign of the quick resolution O'Malley favors, and 
Selig will be in New York today, meeting with his newly formed operations 
committee, charting the next steps for the owners and the ground rules under 
which they will operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The union was not invited.

RAMS A SURPRISE AT 2-2, BUT RESPECT HARD TO FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waiting outside the weight room for practice to begin Wednesday, a group of 
Ram players sang off-key and made strange noises like pigs and other barnyard 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it great to be 2-2? 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks into the NFL season, the Rams are giddy with victory but also are 
suffering from the Rodney Dangerfield syndrome -- nobody respects them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a 16-0 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and Joe Montana, one of the 
best quarterbacks to play the game, wasn't enough. And now Atlanta wide 
receiver Andre Rison is carping again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison taunted the Rams again Wednesday -- two days after Ram free safety 
Anthony Newman challenged him to run pass routes over the middle of the field 
when the teams meet Sunday in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more important things to think about than a comment from a wanna-be," 
said Rison, a Pro Bowl selection the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as his threats, our defensive backs weren't too fond of it. I guess 
there are going to be a lot of people afraid to come over the middle, if you 
know what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison insulted the Rams three weeks ago by guaranteeing a victory over them, 
then running short sideline patterns and catching two touchdown passes in a 
31-13 Falcon victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he had a big game on us," Newman said Monday, "but he didn't come over 
the middle. I challenge Andre to come over the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman backed off somewhat Wednesday from his original challenge, which was 
issued during a live local telecast after "Monday Night Football." Rison heard 
the comments Tuesday, and fired back a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman's response to being called a "wanna-be?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I just laughed," he said. "Words never hurt me. It sounds like something from 
the WWF (World Wrestling Federation). And I'm not part of the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing more to say. No more to stir up. It's not a wrestling match 
out there. Andre has a job to do, and I have a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds as if Newman is backing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to back down on," he said. "I have my area to cover, and if 
anyone comes in there, I'm going to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I challenge any receiver to come over the middle. If he doesn't, I feel I'm 
getting (cheated)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' public relations department alerted the players and coaches of 
Rison's comments early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox was asked if he had spoken to Newman about toning down 
his comments to keep Atlanta from getting any more bulletin-board material. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not our style, the Rams' style," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Has he discussed that with Newman? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't discuss with people who I have talked with and what I've said," Knox 
said. "I don't have to tell you, and that's what I'm trying to tell you, in a 
nice way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said to the whole team at various times that it's what you do that 
speaks so well. We don't need to hear what you say." 
</P>
<P>
 So did he say that to Newman on Wednesday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said that a lot of times," Knox said. "To the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison didn't come Newman's way much when the teams met Sept. 11 in the Georgia 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison caught 12 passes for 123 yards, primarily in one-on-one coverage against 
cornerback Steve Israel. Although Israel recently returned from a left knee 
injury, Rison will match up against his friend, Darryl Henley, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My routes aren't designed to go over the middle, they're designed to go to 
the end zone," Rison said.

<P>
 "If he (Newman) has been in the league six or seven years, and I've been 
playing the Rams six or seven years, and he doesn't know that by now, I don't 
know when he will know it." 
</P>
<P>
 One theory is that Newman's challenge will entice Rison to come over the 
middle, where he and strong safety Marquez Pope can give the cornerbacks help 
on coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was smart on their part," Newman said of the Falcons' strategy in the 
last game. "They put Andre on the corner with no help. One on one, it's almost 
impossible to cover Rison." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newman also may have jeopardized Ram receivers by upsetting the Falcon 
secondary. Based on what Rison said Wednesday, wandering over the middle 
against the Falcons will be like crossing the Santa Ana Freeway at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're going to see who the chicken-hearted wide receivers are," Ram 
receiver Jessie Hester said. "I've been in the league nine years, and I've been 
over the middle lots of times. I'm not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are hoping to put more pressure on Falcon quarterback Jeff George, 
who completed 29 of 38 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns while avoiding 
sacks with a three-step drop and a quick release. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is coming off one of its best games last week, shutting out 
Montana for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't believe people respect our defense," Newman said. "Not anyone 
in the league, the press, anybody. We still have to prove ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They did to Montana, who finished with only 175 yards passing and was 
pressured by defensive linemen Fred Stokes, Robert Young, Jimmie Jones and Sean 
Gilbert. Pope, linebacker Roman Phifer and safety Keith Lyle each intercepted 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game was a big, big confidence builder," Pope said. "Who would have 
thought that Montana would get shut out last week? Who thought the Chiefs would 
get shut out? 
</P>
<P>
 "And who thought it would be the Rams who did it?"

A COMPLEX NAPOLEON; KAUFMAN'S SIZE CONFOUNDS NFL AND HIS HEISMAN CHANCES ARE 
HURT BY SANCTIONS, BUT THE NUMBERS ARE STACKING UP QUITE WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least they resisted the poster of Napoleon as Bonaparte, the little general 
in the French officer's coat, one hand tucked inside, the other with a 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they didn't try. The school's drama department had the coat, but 
Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc looked at the proofs and asked out. What Kaufman 
wants, Kaufman gets at Washington, and the preseason promotional poster is of 
him in a football uniform, biceps flexed so the tattoo of his mother's name on 
his left arm stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Napoleon's Numbers" is the headline, and they begin with 1, making sure it is 
known he was the only player in the top 25 in NCAA statistics in rushing, 
scoring, kickoff returns and all-purpose yards last season. And they include 
2,815, the miles from Seattle to the Downtown Athletic Club in New York, home 
of the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 In between there is 400, his top best bench-press mark, according to the 
hypesters. With all of the people at Washington's door with Pacific 10 
Conference and NCAA sanctions the last two years, the school doesn't need the 
truth-in-advertising guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's top mark was 385 pounds -- until August, when he increased it to 
420. 
</P>
<P>
 Update that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, update a lot of them. Every Saturday night, after the Huskies play, 
postcards are mailed with his statistics. Against USC: 244 yards. Against Ohio 
State: 278, including 211 rushing yards. Against Miami: 102, the last two 
breaking Washington's all-time rushing mark, besting Hugh McElhenny, and the 
Huskies ended Miami's 58-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 You are reminded that Kaufman is a 1994 Heisman Trophy candidate and prompted 
to remember him as "America's Most Exciting All-Purpose Player." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the hype. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kaufman's numbers, 443 rushing yards and 624 all-purpose yards in three 
games, all against ranked teams, he doesn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, I think he's as good a back as we've ever played against 
since I've been here," said Bob Field, who is in charge of preparing UCLA's 
defense to handle Kaufman on Saturday in Seattle. He has coached in Westwood 
for 16 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington Coach Jim Lambright didn't want to lose Kaufman, who was 
considering forgoing his final year to enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over for Don James after the Huskies were sanctioned for three 
years for NCAA violations mostly involving the school's summer jobs program, 
Lambright has been recruiting players to stay and running off several deemed 
not loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started to recruit Napoleon with three games to go in the regular season 
last year," Lambright said. "We exposed him to the NFL and they gave him their 
opinions. Napoleon wants to live here in the Seattle area eventually. He wants 
to bring his mother here eventually to live. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Then we said, 'Let's talk about you as the great small back. If you're going 
to go high in the NFL (draft) in a year, what areas do we have to improve in?' 
The NFL personnel people were good enough to back us up in this, as far as his 
being a receiver downfield, returning punts and playing better in the big 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambright hired a new offensive coordinator, Bill Diedrick, and charged him 
with confounding defenses keying on Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd better know where he is," Field said. "They'll line him up at tailback 
in their I-formation. They'll have him at splitback. Sometimes they'll line him 
up at wide receiver. He can be anywhere on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Including punt and kickoff returner. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches told Kaufman he would get the ball between 30 and 35 times a game. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Kaufman has had the ball 31 times against USC, 38 against Ohio State, 
31 against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You've got the talent, so we're going to go ahead and hype you up 
for the Heisman,' " he said. "But there were really no promises." 
</P>
<P>
 His NFL prospects helped with the decision. When he says, "I've chosen not to 
discuss (the pros' feedback) in the press," it's clear the NFL did not show 
great interest in a 5-foot-9, 185-pound running back. 
</P>
<P>
 His size confounds the NFL computers, sending back a warning. And there are 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of his weaknesses a year ago, when the NFL came in and took a look at his 
videos, was his ability to compete against the best competition," Lambright 
said. "That's basically where the NFL (is) going to be rating you as far as the 
draft goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Remedial work was ordered. Last season he gained 51 yards in 18 carries 
against Ohio State. This season, 211 in 32. Last season against USC: 119 yards 
in 18 carries. This season: 152 yards in 26. Last season against UCLA: 81 yards 
in 19 carries. Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman bridles at the big-games assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't agree with that, only because it takes a team to win," he said. "It 
wasn't like I was looking at the tapes and I was making all kinds of mistakes 
and I wasn't running the ball right. . . . I'm not the only one out on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's the target, and that hasn't changed. Kaufman invites major league 
hits every Saturday, lowering his shoulder at the sideline instead of taking 
the easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tough," he said. "If I didn't want to hit, I'd play tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Said teammate Eric Battle: "He's afraid to fail. He's doing what it takes to 
get where he needs to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 2,815 miles from Seattle to the Downtown Athletic Club are mostly 
uphill for Kaufman, whose team is out of the mainstream in the Northwest. 
Because of sanctions Washington cannot play in a bowl game, but that should not 
affect the Heisman voting, which is done in November and early December. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambright has used the sanctions to focus on the Huskies' first four games, 
and Kaufman has performed whereas some other potential candidates have not. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley, Notre Dame's Lee Becton and UCLA's 
J.J. Stokes, have suffered injuries. Others, such as USC's Rob Johnson and 
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom, have not played to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman simply keeps piling up the numbers -- Napoleon's Numbers, which need 
no posters or hype to make a statement.

OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE ICE; BETTMAN SAYS NEW STRUCTURE NEEDED IN NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is bring our broadcasting arrangement into the 20th 
Century, although it's almost the 21st."  
</P>
<P>
 -- NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, announcing a five-year, $155-million 
television contract with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Delete the words our broadcasting arrangement and substitute the NHL , and it 
perfectly sums up Bettman's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer who became the NBA's general counsel and third-in-command, Bettman, 
42, developed a hard-driving, business-oriented philosophy based on the example 
of his boss, Commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Through force of will and more than a little arm-twisting, this New Yorker, 
who admittedly was not "a hockey guy" when he was hired, has done more in 20 
months to buff the NHL's image than his predecessors did in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office on Feb. 1, 1993, Bettman has overseen expansion, 
realignment, a revision of the playoff system and a rebuilding of the NHL's 
marketing operations. He enhanced the league's integrity by delegating 
disciplinary matters to Brian Burke, a former player and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He also defused an alleged game-throwing scandal involving the Ottawa 
Senators, using that as a springboard to adopt an NBA-style draft lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman made sure games went on without interruption last season when on-ice 
officials staged a 17-day strike. He won four years' labor peace and greater 
control over the quality of their performances while conceding no more than he 
offered before they walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Bettman settled a long-simmering dispute with the International Ice 
Hockey Federation over compensating clubs whose players leave for the NHL and 
cleared the way for NHL players to participate in the 1998 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 From Stern, whom he called the most important professional influence in his 
life, he learned the value of marketing and merchandising and of selling the 
league around personalities. He sold Nike and Anheuser-Busch on the vitality of 
the NHL and having them as major advertisers in turn sold Fox on the league's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm impressed with him," said Craig Patrick, Pittsburgh Penguin general 
manager. "He's real concerned about the economics of our business. He's a 
businessman, and the way things are right now, we need to improve the business 
conditions for the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 That focus on the business end of the game has thrust Bettman into the most 
difficult and emotional confrontation of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, after prolonged negotiations failed to produce a collective 
bargaining agreement with the NHL Players Assn., Bettman announced he will 
delay Saturday's season openers unless a deal is reached. Labor unrest has 
marred a season only once before: Players struck for 10 days before the 1992 
playoffs, but postponed games were made up. 
</P>
<P>
 A similarly swift resolution this time appears unlikely. Intensive talks over 
the last two weeks have produced no accords, and barring a dramatic turn in the 
next day, NHL arenas will be silent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman was willing to go through last season without a contract because he 
was still new to the job and had other fires to put out first, such as the 
officials' contract and expanding the league's television exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is concentrating on the NHL's economic foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of this league depends on a new collective bargaining agreement," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His insistence on a deal that involves a salary-revenue link also comes from 
the NBA, whose owners adored a system that reduced costs and made expenditures 
more predictable. He also found such a system appeals to owners of prospective 
expansion franchises because it gives them an idea of what the financial risks 
are as well as a sense of control. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't underestimate the expansion factor in the NHL's scenario. There's a 
line of wanna-be owners waiting for a settlement -- and a promise of no union 
problems -- so they can pay entry fees upward of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the plan supported by Bettman, salaries would be a negotiated percentage of 
clubs' revenues. Clubs that exceed the limit would pay a levy, which would be 
disbursed to small-market clubs. Bettman also would set minimum payrolls, which 
he contends would make teams more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL Players Assn., led by Bob Goodenow, claims that plan would inhibit 
owners' spending because the levy would drive up the cost of signing players. 
It proposed a 5% levy on clubs' gate receipts and distribution of those pooled 
funds to small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, who helped implement the NBA's salary cap during a tense period when 
several franchises were near collapse, won't call his plan a salary cap. He has 
used the term "next generation system." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever he calls it, it's clear that of all the issues being discussed, he is 
least flexible on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a determined, aggressive and even abrasive negotiator," said Don Meehan, 
who represented the NHL Officials Assn. in bargaining with the league a year 
ago. "We had some difficult moments. There was name-calling. We threw rocks. He 
tested our determination, will and conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn. 
and another former negotiating adversary, predicted this stalemate two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob Goodenow is going to have his work cut out for him with Gary," Grantham 
said in December of 1992. "Gary is a doer. He understands the concept of vision 
and setting goals and how you get there. . . . He's straightforward. He's 
hard-nosed. He has a lot of tenacity and he is quite thorough." 
</P>
<P>
 To Bettman, thoroughness is essential to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done our homework and we're approaching things in a practical, sensible 
way, looking at the long term," Bettman said. "What we've tried to do all along 
is put a professional, hard-working organization in place that could execute 
the various elements that must be in place to run a professional sports league. 
A deal (with the players) is one of those elements. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The Fox deal isn't the end, it's the beginning for us. We are going to be an 
attractive house. What we're doing is ensuring the house doesn't fall down. 
Unless you have a strong enough house, you're not going to have competitive 
teams, and that means you won't have ratings. An illusory, short-term (labor) 
fix is not going to serve us any good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he took office, Bettman declared his objective was to be a protector of 
the game. Although his way of protecting it might result in postponing the 
start of the season, he has the full support of owners, who hired him for five 
years at about $1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 He has won the support of the NHL's old-line, cigar-smoking, back-room dealers 
as well as its younger, progressive figures with his instinct for when to 
flatter and when to be blunt. His ability to talk bottom-line has won the 
allegiance of the league's heaviest financial hitters, the Walt Disney Co.'s 
Mighty Ducks and Wayne (Blockbuster) Huizenga's Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 He is concerned about the NHL's small-market clubs -- "So much of the league's 
cultural heritage is in Canada and in those cities," he said -- but he isn't 
governed solely by them. And while he isn't hesitant to consult Boston General 
Manager Harry Sinden or Panther President Bill Torrey for hockey advice, he 
resists being railroaded by them or the NHL's other established power brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 They have bought his assertion that only if labor peace is assured will more 
advertisers pump money into the league and will more people watch games on ESPN 
and Fox, which will lead to additional expansion, advertising and merchandising 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, by waiting until the start of the season to lock players out, he made 
sure owners got gate receipts from exhibition games without having to issue 
paychecks, which players don't draw until the season begins. Owners wouldn't 
have to pay players during a lockout, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very satisfied so far," said one executive who requested anonymity. 
"But the bottom line is the result. If we end up with a good result, fine. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why force the issue now? Look at baseball (and its season-ending strike). We 
don't want anything like that. It's a matter of who has leverage when, and we 
have it now. I think Gary's got a good plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Patrick: "What he did emphasized that there is a deadline, and when 
there's a deadline, things happen. We all find it that way with the trading 
deadline. We talk for a month and nothing happens. Then, the deadline is on top 
of us and we do things." 
</P>
<P>
 Players, however, think Bettman mainly intends to break their union. They 
discount his claim he acted to preserve the NHL's integrity and avoid a repeat 
of baseball's strike-shortened season. They say he is putting his personal 
stamp on the league. Why else would he halt play after a successful 1993-94 
season that left fans hungry for hockey? 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Bettman's postponement warning, fans lined up outside The Pond 
in Anaheim and snapped up 22,000 single-game tickets in a few hours. Why risk 
losing those fans -- and squander a chance to win a new audience among unhappy 
baseball fans? 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't compare hockey to baseball. If he is, he's sadly mistaken," said 
Dave Gagner, the Dallas Stars' player representative. "Baseball has deeper 
roots and the fans are going to be there. If he thinks hockey fans are going to 
come back, he's nuts. I honestly believe Gary Bettman has an agenda he has to 
force on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA's negotiating 
committee: "Did he have to (threaten a delay)? I believe he wants to. It's just 
not good for the game. . . . I don't believe there's a commitment by the 
ownership group to start the season Oct. 1. I don't think they want to. They 
believe we're going to be in a position of weakness and give in after we miss a 
paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is, of course, a tenet of negotiating. Seek your opponent's weakness and 
hammer away at it.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be very difficult in these negotiations, as he was in the 
negotiations we had with him," Meehan said. "But at the end of the day we were 
very happy and I think they were too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one is happy now. Players are still bristling over Bettman's decrees before 
training camp, ranging from the minor (taking away training camp meal money) to 
the major (cutting game rosters) to the annoying (rescinding the limit 
practices can last). 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh though his move seemed, it kick-started the talks. And it gave him the 
chance to appear generous when he promised to restore rescinded benefits if a 
deal is made that can save the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bettman doesn't see himself as a hard-line negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a deal maker," he said. "But when somebody doesn't want to make a deal, 
you've got to use all the resources that are available to you. My preference is 
to go quietly into a room and work things out. But that's not happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're as tough as you have to be. And Bob Goodenow isn't a pussycat." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow has been as tough as Bettman. After hearing some players say they 
would accept a rookie salary cap in exchange for quicker free agency or the 
restoration of arbitration, he rallied players back into line. He won't yield 
on any form of salary restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stubborn men, one season in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate if the season gets derailed," Goodenow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman will be remembered as the man who derailed it. But he will accept 
being vilified if it ultimately brings the NHL closer to his vision of a secure 
financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is reallocation (of wealth). This isn't punishment," he said. "Players 
and fans benefit from a healthier league. . . . We -- that's the league and 
teams and owners -- know there's no choice but to come out of these 
negotiations with the principles we've articulated."

THE CAN-DO KID; THERE'S NOTHING ARTIFICIAL ABOUT BIRMINGHAM'S CHARLIE ARANGO, A 
WIDE RECEIVER WHO TOSSED HIS PROSTHESIS TO PROVE HE COULD CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Arango watched a pass bounce off his left arm for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 He was acutely aware of the problem and decided it was time to eliminate it -- 
forever. When Arango arrived home one day after playing in a junior high, 
flag-football game, he took off the rubber prosthesis that covered his 
three-quarter length arm and never wore it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day he told me, 'Daddy, I don't need it. I feel more comfortable like 
this,' " Hugo Arango, Charlie's father, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Arango had mixed emotions. He had brought his family to Los Angeles from 
Guatemala in 1981 for the sole purpose of getting an artificial limb for his 
only child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charlie saw no need to wear a substitute hand on his left arm, especially 
if the device would hinder his football career. His father reluctantly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is normal," Arango said, pointing to his left arm during a 
practice session this week. "This is how I was born. I don't feel different." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years have passed since Arango tossed his rubber prosthesis into a 
closet. And he certainly doesn't miss it now that he is a starting wide 
receiver for Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's a tough kid," said Paul Prince, the Braves' quarterback. "He dives 
for all the balls. He puts 110% effort into every single route he runs. He 
wants to prove to everyone that he can catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Arango proved long ago he was a football player, according to Birmingham Coach 
Chick Epstein. The 5-foot-9, 150-pound senior started three games at cornerback 
and a half-dozen others at outside linebacker last season in addition to his 
duties on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Arango feels the same as any other athlete on the field, he cannot 
escape the visible difference that some opponents ungraciously point out. Like 
the time nearly two weeks ago when Birmingham played University High.  
</P>
<P>
 "I went in for a punt return and (a University player) said, 'Oh, I got the 
guy with no hand. . . . I got the one-armer,' " Arango said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the focal point of stares and rude comments is nothing new for Arango. 
People are always going to stare, he said. It's something he has learned to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just smile because it doesn't hurt me," he said. "I went through it in 
junior high." 
</P>
<P>
 Until age 10, Arango shied away from sports. He had given in to his 
classmates' assumption that he could not play traditional American sports such 
as basketball, baseball and football. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Saturday, Arango had a change of heart. A friend, Elden Henry, 
persuaded Arango to play in a pick-up football game. Arango's ability to catch 
Elden's passes surprised many, including himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Elden and Charlie began envisioning themselves as Joe Montana and 
Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Elden) used to always say, 'Montana to Rice,' " Arango said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a wide receiver was born. Arango redecorated his bedroom with pictures and 
posters of Jerry Rice. Catching passes and running for touchdowns was all 
Arango wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain he was too small to play football as a freshman at Birmingham, Arango 
waited until his sophomore year to try out for the team. He was a wide receiver 
on the Bee team that year even though skeptical teammates doubted he would be 
able to contribute. He soon proved them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the hardest worker out here," assistant coach Dave Lertzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arango is motivated by the nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is something you could do and you have both hands and I can't do it, 
I'm gonna keep trying until I do it," he said. "I won't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Arango what is impossible for him and he will quickly answer, "climbing a 
rope." But feats beyond that, he said, have yet to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 He bench presses 195 pounds with the help of three spotters and has a daily 
workout routine replete with push-ups and biceps curls. He learned to tie his 
shoes at age 5 and can do so as quickly as a two-handed person. And he drives a 
stick-shift Toyota Celica. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does everything," Hugo Arango said. "I never help him. I let him do it. 
He's got to try hard and learn it for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Arango, who brings in the offensive play to the huddle, has started in each of 
the Braves' victories over Canoga Park, University and Reseda. But his dream of 
catching a touchdown pass has yet to be fulfilled. In fact, he is still waiting 
for his first catch. But, according to his coach, it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will catch a touchdown pass, no question about it," Epstein said.

OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE ICE; GOODENOW WILL WAGE FIGHT AGAINST A CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What you need to know about the dark ages of NHL labor negotiations can be 
summed up by the nicknames of the two principals who once were the most 
powerful men in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziggy and Iggy. 
</P>
<P>
 Former NHL President John Ziegler and R. Alan Eagleson, executive director of 
the NHL Players Assn., were not exactly adversarial, setting a most disturbing 
trend in labor relations. They were running mates -- attending Wayne Gretzky's 
wedding and traveling to the Soviet Union together. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gretzky was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Kings in August of 
1988, Ziegler was tracked down for a comment. He was found on the golf course, 
sharing a cart with Eagleson. Thus, there was little surprise that Eagleson's 
charges -- the players -- were docile. 
</P>
<P>
 What you need to know now is that NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and the 
current executive director of the NHLPA, Bob Goodenow, won't be tending the 
flag for each other. Or sampling strawberries and cream together courtside at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 While it might be easiest to define Goodenow by what he is not -- namely, 
Eagleson -- that is the incomplete way. Eagleson, after all, is under federal 
indictment for racketeering. Government authorities are trying to extradite him 
from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a two-year span, Goodenow, 41, has helped change the adjective 
describing the union's image from supplicant to militant . In 1992, he led the 
players in a 10-day strike, the first such stoppage in league history. Now, 
faced with a Friday deadline for a season-opening lockout from Bettman, 
Goodenow is not flinching, saying that the latest proposal from the owners is 
unacceptable and that it still essentially caps salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they look at Mr. Goodenow as being the same as Mr. Eagleson," 
said King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA's negotiating 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley paused and started to smile, saying: "They see Mr. Goodenow sitting 
on our side of the table this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow's background is especially intriguing considering that he comes to 
the table having been on both sides of a labor dispute. Before becoming a 
player agent in 1984, Goodenow stared down the Teamsters in a 1983 dispute 
between the union and a fire-fighting equipment manufacturer. Representing 
management, Goodenow kept the union out for 11 months before the Teamsters gave 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me sick to my stomach he's head of a union," retired Teamsters 
official Frank Caputo of Pittsburgh told a reporter in 1992. "There's no doubt 
he's a union buster. He's the most difficult man I've ever dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to the union's side didn't bring praise from management, either, in the 
aftermath of the players' strike in 1992. Chicago owner Bill Wirtz called him 
unprofessional and said he didn't know which way "this rabbit" is going to 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Such rhetoric -- past, present and future -- glances off the feisty redhead 
like a weak slap shot. Goodenow relished verbal battles as a law student at the 
University of Detroit and physical ones when he was a hard-hitting forward with 
a booming slap shot for the U.S. national junior team and as co-captain at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens any time you get into labor issues," Goodenow said. "A lot of 
people don't like labor or a differing uncompromising situation. The level of 
conflict can get quite high. It's not like going before a judge and having the 
issue decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the nature of the business that brings out that level of emotion. Some 
people don't like it. I find labor situations fascinating, issues how it 
relates to a sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor relations can get to the point where emotion turns deadly. In 
Pittsburgh, Goodenow once had to secure a license to carry a handgun when he 
was involved in a tense negotiation. Years later, he downplayed the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dispute that got heated," he said. "It was over 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he still have that license? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That may have been his most dangerous moment as a labor lawyer. This current 
standoff with the NHL, of course, is his most public.  
</P>
<P>
 "At any point in time, you think something is important," Goodenow said. "But 
I haven't slotted it in my mind. At the moment, it's this." 
</P>
<P>
 With this dispute, not only does Goodenow have a responsibility to his 
far-flung membership of about 600 players, but hockey's players union is being 
closely watched by other sports, especially baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, no union leader wants to be known as the next Gene Upshaw, who has 
been widely criticized for football's salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputations are made and broken in labor negotiations. If Bettman is perceived 
to have lost, no one will remember all of his positive accomplishments. 
Likewise with Goodenow, who has been lauded for creating a stronger, more 
informed union. 
</P>
<P>
 He has repaired years of inequity, turning union business into a give-and-take 
operation, rather than one shrouded in secrecy. Players needing a quick answer 
can count on getting one by the end of the day from Goodenow himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has changed, everybody realizes that now," King defenseman Charlie 
Huddy said. "Before the strike (in 1992), everybody used to think the players 
union was just a way to get benefits, not much more. Now we've learned we have 
to stick together, especially when things happen like cutting one man of the 
roster. Because that one person could easily be you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Goodenow: "The players are continually increasing their level of 
knowledge. And that's helpful. Players have to live their life and make 
decisions. The key is to make sure the players are informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, Goodenow has the strong support of key player agents, such 
as Winnipeg-based Don Baizley, who represents Teemu Selanne, Jari Kurri and 
Paul Kariya, among others, and Los Angeles-based Mike Barnett, who has Gretzky, 
Brett Hull, Alexander Mogilny, Jaromir Jagr and Sergei Fedorov among his 
clients. Clearly, the rank and file players are important, but it means little 
without the backing of hockey's stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very thorough and conscientious and can come across as very guarded," 
Barnett said. "But those who know him well know that the guard that appears to 
be up there is a person who is interested in being a listener instead of a 
talker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an old adage of what isn't said in a negotiation versus what is said 
is often the most important thing. That adage is Bob Goodenow personified. 
</P>
<P>
 "But out of the business suit and in jeans going to the hockey rink with his 
own young son, he is just another parent who is very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Baizley believes Goodenow's experience as a player has served him well in his 
term as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob moves amongst his constituency easily, he's comfortable in a locker 
room," Baizley said. "Apart from the economic aspects, he has an attachment to 
the soul of the game. I think it's an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, who has spent a great deal of time with Goodenow in recent weeks, is 
comfortable about the union's leadership and solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the unity isn't underestimated," McSorley said. "If we're put to the 
wall, you always know that the tiger is most dangerous when it is cornered."

 "Our ownership is not interested in any single-entity proposition," APSL 
Commissioner Richard Groff said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL franchises are run by individuals and groups. MLS is a 
"single-entity" structure, meaning the league owns all the franchises and 
player contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL, a seven-team league in Canada and the United States, has been 
operating in some form since the mid-1980s. U.S. soccer authorities regard it 
as a second division league, while MLS is envisioned as a first division 
outfit.

 Charlie Ward, not taken in the NFL draft despite winning the Heisman Trophy 
and a national championship at Florida State, signed a five-year guaranteed 
contract with the New York Knicks, who took him in the first round of the NBA 
draft. 
</P>

 "It's all a business, and if they didn't want me to be here, they wouldn't 
have signed me," Ward said, referring to the fact that the Knicks have three 
other point guards.

DODGERS CUT BACK ON FRONT-OFFICE PERSONNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The canceled baseball season claimed its latest victims Wednesday when the 
Dodgers laid off almost 20 front-office employees, some who had worked for the 
team at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in recent history that the club has had layoffs of such 
magnitude. Those affected were scouts as well as secretaries and switchboard 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never gone through anything like this before," said Fred Claire, 
executive vice president. "It was not easy at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers eliminated 20 full-time and five part-time positions, reducing 
their front-office staff to about 70, still high by industry standards. 
Depending on how many employees opt for an early retirement buyout (age 55), 
the staff might be reduced further next month. With 52 days of the regular 
season canceled, it is estimated the Dodgers lost about $14 million in net 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Graziano, vice president of finance, said the layoffs are permanent and 
the Dodgers have no plans to fill the positions when baseball resumes. The 
organization, however, offered affected employees a severance benefit package 
and the service of a placement firm to help them find employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of the people who were laid off are still eligible for the early 
retirement (buyout)," Graziano said. "Those who were offered that program have 
until Oct. 31 to decide, and if we need to replace their position we would call 
on our people first who were laid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those laid off was Jerry Stephenson, a longtime major league advance 
scout who had been with the Dodgers for 21 years. He was the only employee from 
Claire's department who was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second cost-cutting measure the Dodgers have taken with the 
front-office staff since the Aug. 12 strike. At first, management salaries were 
reduced by 15% and other employees by 10%. Shortly after the strike, the 
Dodgers laid off about 600 part-time ushers, ticket takers, cleanup crews and 
day-of-game stadium operation staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the club rehired third base and infield coach Joe Amalfitano, 
bullpen coach Mark Cresse, bench coach Bill Russell, hitting instructor Reggie 
Smith and Manny Mota. Joe Ferguson's position as eye in the sky was previously 
eliminated.

 John Stiegerwald in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, responding to Dodger pitcher 
Orel Hershiser's comments on the cancellation of the baseball season and the 
World Series as "the death of a friend or somebody in your family": 
</P>
<P>
 "Orel and everybody else associated with Major League Baseball should know 
that the average North American, other than those financially affected by the 
strike, got over the news in less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orel's comments make you think that there's an outside chance that baseball 
players and owners take themselves a little too seriously."

 "I don't think they're learning enough. Some of these No. 1 draft choices 
ought to be further along than they are right now. I blame the guys who are 
coaching them."

 Carried away: Phil Jackman, writing in the Baltimore Evening Sun: "The thing

Miami (ending the Hurricanes' 58-game victory streak in the Orange Bowl) as a 
'monumental upset' is he knows better. 
</P>

 "This was the Huskies, Brent, not Washington University of St. Louis."

 Prospering: Norm Cohen of Newsday reports that the baseball strike is a boon 
to NFL trading cards: 
</P>
<P>
 "NFL properties already reports a 25% increase in trading-card revenue over 
last year's, and the threat of an NHL lockout could pump up sales even higher."

HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE APPROVES BILL ON ANTITRUST EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A House subcommittee on Wednesday took the first step toward repealing 
baseball's antitrust exemption, approving a bill that would remove the 
exemption as it applies to labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's approval by the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law sends 
the bill to the full Judiciary Committee for a vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncertain whether the bill, sponsored by Mike Synar (D-Okla.), can get 
through Congress before it adjourns Oct. 7. Also, the players union, which has 
said it would end its strike if the exemption is repealed, might not honor that 
vow considering that two provisions favoring the union were removed from the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 A provision that would have prevented a salary cap from going into effect 
until all lawsuits stemming from the cap's unilateral implementation were 
resolved was removed at the request of management lawyers. So was a provision 
that would have left it up to the courts to determine whether the union would 
have to decertify before challenging implementation in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Donald Fehr said the amended bill was still a step in the right 
direction, but he wouldn't say whether it was good enough for the union to end 
the strike, if enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this evidences a growing recognition on behalf of the Congress that 
there are significant abnormalities here that need to be corrected or you're 
going to continue to have strikes and lockouts all the time," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the House Subcommittee on Education and Labor will conduct a 
hearing today on a bill by Pat Williams (D-Mont.) that would impose binding 
arbitration if players and owners don't reach a bargaining agreement by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said he remained hopeful of amending an 
appropriations bill for the District of Columbia to include an exemption repeal 
similar to Synar's. ROSS NEWHAN

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; JORDAN HAS BECOME THE NO. 1 TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's still, to some extent, hiding out. Kevin Jordan still isn't drawing extra 
defensive attention, and it's paying off for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA wide receiver has caught 28 passes for 458 yards and three 
touchdowns, best in the Pacific 10 and second nationally in yards per game to 
Nevada Las Vegas' Randy Gatewood. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is accomplishing all that as UCLA's primary receiver in most 
situations, given that All-American J.J. Stokes continues to be out because of 
a thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 He has become quarterback Wayne Cook's main target, catching all three of 
Cook's touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, there is no extra pressure. "Not in the games," Jordan said. "I 
guess they don't know about me yet. But, yes, I feel it before the games." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he said, is understanding his limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can only do what Kevin can do," he said. "I can't do what Kevin and 
J.J. can do. Some guys are going to have to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has had 12 players catch a pass, but only Jordan has gone over 100 yards 
for the season. Stokes is second with 97 yards in seven catches over parts of 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has moved to 10th on the all-time UCLA list with 91 catches, one behind 
Reggie Moore. Jordan's 1,220 yards for his career rank 11th on that list. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 UCLA put in extra time on punt protection Wednesday, with Aaron Anderson 
stepping in at the right end for Aaron Roques. That's the position Washington 
State went through to block a punt Saturday and Nebraska used to deflect one a 
week ago. . . . Sentencing for defensive back Tommy Bennett, who pleaded 
no-contest to felony charges of grand theft and making a false financial 
statement, has been postponed a second time, to Monday. JIM HODGES

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: GOOD TO BAD TO UGLY IN A HURRY

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to Indiana, which is believed to be the first team in the top 25 
rankings ever to trail an opponent, 0-55. The Who?siers eventually rallied to 
lose 13-62 to Wisconsin--but were still reassigned to No. 10 in the Bottom Ten 
doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another big year, meanwhile, for the Loan Star State--so named for the 
numerous scandals involving illegal payments to Texas football players. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, which hasn't scored in weeks, accelerated its quest for a second 
Bottom Ten title while SMU (No. 7) and Texas at El Dropped Paso (No. 8) wait in 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal, the former Bottom Ten leader, ended its season-long losing streak with a 
25-21 victory over Arizona State. In a way, though, Cal's losing tradition was 
preserved. ASU's Bruce Snyder used to be the Bears' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings: 03,24,21,16 School, Record Last Loss Next Loss 1. Houston (0-4)

<P>
 Crummy Game of the Week: Missouri (1-3) vs. West Virginia (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Crummy Intrasquad Game of the Week: Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy losing streaks: Miami (Fla.) at home (1). 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason computers will never replace newspapers: Incensed over a 
reporter's prediction that Virginia Tech would lose to Boston College on Sept. 
17, fullback Brian Edmonds stuffed the newspaper clipping in his helmet for 
inspiration. Tech won, 12-7. THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 Still no word on whether ESPN will lodge broadcaster-tampering charges against 
the NFL over the efforts of Flagstaff Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan to sign 
ex-Giant Phil Simms.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, several treasured streaks were broken. Denver's John Elway had no 
interceptions run back for touchdowns for the first time this season. 
Cincinnati's defense ended its sack-less skein at just three games. And New 
Orleans finally managed a run of more than 20 yards--by its punter. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers of the Buffalo-Denver game could have been excused for thinking they 
were watching Ken Burns' baseball documentary. At one point, ABC's Frank 
Gifford--proving that he is in mid-season form--referred to Buffalo's Thurman 
Thomas as Thurman Munson, the late Yankee catcher.

PAC-10 USING HUSKY TV MONEY TO FIGHT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference has decided to use money generated by the University 
of Washington's televised football games last fall to pay defense attorneys 
fighting a lawsuit by Husky players. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's share of TV money -- about $939,000 -- was withheld for one year 
as part of Pac-10 penalties imposed on the Huskies for violations mostly 
stemming from the school's summer jobs program. Washington also was barred from 
postseason bowls for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the penalties were announced last summer, the conference indicated the TV 
revenues would be set aside but did not specify how the money would be used. 
Washington appeared in six telecasts last fall. Under a Pac-10 formula, member 
teams keep 59% of their appearance revenues, with the rest divided among the 
other nine schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference presidents, with Washington President William Gerberding 
abstaining, voted unanimously in June to use the money to defend the conference 
against a federal-court lawsuit filed by players, conference spokesman Jim 
Muldoon said. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials made it clear they believed the money would be better 
spent on scholarships or for gender-equity expenses such as travel costs for 
women's teams, said Rob Aronson, Washington's faculty representative to the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 has hired Bogle & Gates, a prominent Seattle law firm, to defend 
it. The suit contends the conference penalties unfairly penalize athletes in 
the school's football program and are "anti-competitive, overboard and 
unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled Nov. 7 on the players' bid to have the bowl ban lifted 
this season, the second year of that penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Neubauer, an attorney for the athletes, said he found it ironic the Pac-10 
would use the appropriated TV revenues to fight a player lawsuit that 
challenges the TV penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldoon said any leftover money would be put in an interest-bearing account, 
whose use would be decided later by the Pac-10 presidents.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; THURMAN LOOKING FOR A CARRYOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of Coach John Robinson's assistants were somewhat pleased with Saturday's 
victory over Baylor, but not cornerback coach Dennis Thurman. "We have some 
guys who aren't carrying over into the games what they're doing in practice," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive coordinator Don Lindsey singled out linebackers Jeff Kopp, Brian 
Williams and Eric Herrin, and cornerback Brian Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is hopeful both tailback Leonard Green (hamstring) and wide receiver 
Ed Hervey (knee) will be available against Oregon on Saturday. Green has been 
sidelined since training camp and Hervey since the Washington game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end John Allred sprained his left ankle in practice and is questionable 
Saturday. Guard Phalen Pounds injured his knee Tuesday and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery to remove torn cartilage. He is expected to be out about 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC will announce soon that former All-American wide receiver Johnnie Morton 
will endow a full scholarship for the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, who became USC's all-time career and single-season pass reception 
leader last season, is a rookie with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the 21st player chosen in last spring's NFL draft and signed a 
four-year contract worth $3.15 million including a $1.15-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Before Baylor's Ben Bronson did it on Saturday, the last 
player to return a kickoff for a touchdown against USC was Anthony Prior of 
Washington State in 1991. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; NEBRASKA'S FRAZIER OUT OF 
HOSPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier left a Lincoln hospital Wednesday after 
three days of treatment dissolved a blood clot behind his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Osborne said it will be up to the doctors to determine when Frazier 
can return to workouts.Physical contact is forbidden because he is on 
blood-thinners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a done deal that he'll miss the rest of the season 
necessarily," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Brook Berringer is scheduled to make his first start 
against Wyoming on Saturday. 
</P>

 Since leading the Buffalo Bills to two AFL championships in the 1960s, Lou 
Saban has been around -- and around and around. 
</P>
<P>
 Saban's travels brought him back to familiar turf Wednesday when he was named 
to head the new football program at tiny Alfred (N.Y.) State College, a 
two-year technology school 75 miles southeast of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been known as a peripatetic coach," said Saban, 72. "The first time I 
was called that, I thought it was a dirty word. I looked it up in the 
dictionary and found it meant I moved around a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, he was fired from his most recent job as coach of the new Arena 
Football League team, the Milwaukee Mustangs, after they got off to an 0-4 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've coached at all levels, covered the gamut, and I've never really seen any 
difference," he said. "My coaching techniques are pretty much the same, with 
some adjustments for what younger players can and can't do."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; FLORIDA LEADS AFTER FIRST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And now, a quarterly report on the national championship race: 
</P>
<P>
 FLORIDA 
</P>
<P>
 --Our preseason ranking: No. 5; Current Associated Press ranking: No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Despite Coach Steve Spurrier's ability to insult vast regions 
of the country with his comments about fellow coaches and programs, Florida has 
positioned itself nicely for a championship run. The Gators play five of their 
next six games at home. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: If they don't lose to Auburn on Oct. 15, they will lose Nov. 
26 at Florida State. Both of those games will be more difficult than facing 
Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Dec. 3 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 2; Now: No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Uh . . . Wyoming this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: Quarterback Tommie Frazier, who is suffering from a blood clot 
in his right calf, might be sidelined for the season. So might Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said Frazier was one of the few players in the 
country who could make a difference in a game. He wasn't kidding. Without 
Frazier, the Cornhuskers now turn to Brook Berringer, who is making his first 
start Saturday. How will Berringer run Nebraska's option offense? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not Tommie Frazier in that respect," said Ron Brown, Nebraska assistant 
coach.  
</P>
<P>
 FLORIDA STATE 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 6; Now: No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Foot Locker jokes are down to triple digits. Plus, the 
Seminoles have four games remaining against ranked opponents (Miami, Notre 
Dame, North Carolina State and Florida). Win those and nobody can say Florida 
State doesn't deserve a No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: Games against four ranked opponents, two on the road and one 
in Orlando against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 PENN STATE 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 17; Now: No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Coach Joe Paterno said he wanted a Big Ten Conference title 
before he retired. He'll get it with time to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: With the exception of an Oct. 15 trip to Ann Arbor, Mich., 
none that we can think of. 
</P>
<P>
 COLORADO 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 13; Now: No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Coach Bill McCartney is a big believer in divine 
intervention. Did someone say "Hail Mary?" 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: God can't do anything about the Oct. 29 trip to Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 3; Now: No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Ask Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom about the Wildcats. 
He can tell you everything you need to know, and he has the bruises to prove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: Arizona's better-than-expected offense still has to face such 
defensive bad boys as Colorado State and Washington State on successive 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHIGAN 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 14; Now: No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: The Wolverines still can win the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: It won't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTRE DAME 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 4; Now: No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: A favorable schedule, lots of TV exposure and Game of the 
Century, Part II, the rematch against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: Despite the best recruiting machine in the country, the Irish 
don't have a dependable kicker. A close game and they're doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 AUBURN 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 1; Now: No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: Only two legitimately tough games remaining: one against 
Florida, one against hated Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: Both are on the road. And even if the Tigers go undefeated, 
NCAA probation prohibits them from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS A&M 
</P>
<P>
 --Then: No. 25; Now: No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Good News: The Aggies play in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Bad News: See Auburn probation. IS THERE A HEISMAN CANDIDATE IN THE 
HOUSE? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to say the Heisman list is thinning, but at last look the leading 
contenders were Florida quarterback Terry Dean, Washington tailback Napoleon 
Kaufman, Penn State halfback Ki-Jana Carter and two newcomers, Tennessee's 
Smokey the Blue Tick Hound and the Michigan fan who hurled a packet of 
batteries at Colorado players last Saturday (What an arm!). 
</P>
<P>
 Heisman hopefuls are dropping faster than Stanford in the polls. First Florida 
State's Derrick Brooks gets suspended for two games. Then Michigan's Tyrone 
Wheatley goes down with a separated shoulder. Then UCLA's J.J. Stokes hurts his 
leg. Then Notre Dame's Lee Becton stumbles, bumbles and fumbles before pulling 
a groin muscle. Then Nebraska's Frazier suffers perhaps a season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover in candidates has given hope to lesser-known players such as 
Alcorn State's Steve McNair, Michigan's Todd Collins and now Colorado's Kordell 
Stewart. And according to Temple Coach Ron Dickerson, it also has helped 
elevate the status of Penn State's Carter from preseason nominee to 
third-of-a-season favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I say that selfishly, because I recruited Ki-Jana," said Dickerson, a 
former Penn State assistant who helped persuade Carter to sign with the Nittany 
Lions. "I say that because I know him. I know him personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's all you really need to know about Carter: 540 yards, nine touchdowns, 
an 8.6 yards-per-carry average and he faces undermanned Temple on Saturday at 
Franklin Field in Philadelphia. If all goes as expected, Carter should be 
enjoying himself on the bench by halftime, the owner of another 100-plus-yard 
game and a touchdown or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it hurt Carter's chances that Penn State has become the team to beat 
in the Big Ten, that it is on TV more than Ken Burns' "Baseball"--and isn't 
half as boring--that it plays in the vote-rich East, that it has Paterno to put 
in a good word, or that the Nittany Lions have as good a chance as anyone of 
winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told (our players) last night in the meeting, this is probably the best 
team in the country," Dickerson said. "I don't think our kids are going to be 
scared of them, intimidated of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it's only Thursday. SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH ROSE BOWL GLASSES 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the difference between Michigan Coach Gary Moeller and Colorado's 
McCartney or Penn State's Paterno: 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss to the Buffaloes, Moeller insisted that the most important part 
of the Wolverines' schedule was still to come. Translation: the Big Ten title 
is bigger than the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the players repeat the silly Moeller mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our goal to win the Big Ten championship," said Michigan linebacker 
Steve Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Big whoop. Several seasons ago, when Penn State joined the Big Ten, Paterno 
said he found the conference's provincialism a bit puzzling. After all, what's 
better, a trip to Pasadena or a trip to the White House and a congratulatory 
handshake and photo op with Bubba? 
</P>
<P>
 Even McCartney, who spent considerable time in the Big Ten as a Michigan 
assistant under Bo Schembechler, has seen the light of looking past conference 
boundaries. McCartney has one championship and he wants another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play the great teams in the country," said McCartney, whose 
long-term contract allows him to take chances with his scheduling. That 
explains the nonconference games against Wisconsin, Michigan and Texas--all 
ranked opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Michigan scheduled Boston College, Notre Dame and Colorado. To 
Moeller, the games never existed. MONEY TALKS, KANSAS SQUAWKS 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas Coach Glen Mason remembers his first season at Lawrence, when the 
Jayhawks finished 1-10 and routinely lost by scores such as 56-7, 52-21, 63-10, 
63-14, 63-24 and 55-17. So overwhelmed was his team that Mason occasionally 
took his coaching staff to dinner after the routs--to thank them for a job well 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the best coaching we did was that year," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder then that Mason had a soft spot for Alabama Birmingham, which 
traveled to Kansas last Saturday and was promptly thumped, 72-0. The Blazers, a 
Division I-AA team making its first appearance against a Division I-A program, 
never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought that UAB was an extremely well-coached football team," Mason 
said. "I know because I've been in that position many, many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham has Division I-A aspirations, but that still doesn't 
explain how such an awful team found its way onto Kansas' schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The short version, which also includes a business lesson: 
</P>
<P>
 When the rule was passed several seasons ago requiring teams to win at least 
six Division I-A games for bowl eligibility, programs began bidding against 
each other for nonconference opponents with Division I-A status. Schools such 
as Pacific, New Mexico State and the late, not-so-great Cal State Fullerton 
were in constant demand because they were weak opponents and available for the 
right price. 
</P>
<P>
 No dummies, the lower-tier Division I-A teams began demanding bigger 
guarantees. Football supply and demand kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've driven the price tag up," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mason, that's why Kansas was stuck with the likes of Alabama 
Birmingham, a team that should have never seen the light of Memorial Stadium. 
Worse yet, Kansas fans had to buy tickets for this mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I have liked to have played a Division I-A opponent rather than a 
Division I-AA? Yes," he said. "But we're not going to pay someone $460,000 to 
come in here and play." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how much Tulsa wanted, but Kansas couldn't afford it. So, the Jayhawks 
ended up with the Blazers and a meaningless rout. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Colorado's Stewart is taking this warm and fuzzy feeling a little too 
far. Said Stewart of the Miracle at Michigan: "I wanted to marry (receiver) 
Michael Westbrook." Fine, said Colorado's McCartney. "We might have to tie the 
knot here this afternoon, come to think of it," he said. . . . It was so hot 
and humid at the Orange Bowl last Saturday that at least three dehydrated 
Washington players required treatment on the trip home to Seattle. Still, 
during the fourth quarter of Washington's 38-20 upset victory over Miami, it 
was the Hurricane players who were seen kneeling uncharacteristically on the 
turf, gasping for air. Washington's players stood nearby, watching in 
amazement. Soon thereafter, the Hurricanes' NCAA-record 58-game home winning 
streak came to an end. Said Miami receiver Chris T. Jones: "I'm ashamed. I'll 
have to look the former 'Canes and coaches in the eye and know that my class is 
known as the class that lost the streak. I'll have to live with that." Top 10

BIG WHEEL; '84 GOLD MEDALIST CARPENTER-PHINNEY RIDES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Connie Carpenter-Phinney was pedaling on the parkways of Mission Viejo with 
the lead pack, jockeying for position with five others and dealing with the 
false breaks that are the obligatory mind games of world-class road races. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Phinney sat in a courtesy van with rest of the U.S. men's cycling team, 
trying to decipher the flickering figure of his wife on a four-inch, 
black-and-white portable television. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the van got to the course, we suddenly realized what an unbelievable 
spectacle this was going to be," Phinney said. "We looked up the road and it 
was just packed with people as far as you could see. And when they saw the 
U.S.A. van, they just went berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200,000 people were lining the 9.85-mile course that bright, hot 
morning in July, 1984, to watch the historic first Olympic road race for women. 
And the roar at the intersection of what is now Olympiad and Marguerite Parkway 
was deafening as the leaders came into view. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter-Phinney was trying to locate France's Jeannie Longo when the sprint 
began about 1,000 meters from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo, who had finished second to Carpenter-Phinney in two recent races, had 
fallen back because of an equipment problem and Carpenter-Phinney was caught 
looking over her shoulder when the others began their final surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the competitor's area, most of the men's team was preparing to race. 
But Phinney was still in the van, screaming at his little television. 
</P>
<P>
 Senses heightened, it seemed to be happening in slow motion for 
Carpenter-Phinney as she surged through the group. As she hurtled toward the 
finish alongside fellow American Rebecca Twigg, she concentrated on everything 
Phinney had taught her about "throwing" the bike at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 She straightened her arms and thrust the cycle ahead at the precise 
freeze-frame moment in time.  
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't call it right away and you sure couldn't tell who won by the 
grainy little TV I was looking at," Phinney said, "so I ran out there and 
everyone was mobbing Connie and Rebecca. I caught Connie's eye and she mouthed, 
'I think I won.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After 49.9 miles of racing, Carpenter-Phinney had become the first women to 
win a gold medal in Olympic cycling . . . by six inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave her a kiss and then tried to get totally focused on my event," Phinney 
said. CHAMPAGNE OR BEER (TO CRY IN)? 
</P>
<P>
 Many were predicting that July 29 would forever be a golden anniversary for 
these newlyweds of 10 months. But a gilded morning would soon be tarnished by 
Phinney's disappointing finish in the men's 118.2-mile event that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The midday heat was oppressive and Phinney wasn't hungry early in the race. 
And by the time he realized his energy was waning on the last few laps, his 
team crew was only handing out fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go by and scream, 'I need food!' but they couldn't hear me because of the 
crowd," Phinney said. "At one point, I asked (teammate) Alexi (Grewal) if he 
had anything to eat because I could see the lumps in his jersey. He said, 'No,' 
but that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Grewal won the gold. Phinney finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very bittersweet day," Carpenter-Phinney says. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple returned to the home of a San Juan Capistrano family they had been 
staying with during the Games. A celebration already was under way, but Phinney 
wasn't up to partying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both our families were there and everybody was so happy for Connie," he said. 
"But I was so tired, so crushed, so mentally devastated. You put it in the 
perspective that your whole career, that everything you have done, is for this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been absolutely obsessed with winning that race for two years and so 
for me, not winning was complete failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter-Phinney, who credits her husband with inspiring in her the drive and 
concentration of effort needed to win the Olympic gold medal, says she was 
"only disappointed for him, never disappointed in him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was happy for me," she said. "I never doubted that." 
</P>
<P>
 Six days later, Phinney won a bronze medal in the 100-kilometer time-trial 
team event, an accomplishment he still refers to as "insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Carpenter-Phinney said, "it's taken him 10 years to get to this 
point where he can talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Phinney eventually was able to mold the pain of 1984 into a driving force to 
keep his cycle career churning. He became a two-time stage winner in the Tour 
de France, the U.S. professional champion in 1991 and when he retired last 
year, he had won 300 races, including four national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fueled my desire to press on and put that day behind me," he said, "but 
Connie had followed through on her destiny. She had come back to cycling for 
that race and after she won, she got off the bike and didn't ride again for a 
year." BACK IN THE SADDLE 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Carpenter-Phinney will make her first visit to the site of her 
Olympic conquest since the day she won the gold. The path of the Orange County 
Multiple Sclerosis 150 Bike Tour, two-day event that begins at 8 a.m. Saturday 
at Anaheim Stadium and has an overnight stop in San Clemente's San Mateo 
Campground, passes through Mission Viejo en route to Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to go back to that start-finish area and kiss the pavement," she 
says, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she rides for fun -- and charity -- putting in an hour or two three times 
a week and setting fitness goals for herself before the couple's annual summer 
cycling camps near Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she's never far away from cycles or cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had asked me 10 years ago if I'd still be involved in this business, 
I'm sure I would have said no," she said. "But we've been very lucky. The 
industry has been really good to us. Davis is part owner of a bike shop; he has 
been doing some television commentary and lots of speaking engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I stay busy with the kids and the camps. The people involved in the sport 
are great, it's a great way to make a living and we're pretty much into fitness 
as a lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously. At 37, after two children, she still looks as if she could strap on 
her helmet and pedal with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe she could. Whoever said, "it don't come easy," don't know Connie 
Carpenter-Phinney: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 14, with little formal training, she made the 1972 Olympic speed-skating 
team and competed in Sapporo, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After an ankle injury ended her skating career, she started cycling, and in 
the first year of racing won two national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While attending Cal to get her bachelor of science degree in Physical 
Education, she joined the women's crew and her fours boat won the 1980 national 
collegiate rowing championship. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was pulling on oars, however, she had just about retired from 
competitive cycling. She had won a silver medal in the 1979 World 
Championships, but was receiving criticism in the cycling press. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were already hinting that I had reached my peak and was over the hill," 
she said. "And I started thinking that it just wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 But then she started dating Phinney, who wasn't the best cyclist around but 
probably the most obsessed, and then came the announcement that women's cycling 
would be included in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Connie clearly hadn't reached her potential," Phinney said, "because she 
didn't have the kind of singular focus, or direction, or advice, or just 
someone to help her build confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we made a decision and set off on this course." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a trail that led to the 1984 Olympics and a morning of glory in the 
Mission Viejo sun.

DUCKS SEND LEADING SCORER TO TORONTO; HOCKEY: RIGHT WING TERRY YAKE IS TRADED 
FOR DAVID SACCO AS TEAM CONTINUES TO RID ITSELF OF ORIGINAL STARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' original team is fast disappearing, and the club continued 
its overhaul Wednesday by trading right wing Terry Yake -- who led the team in 
scoring during its first season and still has the Ducks' only hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira is putting his confidence in the batch of 
rookies who pushed Yake down the depth chart during the preseason. He sent 
Yake, 25, who had 21 goals and 31 assists last season, to the Toronto Maple 
Leafs for center David Sacco, 24, a 1994 U.S. Olympian with little NHL 
experience who is the younger brother of Duck right wing Joe Sacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said Sacco, a playmaking center, gives the organization much-needed 
depth at the position and assigned him to minor league affiliate San Diego, 
saying whether he plays in Anaheim this season depends on his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks haven't been sentimental with personnel decisions in their first 
year and have traded their first All-Star (Alexei Kasatonov), first captain 
(Troy Loney), first game-winning goalie (Ron Tugnutt) and first goal-scorer 
(Sean Hill), along with Yake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the reality of the league that everybody gets better. You can't 
stand still," Ferreira said. "With first-year teams, you can get to a level 
really quick and then kind of hit a plateau. That's where you have to either 
get better players or be patient. You try to prepare for not taking a dip 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake, who turns 26 next month, has back-to-back 20-goal seasons after scoring 
22 with Hartford two seasons ago. He fell behind rookies Valeri Karpov and John 
Lilley at right wing during a poor training camp that he characterized as his 
typical slow start. But the Ducks' confidence in him was shaken by a poor 
finish last season in which he scored only one goal after Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry has a history of being inconsistent," Coach Ron Wilson said. "We've got 
roles for certain people, and the role he was falling into, he wouldn't be able 
to play. If he's on the third or fourth line, would he be able to check? 
</P>
<P>
 "Onward and upward. That's the whole thing. You've got to make sure you 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake -- who scored the first hat trick of his career Oct. 19 against the New 
York Rangers in Madison Square Garden -- said he was happy in Anaheim and 
didn't realize until the last couple of days that his poor preseason might 
contribute to a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did think I was in a good situation, and I considered buying a house over 
the summer," he said. "Then I slapped myself upside the head and said, 'You 
could get traded.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To say you're safe is never possible. If Wayne Gretzky can get traded, 
anybody can get traded. Being the leading scorer doesn't make you safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ferreira said he thinks Yake could have a better year playing in Toronto 
if he's on a line with Doug Gilmour, Mats Sundin or Mike Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect a better year this year myself," Yake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco said he talked to his brother the day before the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was hoping to get traded. We didn't talk about where," he said. 
"We're losing a good guy in Terry, a very good player. But I'm happy for my 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said David Sacco, who had three goals and five assists in eight games 
in the Olympics, lacks his brother's speed but is more of a finesse player and 
can play the point on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is more the explosive winger, David's more the center iceman with good 
hands, clever with the puck," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco's scouting report was similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, and I think he's a pretty good guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, the team's representative to the players' association, said 
forward Stu Grimson and defensemen Tom Kurvers and Robert Dirk will travel with 
him to Toronto on Saturday for an NHLPA meeting, unless a lockout is averted 
and they are playing at Dallas.

MCNALL TURNS OVER CONTROL OF ASSETS TO TRUSTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dispute over who will control King President Bruce McNall's assets -- 
including his remaining 28% interest in the hockey team -- has been resolved, 
with McNall agreeing to turn over clear control to a court-appointed bankruptcy 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dispute largely involved technical legal issues in McNall's 
personal bankruptcy case, the agreement is important in that it gives trustee 
R. Todd Neilson clear authority to sell McNall's interest in the Kings at some 
point.  
</P>
<P>
 No sale is planned, and Neilson has agreed to abide by NHL rules requiring 
league approval if he chooses to sell the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also specifically states that Neilson is not waiving his right 
to potentially challenge McNall's sale of 72% of the Kings in May to 
telecommunications executives Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and Joseph M. Cohen. Sources, 
however, indicate that such a challenge is unlikely and that Neilson is simply 
preserving his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Control over McNall's assets had been clouded by the formation of a so-called 
"creditors trust" set up by his lawyers in May to pay creditors with proceeds 
generated by his assets. The trust was a complicated vehicle that contained 
liens and claims formerly held by Bank of America, which as McNall's chief bank 
once held claims and liens on virtually all of his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust, which will be dissolved, was established just before the 
financially ailing sports executive entered personal bankruptcy proceedings on 
May 27, but after three of his creditors filed papers to force him into 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Neilson and his associates objected to the trust as improper, arguing that it 
allowed McNall to effectively continue to control his assets rather than place 
them under the authority of an independent trustee as called for in bankruptcy 
cases. Marcy Tiffany, head of the U.S. Trustee's Office in the Los Angeles 
area, also objected and took a hard line on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, details of the settlement, which needs bankruptcy court approval, 
were worked out during the past few days by Neilson and his associates along 
with lawyers at Levene and Eisenberg, which is handing McNall's bankruptcy 
case. Both McNall lawyer Richard Wynne and trustee lawyer Leonard Gumport on 
Wednesday hailed the agreement, saying they hope both sides will cooperate in 
reorganizing McNall's finances and paying his creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, McNall said that spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
legal fees fighting over the issue "would not be in the best interest of my 
creditors or the bankruptcy estate." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, who became sole owner of the Kings in 1988, sold a majority of the 
team to Sudikoff and Cohen for $60 million largely to rid himself of debts owed 
Bank of America. As previously reported, McNall has agreed to plead guilty to 
four criminal counts stemming from a federal investigation into McNall's 
banking practices and the falsification of certain loan documents.

KINGS LOSE BUT UNLEASH CRITICISM OF BETTMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was solidarity before the exhibition game, a few scraps during it and a 
sense of futility by the end Wednesday night as the San Jose Sharks defeated 
the Kings, 8-4, at the Forum in what might have been the final hockey game for 
quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, almost all ire seems to be directed at NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman -- 
from the outspoken Wayne Gretzky as well as other players around the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have as much to lose as anybody," Gretzky said Tuesday after an exhibition 
in San Antonio. He did not think Bettman would back down from his decision to 
lock out the players, largely blaming him for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be showing a weakness if he did that. . . . I just hope three months 
from now, everybody is not regretting this. I'm afraid that's not going to be 
the case." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a lockout, Gretzky was asked what he would be doing on Saturday, 
the day of the Kings' scheduled season opener at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gretzky, it was as outspoken as he gets. But that was nothing compared to 
the harsh words from Chicago defenseman Chris Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was Gary Bettman, I'd be worried about my family, about my well-being 
right now," Chelios said in Chicago after practice. "Some crazed fan or even a 
player, who knows, might well take it into his own hands and figure if they get 
him out of the way, this might be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd hate to see something like that happen, but he took the job. The main 
thing is, he doesn't know anything about hockey. That's obvious. He doesn't 
recognize players like Jeremy Roenick and Brendan Shanahan at the meetings. 
Maybe it's the little-man syndrome. . . . He's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments were telecast and picked up in Los Angeles, shocking King coaches 
and others connected with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 It was pointed out that Chelios would probably be getting a phone call from 
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably already has," said a source close to the players union. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Kings finished the exhibition season 4-4-1, losing their last 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The paid attendance was 10,872 at the Forum. General Manager Sam McMaster said 
the team has one plan to travel to San Jose on Friday, another not to make the 
trip and a third option for him to go to Phoenix to watch the Kings' minor 
league team open the season. He also said he will continue to negotiate with 
the agents of rookie forward Matt Johnson and rookie goaltender Jamie Storr.

ALL COUNTY DISTRICTS OK SEPARATE SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 All Orange County school districts are now in favor of forming a county 
athletic section, Dave Andrews, superintendent of the Tustin Unified School 
District, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a meeting of Southern Section officials and the Orange County 
Section steering committee, Andrews said superintendents from the Fullerton 
Union High School District and the Anaheim Union District have agreed to join 
the section.The other 13 districts already have agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Grennan, Anaheim superintendent, and Ken Jones, Fullerton 
superintendent, have said they would wait to make a decision until the State 
Strategic Planning committee finished its report. That report has not been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Grennan nor Jones could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section executive committee and the steering committee agreed on 
an information packet that will be sent to all Southern Section schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The packet contained a joint statement on the formation of an Orange County 
Section and its impact. Principals from Southern Section schools will vote on 
the formation of the new section at their council meeting on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the final adoption would occur at the State Federated Council 
meeting Oct. 28, with a start-up date of July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions still remain about the financial feasibility of a county section. 
Orange County officials said dues would be kept to the current section level of 
23 cents per student. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Section, similar in size to the proposed new section, charges 80 
cents per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the districts would cover any losses for the first year to keep 
the dues the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The new section would likely have 62 schools, not including the county's 14 
small private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Diocese will meet Friday with officials from Mater Dei, 
Santa Margarita and Servite to discuss the new section.

ZAVALA TRIES TO START OVER TONIGHT IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosemead's Rudy Zavala, the No. 1-ranked junior featherweight in the world two 
years ago, is featured in tonight's main event at the Irvine Marriott against 
journeyman John Roby of Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being ranked No. 1 by the International Boxing Federation and World 
Boxing Council, Zavala (22-4-2) has lost four of his last nine fights and 
fallen out of the top 10. Still only 25, Zavala is trying to work his way back 
up the rankings and into the featherweight title picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to get back to knocking people out," said Herb Stone, who has been 
Zavala's manager since he turned pro four years ago. "When he was hot property, 
he was knocking people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Zavala suffered one-sided losses to San Diego's Jesus Salud 
(eighth-round stoppage on cuts) and then-IBF champion Kennedy McKinney 
(third-round knockout), he hasn't been the same fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone is hoping a change of trainers, from Zavala's father to Freddie Roach, 
will help resurrect the fighter's once-promising career. So far, Roach hasn't 
been much help. Zavala has lost two of his three fights with Roach in his 
corner, though Stone contends Zavala was robbed of both decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy has the capability of going back all the way," Stone said. "We're hoping 
to get an opportunity to fight for a world title. Rudy wants that more than 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala, who fought many of his early fights at Irvine, hasn't fought at the 
Marriott since February, 1993, when he knocked out Hector Diaz in the third 
round. Roby (14-10), who last fought Jeff Mayweather for the WBC 
intercontinental lightweight title, will drop a few pounds and fight Zavala at 
128. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior featherweight Oscar Saenza (5-1) of Los Angeles is featured on the 
five-bout undercard against Frances Vivish (11-3) of San Gabriel in a 
five-rounder. Tickets priced at $25, $30 and $35 go on sale at 9 a.m. today at 
the Marriott Ballroom. The fights start at 7:30 p.m..

BACK TROUBLES FORCE UTAH'S EATON TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Eaton, the 7-foot-4 center of the Utah Jazz who has been struggling with 
a degenerative back ailment, retired Wednesday, ending an 11-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, 37, attributed the move to "lingering physical injuries." His career 
had in effect ended a year ago when pain from deteriorating discs forced him to 
drop out of training camp and miss the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, who played at Westminster High, Cypress College and UCLA, had vowed to 
return, but decided to retire after therapy failed to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing when you look back at it," said Eaton. "It was a lot of fun, and 
I certainly didn't think it would turn out this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Knee surgery and back problems had limited him to 17 minutes a game in 
1992-93, his last playing season, well below the 25-minute average of the 
season before. Eaton's shot-blocking average dipped to 1.23 from 2.53 the year 
before, and his 2.8 points per outing was the lowest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jazz, who drafted him in the fourth round in 1982, never expected him 
to be their leading scorer. Eaton, whose scoring average never topped single 
digits, instead made his living clogging passing lanes and terrorizing 
shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times he won the NBA's shot-blocking title, adding defensive player of 
the year honors in 1985 and 1989, the same year he was in his only All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to have played last year and maybe this year, but I think 
a couple more years would have been it," Eaton said. "I accomplished much more 
than I ever dreamed possible, but the time had come for me to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 An awkward teen-ager struggling with a rapidly growing body, Eaton played 
sparingly as a senior at Westminster. He was working at a tire store when 
Cypress College assistant Tom Lubin spotted him and talked him into playing 
basketball at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton enrolled in 1978 -- three years after playing in high school -- and 
helped the Chargers win the State community college championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted a scholarship to UCLA, but spent most of his time on the bench, 
playing only 41 minutes during his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, who owns homes in Laguna Niguel and Park City, Utah, will focus on 
programs for troubled youths and a restaurant. He will try broadcasting college 
basketball games next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged many of his greatest memories will be of the Jazz, though he 
never got to play in an NBA title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to take a team that was in dire straits and not very popular and 
make them a contender," he said. "Sure, the (championship) ring would be great 
. . . but I know that when I stepped out on the court, every game I gave it 
110%. That's enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz owner Larry Miller said Eaton's role in building the club from a loser to 
a playoff participant had been critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and John (Stockton) and Karl (Malone) have been such major parts of what's 
built this franchise into what it is," Miller said. "It's like parting with a 
friend."

STIPEND ASKED FOR COACHES OF BOYS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and players representing the boys' volleyball teams at Buena and 
Ventura highs are asking the Ventura Unified School District to begin paying 
stipends to the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district remunerates all coaches at both schools except for walk-on 
assistants in various sports. However, since the boys' volleyball teams were 
formed in 1989, the district, citing funding shortages, has placed the burden 
of paying the coaches on the parents of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and players have raised approximately $5,000 each season for the 
varsity and junior varsity coaches through a variety of fund-raisers. But at 
Tuesday's school board meeting, volleyball supporters asked the district to 
assume payment, pointing out that all other Ventura County volleyball coaches 
are paid by their respective districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters also suggested that the school board might be violating Title IX, 
the federal law guaranteeing equal access in athletics for males and females.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the law was passed to promote girls' and women's sports. The 
district pays stipends to its girls' volleyball coaches. "We brought up the 
Title IX issue to illustrate the issue of fairness," said Christine Coil, a 
Buena parent and president of the booster club. "Hopefully it made the 
situation clearer to the board members." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Coach Bob Ferguson had to fund his own program for four years, beginning 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helped when we won two section championships," Ferguson said. "It 
was hard for them not to fund a team that was doing well. Our success helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Berk, who established a program at Chatsworth in 1974, became Buena's 
coach last year. "It can get real draining during the season when I have to ask 
them every week to do something to raise money," Berk said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura girls' Coach Mike Russell coached the boys' team two years ago and 
experienced the same problems as did Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the boys' team after one season, partially because of the awkwardness 
of having to raise funds for his stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they either have the money or redistribute the pot to get their 
share," Russell said. "I'm sure if the board looks at the situation and how the 
boys are established, this will be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will study the proposal in a budget meeting on Oct. 12 and 
may decide the issue by the next board meeting on Oct. 25, said Jerry 
Dannanberg, the assistant superintendent for human resources. If approved, 
coaches would receive payment when the boys' season starts in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raisers are used by all sports teams with the money earmarked for 
improvement to the program such as uniforms, equipment and tournament fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of Buena's fund-raising is focused on paying coaches, the boys' 
team currently uses equipment from the girls' team bought new each fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a question if they should afford to pay the coaches," 
Buena senior Zach Coil said. "I think the school board simply should pay for 
our coaches to make everything equal."

MONTCLAIR PREP HIRES FORMER MAJOR LEAGUER PARIS AS BASEBALL COACH; HIGH 
SCHOOLS: TAFT GRADUATE INHERITS TEAM THAT FINISHED 18-9. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Paris, a former major league player, has been hired as the Montclair 
Prep baseball coach, Principal Vernon Simpson announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, a 1975 graduate of Taft High, played professionally for 16 years, 
including five seasons in the majors with the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati 
Reds, Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of people apply -- and many who graduated from Montclair Prep -- 
but I needed to get somebody with some maturity. That was the main thing that 
tipped it for us with Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, 36, replaces Walt Steele, who resigned to pursue a master's degree, and 
will inherit a team that finished 18-9 last season and returns all but two 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele, who will remain head of the math department at Montclair Prep, will 
serve as a consultant to Paris, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Paris' first assignment as a head coach, although he was an assistant 
for a high school team in North Carolina and a couple of local American Legion 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I've got a strong group of kids," said Paris, who will meet with 
his team for the first time today.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen one of them throw a baseball or seen one of them swing a bat. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "(But), I'm of the theory, if it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the returnees is outfielder Darrell Dent, who last season hit .390 with 
34 runs batted in and is considered one of the top prospects in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to several baseball camps that he runs in the summer, Paris also 
administers private individual and group lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, an infielder, was a second-round draft pick by the Cardinals in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, he was a member of the Cardinals' team that won the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is spent, but I still have the ring," Paris said.

FISHER RIDING A GROUNDSWELL OF INDIFFERENCE; SURF RACING: MATH 
TEACHER-LIFEGUARD EXTOLS HER SPORT AS SHE COMPETES IN VIRTUAL ANONYMITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Catch the wave, says Dierdre Fisher. Take a plunge into the frothy Pacific and 
compete in the string of ocean sports that make up surf racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch Fisher on ESPN2 next month, swimming, running and riding a paddleboard 
and surf ski. One race even simulates a rescue like ones she has made as a 
Ventura lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people should get involved in this sport," says Fisher, the nation's top 
water woman. "So many people, if they gave it a try, would be totally stoked on 
surf racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although in Australia races are lucrative and draw more than 100,000 
spectators, surf racing is not widely known in the United States. Spawned 30 
years ago by lifeguards to promote camaraderie and fitness in their profession, 
the sport is treading water in America -- especially among women. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago at Waikiki Beach 35 men and only five women entered one of surf 
racing's most prestigious U.S. events, the King's Race.  
</P>
<P>
 Fisher finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of appeal for surf racing but there needs to be greater 
organization in two areas: putting together events and standardizing the 
races," says Barrett Tester, a Malibu lifeguard and former surf racer who 
publishes a newsletter on ocean sports called Masterstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two events draw large numbers of competitors and spectators: The U.S. 
Lifesaving Assn. Nationals and the Bud Light Ocean Festival Series. Fisher has 
excelled in both. 
</P>
<P>
 She took three first places at the USLA Nationals in August, winning the 
rescue and paddleboard races and the most prestigious event -- international 
iron woman. She finished second in American iron woman, surf ski and surf swim 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, 30, also won this year's Bud Light series women's championship, staged 
on five summer weekends at Southern California beaches before a total of 75,000 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dierdre is definitely the top woman in the nation," says Sherri Hudson, a 
spokesman for the Bud Light series. "Until this year Patti Mackle was the best, 
but she took time off to have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dierdre won this year's series hands down." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning is great, but Fisher would prefer more competition. She has become an 
ambassador of surf racing, extolling the sport's wet and wild virtues to anyone 
who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to promote women in surf racing," she says. "It's so fun, you'd 
think it would be more popular." 
</P>
<P>
 But surf racing -- especially events such as iron woman that combine races -- 
is more than just a day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the international iron woman event, competitors were required to run one 
mile on the beach, swim in the surf 400 meters and race both a paddleboard and 
surf ski for 10 minutes each. All in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being grueling, training is often lonely. "I have somebody to train 
with maybe once a week," says Fisher, a junior high math teacher in Ojai who 
spends summers as a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 As much for friendship as for exercise, Fisher also works out with the Ventura 
College master's swim team. She was an All-Southern Section swimmer at 
University High in Irvine and occasionally enters master's meets for swimmers 
25 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pool, however, Fisher feels like a fish out of salt water. The ocean 
demands the skills she has honed as a lifeguard, and, in fact, surf racing is 
designed to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddleboards have long been essential to lifeguards, who can make rescues by 
flopping victims onto the 12-foot board and paddling to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rescue race involves swimming 200 meters with a rescue can -- a 
two-foot long flotation device -- to a person posing as a victim. The victim, 
who cannot swim and must hold the can with both hands, is carried to shore by 
the racer. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf skis, on the other hand, are sleek, 18-foot ocean kayaks modified for 
racing in waves. Made of fiberglass, they are as light as 40 pounds and have a 
convex hull, allowing the paddler to sit high. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddleboards are also being modified for racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be, you'd grab your board from the lifeguard station and race," 
Tester says. "Now, there are elite boards built for competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher envisions the sport becoming as big as it is in Australia, where 
$800,000 in prize money is offered for the professional series and races draw 
up to 100,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People, even whole families, join surf clubs in Australia and New Zealand," 
she says. "It's like our baseball and softball." 
</P>
<P>
 Tester wants to use the Australian surf-racing circuit as a blueprint for U.S. 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to put together events with Australia," he says. "A lot of people all 
over the Pacific Rim are into the sport. It's a matter of bringing communities 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great atmosphere to be on the beach racing together with friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The last event of the season, the Solano Beach Surf Festival, will be held 
Saturday. Fisher will race to win, but above all she wants to see new faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do like to compete, but I like making friends with other racers even more," 
she says. "If I win, great, but if they win, I am happy for them."

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN SPLASHES INTO TOP 20 IN WATER 
POLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Chapman water polo Coach Rod Hormell doesn't hold back. He's the first to say 
the Panthers had "a miserable season" in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a few practices in 1994, Hormell had no reason to believe this team 
would be much better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this was going to be another one of those years," Hormell said. 
</P>
<P>
 His assessment has changed. Last weekend, the Panthers beat UC Davis, then 
ranked 16th in the nation, 16-15, in the semifinals of the Pomona-Pitzer 
tournament. It was Chapman's first victory over a nationally ranked team and 
although the Panthers lost to Claremont-Mudd, 10-8, in the tournament final, 
they cracked the national rankings this week for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, ranked 19th, is an NCAA Division III program, but water polo rankings 
don't take divisions into account. Stanford is the top-ranked team in the same 
poll. Claremont is No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hormell says Chapman still has problems. For instance, because of injuries 
and other commitments, only five of the 13 players on the team were able to 
make practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'This is the 19th-ranked team in the country, are you kidding me?' " 
Hormell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and a lack of stamina also contributed to the Panthers' loss to 
Claremont Sunday. Chapman led much of the game, until the Stags took control in 
the fourth quarter. Tim Sylvester, a freshman from Los Alamitos and one of the 
Panthers' strongest players, injured his shoulder in the first half and left 
the game. Another player got into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say Claremont didn't play a good game," Hormell said. "But we 
played three good quarters, then due to injuries we had to start going down our 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season that would have been impossible -- Chapman barely had reserves. 
But Hormell has brought in several players to go with his solid core of Chad 
Roberts, Miles Takahashi, Jason Gaw and Anthony Hustler. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester, Steve Wellington, another freshman, Juan Felsman, a transfer from 
Golden West College, and Pat Karayan, a transfer from Grossmont, give the 
Panthers more skill and depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (5-3) have a good chance to make postseason play, the eight-team 
Western Water Polo Assn. tournament in November, but Hormell says they are no 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a darkhorse," Hormell said. "We could be a spit in the pan -- 
here today and gone tomorrow -- if we keep having these injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach 100: The Chapman women's volleyball team is also experiencing an 
impressive turnaround. The Panthers, 4-20 last year, are 14-3 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, they defeated UC Santa Cruz at the Menlo tournament and gave 
Coach Mary Cahill her 100th victory in six years at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chapman swept through the tournament and after a five-game victory over 
The Master's Wednesday, Cahill is 105-77. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cahill is mostly celebrating the fact that Chapman is winning again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say I can take losses and put then into perspective because of 
last year," she said. "I can take ugly wins really good too." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, which has won seven consecutive matches, has been bolstered by three 
freshmen who start: middle blockers Addy Benard from Rosary High, Anne Hoffman 
from Scottsdale, Ariz., and Shanea Bishop from Placerville. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Fuller, who played at Fullerton College and El Modena High, and sophomore 
Shawna Parkinson, are providing strong play at outside hitter. Fuller was named 
the most valuable player of the Menlo tournament; Parkinson was named to the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior setter Christi Park rounds out the starting lineup and sophomore Cathy 
Thielen, who has recovered from knee surgery, is usually first off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Curtis Robinson's separated shoulder is largely healed, and he 
will probably start Saturday's game at Redlands, Chapman football Coach Ken 
Visser said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Todd Gragnano, who started the Panthers' second game Saturday, will 
again be the backup. Gragnano completed six of 16 passes for 68 yards with one 
touchdown and one interception in the Panthers' 34-14 victory over 
Claremont-Mudd. But mostly he handed off to running back Darnell Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Gragnano said he was still rusty. He last played in 1991 at 
Nebraska in mop-up roles; he last started in 1989 for Los Alamitos High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played all right but I know I can do better," he said. "I came here to 
play, and I'm not getting as much time as I thought but it doesn't bother me, 
because we are winning and I'm having a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes

 Southern California College men's soccer player Brent Rogers was named the 
Golden State Athletic Conference player of the week. Rogers, a junior 
goalkeeper from Santa Maria shut out San Diego State and Hawaii Pacific, 
helping the Vanguards to a 2-1 record during the week. . . . SCC freshman Caren 
Anderson was named the conference cross-country runner of the week after 
finishing 15th at the Whittier Invitational and fifth at the Aztec Invitational 
this month. At the Aztec Invitational, Anderson, from Mission Viejo High, 
finished 5,000 meters in 20 minutes 39 seconds. . . . Concordia has had to 
change the course for the Eagle 5000 road race Saturday because of a mountain 
lion sighting at Mason Regional Park. The park has been closed, and the course, 
which used to go through the park, now goes around it. The Eagle 5000 includes 
five- and 10-kilometer races and is open to the public. Registration is 6:30 
a.m. The 5K starts at 7:30 and the 10K at 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Flores, the Fairplex meeting's leading rider, has been named to ride 
Flying Sensation in Saturday's $100,000 Pomona Derby at Fairplex Park in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis was originally recruited to ride the son of Flying Paster after 
Solis committed to ride trainer Don Warren's horses Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Harry Hacek, Solis' agent, said the jockey couldn't ride the first 
two days, Warren switched jockeys.  
</P>
<P>
 Flying Sensation hasn't won a race since the California Cup Juvenile almost a 
year ago, but he demonstrated a liking for the small track last year with a 
second-place finish to Individual Style in the Gate For Glory Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Katilac Ofthestars, last in a nine-horse field the first time around the 
track, rallied under Gary Baze to beat The Jody Grind by two lengths in the 
$50,000 Black Swan Stakes on Wednesday. Pascali, with Justin Vitek aboard, was 
third. . . . The Super Derby from Louisiana Downs, which includes trainer Dick 
Mandella's Soul Of The Matter, will be simulcast at Fairplex Park on Saturday. 
. . . Magical Maiden, third in the 1992 Breeders' Cup Distaff, drew the No. 1 
post position in a five-horse field in today's $100,000 Las Madrinas Handicap.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: MILLEN HAS MADE IT BACK -- ALMOST TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be too early to name the comeback driver of the year, but Steve 
Millen, a transplanted New Zealander who lives in Newport Beach and drives a 
Nissan 300ZX in the International Motor Sports Assn. GTS series, should head 
the list of nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen was involved in a freak accident June 27, 1993, at Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
He suffered a double skull fracture, broken jaw, several broken ribs and a 
severely shattered left arm. Doctors said he might never be able to raise his 
arm again, much less drive a race car. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the accident, the nerves in Millen's face were traumatized and 
one side of his face was paralyzed. He could not blink, shut his eyes or smile. 
Three days later, the other side froze and it was six months before his face 
returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a mystery how I got hurt the way I did," Millen said. "I was 
stalled in traffic when I got hit (by a car going 150 m.p.h.) and my car just 
flicked around like the end of a bullwhip. I didn't hit anything, but I got 
thrown around pretty severely. My belts were secure and the cockpit was not 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "My helmet didn't appear to have taken a lick. We sent it to the manufacturer 
and it showed no break from an impact. No one knows how my jaw and my arm got 
broken. They think my skull, which had separate fractures on both sides, was 
damaged from being shaken up inside the helmet. It was very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 After several operations on his arm were unsuccessful, Millen went to Robert 
Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, who 
inserted a metal bar to what was left of his bones and secured it with eight 
screws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good quality titanium, it won't rust," Millen says, "but it does set off 
the alarms in airports. I owe a great deal to Dr. Chandler. I might not be 
racing if it weren't for what he did with my arm." 
</P>
<P>
 When this year's IMSA GTS season began last January at Daytona Beach, Fla., 
Millen was there with Clayton Cunningham's El Segundo-based Nissan team. He had 
already tested the car to prepare it for an assault on the manufacturer's 
championship held by Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen was one of the winning drivers in the 24 Hours of Daytona and has won 
four of eight events going into the season finale Saturday on Phoenix 
International Raceway's 1.5-mile road circuit. Nissan clinched the team 
championship when Millen won last month in Portland, but the driver's 
championship is still at stake with Millen holding a nine-point lead over 
Oldsmobile driver Irv Hoerr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Hoerr wins, I can win the championship if I finish third," Millen 
said, noting that "I've been third or better in every race this year." 
</P>
<P>
 He was on the winning team at Daytona and Sebring, won individually at Road 
Atlanta and Portland, finished second at Watkins Glen, Indianapolis Raceway 
Park and Laguna Seca and third at Lime Rock, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he didn't clinch the driver's title with the manufacturer's crown 
is because his victory at Daytona did not count in the points. Millen started 
in one Nissan and when it broke a crankshaft during the night, he joined Paul 
Gentilozzi, Scott Pruett and Butch Leitzinger for a two-hour stint with the car 
that won. Points can be scored only in the first car driven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," Millen said. "We won by 24 laps. I didn't get any points but I 
did get a silver Rolex." The car averaged 104.80 m.p.h. for 2,516 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamed with Johnny O'Connell and John Morton, Millen also drove one of 
Cunningham's Nissans in the 24 Hours of LeMans, where it finished fifth overall 
and won the IMSA GTS class. Millen had won rookie-of-the-year honors at LeMans 
in 1990.

 Kenny Smith, the El Monte race car driver who won $24 million in the lottery 
last week, is looking to make another $1,000 on Saturday night. Smith, the 
Saugus Speedway Pro-Four Modified champion, will drive his Lumina in a 
$1,000-to-the-winner Pro-Four race at Kern County Raceway in Rosamond. 
</P>
<P>

veteran of eight Indianapolis 500s, will leave Dick Simon to drive as Bobby 
Rahal's teammate next year on the Rahal-Hogan Indy car team. They will drive 
Lolas powered by new Mercedes-Benz/Ilmor engines. . . . Jim McGee, one of 
racing's most successful crew chiefs, will leave the Newman-Haas team at the 
end of this season to rejoin Pat Patrick's new Firestone team. McGee was with 
Patrick for 11 seasons during which the team won the Indy 500 twice and the PPG 
Cup championship in 1989.

DIGEST: PFAU WILL MISS REST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephanie Pfau of Cal State Northridge, who has not played since a Sept. 10 
match against Hofstra, is expected to miss the rest of the volleyball season 
for personal reasons, first-year coach Lian Kang Lu said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfau, a 6-foot freshman from South Torrance High, was a starting middle 
blocker for the first seven matches of the season, but she missed the Matadors' 
match against Idaho on Sept. 14 because she was said to be ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, however, said that "personal problems with her family" have led to Pfau's 
extended absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose her, but it doesn't look like she's going to be back," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfau had 42 kills -- with a .322 hitting percentage -- and 38 total blocks in 
26 games for Northridge. Cross-Country

 After 35 years as a track and cross-country coach, Tuck Mason has decided to 
take a break.  
</P>
<P>
 Mason is on sabbatical from Ventura College this school year but expects to 
return to coaching next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just taking some time off to work on a couple of projects and recharge my 
batteries," Mason said. "I'll be back next year and plan to coach for a long 
time after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason has coached cross-country and track at Ventura for 18 years. He coached 
the same sports at Oxnard High for 14 years after a three-year stint at Palo 
Verde High in Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Fredrickson, a Ventura assistant for the past two seasons and No. 1 
runner on the Pirate team that won the 1983 State small schools cross-country 
title, has replaced Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team has retained its No. 2 
national ranking in the latest poll by The Harrier magazine. Hart (No. 23) has 
moved into the top 25 for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will meet top-ranked Kingwood (Tex.) in the Southwestern 
University Invitational in Georgtown, Tex., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks girls are 18th in the national poll, four spots higher than 
their preseason ranking. The Lancers are the top-ranked team from California. 
Soccer 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Pivnick, a junior at Chaminade High, has been selected to the pool for 
the under-16 national team that will start training in December. Pivnick, a

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: UTAH'S MARSH A GO-GETTER AS A RECEIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to catching footballs, Curtis Marsh has learned not to waste 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah wide receiver, who played only three games in high school before 
excelling at Moorpark College, is catching nearly everything thrown his way. 
</P>
<P>
 In four games, Marsh has caught 19 passes for 287 yards and five touchdowns. 
He ranks third in the Western Athletic Conference in receiving yardage per game 
(71.7) and fifth in receptions per game (4.7). 
</P>
<P>
 Even when opportunities do not seem apparent, Marsh creates them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter of last week's game against Wyoming, a defensive back 
tried to jam the 6-foot-2, 209-pound receiver from Simi Valley. Marsh 
stutter-stepped to the outside, sprinted upfield and hauled in a 43-yard 
touchdown pass from Mike McCoy to open the scoring in a 41-7 rout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got past that cornerback, all I had to do was beat the free safety," 
Marsh said. "It was a matter of whoever had the wheels would win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Marsh. When he enrolled at Moorpark in 1990, he had very little 
football experience, but offensive coordinator Will Thurston was bowled over by 
Marsh's athletic talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We timed him in the 40 and he ran a legit 4.4," Thurston said. "I heard he 
ran a 4.3 weighing 230 (pounds) at the NFL combine last spring. I remember how 
we found out about him. (Coach Jim Bittner) got a phone call about a guy 
slam-dunking in the park. The guy on the phone said Curtis had great hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid was phenomenal his sophomore year with us. But he was still very 
green as far as being a receiver. He didn't like to go over the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh had 48 receptions for 1,030 yards and 11 touchdowns at Moorpark in 1991. 
He accepted a scholarship to Utah and redshirted in 1992. Marsh had big plans 
for 1993, beginning the season No. 2 on the depth chart. But he was sidelined 
for the first four games because of a ruptured Achilles' tendon and he never 
got on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was complete misery," Marsh said. "I dropped eight balls and I only 
caught 10. I was out of rhythm and I was trying to make big things happen and 
make up for what I missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh almost missed football completely in high school. He transferred from 
Royal to Simi Valley, where his eligibility wasn't cleared until only three 
weeks remained in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he makes the most of every reception. In Utah's 34-16 victory at Oregon 
two weeks ago, Marsh caught nine passes for 82 yards. He didn't score and 
picked up only three first downs. On most receptions, he was instantly met by a 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get a catch for 10 yards or if I have to block, that's OK as long as we 
win," he said. "But I'm still the deep threat on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 He showed that against Wyoming. He had two receptions and both went for 
touchdowns: a 43-yarder in the first quarter and 42-yarder in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second scoring play, Marsh was covered well on a fly pattern, but McCoy 
threw to him anyway. Marsh cut inside the safety at the last second, caught the 
pass on his chest at the nine-yard line and high-stepped into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having fun now just having the opportunity to show what Curtis Marsh can 
do," he said. "I can make big plays, acrobatic-type plays." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Fresno State sophomore wide receiver Brian Roberson 
(Sylmar) has 16 receptions and averages 19.9 yards a catch. He had three 
receptions in the Bulldogs' 31-16 victory over Hawaii last week. His 29-yard 
touchdown reception on the team's second drive of the second half gave Fresno 
State a 24-9 lead. . . . Senior free safety Lance Thomas (Crespi/Moorpark 
College) leads the Bulldogs with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman quarterback Leon Blunt (San Fernando) took three snaps in relief of 
Ron Powlus and injured an ankle in Notre Dame's 39-21 victory over Purdue. . . 
. Colorado senior tight end Christian Fauria (Crespi) didn't make the big catch 
to beat Michigan but his seven receptions for 43 yards moved him to seventh on 
the Buffaloes' all-time list. He needs 17 receptions to become the school's 
reception leader at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 USC junior fullback Terry Barnum (Alemany) had only one yard in one carry in 
his first start at fullback, but he caught six passes for 77 yards. His 52-yard 
reception from Rob Johnson in the first quarter put the Trojans in position to 
score the touchdown that put them in front for good.

THE COLLEGES / STEVE ELLING: AS FOR STAGGERING ATHLETIC PROGRAMS, VAUGHN KNOWS 
THE FEELING

 Joseph Vaughn was playing at Cal State Fullerton when the Titan football 
program was blue-penciled after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a senior defensive back at Cal State Northridge who could be a peer 
counselor on funding issues, knows storm clouds when he sees them and would 
like to share the feeling of dread with his fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they pass a measure on the Oct. 18-19 ballot that would increase 
student fees from $4 to $49 a semester to aid the athletic department, 
Northridge might lose its football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like it's following me," Vaughn said. "It's too much. We've got 
school, our families, we have our own problems other than football. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a load to carry. To not know your future as far as next year is tough 
and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Money matters like this always deteriorate into commas, decimals and dollar 
signs. This time, the athletic department would like to include an exclamation 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's time for a 49er. 
</P>
<P>
 Semester registration fees for state residents enrolled full-time this fall is 
$958, which means an increase of $49 amounts to a 5% hike. It's a simple 
decision, really. If students want a legitimate athletic program, they must 
fork over the money themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 An election-day defeat means the school's Division I status might disappear 
without a trace, like Sargent Shriver and Admiral Stockdale. Both were 
second-banana hopefuls. The Matadors will be second bananas with an election 
slip-up, no doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the additional funding, Northridge would be forced to eliminate a 
handful of programs and revert to Division II status, officials maintain. The 
athletic program has competed at the Division I level, successfully in most 
instances, for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Football is on the shakiest ground. Tentatively, it has been the first program 
targeted for extinction if the ballot measure is given a thumbs-down. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unrealistic to expect the Matadors to compete with other Southland 
Division I teams at their funding level of $3.6 million. To their credit, many 
Northridge teams do well on such a restrictive budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.25 million generated annually by the referendum would allow Matador 
teams -- except football -- to to allocate the NCAA maximum in scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would put us closer to a level playing field with the schools we're 
expected to compete with," Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Level field, eh? Beats the gopher holes, dead spots, poor lighting and dismal 
accommodations at many Northridge athletics venues. That would be rectified 
with a yea vote, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from outside sources -- benefactors, corporate donors, alumni and the 
like -- would be used to upgrade the school's third-rate facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, money solicited from private donors was used to underwrite 
day-to-day budgetary expenses. Several area high schools have superior 
stadiums, another reason why the stands at Matador events are often emptier 
than the departmental coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to cash, the athletic department is a veritable Fort Knocks. 
Blows come from every quarter these days, including Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The University Corporation, which oversees much of the school's discretionary 
finances, is strapped because of earthquake-related construction costs. The 
$430,000 that athletics received from the Corporation in 1992-93 will plummet 
to zero by next year. The department could lose as much as $700,000 from the 
1995-96 budget, according to projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics receive $4 per semester from each student, a fee that was instituted 
in 1985 and has remained unchanged since. The recession and quake have trimmed 
student enrollment to 24,000, down from 31,000 in the late 1980s, which also 
has trimmed the departmental bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unforeseen, unpredictable shot to the ribs: Last week, the Matador 
Reporter, a campus newspaper, broke a story detailing the department's new 
sponsorship contract with Pepsi-Cola. According to terms of the deal, Pepsi 
will provide $500,000 over the next 10 years. A plum for a shoestring program. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, a student reporter leaned too heavily on the office calculator. 
The headline in the newspaper the following day said the department would 
receive $5 million from Pepsi. . . . On the same page came news that athletics 
was seeking an additional $49 each semester through the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so at least one Northridge student has trouble with multiplication, but 
the entire student body can spell O-V-E-R-K-I-L-L . Not a positive 
public-relations moment for those backing the new measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and Joan College want to know what the payoff is for them, of course. To 
begin with, entry to athletic events will be free. If the proposition fails, 
students will fork over admission charges like everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Care to see the likes of USC, UCLA, Stanford and Pepperdine? Place a check 
mark in the "affirmative" box. Otherwise, expect a steady diet of box scores 
from Cal State snoozers Dominguez Hills, Stanislaus, San Bernardino and 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the meager sacrifice: 
</P>
<P>
 For the average frat guy, $49 in beer money lasts a month of Saturday nights, 
tops. Here's what $49 buys today at the Northridge Fashion Center: 
</P>
<P>
 A bag of cement. 
</P>
<P>
 A ball peen hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 A bucket of bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much else, because there is no Northridge mall. It was closed by the 
earthquake, though reconstruction has been under way for months.  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge athletic department needs to retool, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-nine bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 May student vision be 20-20.

FAVATA TO COACH AT WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Favata, a former Cal State Fullerton baseball player, was hired Wednesday 
as Woodbridge's baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Favata, who played in the Milwaukee Brewers' organization, replaces Vince 
Brown, who left after two seasons with the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Favata was the head coach at Edgewood (now West Covina) High School four 
years, from 1985-88, where he won three league championships and finished with 
a 76-29 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed coaching after my four years at Edgewood," Favata said. "I was 
looking for the right opportunity to get back into a team situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Favata, who played second base, worked recently as director of the "Better 
Baseball 4 Kids" Clinic and was an instructor at local hitting and base-running 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown led the Warriors to a Sea View League title in 1993 and a fourth-place 
finish in 1994.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; TOP PICK FREDRICKSON DEVELOPS QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the Raiders' biggest defensive play of last week, cornerback Lionel 
Washington plucked the football out of the air and ran 31 yards to a touchdown. 
Hear the crowd cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody saw the end of that fourth-quarter play against the San Diego 
Chargers, but not many highlight clips zeroed in on linebacker Rob Fredrickson, 
the man who created the opportunity for the interception by batting the ball 
loose from Shannon Mitchell, the intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 That figures. Although he was the Raiders' top draft choice this season, 
Fredrickson has developed quietly, away from the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders are so impressed with the rookie out of Michigan State that 
they are trying to find new ways to get him on the field. An outside linebacker 
in college, Fredrickson was moved into the middle when he turned pro. Now, the 
Raiders are using him at both spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the three best guys out there," linebacker coach Jim Haslett said. 
"Hopefully, he'll be one of them." STEVE SPRINGER

 Cornerback Deion Sanders twisted his left ankle during a San Francisco 49er 
workout, going down in a heap during a pass coverage drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was carried off the field.Coach George Seifert said it probably would 
take a day to determine the severity of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue emphatically approved Sanders' 
$1.1-million contract, saying despite protests from other teams, the 49ers met 
every salary-cap obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue gave his endorsement during a meeting in Irving, Tex., in which the 
NFL completed plans for stocking the expansion Carolina Panthers and 
Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be allowed to pick from a pool of six players from each of the 28 
teams and get one extra draft pick per round in the next two years, giving them 
a total of 14 to seven for each of the existing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting, owners approved the proposed move of the Washington 
Redskins to Laurel, Md., but Tagliabue said the resolution does not bar 
Baltimore from getting a team. Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke has said one team 
is all that the two cities can support.

and was being held without bond.

GIRLS' TENNIS PREVIEW; ALLEGRE COULD LEAD CAMARILLO TO ITS CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Frances Giffin said one need not be a queen to know how precious it is 
to wear a crown and sit on one's own throne. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Camarillo High girls' tennis team hopes to inherit both this season. And 
the Scorpions have a dominant player to lead them: Monique Allegre. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre, a senior who plays No. 1 singles, is ranked No. 10 among 18-and-under 
players by the Southern California Tennis Assn. Most serious juniors players do 
not play high school tennis because of the inferior competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised she's playing this year," Giffin said. "But I purposely set up 
some good (nonleague) competition to keep Monique interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre came back, in part, because the 1993 season provided her with a 
breakthrough victory. She pulled off a surprising 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory over 
third-seeded Laura Ruben of Mater Dei in the quarterfinals of the individual 
Southern Section tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just boosted my confidence," she said. "It showed me I could play with 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo posted a 13-1 record last year but tied with Westlake for the league 
title. The Scorpions (16-3 overall) eased some of that disappointment by giving 
eventual runner-up Newport Harbor a push before falling, 13-5, in the 
quarterfinals of the sectional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Allegre and No. 2 singles player Darian Chappell back, the Scorpions 
are more than Marmonte favorites. Ranked No. 4 in Division I by the Southern 
Section, they appear to be the best team in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Camarillo, which has twice shared the Marmonte League title with Westlake, 
won't be satisfied with anything less than sole possession of the league 
championship. The Scorpions have never won a league title outright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know we have the talent to do it this year," Giffin said. "That's all 
we care about at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas might have challenged Camarillo as the top team in the area had it 
not lost Kirsten Gross, a top 16-and-under player. Gross, a junior, reached her 
age-group final in the Ojai Valley tournament in April and was seeded sixth in 
the SCTA sectional, but she's skipping the high school season because of a 
heavy academic load. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get ready for college and I have a lot of (advance placement) 
classes," she said. "But I miss the team. The other day during the morning 
announcement, they named off the players who had won in our first match. I 
thought I was going to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas is ranked No. 6 in Division II, one spot higher than 
Harvard-Westlake, the two-time defending Division III champion. Romy Mehlman, 
the Wolverines' No. 1 singles player, said the team will be better than last 
year's squad that beat higher-level competition before breezing to a 13-5 
victory in the title match against Glendora St. Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo -- The Scorpions, ranked fourth in Division I, are off to a good 
start, 5-1 overall and 2-0 in league. They lost, 10-8, to third-ranked Santa 
Barbara, losing the final set in a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell, a sophomore, returns at No. 2 singles. After sitting out last 
season, senior Laura Crawford is playing at No. 3. The No. 1 team of Jennifer 
Messmer and Melissa Feld lead a strong corps of doubles players. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas -- The Coyotes' hopes for the Division III title last year ended 
when Gross suffered a season-ending ankle injury. Now they must play an entire 
season without her. But returning singles players Shera Wiegler and Deborah 
Pepkowitz, and El Camino Real transfer Amanda Cey, should pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiegler, Pepkowitz and Cey -- daughter of former Dodger Ron Cey -- lost only 
one game in nine sets against Burbank last week. Calabasas is 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake -- Mehlman returns after a junior season in which she won 57 
of 63 sets. Senior Natalie Rice, sophomore Jackie Gortman and freshman Lindsy 
Fordess are rotating at Nos. 2 and 3 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Devine and Melanie Schoenberg are defending Mission League champions at 
No. 1 doubles. Harvard-Westlake, 22-3 last year, is 2-0-1. The tie was against 
Corona del Mar, ranked seventh in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines are seventh in Division II. Coach Richard Kinuya said his team 
might have been good enough last year to win the Division II title rather than 
Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls were on auto pilot," he said. "This year they have something to 
prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa -- The Spartans might not have enough to win the Channel League, 
which has two of the top five teams in Division I -- Santa Barbara and San 
Marcos. But Rio Mesa is a force to contend with because of exchange student 
Zuzana Stunova. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunova, a sophomore from the Czech Republic, beat Allegre, 6-4, on Monday and 
is 11-0. Seniors Jessica Improta, an honors student who likely will play in the 
Ivy League next year, and Danielle Ouwendijk will play Nos. 2 and 3 singles. As 
a doubles team last year, Improta and Ouwendijk reached the semifinals of the 
section tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake -- While the coaches at Camarillo and Rio Mesa are praising nearby 
Cabrillo Racquet Club for providing top players, Warrior Coach Connie Flanderka 
says her talent pool is drying up. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Flanderka expects Westlake to be better than its No. 9 ranking in 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be better than that by the end of the season, even though we're really 
a Division II school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Helena Horak is 8-1 at No. 1 singles. Opponents call her "the 
backboard" because of consistent returns. Sophomore Erin Smith jumps from No. 1 
doubles to No. 2 singles, and senior Joanna Mazur, the lone remaining member of 
the 1991 section champion team, plays at No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank: The Bulldogs (16-2 last year) have gone undefeated in the Foothill 
League two seasons in a row and entered 1994 with a No. 6 ranking in Division 
III. Four all-league players graduated last spring and another, Esther Park, is 
skipping her senior season. Junior Sofia Managadze, who would have challenged 
for a section championship, moved back to her native Georgia -- a former Soviet 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Analisa Swan and Lolita Alcocer must pick up the slack in singles. In doubles, 
Kendall Nohre and Piunik Shabani are the only returners. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft -- The Toreadors, the two-time defending City 4-A champions, lost Brahna 
Pastorini, 1992 City Section champion who lost only one match in her high 
school career. Back is Julia Feldman, the team's No. 1 singles player, and Taft 
should again be the best team among Valley City Section schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Ravid Levi moves from No. 3 singles to join Alicia Whelen at No. 1 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Players to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Allegre -- The senior has made several tough transitions to improve 
her game. Giffin said Allegre lost a few sets last year because she switched 
from a two-handed to a one-handed backhand stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre is being recruited by Arizona, Arizona State, Kansas, Nevada Las Vegas 
and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuzana Stunova -- She came to California on vacation this summer and decided 
to stay. She can barely speak English, but her racquet speaks volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a cannon," Rio Mesa Coach Steve Worthington said. "I'm just amazed 
how she can generate power. The ball just turns into a bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 The only piece of information Worthington has on her tennis background is that 
her mother was once Martina Navratilova's hitting partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Romy Mehlman -- Like Allegre, Mehlman made big strides over the summer. She 
beat Tu Dong of Long Beach, ranked No. 7 among Southern California 18-and-under 
players at the time. She lost to former Harvard-Westlake schoolmate and 
eventual champion Ania Bleszynski in the third round of the sectional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Feldman -- Will this be Feldman's year to win the City individual 
championship? She certainly has paid her dues, losing to Pastorini in the 1992 
championship match and losing to eventual champion Kendra Segura of Dorsey in 
the 1993 semifinals.

ROUNDUP; ANOTHER 10-GOAL DAY FOR BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake High senior David Block matched a school record he set last week, 
scoring 10 goals in a water polo game, to lead the Warriors to a 20-11 
nonleague victory Wednesday over Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, who played for the United States 17-and-under All-Star team this summer 
in Greece, scored 10 goals against Oxnard on Friday in the Buena tournament. He 
has 41 goals in seven games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer has really paid off for him," Coach Mike Power said. "He knows 
what he wants. He wants to play in the (2000) Olympic Games in Sydney and he 
knows what he has to do to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Block scored three of the first four goals for Westlake (5-2). BOYS' 
CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff, 17; Moorpark, 51; Santa Paula, 58; Calabasas, 104; Santa Clara, 133 
-- Will Bernaldo, Omar Vega and Mason Moore placed 1-2-3 to pace Nordhoff to 
victory in the first of this season's three Frontier League meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Each meet will count toward one-third of the overall league title with the 
league finals counting as a tiebreaker if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernaldo timed 16:28 over the three-mile course at Steckel Park with Vega and 
Moore clocking 16:29. The Rangers' other scoring runners were Victor Ochoa 
(fifth in 16:48) and Javier Ramirez (sixth in 16:49). 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, third in last year's State Division III championships, was conserving 
his energy for Saturday's Stanford Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff, defending State Division III champion, is undefeated. GIRLS' 
CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff, 19; Moorpark, 39; Calabasas, 74; Santa Paula and Santa Clara, no 
score -- Elaine Canchola, Terrah Chapin and Gina Tallakson took first, second 
and third as Nordhoff placed five runners among the first seven finishers in 
the first Frontier League meet of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola timed 19:56 over the three-mile course at Steckel Park, followed by 
Chapin (20:40) and Tallakson (20:58). GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep d. Oakwood, 15-13, 15-4, 15-7 -- Karyn Dousette had 15 kills 
and nine aces and Vanessa Richlin had 38 assists to lead the Mounties (1-2) in 
a nonleague match at Oakwood. MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran 8, Caltech 0 -- Thomas Johnsen scored three goals and Jan 
Hammervold and Grady Brahy each scored two as the Kingsmen rolled over Caltech 
in an SCIAC match at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen scored once in the first half to give the Kingsmen (2-7, 2-0) a 2-0 
halftime lead. He added a pair of goals early in the second half, each on 
assists from Brian Collins. WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 CS Northridge d. CS Bakersfield, 15-13, 12-15, 15-12, 10-15, 15-13 -- Missy 
Clements had 27 kills and Aimee Stone added 25 kills to lead the Matadors (8-6) 
past the top-ranked Division II team in the country at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive five-game match for Northridge, which lost to 
the University of San Diego on Friday night.

 NFL owners Wednesday approved the proposed move of the Washington Redskins to 
Laurel, Md., but Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the resolution does not bar 
Baltimore from getting a team. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL bylaws require approval of three-fourths of the team owners before a 
franchise can move out of its city even if it's in the same area, Tagliabue 
said at a news conference after the meeting in Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some discussion about what that means to Baltimore and I made it 
clear it had no bearing on Baltimore" Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins have announced plans to move to Laurel, which is about 15 miles 
from both Baltimore and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jack Kent Cooke has said one team is all that the two cities can 
support, but Baltimore still is trying to attract a team to Camden Yards.

 Cornerback Deion Sanders twisted his left ankle during a San Francisco 49er 
workout, going down in a heap during a pass coverage drill.

<P>
 Sanders was carried off the field. Coach George Seifert said it probably would 
take a day to determine the severity of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tagliabue emphatically approved Sanders' $1.1-million contract, 
saying despite protests from other teams, the 49ers met every salary-cap 
obligation.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCK FUND PURCHASES SURGE, WANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A late-summer rally in the stock market helped attract a surge of money into 
stock mutual funds in August. But many fund companies say the inflows dropped 
off in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute, the funds' trade group, said Wednesday that 
net new cash flow into stock funds rose to $14.1 billion in August from $9.2 
billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But this month, renewed market turmoil has apparently scared many investors 
off. Fidelity Investments said September cash flow into stock funds is about 
half August's level. Vanguard Group said stock fund purchases are down about a 
third; Oppenheimer Management reported a 20% decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Net new cash flow measures fund purchases less redemptions and reinvested 
dividends and after adjusting for exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fund firms report little change in their bond business. Investors have 
been net sellers of bond funds since interest rates jumped last winter. The ICI 
said a net $2.8 billion flowed out of bond funds in August, compared to a 
$2.9-billion outflow in July.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; IDEAS FOR THE BUSY TRAVELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The following are among the ideas outlined in Christopher J. McGinnis' book 
202 Tips Even the Best Business Travelers May Not Know. McGinnis is an 
Atlanta-based travel consultant and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the plane: Once on a plane, don't place your bag in an overhead bin behind 
you. When the plane unloads, you'll have to go "upstream" to retrieve it. Put 
it in a bin ahead of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative hotel room: If you are desperate for a hotel room and stuck in a 
strange city with no reservation, ask the desk clerk or manager about the 
possibility of placing a roll-away bed in a meeting room for the night. If 
available, use the hotel health club shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling card crooks: Watch out for "shoulder surfers," people who have learned 
to steal your long-distance calling card number by spying on you at airports or 
train and bus stations, and then sell the number on the street. Shoulder 
surfers are more prevalent in cities with large immigrant populations -- 
perfect markets for stolen calling card numbers. Insert your calling card in 
phones that allow it, or shield the phone with your body when entering your 
number. Speak quietly if you must dictate your number to an operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention: Condoms purchased overseas aren't as reliable as those in the 
United States. Heat, light and time will eventually render latex condoms 
useless. Always have a fresh supply on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Carry-ons: If you bring more than two carry-ons, the official limit, and the 
gate agent is being strict, you can always ask a less burdened and 
friendly-looking person near you in line to carry on one bag -- or put a bag 
inside a bag. Gate agents usually scrutinize the number of bags more often than 
the bag dimensions. FAA regulations: one no larger than 9 inches by 14 inches 
by 22 inches (must fit under seat) and another 10 inches by 14 inches by 36 
inches (must fit in overhead bin) or a 4-by-23-by-45-inch garment bag (must fit 
in closet.) Note: A briefcase is considered a piece of carry-on luggage but a 
woman's purse may not be. 
</P>
<P>
 On-time data: The on-time performance for individual flights is tracked 
monthly on all reservations systems. When making your reservation, ask the 
agent and you will be given a score on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 meaning the 
flight was on time between 1% and 10% of the time and 9 meaning the flight was 
on time 90% to 100% of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Morning arrival: Before leaving on an international flight that arrives in the 
morning, determine if your hotel will let you check in early. There is nothing 
worse than the jet-lagged, sleep-starved purgatory of sitting in a crowded 
hotel lobby waiting for maids to clean your room. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickpocket scams: Beware of people causing distractions. Scams used by 
pickpockets: an offer to brush lint off your suit; accidentally spilling or 
spewing ketchup or mustard; a little old lady dropping her suitcase so you will 
help her. Before you know it, you've been had. Also, crafty pickpockets will 
stand next to signs that say "Beware of Pickpockets" so they can watch where 
people feel for theirs wallets. Then they know exactly where to "pick."

SHUTTLE LAUNCH; AIRLINES: UNITED, COMPETING FOR SHORT-HAUL PASSENGERS, PREPARES 
TO UNVEIL ITS LOW-FARE, FREQUENT-FLIGHT SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Their faces flush and sweaty under a hot Central Valley sun, the United 
Airlines ground crew at Sacramento Airport raced against the clock to unload 
Flight 2258 from Los Angeles. In a test of United's new shuttle service, the 
workers emptied the Boeing 737 jet of passengers and baggage, performed 
maintenance and safety inspections and then reloaded the 128-passenger plane 
for a return trip to Los Angeles in about 20 minutes. Normally, the same 
process takes twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working harder and faster," said ground crew worker Art Dalby, 53. 
"The faster we load (and the less time wasted on the ground), the more profit 
United will make on each plane. So we are doing our part." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the fast-paced world of Shuttle by United, the giant airline's 
high-stakes gamble to win back the passengers and profit lost to efficient, 
low-fare rivals -- Southwest Airlines, namely -- on flights of two hours or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite numerous failures by United and others to fight off Southwest, Shuttle 
by United will begin flying Saturday with 184 daily flights to nine West Coast 
destinations after a few months of development and test flights. By year's end, 
the Shuttle will serve 12 cities with 286 daily departures. Among major 
Southland airports, Shuttle will serve Los Angeles, Burbank and Ontario, but 
not Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be very good at this short-haul niche," said United co-pilot 
Joseph R. Noval. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest will respond to the challenge by boosting flights in November. 
Between Oakland and Los Angeles, Southwest's second-busiest route systemwide, 
the Dallas-based airline will add six flights for a daily total of 25. United 
will begin with 18 flights and grow to 20 by December. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is going to be our primary method of response," said Edward 
Shelswell-White, Southwest's Los Angeles marketing manager. "We will outdo them 
on frequency." 
</P>
<P>
 Created by a team of United managers and workers, Shuttle includes many of the 
same features that have boosted the fortunes of Southwest: low fares, low 
costs, frequent flights and few frills. For example, the in-flight "meal" will 
consist of a beverage and a small bag of peanuts or pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 However, United said it will set itself apart from Southwest, in part by 
offering a first-class section and assigning seats on the day of departure. 
(Advance seat assignments are not available.) In contrast, Southwest lacks any 
assigned seating, which results in a quick but often harried boarding that some 
passengers dislike. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle was born out of a nearly $5-billion deal in July that gave United's 
employees a 55% stake in the Chicago-based airline. In return for majority 
ownership, workers -- except for flight attendants, who did not participate in 
the buyout -- agreed to wage cuts as well as more flexible work rules needed to 
begin an efficient, low-cost shuttle operation, then code-named U-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle cockpit crews, for instance, must fly more daily flights than their 
counterparts in United's traditional "mainline" operation. That cuts down on 
time-consuming crew changes and allows a Shuttle jet to fly 12 1/2 hours a day, 
compared to nine hours for a mainline plane. Shuttle's overall operating costs 
will be about 20% less than the mainline, United officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides testing a new service, Shuttle is also an experiment for a variety of 
New Age management theories, ranging from worker empowerment to team building 
to total quality management. For example, workers have more freedom to make 
decisions related to their jobs without first asking for permission from 
management. Executives plan to transplant these theories to the rest of the 
airline in hopes of invigorating a bureaucratic corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shuttle by United serves a little bit like a lab to encourage that process," 
Shuttle President Sky Magary said. "It's quite a different way of working." 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between Shuttle and mainline service are driven by the need to 
cut time and costs. Every minute counts, as illustrated during a recent test of 
Flight 2258 from Los Angeles International Airport to Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce boarding time, passengers with window seats were 
boarded first, followed by customers in the middle and aisle seats. The unusual 
system, along with strict enforcement of carry-on baggage rules, saves about 10 
minutes at the gate, United workers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the cabin, flight attendants helped passengers load bags into overhead 
cabins to speed up boarding. As the 737 jet taxied toward the runway, flight 
attendants took beverage orders and later delivered them on trays instead of 
lumbering metal carts.  
</P>
<P>
 Flight attendant Len Gibson, a 27-year United veteran, said Shuttle's 
simplified in-flight service reminded her of a less stressful and complex era 
when she worked on DC-6s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot more time to be personal with" passengers, Gibson said. "We are 
not overwhelmed. A little beverage service is nothing. We could do it 
blindfolded." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground in Sacramento, Capt. Corey J. Ferguson walked around his jet as 
part of the safety and maintenance inspection. Inside the cockpit, co-pilot 
Noval handled paperwork and programmed the in-flight computer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we could get out into the terminal and take a stretch," said Ferguson 
of the 45-minute layover that has now been halved. The routine is "more focused 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 But the differences that make Shuttle a low-cost, low-fare carrier may also 
alienate and confuse customers accustomed to United's full-service mainline. In 
1981, United scrapped a similar low-fare, low-frills operation in part because 
of customer confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Magary said the distinct personality and public image of Shuttle should 
prepare mainline passengers for any differences. Many Shuttle employees, for 
example, will be uniformed in casual polo shirts and shorts. Mainline employees 
will remain dressed in dark blue suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to get customers used to a little different system," Magary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Flight 2258, passengers did not seem to mind the differences -- given 
that one-way fares ranged from $49 to $69. Neil Zachary, a 50-year-old state 
employee traveling on business, said he wants Shuttle to consider service to 
Burbank and Ontario from Sacramento. Zachary usually flies Southwest on those 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they go to these other destinations, I'll switch," he said. United's

<P>
 United Airlines will go head-to-head with Southwest Airlines beginning 
Saturday by launching its short-haul, low-fare Shuttle by United.

SHOW'S OVER FOR GRUSHOW AS PROGRAM CHIEF AT FOX; TELEVISION: HE'S OUSTED BY 
MURDOCH. FAILURE OF NFL FOOTBALL DEAL TO LIFT SUNDAY NIGHT VIEWERSHIP MAY BE A 
FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox Broadcasting's failure to turn its billion-dollar investment in NFL 
football into a Sunday night ratings bonanza has tackled its first victim as 
the network's youthful programming chief, Sandy Grushow, was ousted by Fox Inc. 
Chairman Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow abruptly left the network Wednesday in what has become one of 
Hollywood's fastest-revolving executive-suite doors. He was running Fox at a 
time when Murdoch is trying to elevate it from an upstart fourth network 
targeting "Clearasil kids" to become a broad-based entertainment giant that 
will overtake ABC, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 John Matoian, a Fox film executive and former CBS Entertainment executive, 
will succeed Grushow in the chief programming post. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow's departure, which had been rumored, underscores Murdoch's 
idiosyncratic management style that has led to the resignations of several Fox 
executives since he became more involved with the studio's affairs several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Grushow's exit comes at a time when Fox's ratings appear to be on 
an uptick. Fox's ratings so far this season have climbed 4% from the same 
period a year ago, pushed up by such hits as "X-Files" and the network's 
Tuesday night movie. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fox has had problems. Several aging series such as "Married With 
Children" and "The Simpsons" have lost steam. More important, a key decision to 
flip days and time periods for some key shows -- moving "Martin" and "Living 
Single" to Thursday while sliding "The Simpsons" back to Sunday -- appears to 
have misfired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest disappointment was Fox's failure to build upon its new Sunday 
National Football League broadcasts. Though the telecasts themselves have been 
highly rated, the billion-dollar NFL gambit was also expected to fuel Fox's 
Sunday night viewing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Fortune Hunter," the Fox show that comes on directly following the 
NFL telecast, embarrassingly turned out to be the lowest-rated show of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several industry executives blamed Grushow's departure more on 
different operating strategies between him and Murdoch than on any gross 
programming miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murdoch pulls the trigger faster than Wild Bill Hickok," said one veteran 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since 1992, Murdoch's growing presence on the Century City lot has led 
directly to the departures of former Fox Chairman Barry Diller, former studio 
chief Joe Roth and two former heads of the Fox network, Jamie Kellner and Lucie 
Salhany. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A spokesman for Fox 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow, 34, joined Fox 11 years ago directly out of UCLA, as an intern in the 
feature films division. Diller later brought Grushow over to help launch the 
network's marketing department, and he was eventually named programming head by 
Kellner. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow, who earns about $500,000 annually, still has two years remaining on a 
four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Fox insiders feel that Grushow was never really given the chance to show 
his mettle at Fox and instead got sidetracked by the company's Darwinian 
corporate politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Kellner put Grushow in the programming hot seat, for example, 
Salhany was named to succeed Kellner, and she became heavily involved in 
program decision making.  
</P>
<P>
 Grushow "was not given the opportunity to run the network from a creative 
standpoint," one executive said.  
</P>
<P>
 Grushow was said to favor adhering to the strengths that made Fox famous: 
developing shows for the 18-to-35-year-old demographic slice of the audience, 
exemplified by such shows as "Beverly Hills 90210," "Melrose Place" and "Models 
Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 But Murdoch has wanted to widen the network's demographics to a bigger 
audience to better compete with ABC, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL football contract was the first big step in Fox's attempt to rope in a 
broader audience beyond its staple teen-and-young-adult viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian, a former senior executive at CBS Entertainment, oversaw that 
network's prodigious output of TV movies and miniseries.

PROFILE; NEW MAN AT MCDONNELL DOUGLAS; TRANSITION: HARRY STONECIPHER TURNED 
SUNDSTRAND AROUND. ANALYSTS EXPECT HIM TO SHAKE THINGS UP IN HIS NEW JOB TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For clues about how Harry C. Stonecipher is going to run McDonnell Douglas 
Corp., the best place to start is the seven years he spent in Rockford, Ill., 
running a large but bland aerospace company known as Sundstrand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher arrived as Sundstrand's president in 1987, just as the maker of 
aircraft and industrial parts was in trouble with the Pentagon for price fraud. 
It had other problems as well: excessive debt, dwindling profit, overreliance 
on the slumping defense and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
 After being named chief executive in 1988, Stonecipher slashed Sundstrand's 
employment by a third to lower its costs. He sold off weak divisions, 
reorganized those he kept and bought new firms to build up Sundstrand's 
non-aerospace industrial operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Stonecipher pared Sundstrand's debt, bolstered its profit 
margins and nearly doubled the company's stock price from four years earlier. 
He took care of the parts scandal by having the firm plead guilty and pay $200 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is persuading analysts that McDonnell Douglas is also in for 
major changes under Stonecipher, 58, who was named president and chief 
executive earlier this week. McDonnell Douglas is the nation's largest defense 
contractor, with $14.5 billion in annual sales and 67,000 employees, including 
20,000 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is going to shake the place up," predicted C. Donald Scales, aerospace 
manager for EDS Management Consulting Services in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what McDonnell Douglas can use, Scales said, because the St. 
Louis-based firm faces several nagging strategic challenges -- such as its C-17 
military transport plane and its troubled commercial jetliner group -- that 
need a fresh review. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chairman John F. McDonnell, who at age 56 surprised many by relinquishing 
the chief executive's job to Stonecipher, said McDonnell Douglas' turbulent 
ride in recent years has left many of his workers demoralized and tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a leader who will get everybody back up on the step, excited about 
the future," McDonnell said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his Sundstrand stint, Stonecipher fits the bill. He is known as a 
determined, blunt, strong-minded and energetic executive who works long hours 
and has a deft touch for promoting his goods to potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 His image stands in bright contrast to the bearded, bookish-looking McDonnell, 
an intelligent but reserved Princeton-educated engineer who said he wanted 
Stonecipher to run McDonnell Douglas so he could think about its long-term 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrand spokesman Brad Considine recalled how, back in 1988 when Sundstrand 
was in trouble, he would routinely arrive at work at 6:30 a.m. and see 
Stonecipher's white Lincoln already parked in front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was keeping long hours myself, and I remember leaving (at night) and 
feeling I'd put in a long day," Considine said. "But on the way out, I'd see 
that white Lincoln still in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 A stocky six-footer who wears steel-rimmed glasses and earned a physics degree 
from Tennessee Technological University, Stonecipher is described as a 
personable man who likes his subordinates to call him Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also known as a community activist who, in his seven years at 
Sundstrand, persuaded its employees to more than double their annual donations 
to United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't lack for competitive juices," said Chuck Chadwell, vice president 
for production at General Electric Co.'s aircraft engines group, where 
Stonecipher spent 26 years and rose to senior management before joining 
Sundstrand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also has a good sense of humor," Chadwell said, "but he's tough-minded as 
hell when he needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher will need to be tough-minded at McDonnell Douglas, a company with 
sales 10 times those of Sundstrand's. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas has completed a strong financial comeback since 1992, but 
only after John McDonnell led the firm through a wrenching cost-cutting and 
restructuring program that slashed employment by more than half in the last 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts mirrored those made by other defense firms as they grappled with 
smaller defense budgets. But now that much of the cutting appears over, 
McDonnell Douglas still faces nettlesome questions about what its business will 
look like during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of its big programs, such as the F/A-18 jet fighter, have relatively 
secure futures. Others do not. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas' C-17 program in Long Beach could end with just 40 planes. 
Its missile business, having lost a $1-billion Navy contract to Hughes Aircraft 
Co. earlier this month, "no longer has critical mass" and might have to be 
sold, Morgan Stanley & Co. defense analyst Phil Friedman said in a recent 
report. The commercial jetliner group, also in Long Beach, desperately needs 
new orders. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas overall has also been largely absent from the defense 
industry's recent merger wave. "They've been so focused on survival . . . that 
their ability to do deals has been extraordinarily limited," Scales said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stonecipher's record at Sundstrand shows he's generally averse to nursing 
along sick divisions for lengthy periods, preferring instead to shed them and 
buy other, more promising businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strategy partly honed by his years at GE, the diversified manufacturing 
giant whose chairman, Jack Welch, is renowned for his philosophy of relentless 
cost cutting and of selling divisions that aren't leaders in their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher "would tell you straight out that Jack Welch was an influence on 
him," Considine said. "But I'd also say he is very much his own person."

SOUTHWEST TRIGGERS FARE WAR IN INTERSTATE FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines announced a 50% fare cut Wednesday, firing a cannon at 
United Airlines just days before United is to start its competitive, low-cost 
Shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 By starting a major fare war, Dallas-based Southwest is making clear its 
intent to defend its turf from upstarts seeking to chip away at its dominance 
of the short-haul, low-fare market. 
</P>
<P>
 Already dealing with a series of selected fare cuts this fall, other carriers, 
including Shuttle by United, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, said 
they would match the new Southwest fares on competitive routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous fare cuts this fall have been mere skirmishes compared to Southwest's 
latest move, said Thom Nulty, president of Associated Travel Management in 
Santa Ana. "Now we are talking about a serious fare war. All this other stuff 
has been fun and games." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest said it is cutting at least by half its regular fares, with only a 
one-day advance purchase required. The new fares will cut the price of one-way 
travel from Los Angeles to such cities as New Orleans and Houston to $99. 
Tickets may be purchased until Oct. 13 for travel through Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Southwest discounts do not include travel within California -- where 
one-way fares will remain at $69 -- an airline executive affiliated with 
neither United nor Southwest said he thinks Southwest is trying to gain high 
ground against United. Most of Shuttle by United's flights will be on 
intrastate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all aimed at United," said the executive, who declined to be named. 
"They are out reaffirming their position as the low-cost leader, making United 
scramble." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Southwest isn't cutting fares in the United shuttle's core California 
market, the discounting move appears to be timed to score a publicity coup that 
will generate favorable word-of-mouth among fliers and undercut the splash of 
United's start-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's announcement came three days before Saturday's launch of United's 
low-fare Shuttle by United, which is intended to mimic many of the best 
features and best routes of Southwest, the leader in high-frequency, 
short-distance air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Shuttle will offer flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco for 
$69 one way, and the service will include assigned seating on the day of 
departure (which Southwest does not) and credit on United's frequent-flier 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Chairman Herb Kelleher has indicated his displeasure at other 
airlines butting into his carrier's market niche, and he has threatened to 
retaliate with discount fares on longer hauls. A Southwest spokeswoman denied 
that United was the primary target. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's aimed at the customer," said Ginger Hardage, a spokeswoman for 
Southwest. "We don't want there to be any confusion about who is the low-cost 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
 A United Airlines spokesman said the Elk Grove, Ill.-based company "will be 
fully competitive with" Southwest on routes where Shuttle will fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the other markets, we need to gain additional input," spokesman Joe 
Hopkins said. He declined to comment on whether he believed Southwest's move 
was aimed at denting the launch of Shuttle by United.  
</P>
<P>
 Other airlines appeared stunned at the Southwest announcement. "We are 
studying it to determine the impact," said Mike Mitchell, spokesman for America 
West Airlines in Phoenix. "It's pretty cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said that although Southwest is a short-haul carrier, the discounts 
are deep enough that some customers may be willing to put up with the 
inconvenience of the extra stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, there are a lot of passengers who are not going to want to make 
the stops along the way," he said, "but if the fare is cheap enough, perhaps 
they will."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: FIRST AMENDMENT TO ANSWER CALL OF TELECOM 
OVERSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, it seems S.1822 turned out to be a wrong number after all. But now that 
pernicious parochialism has finally disconnected congressional efforts to 
upgrade America's ancient telecommunications laws, what rules will govern 
tomorrow's information highways? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the essential document still be the Communications Act of -- can you 
believe it? -- 1934? The perennial Judge Harold Greene and the antitrust 
consent decree that dismembered Ma Bell? The tenderly technocratic 
"rule-makings" of the Federal Communications Commission? The precociously 
anachronistic Cable Reform Act of 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above: The "regulation" that will have by far the biggest impact 
on tomorrow's new-media services and the movie studios, cable operators and 
telephone companies that provide them will be the First Amendment of the 
Constitution of the United States. Consider it "freedom of the press" with a 
multimedia twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the existing telecommunications bills had not collapsed, there would have 
been serious First Amendment problems with many of their provisions," asserts 
Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe. "The new telecommunications landscape 
can't be planned or planted without the very fundamental considerations of the 
First Amendment taken into account." 
</P>
<P>
 Tribe, one of America's most brilliant constitutional scholars, has taken the 
same First Amendment rights that citizens comfortably associate with publishers 
of the printed page and cleverly mapped them onto the proprietors of telephone 
networks. Representing Bell Atlantic in its efforts to wriggle out of a 
regulatory straitjacket forbidding it from offering video programming over its 
own phone lines, Tribe successfully argued that the First Amendment offers the 
same free speech opportunities and protections to regulated telecommunications 
giants as small-town newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Baby Bell was a telephone company, moving other people's voices and 
data over its lines, it was a heavily regulated "common carrier" obliged to 
give equal access to all at government-approved rates. But with this ruling, 
don't think of a Baby Bell as a telephone company anymore: Think of it as a 
newspaper publisher -- or a movie studio -- that happens to have wires running 
into every local home and business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I originally conceptualized the complaint on behalf of Bell 
Atlantic was that First Amendment considerations hadn't been playing an 
adequate role in the discussion," says Tribe. "The First Amendment definitely 
lowers barriers of entry to video programming for Bell Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparable rulings have recently given Bell South and US West similar 
freedoms. These rulings are, of course, expected to be appealed all the way up 
to the Supreme Court. Should they be affirmed, the First Amendment -- not 
antitrust laws or FCC rulings -- will be the preeminent industrial policy of 
the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, cynics might argue that Tribe's Bell Atlantic argument recalls press 
critic A.J. Leibling's caustic gibe that "freedom of the press extends only to 
those who own one," but this precedent is extraordinary in its implications. 
Presumably, a power utility that wants to send information down its networks 
would enjoy the same First Amendment rights as a Baby Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Baby Bell has a First Amendment right to simultaneously distribute video, 
voice and text over its network, doesn't that, in effect, make obsolete 
cross-ownership-of-media provisions that forbid a single company from owning TV 
stations, newspapers and radio stations in the same town? What about the local 
cable company that wants to publish a newspaper? First Amendment challenges to 
media cross-ownership rules have been rejected by the Supreme Court in the 
past, but the court's rationale -- based in part on the inherent scarcity of TV 
and radio broadcasting frequencies -- is quickly becoming obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 People ordinarily think of the First Amendment and the media in the context of 
such issues as the right of an individual to get a fair trial as opposed to the 
public's right to follow news about that trial, but that perception is now 
laughably limited. In the absence of coherently crafted telecommunications 
legislation, the First Amendment will continue to assume policy primacy over 
outmoded antitrust and cross-ownership rules and increasingly artificial 
distinctions between content and conduits. Consequently, in the eyes of today's 
courts, the First Amendment is enjoying a robust renaissance as an instrument 
of deregulation and economic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the First Amendment could and will and should be used for the removal 
of restrictions that separate industries from each other," agrees Eli Noam, who 
served on New York's Public Utility Commission and now directs Columbia 
University's Institute of Tele-Information. "The tradition of 
telecommunications regulation was 'content-neutral,' but the technological 
metamorphosis of the phone service to a mass medium has raised issues that give 
First Amendment issues priority over traditional utility law." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the consent decree blocks the Baby Bells from offering 
long-distance telephone service. Does that mean Bell Atlantic can't sell its 
video programming beyond its region? That's like saying you shouldn't be able 
to buy the Los Angeles Times in New York. The point is simple: The preeminence 
of the First Amendment will ride roughshod over these irksome legal 
technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are a host of troublesome questions a First Amendment-driven 
telecommunications policy leaves inadequately addressed: What of 
non-discriminatory access to the networks? What does universal service mean in 
this context? But it's clearly time for policy-makers to worry less about 
trying to draw distinctions between cable operators and phone companies, 
content and conduits and worry more about what fairness and equity mean in a 
new-media world where the First Amendment comes first.

 Samsung Details Plans for Tijuana Plant: The Korean consumer electronics and 
appliances manufacturer released further details of the massive $500-million 
manufacturing complex that it plans to build on 65 acres in Tijuana that it 
acquired in April.In addition to television sets, the complex will manufacture 
videocassette recorders, microwave ovens, washing machines and cameras, 
according to the company. The complex will also include a research and 
development facility as well as a distribution center by the time it opens in 
1996. Employment may someday total 4,000. Samsung, whose annual worldwide sales 
exceed $60 billion, is building the plant partly so its products qualify under 
local content rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 Ropak Corp. Reveals Merger Offer: The Fullerton plastics maker said a British 
competitor has offered to buy the company in a deal valued at $41 million and 
that the founding Roper family, which controls a 25.4% stake, favors the 
proposal. The family -- led by Ropak executives and brothers William, Robert E. 
and C. Richard Roper -- agreed to give Linpac Mouldings Inc. in Birmingham, 
England, the right to vote its shares on the merger proposal at a 
soon-to-be-scheduled shareholders meeting.Privately held Linpac, which already 
owns 8.5% of Ropak, is offering $10.50 a share in cash. The price of Ropak 
stock climbed $1 a share on news of the bid to close at $10 a share on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market.

 NME Mum on Merger Talks: National Medical Enterprises Chairman Jeffrey C. 
Barbakow, speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting, had little to

Healthtrust Inc. and American Medical Holdings Inc. "We continue to have talks 
on a number of fronts," Barbakow said. He declined to comment specifically on 
reports last week that Santa Monica-based NME was trying to acquire the two 
other companies in a multibillion-dollar transaction that would create the 
nation's second-largest hospital firm. There had been speculation that Barbakow 
would announce a deal with the companies at the annual meeting.

 Japan Moves Against Sexism in Workplace: The Labor Ministry has directed 
hundreds of companies to abandon discriminatory practices against women.After 
two years of investigating financial institutions and broadcast stations, the 
ministry discovered "inequality" between men and women in the workplace. Of 655 
companies investigated, 264 financial institutions and 51 broadcast stations 
were found to violate Japan's equal employment law. The law requires employers 
to treat women equally in recruitment, wages and promotion and forbids 
discrimination in training, retirement and dismissal. But the law is toothless: 
It lacks any penalties to make employers comply.

GM JUGGLES PRODUCTION AMID STRIKE; AUTOS: BUICK CITY WALKOUT FORCES SHUTDOWN OF 
TWO OTHER PLANTS. TALKS ARE TO RESUME TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. slowed the spreading effects of a strike at a key 
parts-making complex Wednesday by changing the mix of cars and trucks it 
builds. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, parts shortages caused by the walkout of 11,500 workers at the 
Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., had forced two other GM plants to shut 
down. A third assembly plant was scheduled to close Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buick City complex assembles Buick Park Avenue and LeSabre models and 
Oldsmobile Eighty-Eights. But it also makes V-6 engines and transmission and 
suspension parts that go into other GM cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the strike drags on for more than a week or so, shortages of those 
components could shut down most of GM's North American operations and force the 
layoff of hundreds of thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,550 workers at two assembly plants in Lansing, 50 miles southwest of 
Flint, were laid off late Tuesday, hours after the strike began. They ran out 
of parts for Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Achieva and Pontiac Grand Am models. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other plants kept their assembly lines moving by changing the mix of cars 
and trucks to models that do not use parts from the Flint complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can continue running for some time by going to different transmission 
options or engine options," GM spokesman John Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for the company and United Auto Workers Local 599 in Flint met for 
about nine hours Wednesday and were scheduled to resume talks this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The UAW is complaining that employees are being forced to work longer and 
faster to keep up with demand for cars and trucks and that this is making them 
sick and threatening their safety. The union also complained about the use of 
non-union outside employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, trying to improve productivity and the bottom line, has 
eliminated 52,000 hourly jobs since 1991. It is reluctant to hire new workers 
because they essentially are hired for life under the UAW contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If the strike shuts down most of GM's North American operations, the auto 
maker could lose $45 million a day in profits, said industry analyst David 
Healy of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the intent to buy so high right now, if there isn't any guarantee of 
(new GM cars and trucks) coming soon -- the window is about two weeks -- 
customers will go shopping for something else," said Art Spinella of CNW 
Marketing-Research in Bandon, Ore., an auto industry consulting firm.

INVESTMENT IN CHINA UP 55%, CONTINUES CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign direct investment in China continues to climb, reaching $20.52 billion 
in the first eight months of the year, up 55% on the same period a year ago, 
the official China Daily reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said the rise had come despite a dip in the number of new projects. 
Tighter government curbs on real estate speculation have deterred property 
investment, particularly from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, more money flowed from Japan, Europe and the United States into 
China's machinery, electronics and chemical sectors, matching the government's 
industry development plans, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average investment per project in the first eight months of the year was 
$1.7 million compared with $1.3 million for the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest investment figures from the trade ministry show the inflow of 
foreign cash from abroad has maintained the pace of the first half of the year, 
despite increasing signs that the economy may be overheating again. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent economic statistics indicate the economy is gathering steam, with 
industrial output, inflation and retail sales on the rise after showing signs 
of easing in the first and second quarters of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said China is on course to reach $30 billion in foreign investment 
this year, up from the $26 billion recorded in 1993. Last year, only the United 
States, with $32 billion, attracted more investment from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was not entirely praiseworthy of foreign investors, however, noting 
that China had revoked the business licenses of some 7,000 joint ventures for 
poor performance or wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that some investors had come to China will the sole purpose of taking 
advantage of tax breaks and had abandoned the country when their breaks 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate report in the China Daily last weekend said that as much as 51% of 
all joint ventures in China will lose money this year. It blamed the losses on 
the initial costs of setting up operations in China, but also said many 
companies make "artificial" losses to avoid paying tax.

 Sega to Invest $90 Million in Atari: The Japanese video game giant bolstered 
its struggling rival in return for access to key video game 
technologies.Tokyo-based Sega Enterprises Ltd., the world's second-largest 
video game company, bought 4.7 million newly issued shares in an investment 
worth $40 million, giving it 7.4% ownership of Atari Corp. Sega will pay 
another $50 million in cash as prepaid royalties for access to Atari's 70-plus 
game patents. An analyst said Sega will benefit from Sunnyvale, Calif.-based 
Atari's 64-bit game format -- Sega currently has only a 32-bit game -- and that 
the shared technology will intensify industry competition.

 Bloomingdale's Eyes Beverly Hills: Bloomingdale's is "leaning toward" building 
its West Coast flagship store on Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, but it hasn't 
ruled out a site in or near the Century City Market Place mall in Los Angeles, 
the retailer's chairman, Michael Gould, said in an interview.It plans to open 
the store in March, 1997. At stake are up to 1,000 jobs and $1 million-plus in 
sales tax revenue, not to mention the cachet of having what the ritzy New York 
retailer says will be its grandest store outside Manhattan. It will be the 
first of three Bloomingdale's planned for Los Angeles and Orange counties.

STOCK EXCHANGE DISCIPLINES BROKERAGE MANAGER; SECURITIES: FORMER CHIEF OF 
ORANGE COUNTY PRUDENTIAL OFFICE ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO DETECT FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW and DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange took disciplinary action Wednesday against a 
former Prudential Securities branch manager in Orange County, banning him from 
acting as a supervisor for six months for failing to stop one of his brokers 
from allegedly defrauding customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zaccaro, 44, had been in charge of Prudential's Laguna Hills and 
Newport Beach offices from 1985 to 1992. He currently is the Laguna Hills 
branch manager for the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaccaro agreed to the penalty, which also included a censure, without 
admitting to or denying the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE charged that Zaccaro failed to supervise a broker, whom the exchange 
did not name. However, sources confirmed that the broker was Grant Ross, a 
one-time broker in Prudential's Newport Beach office who was fired in 1990. 
Ross could not be reached for comment. He has not worked in the securities 
business since leaving Prudential, according to Los Angeles officials of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the NYSE, the broker advertised heavily for customers in The 
Times and other publications during the late 1980s, running ads that promoted 
high-yielding "foreign currency bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 A stock exchange disciplinary panel charged that the bonds were unsuitably 
risky for many of the unsophisticated investors who bought them and that the 
broker misrepresented the risks. The NYSE also charged that he heavily traded 
these and other bonds in the customers' accounts without permission and duped 
customers into borrowing so much money against the bonds that the interest on 
the loans exceeded the income from the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 As branch manager, the exchange said, Zaccaro was required to review every 
trade made by his brokers and "knew or should have known" of improper trading 
in the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Wednesday, Zacarro said, "I don't think any of this 
is fair," notwithstanding his agreement to settle the charges. "When the 
misdeeds were found out, the broker was fired for cause." 
</P>
<P>
 A Prudential Securities spokesman had no immediate comment on the charges. 
Most of the customers in the case had been reimbursed "at least to some extent" 
as a result of arbitration cases they brought, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated action, the NYSE on Wednesday imposed a $50,000 fine on the 
securities firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. for failing to file timely reports 
about brokers who were fired or had customer complaints filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's disciplinary report said the penalty was at least the fourth since 
1985 against Dean Witter for delays in reporting information about alleged 
wrongdoing by its brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange charged that from September, 1989, through last April, Dean 
Witter repeatedly failed to make prompt reports about arbitration cases, 
customer complaints and brokers who were fired because of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dean Witter spokesman said the firm had no comment on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to mounting concern about dishonest stockbrokers, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission in recent months has been pressing the NYSE and other 
exchanges to crack down on firms that fail to promptly report alleged misdeeds 
by their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC has said such failures prevent the exchanges from rapidly launching 
disciplinary investigations and keep investors from getting accurate 
information about brokers' disciplinary records.

FOR FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS, SHUTTLE HAS ITS ADVANTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many pilots and flight attendants, the idea of traveling to exciting 
places around the globe was one of the attractions of flying for United 
Airlines. So why have some of these folks decided to fly six times a day 
between Los Angeles and Sacramento for United's new shuttle service? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm home most every night . . . and I could go to my kids' games after 
school," said flight attendant Kathleen Rudrud, a 25-year veteran of United who 
volunteered to work for Shuttle by United, which begins operations Saturday. 
"At this point in my career, I like the idea of staying on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudrud's comments were echoed by many of the flight crew members who have 
chosen to work the relatively short West Coast Shuttle flights instead of more 
glamorous jaunts to Tokyo or New York. About 965 of United's approximately 
85,000 employees will work for the Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 For United employees who leave the airline's "mainline" operation to work for 
Shuttle, there are sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ward, who is giving up his job as a United mainline co-pilot to fly for 
Shuttle, said he will miss the variety of destinations and the opportunity for 
interesting sightseeing on his layovers. Some of his favorite trips have been 
to such places as Mexico City, Guatemala City and Fairbanks, Alaska, where, 
during one layover, he tried dog sledding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who said he earns more than $50,000 a year, said he also took a 7% cut 
in his hourly pay when he joined Shuttle. However, he also said the more 
tightly scheduled Shuttle flights will enable him to get about 80 to 83 hours 
aloft a month, enough extra time to offset his hourly pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The flexibility and esprit de corps of the Shuttle operation -- and the chance 
to be part of something new and innovative -- make the change worthwhile, said 
Ward, 38, a former military pilot who joined United immediately after leaving 
the Air Force 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to be right in the center of the changes," he said, adding, 
"It's refreshing that a lot of ideas they used to kick this off were developed 
by employees." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some pilots find the numerous stops common to shuttle flying more interesting 
than long transcontinental or foreign flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love takeoffs and landings," said co-pilot Rich Lepman, 40, who is one of 
the workers involved in designing Shuttle by United's operation. "Flying four 
hours on autopilot (on a cross-country flight) is fairly monotonous." 
</P>
<P>
 But some like the idea of flying cross-country in five hours and then calling 
it a day. On a shuttle, employees might fly as many as six flights a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My back can't take all that up and down, up and down," said one United flight 
attendant.

ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS ROCKET 6% IN AUGUST; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS HAD EXPECTED A 
REBOUND, BUT THE SIZE OF THE INCREASE WAS A BIG SURPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Durable goods orders zoomed in August as demand for 1995 model cars and trucks 
helped propel orders for big-ticket items to their biggest advance in nearly 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for 
long-lasting goods, everything from tanks to washing machines, soared 6% in 
August and more than wiped out a 4% decline in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Durable goods orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $154 billion in August, up 
from $145.2 billion in July, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts marveled at the continued strength of the economy's 
manufacturing sector, financial markets appeared to welcome the news. Some 
analysts said the glow on Wall Street was due more to the Federal Reserve 
Board's decision Tuesday not to boost interest rates for the sixth time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the gain in demand for durable goods came from sharp increases in 
volatile orders for cars and aircraft. Still, the advance was broad-based and 
covered all major categories -- electronic and other electrical equipment, 
primary metals and industrial machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if remarkable is the word, but we're having one hell of a year," 
said Michael Evans, head of an economic forecasting firm in Boca Raton, Fla. 
"If we were looking for any sign of a slowdown, we didn't see it in this 
report. We'll have to wait for 1995 for a slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Co. insisted that there are no 
signs of overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industrial sector is healthy, but not accelerating as the August durables 
report might suggest," he said. Excluding cars and aircraft, he said, the pace 
of demand is sustainable without an inflationary burst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they are sticking to predictions that the Fed will wait until 
after the November elections to boost interest rates again -- unless a sharp 
drop in unemployment is announced Oct. 7 or fresh signs of inflation crop up. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had expected durable goods orders to rebound, but the size of the 
increase was startling. The August advance was the largest since orders 
skyrocketed 9.1% in December, 1992. Durable Goods

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; HILTON UPS THE ANTE IN 
FREQUENT-STAY WAR

<P>
 In a bid to win market share from competing chains, Hilton Hotels Corp. last 
week upped the ante for hotel frequent-stay programs by announcing that its 
guests can exchange their room points for miles on participating airlines, or 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton's move is the latest in a series this year by hotel chains 
reconfiguring their frequent-stay plans. While most other chains have 
restricted their programs, awarding fewer points for room stays, Hilton has 
bucked the trend by continuing to allow "double dipping," awarding both miles 
and points for room stays.  
</P>
<P>
 Hotel frequent-stay programs, which are modeled after airline frequent-flier 
programs, are aimed at business travelers to develop brand loyalty. Because the 
programs are expensive to maintain, however, some business-class hotel chains 
have been quietly scaling them back in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this, Hilton has positioned (itself) to continue to be quite 
aggressive," said Randy Petersen, who monitors and ranks frequent-flier and 
frequent-guest programs for his Colorado-based publication "Inside Flyer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hilton's double-dipping strategy generated a 30% increase in members 
during 1993 and an additional 15% growth in new members this year, said Jeff 
Diskin, Hilton vice president of marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 Other hotel chains, in contrast, have stopped allowing double dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyatt Hotels, for example, eliminated double dipping earlier this year in 
favor of short-term mileage promotions, said Hyatt spokeswoman Carrie Reckert 
in Chicago. Guests now earn Hyatt Gold Passport mileage points they can redeem 
for either hotel stays or plane tickets, but not both. Short-term promotions 
can still help frequent guests rack up points quickly, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did some research to find out what our customers wanted, and this was one 
of the options," she said. "The promotions are short-term, but they're very 
generous."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent "Nights after Nights" promotion attracted about 150,000 new 
members between April 15 and Aug. 31, Reckert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based ITT Sheraton also eliminated double dipping earlier this year. 
The company is betting that its international net of participating properties 
will be enough to keep its frequent guests from defecting to other programs. 
Guests can redeem their Sheraton Club International award points at more than 
400 properties in 50 countries, said Lisa Dickason, spokeswoman for Sheraton in 
Boston. "It's the most global of all the programs." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sheraton gives its most frequent guests -- those who earn VIP 
Gold Club status -- a 50% bonus on points earned.  
</P>
<P>
 Marriott Hotels of Washington, which has the oldest and largest of all the 
guest award programs, has also introduced a separate mileage program in the 
last year. But guests must choose whether they want to earn mileage points or 
room points. They can't earn both. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it has been around since 1983, the Marriott Honored Guest Award 
Program has a large, loyal following, said Marriott spokeswoman Catharine 
Boire. "We've never had to double-dip." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ability to not just earn both types of awards, but to interchange the 
two that sets the Hilton program apart, Petersen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Using this program "is like going back to the early days (of reward programs) 
when it was possible to earn a totally free vacation," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In most hotel reward programs, guests can choose to earn either points toward 
room stays or miles for airline tickets, not both. And once they've chosen, 
they can't change their minds later and convert the room points into mileage 
points or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That limits the value of the points. In a program such as Hilton's, where the 
two types of points are interchangeable, business travelers can use their 
awards to their advantage. If they are close to earning a free airline ticket, 
for example, they can use some room points to reach the award level. Or if they 
are nearing the point level for free room stays, they can convert some mileage 
points over. 
</P>
<P>
 The flexibility is valuable because travelers are less likely to need an 
additional trip to reach an award level. 
</P>
<P>
 To convert miles to points, members of the Hilton HHonors program contact the 
partner airline, just as they would to redeem any type of award. Airlines 
participating in the program so far include Alaska, America West (in 1995), 
Delta and United. Guests must convert a minimum of 5,000 miles, which translate 
into 10,000 hotel points. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, to convert their hotel points to miles, HHonors members call 
Hilton, which contacts the airline. To use this option, members must convert a 
minimum of 10,000 points, which translate into 1,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity in the exchange rates reflects the differing costs of airline 
miles compared to hotel stays, said Hilton spokesman Marty Gordon. It is also 
designed to discourage people from shifting miles on one airline to miles on 
another by converting them to Hilton points first. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one scenario in which shifting miles to airline points and back to 
miles can be a benefit, Petersen said. For example, if you have frequent-flier 
miles that are about to expire, you can convert them to room points, then 
convert them back to frequent-flier miles when you need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you pay a price for the swap because you don't get back the same 
number of miles you gave up to get room points, it is better than letting your 
miles expire, Petersen said.

 Cuba Says Tourism Is Bouncing Back: Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos said 
the island's August refugee crisis caused some decline in tourists from 
countries such as Italy and France, but he said the fast-growing tourism sector 
-- the Communist-ruled island's No. 2 source of hard currency after sugar -- is 
now recovering. He said tourist numbers and revenue will be higher this year 
than last. Cienfuegos forecast 700,000 visitors and earnings of about $900 
million.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; DEMAND FOR CARS RIDES A BOOM IN INDIA'S GROWING 
ECONOMY; ASIA: MANUFACTURERS CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CONSUMERS' APPETITES. FOREIGN 
FIRMS ARE SCRAMBLING TO GET IN ON THE ACTION.

 If you want to buy a car in India, you'll have to wait as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers can't turn out cars fast enough to keep up with a huge demand 
fueled by lower taxes, an expansion of credit and, more significantly, a 
growing Indian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 India's economy grew 3.8% last year and is expected to grow as much as 5.5% 
this year. The boom has boosted income and given people the confidence to make 
big purchases, such as autos, trucks and motor scooters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Income levels have increased in the last year," said Sangeeta Mehta, an 
analyst with brokerage SSKI Group in Bombay. "Just look around. People are 
willing to spend more." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to industrialized nations -- and even some other developing Asian 
countries -- the number of private cars in India is minuscule. Only one person 
in 279 has a car here, compared to one in 22 in Thailand and one in 10 in 
Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the excitement here is the potential for growth in a country of 900 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 117,000 cars were sold in India over the last five months -- since 
April 1, the beginning of the fiscal year for most Indian companies -- but the 
figure represents a 17% increase over the same period last year. Deepak Verma, 
an analyst at Industrial Credit Investment Corp. of India, said he expects 
sales to rise 25% to 240,000 for the full fiscal year, up 25% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That market growth has boosted the share price of Indian auto makers and also 
has more foreign firms looking at the Indian market, which until recently was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of next year, everyone from General Motors to Mercedes-Benz to 
Peugeot will be banging together cars on Indian assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Suzuki Motors has teamed up with the Indian government-owned Maruti 
Udyog Ltd. auto firm in a joint venture that has an astonishing three-quarters 
of the auto market. Its sales have leaped 22% over the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of other foreign firms should be good for Indian auto makers because 
most of the foreigners are teaming up with Indian companies instead of going it 
alone. The Opel division of General Motors, for example, has joined Hindustan 
Motors. Hindustan makes the large, gas-guzzling Ambassador, designed like a 
chubby, bubble-shaped 1950s British car. It has only about 8% of the market and 
is one of the few Indian car companies whose sales are declining -- 7% over the 
last five months. 
</P>
<P>
 But hope springs eternal: "With GM as a partner," said Pankaj Talwar, senior 
analyst with the brokerage W.I. Carr, "Hindustan Motors can do good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Indians began putting their money into new wheels after the government lowered 
excise taxes on cars from 55% to 40% last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the boom: Car financing has become not just more available 
but more acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 Indians, traditionally averse to credit, are now turning to financing. And if 
you don't want to commit to buying a car, companies such as GE Capital and 
Citibank will lease you one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wanted to buy a car before, you had to put down all the cash 
up-front," said Ashwini Suri, managing director of Ganga Automobiles Ltd., a 
car and scooter dealership. "Now, with financing, lots of people can afford a 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 The first five months of the fiscal year saw higher sales for every type of 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in India's most popular forms of transportation -- motorcycles and 
scooters -- jumped 23% to 821,600 in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Truck sales are also up as older models are being traded in, analysts say. 
From April through August, heavy- and light-truck sales were up 35% to 62,500.

 IMF Sees World Economic Growth: The International Monetary Fund said it 
expects the global economy to grow 3% this year and 3.5% in 1995 as the 
industrialized world comes out of its deepest recession in half a century. 
World trade is expected to expand strongly, growing by more than 7% this year 
and by 6% in 1995, well above the 5% average of the past two decades, the IMF's 
annual World Economic Outlook report says. The U.S. economy is expected to grow 
3.7% in 1994, slowing to a more sustainable 2.5% pace in 1995, while Japan's 
economic recovery will produce a sluggish 0.9% growth, the IMF said.

 Consortium Eyes Former Clark Air Base: The international group led by Mitsui & 
Co. of Japan has submitted a $2.5-billion proposal to convert the former U.S. 
military base in the northern Philippines into the country's premier 
international airport by 1998.The base, which was destroyed by the 1991 
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, would undergo a massive rehabilitation aimed at 
eclipsing the dilapidated Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila as the 
principal destination for foreign flights. Mitsui, which bankrolled the master 
plan for the project by Pacific Consultants International of Japan, would be 
joined in the consortium by the British Airports Authority, U.S.-based 
Schal-Bovis and Construcciones y Auxiliar Ferrocarriles of Spain.

ROPAK STOCK CLIMBS ON NEWS OF MERGER PLAN; AGREEMENT: THE FULLERTON PLASTICS 
MAKER SAYS A BRITISH RIVAL HAS OFFERED TO BUY THE COMPANY FOR $41 MILLION IN 
CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plastics manufacturer Ropak Corp. said that a British competitor has offered 
to buy the company for $41 million in cash and that the founding Roper family, 
which controls a 25.4% stake, favors the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The family -- led by Ropak executives and brothers William H., Robert E. and 
C. Richard Roper -- agreed to give Linpac Mouldings Ltd. in Birmingham, 
England, the right to vote its shares on the merger proposal at a 
soon-to-be-scheduled shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held Linpac, which already owns 8.5% of Ropak, is offering $10.50 a 
share in cash for the remaining stock. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the merger proposal caps 10 days of heavy trading in Ropak stock. Last 
Friday, CNBC television commentator Dan Dorfman speculated that Linpac was in a 
bidding war for Ropak with Stone Container Corp. in Chicago. But Ronald 
Cameron, Ropak's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that his company "had 
no contact" with Stone Container. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of Ropak's stock climbed $1 a share Wednesday on the company's 
announcement to close at $10 a share -- its highest price in the past 12 months 
-- on the Nasdaq market system. The number of shares trading hands was nearly 
eight times the average daily trades over the previous three months. 
</P>
<P>
 If shareholders approve the deal, Ropak would continue to operate as a Linpac 
subsidiary, Cameron said. Linpac is expected to keep all of Ropak's 900 
employees at six U.S. plants and four Canadian facilities, including 30 
corporate workers at Ropak's headquarters in Fullerton and 100 at its La Mirada 
plant, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Roper brothers founded the company in 1978 to make plastic storage 
products. Since then it has expanded to make pails and shipping containers, 
spray-on plastic coatings and plastic farming equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Linpac, a family-owned company with 50 manufacturing plants worldwide and 1 
billion -- $1.6 billion -- in revenue last year, makes plastic, paper and metal 
packaging products. Linpac's strategy in acquiring Ropak is to bolster its bulk 
food packaging business, one of Ropak's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the Roper family and Linpac comes with offsetting 
options in the event shareholders turn down the deal: Linpac can still acquire 
the Roper family's stock at $10.50 a share and the family could force Linpac to 
buy its stake at a price to be fixed later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak's stock price has been rising since last week, but Cameron said neither 
company officials nor Linpac were buying the stock. Earlier this month, though, 
two Wall Street newsletters had recommended buying the stock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investment banking firm Cruttenden & Co. in Irvine bought 100,000 
shares of Ropak last week after an analyst visited the company. But Cruttenden 
analyst Peter Castellanos said the purchase was not related to a possible 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were buying in the normal course of business," he said Wednesday. Merger

 Foreclosures of homes and commercial properties in Orange County during the 
first eight months of 1994 increased 17.7% from the same period last year, 
according to a data company. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Orange County compares favorably with the rest of the state, where 
foreclosures were up more than 19% this year from 1993, according to statistics 
compiled by TRW Redi Property Data in Riverside.Statewide, lenders foreclosed 
on more than 42,000 residential and commercial properties from January to 
August. The combined mortgage value of those properties was $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the number of distressed properties is rising in many parts of the 
state, the rate of increase has slowed drastically, TRW Redi found. From 1992 
to 1993, for example, foreclosures jumped by more than 70% statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first eight months of this year in Los Angeles, foreclosures were 
up 21.7% from the same period last year, TRW said.

 Koll Builds in China: Koll China Real Estate Co. is developing a $175-million 
office and convention center in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is one of the first for Koll China, a division of Koll Co. that 
was formed late last year to lead the Newport Beach developer's operations in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 The futuristic-looking Beijing High Tech Center project will include 500,000 
square feet of office space, 400 apartments and 75,000 square feet of retail 
area. It will also have a 140,000-square-foot convention center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the living room for the high-tech industry in China," said Kenneth 
Munkacy, president of Koll China. "Right now there is just no space in that 
area. There is no good showroom space or office space." 
</P>
<P>
 Under construction in the northwest portion of the Haidian district of 
Beijing, the office tower will be the centerpiece of the district, Munkacy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll China said it has several other deals in the works in China.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: JUDGE TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO NAME RECEIVER FOR TMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Floyd H. Schenk is to decide today whether 
a receiver should be appointed to take over troubled Teachers Management & 
Investment Corp., the Newport Beach firm that raised about $1 billion from 
60,000 California educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Four teachers sued TMI on Aug. 23, alleging that the 26-year-old company, 
which offered investments in real estate partnerships, lost $100 million of 
clients' money through fraud and racketeering.The suit alleges that the company 
is insolvent and seeks appointment of a receiver to manage any remaining 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI's owners, Maurice Shuman and John Martin, deny any wrongdoing and say the 
company lost money because of California's real estate downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 The receivership hearing will be at 1:30 p.m. in Orange County Superior Court.

 Comarco said the Navy is likely to extend its contract in two-month intervals
